08 April 2021||New Delhi,||No shortage of vaccines, Oppn. politicising the issue: Vardhan||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, in a no-holds- barred attack on Maharashtra on Wednesday, accused it of demanding universal vaccination for all adults to cover up its “poor vaccination efforts”. Maharashtra, which has and continues to see the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India, was putting its citizens in danger by allowing them to escape institutional quarantine for the sake of “personal vasuli (extortion)”, Dr. Vardhan said. “Overall, as the State has lurched from one crisis to another. It seems as if the State leadership is happily sleeping at the wheel.” In recent days, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have complained of erratic vaccine supplies. The Centre has consistently maintained that there are no shortages, that the vaccine strategy has been put in place after consultation with the States, and because “supply is limited”, the priority has been to vaccinate healthcare and frontline workers and groups at risk. Though several non-NDA ruled States were upbraided, much of Dr. Vardhan’s ire was directed at Maharashtra. “In particular, I have seen statements made by public representatives in Maharashtra about shortage of vaccines. This is nothing but an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government’s repeated failures to control the spread of the pandemic. The inability of Maharashtra government to act responsibly is beyond comprehension. To spread panic among the people is to compound the folly further. Vaccine supplies are being monitored on a real-time basis, and State governments are being apprised regularly about it. Allegations of vaccine shortage are utterly baseless,” his letter noted. He marked out the three States — all led by non-NDA governments — to argue that they were coming up short compared with several other States in vaccinating healthcare and frontline workers, and those above 45 years, and trying to “politicise” the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-shortage-of-vaccines-oppn-politicising-the-issue-vardhan/article34268337.ece
08 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||State to intensify COVID-19 containment||Now that the Assembly polls are over, the State will intensify COVID-19 containment measures from Thursday and focus on vaccinating as many people as fast as possible. On Wednesday, a meeting of the core committee headed by Chief Secretary V.P. Joy said that the State needed to be more vigilant about containment, now that new cases were on the rise and a more intense second wave of COVID-19 was sweeping across other States. Protocol enforcement The State police have been asked to enforce protocols strictly in public spaces and to ensure that none violated the mask rule. Crowding has to be avoided at all shops and public places. The sectoral magistrates would be aided by the police in enforcing the protocols. Surge expected Cases were expected to surge in Kerala too after the Assembly polls and with the SSLC examinations beginning on Thursday, students and parents needed to be more mindful about the protocols. The meeting decided to intensify the current vaccination drive for 45 plus age group in the State in the next three days, with the active involvement of local self-government bodies. It also issued an advisory that polling officials, polling agents as well as all party workers who actively took part in the election activities to be more careful in the coming weeks and to get themselves tested immediately if at all they develop any fever or other COVID-related symptoms. The seven-day quarantine for people coming from other States would be strictly enforced. Students appearing for the SSLC examinations should ensure that they wear the mask at all times, on their way to the examination venue and inside the hall. They should take care not to stand together in groups with other school mates. Parents have been asked not to accompany the students. Advisory to students Students should not share their stationary supplies with other students. Any student with any symptoms such as fever or respiratory illness should inform the authorities at the examination centre ahead of the examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-to-intensify-covid-19-containment/article34268662.ece
08 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Brace for travel hassles as bus strike continues||While the bus strike was almost complete across the State on Wednesday, the road transport corporation (RTC) employees have announced that the stir will continue indefinitely till the State government agrees to their demand. They have sought implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission. The State government is threatening to invoke provisions of the Karnataka Essential Services Maintenance Act, 2013, and withhold the March salary of striking employees. Strike unfair: CM Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa opened a window for negotiations on Wednesday and said talks could be held if they suspend the strike. Mr. Yediyurappa, busy campaigning for bypolls all day in Belagavi, said, “The State government has fulfilled eight of the nine demands and have also announced an 8% salary hike. In these tough times, it is wrong to go on an indefinite strike. I hope they do not force a situation where tough measures will be necessitated.” While welcoming the invitation for talks, Kodihalli Chandrashekar, honorary president of the KSRTC Employees League, said they believed talks were the only way ahead and they would participate, but said the strike would continue till the Sixth Pay Commission was implemented. Transport Minister Laxman Savadi, also busy campaigning in Basavakalyan, argued that the strike was adversely impacting the already financially stressed RTCs, jeopardising their ability to even pay salaries. RTCs suffered a loss of Rs. 17 crore on Wednesday. Other arrangements On day one of the strike, while many seemed to have postponed or suspended their travel plans, others who were out on emergency or for work were stranded. The situation is expected to get tougher by Thursday even though private vehicles have been pressed into service. In preparation, the government has done away with the permit rule allowing any private vehicle to ferry passengers, deregulating the entire transport sector, till the strike ends. Meanwhile, South Western Railway has announced nine additional trains within the State over the next five days. Namma Metro in Bengaluru too has begun running additional trips.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/brace-for-hassles-as-bus-strike-continues/article34268378.ece
08 April 2021||CHENNAI,||In biggest single-day spike, India reports 1.26 lakh cases||India reported 1,14,352 new COVID-19 cases and 624 deaths as of 9.30 p.m. on Wednesday. This is the second day in a row that the country has crossed the one- lakh mark. The figures do not include data from Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Sikkim and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The data were sourced from covid19india.org , an independent aggregator of daily figures. The rise in cases in the past two days was primarily due to a record number of tests on Monday and Tuesday. More than 12 lakh daily tests were conducted on both these days. The last time the daily tests crossed the 12-lakh mark was on November 28, 2020. Maharashtra (14%) and Uttar Pradesh (13%) led the list in terms of the absolute number of new tests conducted in these two days. However, in terms of tests conducted relative to the population size, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand were the front-runners. The country has so far reported a total of 1,29,14,148 cases and 1,66,832 deaths. Maharashtra reported 59,907 infections, accounting for nearly 52% of the new cases, on Wednesday, followed by Karnataka (6,976) and Uttar Pradesh (6,023). Maharashtra also recorded the most casualties (322), followed by Punjab (62) and Uttar Pradesh (40). Vaccination doses The number of vaccine doses administered exceeded the 8.5-crore mark, with 8,70,77,474 shots given as of 7 p.m. on Wednesday. The number of daily vaccinations recovered from the low figures recorded during the last few days of March and peaked at 42 lakh doses on April 2. However, since then, the pace of vaccinations has fallen again. As of 8 p.m. on Wednesday, 13.14 lakh vaccine doses were administered across India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-adds-over-1-lakh-cases-for-the-second-day-in-a-row/article34268339.ece

In Chennai, 13 constituencies registered less than 60%, with Villivakkam coming at the bottom of the table for the State with 55.52%. Karur, Ariyalur, Dharmapuri and Kallakurichi districts recorded more than 80%. The Nilgiris, Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Coimbatore, Kanniyakumari, Chengalpattu and Tirunelveli registered 65.65%-69.68%.

08 April 2021||Mumbai,||RBI keeps policy rates unchanged||The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted unanimously to leave the policy repo rate unchanged at 4%, Governor Shaktikanta Das announced on Wednesday. “It also unanimously decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward,” he added. Observing that the economic prospects for 2021-22 had strengthened with the progress of the vaccination programme, Mr. Das said the recent surge in infections had, however, “imparted greater uncertainty to the outlook and it needs to be closely watched, especially as localised and regional lockdowns could dampen the recent improvement in demand conditions and delay the return of normalcy.” The MPC had, therefore, decided to retain the accommodative policy stance “till the prospects of sustained recovery” were well secured, he added.  Mr. Das stressed that the focus must now be on containing the spread of the virus as well as on economic revival by consolidating the gains achieved so far and sustaining the impulses of growth in the new financial year. “A key aspect of this strategy will be to strengthen the bedrock of macroeconomic stability that has anchored India’s revival from the pandemic. This will help stakeholders in taking efficient spending decisions over longer horizons, thereby improving the investment climate,” he said.  Optimistic surge Mr. Das said the RBI is optimistic about a pick-up in demand and expansion of business activity this year. “Rural demand remains buoyant and record agriculture production in 2020-21 bodes well for its resilience. Urban demand has gained traction and should get a fillip with the ongoing vaccination drive,” he added.   Taking various factors into consideration, the projection of real GDP growth for 2021-22 has been retained at 10.5% consisting of 26.2% in Q1; 8.3% in Q2; 5.4% in Q3; and 6.2% in Q4, Mr. Das said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rbi-keeps-policy-rates-unchanged/article34268342.ece

08 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Focus on containing second wave, says HC||The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the Tamil Nadu government to concentrate on containing the raging second wave of COVID-19. Since polling for the Assembly election got over on Tuesday, it hoped the government would begin taking effective steps, aimed at avoiding human suffering, after recovering from the election fatigue by the end of this week. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said some States had already imposed night curfew, and even a lockdown, albeit in a more restricted form than what was imposed during the first wave last year, appeared imminent. The Bench said the High Court, too, had scaled down physical hearings.  PIL petition The observations were made at the hearing of a PIL petition filed by advocate B. Ramkumar Adityan, who sought a direction to the Central and State governments to subject even asymptomatic international passengers to seven days of institutional quarantine and conduct COVID-19 tests on them, at their cost, to prevent the spread of a new virus strain. However, the judges said, no such directions would be issued for the present and the officials concerned would be given a free hand to take decisions without being constrained by court orders. They, nevertheless, put a rider that the court would be forced to pass necessary orders after a fortnight if the government did not take a call within a week or 10 days on the concerns expressed by the litigant. In his affidavit, the petitioner had insisted that the incoming international passengers be allowed to step out of institutional quarantine only if they tested negative after seven days. He said these passengers must be issued with an advisory to subject themselves to seven more days of home quarantine. On the other hand, those who tested positive must be treated at hospitals and discharged only as per medical advice. Highlighting the need for the government to act fast, he said the number of cases was on the rise across the country, and therefore it was essential to take precautionary measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/focus-on-containing-second-wave-says-hc/article34268433.ece
08 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||High Court allows MPTC, ZPTC elections||A Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court cleared the way for elections to the mandal and zilla parishad territorial constituencies (MPTC and ZPTC) scheduled for April 8, by overturning Justice U. Durga Prasad Rao’s order to impose a stay on the State Election Commission’s notification dated April 1. However, the court, comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice C. Praveen Kumar, ordered that the results be kept on hold until further orders. ‘State facing difficulties’ Appearing for the government, Advocate-General S. Sriram said that with the model code of conduct in force since January, the State had been facing difficulties as it could neither present the budget nor undertake COVID-19 vaccination in a full-fledged manner. He informed the court that the entire machinery was in place for the elections and that the State had not introduced any new policy regarding rural areas. None of the officers who had been transferred by the SEC was shifted back either. So, effectively the model code was still in place and no political party had been given an advantage. Representing the SEC, senior counsel C.V. Mohan Reddy said the single judge ought not to have entertained the writ petition filed by TDP’s Varla Ramaiah, especially when his locus standi was not decided. When the plea was opposed on the ground that it is in the nature of a PIL, it should have been heard by a Division Bench as per the writ proceeding rules, he contended. Senior advocate Vedula Venkataramana argued on behalf of the petitioner that the SEC had violated the Supreme Court order in the present election schedule, but to no avail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/court-allows-mptc-zptc-polls-in-ap/article34268300.ece

08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. mulling ways to boost yield from poppy||The Union government has decided to rope in the private sector to commence production of concentrated poppy straw from India’s opium crop to boost the yield of alkaloids, used for medical purposes and exported to several countries. Among the few countries permitted to cultivate the opium poppy crop for export and extraction of alkaloids, India currently only extracts alkaloids from opium gum at facilities controlled by the Revenue Department in the Finance Ministry. This entails farmers extracting gum by manually lancing the opium pods and selling the gum to government factories. The Ministry has now decided to switch to new technologies, after trial cultivation reports submitted last year by two private firms showed higher extraction of alkaloids using the concentrated poppy straw (CPS). Indoor greenhouses “While alkaloid extraction from the current opium crop using the CPS was found more than opium gum, it is possible to have two or three crop cycles in one year if we use CPS varieties of seeds that can be grown in indoor greenhouses too,” said an official aware of the development. The outcome of the two trials conducted in the crop years of 2017-18 and 2018-19 were received in February 2020 and June 2020. India’s opium crop acreage has been steadily declining over the years and using the CPS extraction method is expected to help cut the occasional dependence on imports of products like codeine (extracted from opium) for medicinal uses. While roping in private players to partner with the government in producing CPS and extracting alkaloids from it is likely to require amendments to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, the Department has decided to appoint a consultant to help frame the bidding parameters and concession agreements for the same. Partnership model “The consultant will be required to help frame the modalities for this endeavour, with an appropriate model including public-private partnership (PPP), advise on the changes needed to the rules and laws to facilitate this, and recommend security measures to protect the crop and the final product,” the official said. The firms carrying out the trials faced legal hassles in terms of getting relevant licences from the State governments to manufacture bulk alkaloids on their premises, which will need to be ironed out. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are the three traditional opium-growing States, where poppy cultivation is allowed based on licences issued annually by the Central Bureau of Narcotics. As per the trials’ findings, the imported seeds of certain CPS varieties worked effectively in Indian fields and their narcotic raw material yield was much higher from imported seeds instead of those used currently. “One of the firms purchased poppy straw of locally cultivated crop to analyse the yield from the same crop with the CPS method. They also cultivated CPS with hydroponic and aeroponic methods under a greenhouse environment. The other firm imported seeds from the U.K. and Australia, and carried out cultivation in association with an agriculture university,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-mulling-ways-to-boost-yield-from-poppy/article34268262.ece
08 April 2021||Kolkata,||Cooch Behar, Alipurduar set for crucial battles||Marginalised people from remote areas will exercise their right to franchise as 14 seats in Cooch Behar and Alipurduar districts of the northern part of West Bengal go to the polls in the fourth phase of the West Bengal Assembly election on April 10. The areas stretch from erstwhile enclaves bordering Bangladesh to the hills near Bhutan, where a particularly vulnerable primitive tribe, Toto, lives. In all, the electorate of 44 Assembly constituencies will vote in the fourth phase on April 10. Of the 44 seats, 14 are spread across the two districts of north Bengal, nine are in Cooch Behar and five in Alipurduar district. The fact that the Trinamool Congress lost both the Cooch Behar and Alipurduar seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election makes it an all the more important contest for the ruling party. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has campaigned extensively in the districts, emphasising that she has established peace and stability in the region and was upset that she lost the seats in the 2019 election. Cooch Behar used to be the capital of the erstwhile Koch Kings and both the Trinamool Congress and the BJP have been wooing the Rajbanshi population. Separatist movement The region saw a violent separatist movement in the first decade of the century. The BJP leadership has promised a Narayani Sena force on the lines of other paramilitary forces in the country, if elected, while the Trinamool Congress is promising a battalion called the Narayani Battalion in the police force. Occasional references to Panchanan Barma, another Rajbanshi icon, have been made by both parties. Seats like Mekhliganj, Sitalkuchi, Sitai and Dinhata in Cooch Behar share a porous border with Bangladesh. For a district with over 25% minority population, the BJP has been raising the issue of infiltration, with Union Home Minister Amit Shah pointing out that if the party wins, it won’t allow a bird to fly from across the border. Issue of enclaves Both the BJP and the Trinamool Congress take credit for settling the long-drawn issue of enclaves. In 2015, after the historic Land Boundary Agreement, 51 Bangladeshi enclaves located deep inside the Indian territory became part of India and 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh were merged with the territory of the neighbouring country. Over 900 people from the Indian enclaves in Bangladesh, who were settled in camps in Cooch Behar district, feel that there is a gap between what was promised and delivered. “No leaders come here any more, not even during elections. Six months ago, we were shifted from the camps to small flats. The free rations which the State government was giving have been stopped. We are a forgotten lot,” said Osman Gani, a resident of the Dinhata settlement camp. Dinhata, which has been witnessing violence over the past several weeks, is all set for an electoral contest between Nisith Pramanik, who was elected as BJP MP from Cooch Behar, and Udayan Guha of the Trinamool Congress. Like in many seats across the State, the BJP has fielded Trinamool Congress turncoats, including MLA Mihir Goswami, who joined the party months ago, at the Natabari Assembly seat against prominent Minister for North Bengal Development Rabindranath Ghosh. Cooch Behar district used to be a Forward Bloc bastion and in seats like Cooch Behar Uttar, the Samyukta Morcha candidate can play a key role. Tribal population In the adjoining Alipurduar district, with a significant tribal population adjoining the Buxa Tiger Reserve, the economy depends on tea gardens. Leos Hasapurty, a senior union leader of the tea gardens from the Madarihat constituency, explained the plight of tea workers. “On paper, the wages for the tea garden workers are Rs. 202 a day, but most of the workers are brought on contract from other tea gardens and get much less. Most of the tea gardens were started before the country got Independence. But we are struggling to get minimum wages,” he said, referring to half a dozen tea gardens that are lying closed in the district. Poll manifestos The poll manifestos of both the BJP and the Trinamool Congress promise an increase in wages. On the campaign trail, the BJP leaders have been talking about a Rs. 1,000 crore allocation for tea workers of Assam and Bengal if elected, while the ruling party is promising projects like ‘Cha Sundari’, with provisions of providing houses for tea garden workers. Leader of the BJP in the West Bengal Assembly, Manoj Tigga, is contesting against the ruling party’s Rakesh Lakra from Madarihat seat. In Alipurduar, Trinamool leader Sourav Chakraborty is contesting against the BJP’s Suman Kanjilal. Earlier, the BJP had fielded economist Ashok Lahiri from the seat, but renominated him from Balurghat after protests by the party’s rank and file.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cooch-behar-alipurduar-to-vote-on-april-10/article34268275.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Wearing mask mandatory even if driving alone, says Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday ruled that wearing a mask, or face cover, in a vehicle is compulsory even if a person is driving alone. “A mask is a suraksha kavach for preventing the spread of the coronavirus,” Justice Prathiba M. Singh remarked, while dismissing four different pleas challenging the Rs. 500 challan issued for not wearing masks while travelling alone in private cars. “A vehicle which is moving across the city, even if occupied at a given point in time by one person, would be a public place owing to the immediate risk of exposure to other persons under varying circumstances,” the court said. Lawyer’s case In one of the four cases, a lawyer, who was driving his car alone to his chambers at the Tis Hazari Courts on August 9, 2020, was stopped near Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital, Rajpur Road, Civil Lines by the police. He was travelling alone, with his mask hanging on his face from one of his ears. His case is that since he was in the car alone, he had not put on the mask properly and that he had intended to wear it as soon as he stepped out of the car. He said the four windows of his car were closed. When the police official stopped his car, he was informed that not wearing a mask was in violation of the Delhi Epidemic Diseases (Management of COVID-19) Regulations, 2020, and a sum of Rs. 500 was imposed on him as fine. The lawyer had sought to declare that privately owned cars were private places for the purpose of the regulations. Apart from the refund of the Rs. 500, he sought a Rs. 5 lakh compensation. The High Court clarified that authorised persons under the regulations would include a District Magistrate, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate, any officer of the Health Department, who may be authorised, or of the State government. It includes officials who hold the position of a sub-inspector or above in the Delhi Police. Exposure possible Justice Singh highlighted that a person travelling in a vehicle or car, even if he was alone, could be exposed to the virus in various ways. “The person may have visited a market, or workplace, or hospital or a busy street, prior to entering the car or vehicle. Such a person may be required to keep windows open for the purposes of ventilation.” “The vehicle may also be required to be stopped at a traffic signal and the person could purchase any product by rolling down the window. The person may thus, be exposed to a streetside vendor. Thus, it cannot be said that merely because the person is travelling alone in a car, the car would not be a public place,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wearing-mask-mandatory-even-if-driving-alone-says-delhi-hc/article34268289.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Incentives for solar energy sector||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved two production-linked incentive schemes for white goods (air-conditioners and LED lights) and high-efficiency solar photovoltaic modules. The Cabinet, at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, took another step towards the vision of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) with the approval for the Rs. 6,238-crore PLI scheme for air-conditioners and LEDs, a government statement said. “The prime objective of the PLI scheme is to make manufacturing in India globally competitive by removing sectoral disabilities, creating economies of scale and ensuring efficiencies. It is designed to create complete component ecosystem in India and make India an integral part of the global supply chains,” the government said. White goods The scheme would extend an incentive of 4% to 6% on incremental sales of goods made in India for five years. The statement said the scheme was estimated to lead to incremental investment of Rs. 7,920 crore over five years and lead to production worth Rs. 1.68 lakh crore, as well as lead to 4 lakh jobs. The Cabinet also approved a proposal of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy for a PLI scheme for high efficiency solar PV modules with an outlay of Rs. 4,500 crore. “Solar capacity addition presently depends largely upon imported solar PV cells and modules as the domestic manufacturing industry has limited operational capacities of solar PV cells and modules. The National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules will reduce import dependence in a strategic sector like electricity. It will also support the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative,” the government said. The scheme was expected to lead to 10,000 MW of additional capacity of solar PV plants and investment of around Rs. 17,200 crore in solar PV manufacturing projects, it said. The scheme would lead to direct employment of 30,000 people and indirect jobs to 1.2 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/incentives-for-solar-energy-sector/article34268251.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||COVID-19 curbs won’t stop us, say farmers||Despite a spike in COVID-19 cases and imposition of curbs across many States, protesting farmers at the Singhu border said they were determined to continue with their movement. Several protesters who have been camping at the borders for over four months now said on Wednesday that farmers had overcome the fear of the virus and they had altered their rotation schedules to ensure they travelled during the day and avoided the curfew hours. “We will continue our movement at the same pace,” said Sukhjeet Singh Sidhu, a farmer from Punjab’s Patiala district. “Neither the night curfew nor the ban on political gatherings will have any effect on our movement. We will continue with the rotation system that we have evolved and nothing can stop us from continuing our protest at this point.” Manjeet Singh, another farmer from Patiala, said the Punjab government had stood by the farmers. “Our State government has supported us earlier as well and authorities are not really bothering farmers who are on their way to the Singhu border.” Curfew not violated “People are ensuring that they reach their respective destinations — be it the border or the villages — in time. Our vehicles leave in the morning itself to ensure that curfew hours are not violated. However, we have not faced any difficulties till now from the authorities. As for the virus, we have been lucky that there has been no outbreak at the protest site itself. So we are not worried,” Mr. Singh said. Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Roopnagar district, said the announcements of restrictions and curbs had only strengthened the farmers’ resolve. “This is the government’s ploy to stop the protest and once the elections are over, they will impose similar curbs across the country. But that will not affect our movement one bit. Even now schools and colleges are shut and we have seen an increase in participation from the youth. Several have reached the Singhu border in the past few days. No matter what curbs are imposed on us, our movement continue,” said Mr. Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-curbs-wont-stop-us-say-farmers/article34268285.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre seeks nod to close Italian marines case||The government on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to schedule an urgent hearing of its application to close the criminal trials pending in India against two Italian marines accused of killing two fishermen off the coast of Kerala in 2012. A Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde agreed to hear the case on April 9. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the government, said the victims’ families have been compensated and the case needs to be disposed of. Eight months ago, the Centre had informed the apex court about its decision to “accept and abide” by an international tribunal’s award that the Marines, Salvatore Girone and Massimiliano Latorre, should be tried in their native Italy. The government had explained that India was bound by the award of the arbitral tribunal formed under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The award was “final and without appeal” as India was a party to the UN Convention. In a virtual hearing in August last year, the court had made it clear that it would close the criminal trial of the Marines in India only after the victims’ families were heard and paid a ‘hefty’ compensation. The court had asked the government to negotiate an ‘adequate’ compensation for the slain fishermen’s families with Italy. “We appreciate the steps taken by Italy to prosecute the two Marines... You want to withdraw the criminal cases against them, but you have not been able to fix the compensation [for the families of the victims]. Secondly, the fact is that there is a pending trial in a criminal court and the victims’ families are parties there. How can we order withdrawal of the cases here without first hearing them?” Chief Justice Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench, had asked Mr. Mehta and advocate Suhail Dutt, for Italy, in that hearing. Girone and Latorre, who were detailed on the Italian ship Enrica Lexie , allegedly shot the fishermen thinking they were ‘pirates’. India is entitled to compensation for the loss of life. Its freedom and right of navigation was violated by the Marines, the U.N. tribunal had held.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-seeks-nod-to-close-italian-marines-case/article34268255.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pandemic offered key lessons: PM||Though students missed a year of school life and interaction with their teachers and friends due to COVID-19, the pandemic has also taught them many lessons about the true value of essential things and strengthened the emotional bonds between family members at a time of social distancing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday. He was responding to the only question related to the pandemic in his interaction with students and parents through a virtual Pariksha Pe Charcha event, despite the fact that social media saw a section of students clamouring for examinations to be cancelled due to the spike in cases. With cases crossing the one lakh a day mark — significantly higher than the level of infection last March when several board examinations were cancelled — a section of students and parents have urged that students’ safety be considered the highest priority. The hashtag #cancelboardexams2021 was one of the top five Twitter trends on Tuesday and Wednesday, with almost seven lakh tweets. Others wanted examinations to be postponed or held online to reduce the risk of infection. However, the Central Board of Secondary Education has reiterated that examinations will be held offline, starting May 4. Students who support the exams being held on schedule have argued on Twitter that they do not wish to risk losing an academic year, and that a year’s experience of COVID-19 safety protocols will protect test-takers. Mr. Modi also offered study tips and advice on reducing tension in the examination hall. Responding to one student’s query on memory tips, the Prime Minister urged her to focus on internalising knowledge rather than rote memorisation. “You learned your mother tongue naturally, because the things that become a part of you are never forgotten,” he told the student from Rajasthan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pandemic-offered-key-lessons-pm/article34268325.ece
08 April 2021||New Delhi,||Police establish contact with Maoists||The police have been able to establish contact with the group of Maoists who abducted a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) commando after the April 3 encounter at Tarrem in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh. A day ago, the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) released a statement demanding that the State government name a mediator for the release of the commando. Refusing to divulge details on the negotiation, a senior police official said the commando would be brought back soon. The abducted commando, identified as Rakeshwar Singh Minhas, belongs to the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) unit of the CRPF, which is specially trained for operations in areas affected by left-wing extremism. On Wednesday, the Maoists released a photograph of Mr. Minhas where he is seen sitting under the shade of a hut in his combat clothes. “There are positive developments and the commando has been located. We cannot launch an operation as it would risk his life,” the official said. Asked by the media during the briefing on Cabinet decisions of whether the government would get the CRPF jawan released, Mr. Javadekar declined to comment, requesting the press to maintain “discipline” and stick to questions on the Cabinet meeting of the day. A joint team of Chhattisgarh Police comprising the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Special Task Force (STF), along with various teams of the CRPF, proceeded for a combing operation in south Bastar on April 2. The region is said to be a stronghold of the Maoists and one of the worst affected areas. On April 3, when the troops were returning, the last group was attacked by Maoists, killing 22 security personnel and injuring 31. The Maoists also took away 14 weapons, over 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and other items belonging to the security personnel. The April 6 statement signed by “Vikalp”, spokesperson of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee of the Maoists, said that four People’s Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA) cadres had been killed in the encounter at Tarrem on April 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-establish-contact-with-maoists/article34268270.ece
08 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||BJP’s rivals include 3 NDA constituents in Assam||More political parties are destined to end up as also-rans in Assam’s mandate in 2021 compared with past elections. This list is likely to include three constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that put up candidates against “big brother” BJP. The three-phase Assembly election that ended on April 6 saw 41 national, State and registered unrecognised parties battle it out. This excluded parties such as the Rabha Joutha Mancha and the Anchalik Gana Mancha, whose candidates contested under the BJP and the Congress symbols, respectively. While jailed activist Akhil Gogoi and other candidates of his party, Raijor Dal, contested as Independents, there were a few parties such as the Jimochayan (Deori) People’s Party and the Adivasi National Party that chose not to contest, but aligned with the Congress-led Mahajot or grand alliance. The total count of parties in the 2016 election was 36. Some of the registered unrecognised parties that contested the 2016 poll skipped the mandate in 2021. These include the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, the Bharat Vikas Morcha, the Jan Congress Party and the Rashtriya Pragati Party. Some better-known parties such as the Shiv Sena and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) were missing in action too. Their spaces were filled by some unfamiliar names such as the Asom Jana Morcha, the Bahujan Maha Party and the Voters’ Party International. For parties such as the Bharatiya Gana Parishad (BGP), winning a seat is “just a matter of time”. This party, catering mainly to Hindu Bengalis who feel betrayed by both the Congress and the BJP, fielded 15 candidates compared to 10 in 2016. But the focus beyond the three primary alliances — the BJP-headed Mitrajot (friends’ group), the Congress-led Mahajot and the regional front of the Assam Jatiya Parishad-Raijor Dal — is expected to be on three NDA constituents that went alone, even against the BJP. The Janata Dal(U) contested 33 seats, the most among the three allies of the BJP, followed by Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad A. Sangma’s National People’s Party with 11 and Union Minister Ramdas Athawale’s Republican Party of India (Athawale) with seven. Among the seven that the RPI (Athawale) fielded was Krishnamani Das, one of the youngest candidates this time at 26 years. Her key opponent for the Patacharkuchi seat is State BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjps-rivals-include-3-nda-constituents-in-assam/article34268273.ece
08 April 2021||new Delhi,||Pandemic taught key lessons: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said students might have lost a year of their lives due to the coronavirus pandemic but they had learnt lot of lessons of true value of essential things. In his annual interaction called “Pariksha Pe Charcha” with students ahead of board exams, he said the COVID-19 pandemic had taught everyone not to take anything for granted like regular school days and attending office. “The pandemic has taught us to fight the unexpected. People have realised the importance of not taking anything for granted like regular school days, attending office. Though COVID-19 forced us to maintain social distancing but it strengthened families’ emotional bonding,” Mr. Modi said. “We have lost much during the pandemic but we have also gained a lot. The biggest lesson that corona has taught is that the things and people you missed during the period have such an important role in your life. Those activities and people you had assumed as part of a routine, you realised their importance,” he added. Schools across the country closed in March last year ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of novel coronavirus. The prolonged closure prompted the shift of teaching, learning activities to online mediums. While several States began partially reopening schools in October last year, the physical classes are again being suspended in the wake of fresh surge in cases. The board exams for Classes 10 and 12 which are usually held in February-March are scheduled to be held in May-June this year. This is the first time that the Prime Minister’s interaction with the students was conducted virtually.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pandemic-taught-key-lessons-pm/article34268260.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘China is capable of launching cyberattacks’||Accepting that there is a capability differential between India and China, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Wednesday said the biggest differential lies in the cyber field and China is “capable of launching cyberattacks on us and it can disrupt a large number of systems”. On Afghanistan, he said they were keeping their eyes and ears open and “making sure that we are not out of the bandwagon”. “We may not be able to fully catch up with China. So, we are trying to develop some kind of a relationship with western nations and see if we can get better support from them during peace time at least, which will help us overcome this deficiency,” Gen. Rawat said while speaking at a webinar by the Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF). What they were trying to do was create a system that would ensure cyber defence, he said, adding that they had created a cyber agency within the Armed forces. Gen. Rawat said each service also had its own cyber agency, so that even if they came under a cyberattack, the “downtime of the attack doesn’t last long”. “We should be able to overcome that cyberattack and continue with our systems through alternate means... While we are trying to create firewalls for cyberattacks, we are quite sure they will be able to break through the firewalls and we will have cyberattacks,” he added. This differential could be overcome only if resources of the three services were integrated, Gen. Rawat said. Responding to questions on the situation in Afghanistan, Gen. Rawat said the Taliban was trying to put pressure on the U.S. He said the Taliban was gaining ground. “We are keeping our eyes and ears open. We are making sure that we are not out of the bandwagon and that we understand what is happening in that nation,” Gen. Rawat said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-is-capable-of-launching-cyberattacks/article34268271.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM to launch vessel for the Seychelles||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hand over a fast patrol vessel to the Seychelles Coast Guard on Thursday. The handing over will be part of a high-level virtual interaction between the Indian leader and the President of the Seychelles, Wavel Ramkalawan. This is the first interaction between the two leaders since Mr. Ramkalawan won the October 2020 election in the Seychelles. The African archipelago nation has been a steady part of India’s policy for the Indian Ocean region and Mr. Modi visited the country in 2015. India gifted similar vessels to the Seychelles in 2005, 2014 and 2016. During the event, the leaders will inaugurate a 1 MW solar power plant, and the Magistrates’ Court building project in Mahe, the largest island in the archipelago. The Magistrates’ Court will help the Seychelles in centralising the legal and administrative processes that are spread over different regions of the nation. Anti-piracy operations The fast petrol vessel PS Zoroaster will help the Seychelles in carrying out anti-piracy operations. The vessel, built by the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineering Limited, was delivered to Seychelles on March 16 and will be dedicated to the Seychelles Coast Guard by Prime Minister Modi during the virtual interaction. The virtual interaction comes weeks after India gifted 50,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine to Seychelles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-to-launch-vessel-for-the-seychelles/article34268281.ece
08 April 2021||Kolkata,||Amit Shah holds road show in Singur||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday participated in four road shows in Kolkata and adjoining areas. During a road show in Singur, Mr. Shah promised industrialisation if the BJP came to power. Singur is going to the polls on April 10 in the fourth phase and industrialisation is central to the constituency. During another road show in Howrah, he urged supporters to ensure that the BJP wins with a big margin. “Mamata didi is a big leader, so her departure should also be by a big margin,” Mr. Shah said. He said if the BJP comes to power, it will reform the education system, strengthen infrastructure, provide work to the unemployed and promote industry. The Home Minister also participated in a road show in Domjur in Howrah and Behala in the southern parts of the city. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union Minister Smriti Irani also campaigned for the party candidates. At rallies at Mal in Jalpiaguri, Mr. Adityanath alleged that the TMC government has siphoned off money from the Central schemes. The Trinamool Congress chairperson addressed two public meetings in Cooch Behar district and one in the Jadavpur Assembly segment in Kolkata. At the public meetings in north Bengal, Ms. Banerjee said if the BJP comes to power they will send people to camps as they did in Assam during the National Register of Citizens. She urged the people to elect at least 200 MLAs to help her form government. Responding to Ms. Banerjee’s remarks, pradesh Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the Trinamool chief’s insistence on winning 200 seats points out that she is scared that her MLAs may desert her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amit-shah-holds-road-show-in-singur/article34268729.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||EC notice to Mamata on code violation||The Election Commission of India (EC) on Wednesday sent a notice to West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee stating that her appeal to minority voters not to divide their votes was a violation of the model code of conduct. The EC asked the Chief Minister to respond within 48 hours, failing which it would take a decision without any further reference to her. BJP delegation The notice said a BJP delegation led by Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had met the EC and complained about Ms. Banerjee’s speech during a campaign event in Tarakeshwar on April 3 appealing to Muslim voters not to let their votes get divided among political parties. “I am requesting my minority brothers and sisters with folded hands don’t divide the minority votes after listening to the shaitaan [devil] person who had taken money from the BJP (sic),” the EC quoted Ms. Banerjee as saying. The EC said it found Ms. Banerjee’s speech to be in violation of the poll code, which was imposed after the West Bengal Assembly election was announced on February 26. Among the clauses highlighted by the notice were those against the use of caste or communal appeals to voters and intimidation of voters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ec-notice-to-mamata-on-code-violation/article34268267.ece

The move then is aimed at making the vaccine more accessible,” a communication from Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. The sessions will still require beneficiaries to register on the Co-WIN portal prior to vaccination, and the workplace management will designate one of its senior staff members to be the nodal officer for coordinating with the district health authorities/private COVID-19 vaccination centres and support vaccination activities. “The schedule of vaccination session can be made up 15 days in advance and intimated to the workplace so that maximum attendance is ensured on the day of the vaccination. In most of the workplaces vaccination schedule may, however, be completed in less than 15 days,” the guidelines said. The guidelines added that one fully trained vaccination team should be assigned to vaccinate 100 beneficiaries at the workplace. Private CVCs will deploy the vaccination team at private workplaces. “The workplace CVCs staff engaged in COVID-19 vaccination will follow existing SOPs for vaccination and reporting adverse events following vaccination,” the guidelines said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-gives-nod-for-vaccination-at-workplaces/article34268249.ece
08 April 2021||New Delhi,||CBI may take statement of Param Bir Singh||The Central Bureau of Investigation may record the statement of former Mumbai Police chief, Param Bir Singh, and others in connection with a preliminary enquiry into his letter containing allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh. “Two teams from Delhi have already reached Mumbai for the preliminary enquiry, instituted on the directions of the Bombay High Court. Contents of the letter in question will be scrutinised by the officials and some of those linked to the matter may be examined. Other evidence may also be looked into to determine if a prima facie case is made out,” said an official. Mr. Deshmukh had resigned soon after the High Court directive to the CBI. Meanwhile, a special NIA court in Mumbai on Wednesday allowed the CBI to question suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze in connection with its preliminary inquiry. Judge P.R. Sitre heard the CBI’s plea while extending the NIA custody of Mr. Waze till April 9.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||No shortage of vaccines, says Health Minister||To spread panic among the people is to compound the folly further. Vaccine supplies are being monitored on a real-time basis, and State governments are being apprised regularly about it. Allegations of vaccine shortage are utterly baseless,” his letter noted. He marked out the three States — all led by non-NDA governments — to argue that they were coming up short compared with several other States in vaccinating healthcare and frontline workers, and those above 45 years, and trying to “politicise” the pandemic.  He also picked out Chhattisgarh for “petty politicking” and said the State’s overarching reliance on rapid antigen tests and its early refusal to use Covaxin gave it the “dubious distinction of being the only government in the world to incite vaccine hesitancy”. He said there were 10 States that had inoculated more than 90% of their healthcare workers, when Maharashtra had managed “only 86%”, while Punjab and Delhi had carried out 64% and 72%, respectively. “Among frontline workers, Maharashtra has vaccinated only 73% with first dose. Equivalent numbers for Delhi and Punjab are 71% and 65%. There are five Indian States/UTs that have already done more than 85%. When it comes to senior citizens, Maharashtra has vaccinated just 25%, Delhi has vaccinated 30% and Punjab only 13%. There are four States/UTs that have already vaccinated more than 50%. Doesn’t it seem evident that these States are trying to divert attention from their poor vaccination efforts by just continuously shifting the goal-posts?” Amid a second wave, which is now seeing more than 1,00,000 new cases being added everyday, there has been a clamour for opening up vaccines for all adults. However, Serum Institute of India (SII) has said that its production lines have been stretched, and that India must provide it with Rs. 3,000 crore to boost production capacity. Adar Poonawala, CEO, SII, told NDTV that it was unable to export vaccines (which it sells at a higher price) because of restrictions placed by India and this was curtailing profits necessary for larger manufacturing capacity investments. The company produced about 65 million vaccine doses a month and “most of it” was for India. However, with India now administering over 2-4 million doses a day, the supply could quickly dry up. Mr. Poonawala said his company had been sent legal notices by AstraZeneca over delays in supplying Covishield, and a ban by the United States on exporting the raw material necessary for making another forthcoming vaccine called Novavax meant the SII’s ability to make it had halved. The Centre has also ordered 20 million doses of Covaxin by Bharat Biotech though there are again concerns over how quickly the company can ramp up production for the projected 120 million doses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-shortage-of-vaccines-says-health-minister/article34268263.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||RBI keeps policy rates unchanged||“A key aspect of this strategy will be to strengthen the bedrock of macroeconomic stability that has anchored India’s revival from the pandemic. This will help stakeholders in taking efficient spending decisions over longer horizons, thereby improving the investment climate,” he said. Optimistic surge Mr. Das said the RBI is optimistic about a pick-up in demand and expansion of business activity this year. The juxtaposition of high frequency lead and coincident indicators revealed that economic activity was normalising in spite of the surge in infections, he said. “Rural demand remains buoyant and record agriculture production in 2020-21 bodes well for its resilience. Urban demand has gained traction and should get a fillip with the ongoing vaccination drive,” he added. Taking various factors into consideration, the projection of real GDP growth for 2021-22 has been retained at 10.5% consisting of 26.2% in Q1; 8.3% in Q2; 5.4% in Q3; and 6.2% in Q4, Mr. Das said. The RBI Governor said that while headline inflation at 5.0% in February 2021 remained within the tolerance band, some underlying constituents were testing the upper tolerance level. Taking into consideration various factors, RBI had revised the projection for CPI inflation to 5.0% in Q4 of 2020-21; 5.2 % in Q1 of 2021-22; 5.2% in Q2; 4.4% in Q3; and 5.1% in Q4, with risks broadly balanced, he said. Based on its experience last year, the RBI had also decided to put in place a secondary market G-sec acquisition programme or G-SAP 1.0, whereby the central bank would commit upfront to a specific amount of open market purchases of government securities with a view to enabling a stable and orderly evolution of the yield curve amid comfortable liquidity conditions. “The endeavour will be to ensure congenial financial conditions for the recovery to gain traction,” Mr. Das said. For Q1, it had been decided to announce a G-SAP of Rs. 1 lakh crore. The first purchase of government securities for an aggregate amount of Rs. 25,000 crore under G-SAP 1.0 would be conducted on April 15, he said. “The Reserve Bank will, of course, continue to do whatever it takes to preserve financial stability and to insulate domestic financial markets from global spillovers and the consequent volatility,” Mr. Das emphasised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rbi-keeps-policy-rates-unchanged/article34268264.ece

08 April 2021||New Delhi,||Every Indian deserves a chance to safe life: Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said it was ridiculous to have a debate on “need versus want” with regard to the COVID-19 vaccination and every Indian deserved the chance to a safe life. Mr. Gandhi’s tweet was in response to Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan’s comment at a press conference on Tuesday where he had said the government’s aim was “to vaccinate all those who need and not all those who want the vaccine”. Mr. Bhushan said the vaccination drive was aimed at curbing deaths by targeting groups that were most vulnerable. “It’s ridiculous to debate needs & wants. Every Indian deserves the chance to a safe life,” Mr. Gandhi said on Twitter. In another tweet, the former Congress chief also shared a video of the police mercilessly beating up a person in Indore for not wearing a mask. “In the name of enforcing rules, such shameful inhumanity is unacceptable to the country. Where will the people go if the police, instead of protecting people, start torturing?” he asked. Lok Sabha member Manish Tewari tweeted to ask Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to ensure young people are vaccinated immediately. At the Congress’s press briefing, spokesperson Pawan Khera reiterated the point of vaccination for all and asked the government to approve more manufacturers to have a diversified pool of vaccines. “It’s a very insensitive comment... I ask him who decides that a bureaucrat gets the vaccine and a delivery boy doesn’t,” Mr. Khera asked. He said the second wave could soon turn out to be a tsunami if the government didn’t acknowledge its gravity. He said while during the first wave, India’s highest infection rate on a single day was 97,894 cases on September 17, it reached a staggering 1,15,736 on April 7. “India has surpassed both the U.S. and Brazil to bag the number one spot in terms of having the highest new positive cases daily,” he said. “One in every seven new cases across the world is that of an Indian.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/every-indian-deserves-a-chance-to-safe-life-rahul/article34268278.ece

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The three gunas||Uddhava wonders why a person behaves differently at different times. Lord Krishna explains that this is due to the three gunas — sattva, rajas and tamas, said P.T. Seshadri in a discourse. Each of these gunas results in certain traits in a person. Fifteen qualities result from sattva. They are sama, dama, titiksha, eeksha, tapa, satya, daya, smrti, tushti, tyaga, asprta, sraddha, hree, dayaadi and svanivrtti. Sama means control over the mind. Dama means control over the indriyas. Titiksha means patience. Eeksha means the quality of analysing to find out what is good and what is bad. Tapah means observing one’s dharma. Satya is speaking the truth. Daya means mercy. Smrti is thinking of the Lord’s mercy. Tushti is being content with what one has. Tyaaga is surrendering all one’s actions at the Lord’s feet. Asprta means having vairagya, that is being unattached to anything that is worldly. Sraddha is dedication. Hree is being ashamed to sin. Dayaadi is giving dana. Svanivrtti is being simple. A person with sattva guna believes in dharma anushtana. A person with rajas is pleasure seeking. A person with tamas is interested only in wealth. A combination of the three gunas in a person results in his behaving differently at different times. His behaviour depends upon which of the gunas is dominant at that moment. How can we infer that a person has all three gunas? The same man does rituals to gain an advantage; he leads the life of a grihastha, and observes his dharma, while earning to run his family. One who does his karmas and submits the fruits to the Lord has sattva guna. One who expects certain fruits from his actions has rajas. One who troubles others has the quality of tamas. One with sattva guna knows that the body and atma are different.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-three-gunas/article34268276.ece

A large number of farmers held a sit-in outside the Shahbad police station in Kurukshetra in protest against the arrests. Mr. Singh had gone to Majri Mohalla for a personal visit on Tuesday, when BKU members began protesting outside the house he was visiting. After he came out of the house and entered his car, the protesters surrounded the vehicle, raised slogans and showed black flags. A few of them even tried to pull Mr. Singh out of the vehicle, while others sat on the bonnet, the police said. They also smashed the rear windscreen of the car. The police had a tough time excorting him out of the area. While 11 people have been named in the FIR, eight to 10 are unidentified. The police said they had a video of the incident clearing showing the protesters trying to pull out the legislator and smashing the windscreen of the vehicle. Those arrested were produced before the court and sent to jail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/day-after-attack-on-mps-car-4-bku-members-held/article34268376.ece

Since residents had opposed the cremation of bodies of COVID-19 patients at crematoriums in Ambajogai town, local authorities had to identify another place away from there to perform the victims’ last rites, he said. “As residents objected to the cremation of COVID-19 victims in the crematoriums which we currently have, we identified a separate space on Mandwa road, nearly two km away from the town,” Ambajogai Municipal Council’s chief officer Ashok Sabale told PTI . The new makeshift facility had limited space, he said. “As a result, we had to set up one large pyre and cremate eight bodies on Tuesday. It was a big pyre and the bodies were kept at a certain distance from each other,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/one-pyre-for-8-who-died-of-covid-19/article34268283.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the Ministries of Information and Broadcasting, and Electronics and Information Technology, seeking their stand on the plea by two lawyers. Regulatory body The petition filed by advocates Neha Kapoor and Mohit Bhadu claimed that there was need for a regulatory body to review non-film songs and music videos as many of them contained obscene or vulgar content.  The petition, filed through advocate Rishu Singh, has sought a direction to make it mandatory for composers of non-film songs to receive certification before such songs are made available in the public domain. “Such non-film songs have the effect of eroding the Indian value system and instigating the listeners, especially the youth in believing that drugs, alcohol and most importantly objectifying women is acceptable and these things are necessary to survive at par with your peers in the society,” the petition has alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-asks-for-regulation-of-non-film-songs/article34268247.ece

Of the 40.57 lakh voters, 23.95 lakh voted in the 16 constituencies. Compilation of data was delayed because 350 officials on election duty did not know how to use an app to generate the turnout data from many polling booths in the city. Most booths in north Chennai registered a higher turnout by the close of polling at 7 p.m. on Tuesday. 66.57% in R.K.

08 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||2021 Assembly poll holds similarities to 2016||The 2021 Assembly election has similarities to the 2016 election, going by an analysis of the voter turnout data. The conclusion can be drawn from two factors — the overall turnout figure and the constituencies with a high turnout. As per the provisional figure of the total turnout released by Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo on Wednesday, the current election’s tally — 72.78% — is marginally lower than the 2016 figure of 74.24%. After reconciliation of data, the State’s average may go up. 4.3% increase In absolute figures, approximately 25 lakh more people voted this time than in 2016, an increase of 4.3%. On Tuesday, around 4.58 crore people exercised their franchise as against about 4.33 crore in 2016. As for the number of constituencies that have exceeded the State’s average, the tally this time is 137 as against 146 in 2016. Last time, the AIADMK won 88 such seats and the DMK-led front 58. A perusal of the constituency-wise figures of turnout reveals that Palacode in Dharmapuri district in the western region, from where Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan is seeking re-election, has registered the highest polling of 87.33%, as it did five years ago with 88.57%. Kulithalai in Karur district in the central zone, which is immediately next to Palacode in turnout this time, was placed third in 2016. Now, it recorded 86.15%, against 88.13% five years ago. Edappadi in Salem district, where Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami is trying his luck once again, finished third now with 85.6%, whereas it came fifth in 2016 with 86.35%. Pennagaram, which was third the last time with 88.04%, stands eighth with 84.19%. Aided by the ruling AIADMK, PMK president G.K. Mani is seeking to re-enter the Assembly from this seat after a gap of 10 years. As in the case of these four constituencies, many, which had much higher turnout than the State’s average last time, have registered a similar feat this time too. They include Viralimalai in the central region (where Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar is the AIADMK candidate); Tirumangalam (where Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar is the ruling party’s nominee); Tiruchuli (former School Education Minister Thangam Thennarasu is the DMK contestant); and Oddanchatram (R. Sakkarapani is the DMK’s candidate), all three in the south; and Katpadi in the north (where former PWD Minister Durai Murugan has been fielded by the DMK). An interesting aspect of the 2021 election is that constituencies where many of the high-profile candidates belonging to the two principal parties — the DMK and the AIADMK — have been fielded have registered a higher turnout than the State’s average, as happened in the past. For instance, Gobichettipalayam in the west, where School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan is contesting again, and Thirukkoyilur in the north, where former Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi is seeking re-election, registered a turnout of 82.51% and 76.24% respectively. However, AIADMK veteran S. Semmalai does not see any one-to-one relationship. He wonders why Kolathur, despite having a prominent leader in DMK president M.K. Stalin as one of the candidates, has not registered an exceptionally high turnout. “It depends upon regions and the capacity of political parties to mobilise people. A high turnout has nothing to do with the high profile of contestants,” he asserts. Another feature of the 2021 election is that the turnout in a large number of constituencies in the northern and western regions — starting from Thiruporur in Chengalpattu district, on the southern outskirts of Chennai, to Kumarapalayam in Namakkal district — have exceeded the State’s average. Besides, the central and southern districts account for 28 and 17 constituencies respectively. TNCC vice-president A. Gopanna cites an intense electoral battle as one of the important reasons for the high turnout in many northern and western constituencies. As for the overall turnout, he says this reminds him of what the State recorded during the 2019 Lok Sabha election. G. Palanithurai, a veteran academic, laments that the expectation of certain sections for cash from parties mainly determines the turnout, which is not a “healthy trend”. ( With inputs from   Pon Vasanth B.A. )  It depends upon regions and the capacity of political parties to mobilise people. A high turnout has nothing to do with the high profile of contestants S. Semmalai AIADMK veteran   A high turnout has nothing to do with the high profile of contestants,”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/2021-assembly-poll-holds-similarities-to-2016/article34268438.ece

The data collated during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that the nation was letting slip another epidemic in the form of non-communicable diseases, the impact of which was visible. “Apollo ProHealth is a proactive personalised health management programme backed by cutting-edge technology — advanced diagnostics, artificial intelligence and predictive algorithms — to help identify your health risk,” he said. The ProHealth package ranged from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 13,000. Dr. Reddy said although the government had provided a tax break for preventive healthcare of up to Rs. 5,000, very few were aware of it and even among those, very few used it. The group’s joint managing director, Sangita Reddy, said the hospital used its experience and collated information from 21 million health records of people using artificial intelligence and big data analytics to predict risk and prevent non-communicable diseases. The doctors at the group presented a report on the health of the nation, according to which in the past two decades the top cause of death due to non-communicable diseases had risen to 64.9% as compared to communicable diseases, maternal and other causes that dropped to 25%. Anupam Sibal, group medical director, said the study showed the highest prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes among the 45-60 age group and almost as high as the 60+ age group. Among the diabetics, around 50% had hypertension and were above the recommended weight. Around 60% of these diabetics were leading a sedentary lifestyle. The data indicated that women had lower incidence of non-communicable diseases than men, but the difference was marginal. Hence, they must stay vigilant. “The economically disadvantaged are also not spared, although with lower prevalence,” he said. Sathya Sriram, CEO, Preventive Health, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, said, “Over the last 12 months, a cohort of ProHealth guests with diabetes have shown 33%-60% target achievement across multiple health parameters, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, physical activity and HbA1c.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ncd-causing-serious-loss-of-lives/article34268464.ece
08 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Experts bat for restrictions instead of lockdown||For little over a month, Tamil Nadu has been registering a surge in fresh SARS CoV-2 infections. While a combination of factors are at play, experts strongly believe that a blanket lockdown is nowhere near a solution, rather strict regulations and restrictions tailored to local situations should be the way ahead. Since March 5, when the State’s daily count first exceeded 500, it has added nearly 57,000 more COVID-19 cases. While poor compliance with pandemic-appropriate behaviour is cited as one of the main reasons for the surge, the spread of new variants cannot be ruled out, say experts. “I never expected a second wave,” T. Jacob John, retired professor of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore said. “Looking at graphs and statistics, about 60% of the country’s population was already infected in the first wave. The remaining 40% was not affected. I thought it will be slow, and we will have steady numbers like what we reached in January and February. But things changed in the beginning of March. I think there was the human element and virus element that came together at the wrong time. People let their guards down. Gatherings like weddings took place like no COVID-19 was happening. We let the virus blip up,” he added. A combination of reasons has led to the surge in cases, said Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology-Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “First, there is poor compliance with COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. There is decreased compliance with masking and maintaining physical distancing. There was an increase in the size of gatherings, particularly due to elections. The recent opening of educational institutions is one of the reasons. As far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, there is limited data on the new coronavirus variants and the potential to spread faster,” she said. Dr. John said India was not testing for mutants and was caught unaware. “The currently spreading virus has to be one or more fast-spreading mutants. Look at the numbers growing that is different from the way it grew the last time. Going by the rapidity of the spread, the R-value (reproduction) will be twice that of last time. The faster spreading variant along with lack of precautions has led to the second wave. Either one of which would not have created the same magnitude, except for a little rise,” he said. What are the key areas of concern? Dr. Kaur pointed out that the new variant seemed to cause a rapid surge in cases. “Unlike last year, there is low risk perception among the public. In particular, they are tired of the precautionary measures. There is also a false sense of protection that as soon as they receive the first dose of vaccination, there is a perception that they are protected. Another area of concern is rapid filling up of hospitals and the disruption it could cause to other services,” she said. However, the experts said lockdown was definitely not a solution. “Strict mask wearing and strict crowd control are the solution. There should be restrictions in public places such as restaurants, places of worship, and on gatherings, and restriction in the number of persons attending weddings and funerals. We should do all things short of a lockdown. We need the social vaccine now more than ever,” Dr. John said. Dr. Kaur called for more restrictions tailored to a local situation rather than a blanket lockdown. In high risk areas, intensify surveillance, have extensive contact tracing and testing, focus on areas where there is a rapid surge, she said and added: “We should reach out to high risk groups for vaccination, she said. Vaccination drive As far as vaccination was concerned, Dr. John said schools and colleges were opened before staff were vaccinated. “Tamil Nadu, however, vaccinated the polling staff and this kind of thinking is what we need to apply. Vaccination must be given but it cannot interfere in the current wave. For Covishield, we need to bring back the four-week interval for the second dose during this crisis,” he said. Vaccination should be scaled up very rapidly for those aged above 45.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/experts-favour-stringent-restrictions/article34268461.ece
08 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Commercial passenger air traffic remains stagnant||It has been more than a year since COVID-19 struck, and like other sectors, civil aviation suffered a big blow. In February last year, the Chennai airport used to have nearly 250 departures and arrivals every day. But now, the air traffic has come down by 50%. Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials said that on average, 21,000-22,000 passengers travelled every day. “Both passenger traffic and the number of flights we handle have been stagnant for a while now. But this is expected during March and April. Owing to examinations and other factors, the traffic doesn’t go up at all during these months,” an official said. The officials said that with the rising number of COVID-19 cases and with States such as Karnataka and Maharashtra clamping restrictions, not many want to take up travel at this point in time. “Though there is no surge, there has been no great drop in the traffic now. We feel this will continue for some time till the COVID-19 situation improves,” another official said. No cap Last year, the State government issued restrictions on the number of flights that could be operated at the Chennai airport, and that was increased from time to time. A few months ago, the restriction was lifted and the AAI was allowed to operate any number of flights as earlier. “Even then, we can’t increase the number of flights because there is not much demand. When airlines seek an increase, we will not hold back and will allow them to operate,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/commercial-passenger-air-traffic-remains-stagnant/article34268452.ece
08 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC aghast at move on arrear exams||The Madras High Court on Wednesday termed as “completely unacceptable” a decision taken by the State government in August last year to cancel the arrear examinations of all arts and science, engineering and MCA students, except those pursuing final year or final semester of their course, by citing the spread of COVID-19 and letting them clear the arrear papers solely on the basis of internal assessment and their past performance. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy also held that though the State government had claimed that the decision was taken as per University Grants Commission (UGC) norms, the Commission had come on record before the court to state that its guidelines do not authorise the decision taken by the government to permit the students to clear arrear examinations by just paying the requisite exam fees. “It is inconceivable that a whole mass of students will be certified to have qualified in a system without having basic knowledge in respect of key aspects thereof. What appears to have been done by the State was to treat all those who wanted to re-write their exams as deemed to have passed without conducting any form of test or evaluation. The UGC guidelines did not provide for such a scenario nor it is acceptable to the court,” the judges wrote in their interim order. When Advocate-General Vijay Narayan contended that the evaluation system adopted to award marks for the arrears was actually in accordance with UGC guidelines, the judges ordered that details regarding the methodology adopted by each university in the State, the number of students who had applied for clearing arrear examinations and the number of students who had been declared pass must be submitted in court by April 15. The judges adjourned a couple of cases, filed against the government’s decision, by a week. Seeks suggestions In the meantime, the court directed the State government and the UGC to put their heads together and come up with suggestions on any ameliorative measures that can be taken by way of an examination or some other method. Earlier, the A-G, assisted by Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan, informed the court that though the government order issued in August 2020 applied to engineering courses too, it was not implemented for those courses because Anna University refused to implement it. The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), too, was not in favour of cancelling the conduct of arrear examinations. Therefore, the G.O. was implemented only with respect to arts and science colleges in the State, he informed the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-aghast-at-move-on-arrear-exams/article34268442.ece
08 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Charges of model code violation incorrect: Udhayanidhi||DMK youth wing secretary and star campaigner Udhayanidhi Stalin on Wednesday denied the charge made out in the show-cause notice served on him by the Election Commission of India that he had violated the model code of conduct during the campaign. He was accused of claiming in a campaign speech that former Union Ministers Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley had died, unable to cope with the pressure and torture from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In his response to Malay Mallick, Secretary of the Election Commission of India, Mr. Udhayanidhi said the charges were false and incorrect and the notice had not taken into account the entire speech, but referred only to two lines. “The tenor and intention of the entire speech must be appreciated to decide in what context the extracted two lines were uttered and what were meant to be conveyed,” he said. He requested the Election Commission of India for the transcript of the entire speech so that he could furnish it with a full and proper reply. The leader also wanted a copy of the BJP’s complaint, based on which the notice was issued. Mr. Udhayanidhi said his speech was an answer to Mr. Modi’s criticism during his campaign at Dharapuram that he (Mr. Udhayanidhi) had reached the high office through a short cut. “I said Mr. Modi became the Prime Minister through a short cut, overlooking other senior leaders, while he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. I said I had the list of senior leaders who were sidelined by him. I gave the names of L.K. Advani, Yaswant Sinha, late Sushma Swaraj and late Arun Jaitley. The words ‘pressure’ and ‘torture’ were not used by me in the context as sought to be projected in the notice.” Reiterating that those two words could not be read in isolation, he said the entire speech was made in Tamil, and the meaning of the two words in Tamil was different from that of the words used in the notice. “The [Tamil] word azhutham was used by me to mean that the senior leaders were not allowed to rise to the position of the leader of the party or prime ministerial candidate and the word thollai was used to mean the mental pressure exerted on them so as not to allow them to rise to the position of Prime Minister,” he said. Mr. Udhayanidhi said the entire speech was meant to answer the criticism against him and nothing more. “The notice does not establish that I have spoken about anyone’s personal life.” Reiterating that he held Mr. Modi, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley in high esteem, the DMK leader said he respected the two late leaders as they had helped Tamils stranded in foreign countries reach India. “Accept this interim explanation and permit me to give a detailed reply after I receive the the transcript of the full speech and the copy of the complaint,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/charges-of-model-code-violation-incorrect-udhayanidhi/article34268440.ece
08 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Increase workforce for COVID-19 duty’||Noting that the existing workforce was exhausted, overworked and overexposed to the COVID-19 infection, the Service Doctors and Post Graduates Association (SDPGA) has urged the Health Department to increase the workforce of doctors and healthcare workers proportionate to the rise in the number of COVID-19 patients. In a memorandum to the Health Secretary, association president P. Saminathan requested that an adequate quarantine period as in 2020 be provided for healthcare providers — five days of COVID-19 duty followed by one week of quarantine, COVID-19 testing and return to work based on the results. Proper accommodation and food should be provided to those on COVID-19 duty and quarantine as done last year. This was because doctors on COVID-19 duty residing in hostels could become a source of cross-transmission among doctors, and if they resided at homes, they could become a risk to their family members, the association said. The association sought exemption for doctors with co-morbidities from COVID-19 duties. The association demanded that the announcements made by the government last year — one month special pay, Rs. 2 lakh ex gratia for doctors and healthcare workers who tested positive for COVID-19 and Rs. 50 lakh for the families of doctors and healthcare workers who died of COVID-19 — be fulfilled immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/increase-workforce-for-covid-19-duty/article34268462.ece

The additional special court for trial of cases related to MPs and MLAs also directed them to a pay a fine running into crores of rupees. Mr. Sarathkumar, Ms. Radhikaa and Listin Stephen are the partners of Magic Frames company, which had borrowed Rs. 1.5 crore from Radiance Media Private Ltd, a film financing company, in 2014. They had issued two cheques to repay the loan. Apart from this, Mr. Sarathkumar had also borrowed Rs. 50 lakh and issued five cheques. However, since all the cheques issued to the firm were dishonoured, Radiance Media filed a petition before the fast track court, Saidapet. Proceedings quashed Though the actors approached the Madras High Court seeking respite in May 2019, the court declined to quash the criminal proceedings. Besides, the fast track court in Saidapet was also directed to complete the trial within six months. Meanwhile, the case was transferred to the Special Court for MP/MLAs in Chennai. On Wednesday, when the case came up for hearing, Judge N Alicia sentenced the three to rigorous imprisonment for a year and imposed the fine.

08 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Use of plastic gloves worries activists||Consumer activists have questioned the rationale behind the use of tonnes of extremely thin plastic gloves during the April 6 voting for the Assembly election. They said that though the use of plastics less than 50 micron for medical purposes is not banned, this is still an abuse of the ban on plastics implemented in the State. “It took us a year to come even close to bringing some discipline. The government forced some 140 units making single-use plastic bags to close down. They made people buy cloth bags and use them. Big shops, too, converted after much persuasion. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, all that went down the drain. And the election happened and all that the government could think of was single-use plastic gloves. They could have provided us with sticks or something wooden. After all, the number [of voters] is really huge — six crore,” said consumer activist T. Sadagopan. S. Saroja, of the Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group, said that though the Election Commission of India was concerned about public safety, it could have thought it out better. “They checked temperature and provided sanitisers when voters entered the booths. Similarly, they could have given sanitisers when voters finished voting. The collected stuff is either going to be sent to the landfill or incinerated, both of which are not environment- friendly.” Sources in the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board said there is no ban on single-use plastics for medical purposes but their proper disposal is the responsibility of the local bodies. Despite several attempts, this reporter could not reach official sources in the Greater Chennai Corporation or in the ECI. However, officials in different local bodies said the ECI had provided yellow-coloured bags for the gloves to be packed and disposed of through incineration. “We did the same for the PPE kits used when COVID-19 patients came,” said an official. V.G. Sivaramakrishnan, of Iyyapanthangal, was among the voters who was worried about plastic gloves strewn about at many booths. “In many places, people carried the gloves and threw them on the road after using them. I saw people doing that. In our household, we use as few plastics as possible. Seeing the way plastic gloves were treated yesterday [on Tuesday], I felt all our efforts to change the system at home has been a waste,” he said. A former official of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board felt that the Board should have ensured that all the waste was properly incinerated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/use-of-plastic-gloves-worries-activists/article34268447.ece

08 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||They cast votes, proclaim gender identity||The number of votes cast by people from the third gender category has seen an increase in this Assembly election when compared to their electoral participation in the 2016 election in the 10 constituencies in the district. Though the number of third gender electorate doubled from 207 in 2016 to 428 in 2021, the substantial increase has not reflected in the polling process. While 34 votes were cast by the third gender category in the 2016 Assembly election, the figure bettered and stood at 103, this time. Though Kavundampalayam constituency has the highest number of third gender electorate, 96 voters, the highest number of votes (40) from the category were cast in Thondamuthur constituency on Tuesday. A significant aspect this time was that third gender voters have cast votes in all the 10 constituencies in the district. In the 2016 assembly election, Coimbatore North, Thondamuthur, Singanallur and Kinathukadavu constituencies did not have a single vote from third gender category. “I feel proud to have cast my vote as a person from the third gender category. It is a special feeling to have exercised my franchise by proclaiming my gender identity,” said K.S. Sulochana, a transwoman from Thodamuthur. B. Rathi, president of Coimbatore District Transgenders Association, said that the participation of third gender voters in the electoral process attests their rights in the society, on a par with males and females. “We are also concerned about electing the next leaders of the State. Our dream is to witness transgender candidates contesting in the coming elections,” said Rathi. According to Rathi, the association has around 1,500 transgenders as its members and it was taking efforts to get all the persons enrolled in the voters’ list.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/they-cast-votes-proclaim-gender-identity/article34268486.ece
08 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||EVMs, control units reach counting centre||After polling ended at 7 p.m. Tuesday, 6,885 electronic voting machines, 5,316 control units and 5,894 voter verifiable paper audit trail machines from the 4,427 polling booths reached the constituency-wise strong rooms established at the counting centre in Government College of Technology. Sources said while machines from polling booths within the city were taken first to the strong rooms, those from the city’s periphery followed and the ones to reach the strong rooms last were those from Valparai. There, the presiding officers handed over the machines to the officers in-charge of the strong rooms and left after completing the paper work. And, the entire process ended by around 8 a.m. Wednesday. Thereafter, security personnel took over the security of the strongrooms and the counting centre, where the machines would remain till May 2, the counting day. This time, given the increase in number of booths and electronic voting machines, the administration chose to store them on racks. Aside from the security personnel, the sources said agents of contestants were also at the Government College of Technology, where they would remain till the counting date. Kamal Haasan, Makkal Needhi Maiam candidate for Coimbatore South Assembly constituency visited the counting centre to have a look at the arrangements made. While exiting the premises, Mr. Haasan reportedly tried to assault a journalist, who tried to capture him leaving the place on his mobile phone. In the process, the phone reportedly fell on the ground. DMK candidate for Singanallur N. Karthik and BJP candidate for Coimbatore South Vanathi Srinivasan have condemned the incident and said it was unfortunate. A three-tier security has been arranged for the strong room. According to the police, more than 300 personnel from the local police, Tamil Nadu Special Police, Armed Reserve and Central armed paramilitary forces have been deployed at the place. In addition, a mini control room has been set up at GCT. A total of 137 surveillance cameras have also been installed for the security cover. City Police Commissioner S. Davidson Devasirvatham and District (Rural) Superintendent of Police S. Selvanagarathinam visited the place and reviewed the arrangements. In Tiruppur, EVMs and the voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines were transported from the 3,343 polling stations in eight Assembly constituencies to the counting centre. A press release said that the EVMs comprising control units and ballot units along with the VVPATs were stored in eight different strong rooms (one for each Assembly constituency) at the counting centre in L.R.G Government Arts College for Women on Palladam Road, following which the rooms were sealed. The process was done in the presence of District Election Officer and Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan, General Observers Ravi Shankar Prasath (Dharapuram (Reserved) and Kangeyam), Chandra Prakash Verma (Avinashi (Reserved)), Umanandha Doley (Tiruppur North), Mashir Alam (Tiruppur South and Palladam) and Kapil Meena (Udumalpet and Madathukulam) and representatives from recognised political parties. Three-tier security comprising around 250 paramilitary personnel from Border Security Force, nearly 100 personnel from Tamil Nadu Special Police and 175 personnel from Tiruppur City Police will be deployed at the counting centre, police sources said. Around 200 CCTV cameras and four watchtowers were set up within the premises of the counting centre, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/evms-control-units-reach-counting-centre/article34268493.ece
08 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||New financial year brings uncertainties to industries||With the commencement of a new financial year, industries in Coimbatore and Tiruppur stare at uncertainty as COVID-19 cases are spiking again and raw material prices remain uncontrolled. P. Nallathambi, president of Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association, said that the industries were yet to feel the impact of the rising COVID-19 cases. There is no report of many cases in industries in Coimbatore. However, raw material prices continue to be on the rise. Even public sector undertakings are increasing the prices. Though the units have orders they are unable to commit on pricing. Government has to step in and take measures to control the raw material prices, he said. According to J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, the micro units were yet to revive from the COVID-19 lockdown last financial year. “There is a hike in raw material prices even today,” he said. If this trend continues, the industries will be affected this year too. There is a hike in COVID-19 cases and the industries are willing to take all precautionary measures. But, there should not be another lockdown. It will cripple industrial activity, he said. Raja M. Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters’ Association, said since the time of reopening of industries last year following lockdown relaxations, the units have taken several precautionary measures and there was no major incidence of COVID-19 cases. However, recently, one unit reported a number of cases. “The protocols are in place and we continue to create awareness.” In Europe, there is an extension of lockdown. So there are uncertainties in the new year, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-financial-year-brings-uncertainties-to-industries/article34268479.ece

08 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Pollachi tops polling in district||Of the 10 Assembly constituencies in the district, Pollachi has stood out in terms of polling percentage. In Tuesday’s polling, 77.28% voters had voted, which is nearly two percentile points more than the second highest constituency, Sulur, where 75.49% voters had voted. In numbers, the Pollachi figure translates to 1,75,465 of the 2,27,049 voters having exercised their franchise. And, as in the other nine constituencies in the district, more men had voted in Pollachi. Sources in the AIADMK and DMK said the high polling percentage reflected the people’s anger on the politicisation of the infamous sexual assault case that came to be known as the Pollachi case. The sources in both the parties said the surge in polling percentage in Pollachi would favour them and work against the other. But, voters in Pollachi had shown a high voting percentage even in the last Assembly election, much before the crime came to light. In 2016, 77.31% voters in Pollachi had voted and the next Assembly constituency that reported a high polling percentage was Sulur again at 75.22. The 2019 Lok Sabha election was no different. Though Pollachi was an Assembly segment in the Pollachi Lok Sabha constituency, the voters there had shown increased participation in the voting exercise as 75.90% voting was recorded. This showed that irrespective of whether it was an Assembly or a Lok Sabha election, voters in Pollachi went out to vote and in good numbers at that. This was unlike a few Assembly constituencies like Thondamuthur where the polling percentage in Assembly poll was higher than Parliamentary election. Sources in the town said this had to do with not just increased political awareness among the voters, it also had to do with the local units of political parties joining hands to raise above partisanship to take up common cause. The upgrade of the Government Hospital, Pollachi, being a case in point. Explaining the political awareness part of the argument, the sources said though Pollachi Assembly constituency was rural compared to a few other constituencies in the district, the voters there were educated and were economically well-off as well, what with the town being the centre of coir and other agriculture-based industries. Therefore, it should not be surprising that voters in Pollachi voted in good numbers. As for the voting percentage in the 10 constituencies in the district, Coimbatore North, Coimbatore South and Pollachi showed a marginal dip in votes polled in 2021 election on Tuesday vis-à-vis 2016 Election. Coimbatore North showed 59.08% voters as having polled as against 61.72 in 2016. Likewise, in Coimbatore South 60.72% voters voted on Tuesday as against 61.91% voters in 2016. And, in Pollachi, 77.28% voters voted as against 77.31 voters in 2016. In the other constituencies, the polling percentage was higher as was the district average.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pollachi-tops-polling-in-district/article34268483.ece
08 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Industries urged to vaccinate all workers aged above 45||The State government has urged all industries to ensure that workers and staff aged 45 and above are vaccinated in the next two to three weeks, to control the spread of COVID-19. Senior officials of Industries and MSME Departments had a meeting with industry associations on Wednesday. According to Coimbatore District Small Industries’ Association president M.V. Ramesh Babu, and Southern India Mills’ Association secretary general K. Selvaraju, who took part in the meeting, the government has said that if an industry had more than 100 workers, vaccination camps could be organised on the industry premises. If larger units have in-house medical centres, these can be used as vaccination hubs so that nearby industries also benefit. Industries can also tie-up with private hospitals and get the workers and staff aged 45 and above vaccinated, added Mr. Selvaraju. The officials advised the industries to be proactive and take necessary precautionary measures. With the number of COVID-19 cases spiking every day, “the government has asked industries to comply strictly with all standard operating procedures, to ensure workers wear masks, use sanitisers, and ensure physical distancing,” he said It has also asked the industries to test and quarantine new workers and those coming from other States before they joined work. “The officials said that there would be random inspections and if a unit was found violating the standard operation procedures, they would take action,” Mr. Ramesh Babu said. They also clarified that there were no plans for a lockdown and indicated that there would be more restrictions if the cases go up, he said. The associations have also been asked to improve awareness among all the units, staff and workers about the precautionary measures to be taken. “We are considering the possibility of organising mass vaccination camps at the Codissia Trade Fair Complex,” Mr. Ramesh Babu added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccinate-all-workers-aged-above-45-industries-urged/article34268469.ece

08 April 2021||DHARMAPURI/KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||Stigma blamed as COVID-19 patients keep off voting||Blame it on the stigma attached to the pandemic, but not a single COVID infected person came forward to cast their vote for the five Assembly constituencies here on Tuesday, for the fear of being seen in a PPE. COVID infected persons in Dharmapuri also did not cast their right to vote for the fear of stigma of being seen in a PPE. While the disabled, and the very aged struggled their way to the polling stations to exercise their franchise, COVID patients quarantined in their homes failed to turn up at the polling stations, even as they had expressed their interest to vote. Many patients had expressed their desire to vote and had reached out to the 108 ambulance service to be picked up at the designated hour. However, they backed out at the 11th hour upon being informed that they had to wear their PPEs, says Raman Kani, District Manager, 108 GMR ambulance services. If the home quarantined were recovering from COVID infection, their desire to vote in an election that came once in five years was trumped by perceived shame and stigma attached to the PPE and the fear of being seen in one in their neighbourhood. For instance, in Harur, there were initially 11 COVID patients in home quarantine, who had expressed interest to vote. Later it scaled down to one person, who was supposed to be picked up at 5.30 p.m to be taken to a nearby booth at the allocated time of 6 p.m to 7 p.m for COVID infected voters. However, the patient refused at the last minute. All polling stations were prepared to accommodate to polling of COVID patients between 6 p.m and 7 p.m and the polling staff were also clad in PPEs at the appointed hour. “Infact, our ambulances were equipped with PPEs and our drivers were ready to pick up those interested from their homes at the appointed time. But then, they refused once they were told that they would have to wear the PPEs, which we were ready to provide,” said Mr. Raman Kani. “For instance in Krishnagiri, we were told unofficially that there may be some 200 people interested. Then, 11 persons contacted from Krishnagiri and Hosur to be taken to the polling station. But only three persons in Hosur finally cast their votes, while seven others in Krishnagiri and Kaveripattinam refused our services,” says Mr.Kani. Semi-urban areas The response has been different in a semi-urban Hosur, while in the rest of the rural pockets of Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri, COVID infected would rather forfeit their right to vote than to wear a PPE.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stigma-blamed-as-covid-19-patients-keep-off-voting/article34268589.ece

A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi passed the order on a public interest litigation petition filed by Madurai-based activist A. Veronica Mary. The petitioner said that such a system would significantly reduce the number of deaths. She said her mother, who suffered from respiratory problems, died following a delay in treatment in Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai. Therefore, the system followed in Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Chennai, should be implemented in other hospitals. The petitioner said RGGGH, Chennai, set up a ‘zero delay admission system’ during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure rapid emergency care. As a result, the number of deaths came down. The State must ensure that quality medical care was provided to all, especially the poor. She also sought a direction to the State to begin work for a pediatric care ward at GRH, Madurai. The case was disposed of with the direction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-tells-state-to-consider-activists-plea-for-zero-delay-admission-system/article34268576.ece

Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi, however, made it clear that it was a matter of policy decision. It sought a response on the plea and adjourned the plea filed by A.

Of an estimated 10.04 lakh registered voters, 8,20,323 exercised their franchise as polling closed at 7 p.m. at the 1,558 polling stations on Tuesday. The highest turnout of 90.95% was recorded in Yanam, while the lowest of 72.68% was registered in Raj Bhavan, where an interesting match-up had the AINRC’s K. Lakshminarayanan up against former Minister S.P. Sivakumar of the DMK. Both are seeking a fifth win from the constituency. Apart from Yanam, Karaikal recorded a turnout of 80.07% and Mahe 73.54%. In the 23 constituencies falling under the Puducherry region, voters clocked 81.99% turnout. The turnout in the five reserved constituencies was as follows: Oussudu 88.46%, Thirubhuvanai 86.55%, Nettapakkam 85.77%, Embalam 87.37% and Nedungadu 82.94%. Polling was relatively low in the two constituencies where former Chief Ministers V. Narayanasamy of the Congress (who is not contesting) and N. Rangasamy of the AINRC cast their votes. Throughout the campaign, the two leaders had more or less been the faces of the rival alliances of the Congress-led front (DMK-Left-VCK) and the NDA (AINRC-BJP-AIADMK, with support from the PMK). Mr. Narayanasamy, along with his daughter, voted at the Government Girls French High School, falling under the Raj Bhavan constituency, while N. Rangasamy cast his vote at the Government Middle School, falling in his base constituency of Thattanchavady, which recorded 75.09% turnout. Mr. Rangasamy is also contesting from Yanam. Confident of a win Speaking to reporters after casting his vote, Mr. Narayanasamy said he was confident of the Congress-led alliance coming to power as the people of the Union Territory would not give space to communal parties. Despite the BJP’s use of money power, the saffron party would not be able to come to power, he said. Mr. Rangasamy, too, exuded confidence of an NDA win. The enthusiastic voting across several constituencies was a sign of a desire for change, and the NDA would romp to power, he told reporters. Some of the highest polling was reported in constituencies like Mannadipet (87.78%), where former Minister A. Namassivayam of the BJP is pitted against the DMK’s A.K. Kumar; Bahour (87.9%), featuring a tough fight between the DMK’s Senthil Kumar and the AINRC’s N. Dhanavelou; and Mangalam (86.28%), where the AINRC’s C. Djeacoumar is taking on the DMK’s Sun. Kumaravel. Though the turnout may be a few percentage points lower than in the elections of 2016 and 2011, it is still remarkable, given the second surge of the COVID-19 pandemic and the near-heat wave conditions, election officials said. In empirical terms, the voter participation figures are higher as they exclude the postal ballots, a system of voting that the Elections Department adopted in a much bigger way this year. “Any 80-plus percent turnout is certainly not a let-down, given the pandemic situation,” Chief Electoral Officer Shurbir Singh told The Hindu . The turnout reflected the “enthusiastic and fearless” participation of stakeholders, especially the voters and even more so, Persons with Disability and senior citizens, in the election process in compliance with COVID-19 safety norms, he said.  The highest turnout of 90.95% was recorded in Yanam, while the lowest of 72.68% was registered in Raj Bhavan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/revised-figures-put-ut-voter-turnout-at-8169/article34268843.ece

08 April 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Palayamkottai plays spoilsport||Once again, the highly literate Palayamkottai Assembly constituency, housing large number of middle, upper middle and upper class families with members drawing bulky salary from the government and private sector undertakings, failed to cast their votes and brought down the district’s poll percentage. The Tirunelveli district recorded an overall poll percentage of 66.54 in the Assembly polls held on Tuesday. While the affluent Palayamkottai Assembly segment registered a poll percentage of just 57.76, the rural segment of Ambasamudram recorded a decent percentage of 72.05, the highest among all five Assembly constituencies of Tirunelveli district. Other Assembly constituencies – Tirunelveli (66.90%), Nanguneri (68.60%) and Radhapuram (67.94%) – recorded a relatively decent poll percentage though not an impressive one. Despite the ‘cent per cent polling awareness programmes’ organised by the district administration in a sustained manner and the residents of the Palayamkottai Assembly constituency have once again earned the dubious distinction of being the segment with pitiable voter turnout.  After registering a not-so-impressive poll percentage of 68.71% in 2011 Assembly polls, Palayamkottai’s figure fell sharply to just 59.90% in the 2014 Parliamentary elections. And, the poll percentage stood at 60% in the 2016 Assembly polls. The poll percentage, the constituency has recorded in the April 6 Assembly poll is the lowest in a decade as it has registered only 57.76%. “Poll percentage in affluent areas like Maharaja Nagar, Perumalpuram, NGO Colony, Rahmath Nagar etc. is much lesser than the voter turnout in areas like Manakaavlanpillai Nagar, Samadhanapuram, Shanthi Nagar, Market areas etc. So, it is evident that it is the literate and affluent group that exerts pressure on the government always for their comfort and better amenities but fail to cast their votes,” says Mahesh, a builder from Palayamkottai.  In Tenkasi, all the five constituencies with rural background have registered relatively good voter turn-out to take the district poll percentage to a decent 72.58. Interestingly, all the five segments have recorded 70-plus percentage voter turn-out though these constituencies house a major chunk of farmhands and beedi rollers. Alangulam, having farm labourers and beedi rollers as its electorate, has recorded a poll percentage of 77.40, which is 7.28% lesser than the previous Assembly polls held in 2016 wherein this segment recorded an enviable poll percentage of 84.68.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palayamkottai-plays-spoilsport/article34268895.ece

08 April 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Distraint proceedings suspended||Following the failure to release the court-ordered compensation for land acquisition to the family of a former MLA even after a delay of three years, court officials on Wednesday initiated distraint proceedings to attach movable property in the office of the District Collector here. However, following assurances by officials to the court authorities that the amount would be settled by June 2, the distraint proceedings were temporarily stopped. M. Sivanandam, son of former DMK MLA from Villupuram M. Shanmugam, and one of the landowners, said that 6.75 acres of land was acquired by the Revenue Department and handed over to the Tamil Nadu Housing Board in 1991. According to Mr. Sivanandam, the family was paid paltry compensation, contesting which they approached the court in 2007. Following years of litigation, a local court in Villupuram awarded compensation of Rs. 39.36 crore to the family in 2018. Subsequently, Mr. Sivanandam filed an Execution Petition, after officials failed to pay even after three years. Armed with an order to initiate distraint proceedings, Mr. Sivanandam, along with court officials, on Wednesday came to the Collector’s office to seize the movable property. Senior officials convinced the court authorities not to go ahead and assured to settle the amount by June 2, following which the proceedings were suspended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/distraint-proceedings-suspended/article34268845.ece
08 April 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||73.74% voter turn out in Virudhunagar district||With the final tally of 73.74% that is 16.81 lakh voters turning up at the polling booths in seven Assembly constituencies, the polling percentage has dipped by 1.62% when compared to 2016 Assembly election. While Tiruchuli registered the highest turn out of 77.46%, the lowest poll percentage was reported in Sivakasi AC – 70.16%. The polling percentage in other constituencies are: Rajapalayam (73.89%), Srivilliputtur (73.14%), Sattur (75.17%), Virudhunagar (71.27%), Aruppukottai (75.60%). Among the seven Assembly constituencies Sivakasi has seen the biggest decline in voter turnout with 3.75% lesser voters coming to the polling booths on Tuesday. Even Tiruchuli AC that recorded the highest poll percentage has seen a fall of 3.29%. An official attributed the decline in the voter turn out to fear of second wave of COVID-19 and also the sizzling temperature. “Unusually, the crowd coming to the booth thins in the afternoon and it usually peaks after 3 p.m.,” a senior official said. However, some local people complained that failure of distribution of voter’s slip also led to the low voter turn out. “Despite repeated reminders to the officials, including the Poll Observer about non-distribution of voter’s slip, there was slackness in its distribution,” an elderly resident of Virudhunagar town said. The crowding of voters in front of the Booth-Level Officers to get the voter’s slip at many of the polling stations across the district was an evidence to non-distribution. The need for voter’s slip was felt more in the backdrop of Election Commission creating over 400 booths in the district in view of pandemic situation.  Theni Theni district poll percentage stood at 72.60. Bodinayakkanur polled 76.30 %, the highest among the four Assembly Constituencies in Theni district and Cumbum polled the lowest with 69.51 %.The district has four Assembly Constituencies including Andipatti (74.90) and Periakulam (69.94) respectively.

Krishnanunni said and added that surveillance cameras and round-the-clock security would be in place as per the Election Commission of India guidelines.

Raghu Ganesh, accused in the Sattankulam custodial death case of trader P. Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks, has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking to set aside an order passed by the trial court. In his criminal revision petition, Raghu Ganesh said the trial in the case was pending before the First Additional Sessions Court in Madurai. He had filed a transfer petition before the Supreme Court contending that intervention and monitoring of the case by the Madras High Court would not be in the interest of a free and fair trial. The petition was admitted by the Supreme Court and notice was ordered. Meanwhile, the trial court went ahead with the proceedings as there no stay was granted. The trial court was in a hurry to complete the trial in the case. Being a public servant, he registered an FIR against the father and son for violating COVID-19 guidelines. He said he was performing his lawful duty and was, hence, protected under Section 197 of the CrPC (Prosecution of Judges and Public Servants). Therefore, he filed a petition for discharging him for not obtaining prior sanction from the government for prosecuting him. The petitioner said he also filed a petition as certain copies were not given to him in the case. But, without affording an opportunity to him both petitions were dismissed by the trial court. Therefore he sought the setting aside of the trial court’s order. Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup directed the CBI to respond to the petition filed by the suspended police officer. The judge said the response had to be filed at the earliest and adjourned the hearing in the case by two weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/suspended-police-officer-moves-hc-challenging-trial-court-order/article34268578.ece

The Belagavi bus stand was deserted since Wednesday morning. Only a few NWKRTC staff and policemen were seen. Some drivers and conductors were deputed to the few buses that operated between Belagavi and Hubballi-Dharwad. Deputy Commissioner of Police Yashoda Vantagodi and other officers visited the bus bay outside the bus stand from where private buses were allowed to operate to various taluks and districts. Shivappa Bhoj, a trader from Chikkodi who had come to purchase food items from a wholesale dealer in Belagavi,, said that he was struck in the city since Tuesday. “I will stay for another day and go back by taxi on Thursday,” he said. Ananth Kumar Pawar, an Army soldier, was stranded in Belagavi. “I have taken a month’s leave to go to Kalaburagi. I took a bus from Nashik to Belagavi, to go to Kalaburagi, but I am unable to go anywhere,” he said. He said that he would wait till evening and try to find a connecting train. CM issues warning Earlier, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa warned that strict action will be taken against the striking employees of the State transport undertakings if they did not resume work in the next day or two. “I have appealed to them to come to the negotiating table. I am ready to talk to anyone, anywhere, at any time. But they have rejected our offer. Their strike is only adding to the misery of the common man,” he said. He spoke to journalists before leaving for Ramdurg for election campaigning for BJP nominee for the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat bypolls Mangala Angadi. “We have agreed to eight of the nine demands of the employees. But they are adamantly holding on to the one demand that they be considered as government employees and be given pay commission scales. This is not possible as we are suffering from severe financial constraint. We have told them several times. Despite knowing our conditions, they are acting strange. I will make an offer of talks again. I urge them to stop the protest and come to us for negotiations. If not, we will be forced to take action. Strict action will be taken if they don’t return to work in the next day or two, he said. He reiterated that Ms. Angadi would be elected by a margin of 2.5 lakh votes. “I am meeting leaders of various communities. They have all pledged support to our candidate,” the Chief Minister said.  Govt. blamed Meanwhile, responding to the strike, Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah blamed the government for not addressing the issues of the agitating employees. “The transport employees had resorted to a strike three months ago and they re-launched their agitation today. The government had agreed to fulfil their demands but did not keep its words. That is why they are forced to go on strike. The government should address the demands,” he said, speaking to media representatives in Basavakalyan, Bidar district, on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yediyurappa-warns-state-transport-staff/article34268605.ece
08 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Farm laws are intended to help farmers: CM||“I never thought the Congress will field a candidate against Mangala Angadi whose husband late Suresh Angadi has done so much for the State,” Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said in Murgod village in Belagavi district on Wednesday. He was campaigning for the BJP candidate for the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat bypoll [Mangala Angadi] that was necessitated by the death of Suresh Angadi. “The Congress should not have entered the fray here out of respect for Suresh Angadi. But they did not do so. However, they are sure to lose,” he said. “Suresh Angadi has created a revolution of sorts in the Railway department, not only in the State, but also outside,” he said. He said that the Congress was involved in a misinformation campaign against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government led by him. “The farm laws passed by the NDA government are intended to help farmers. But the Opposition is misleading them,” he said. “The Congress is a sinking ship. Its leaders have no other work but to blame us,’’ he added. “Mangala Angadi was reluctant to fight the bypolls. We convinced her that she has to represent the seat that was vacated by her husband and continue his good work,” the Chief Minister later told journalists in Murgod. He said that he had intervened to resolve the differences between BJP leaders in Bailhongal. The former MLAs Jagadish Metgud and Vishwanath Patil have now resolved to work together, he said. He did a quick tour of the district on Wednesday, addressing three rallies and holding a few meetings with party office-bearers and community leaders. In Salahalli near Ramdurg, he said that the BJP governments at the Centre and the State had taken up several development and welfare works. “In Karnataka, we are suffering from reduced revenue inflows.

08 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Private hospitals seek time to hand over 50% beds||Although the State government has directed private hospitals to reserve 50% beds for government-referred COVID-19 patients, the hospital managements say it may take a couple of weeks to begin the system as they already have other patients admitted. Members of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) said that officials had discussed bed reservation of upto 40% with them. PHANA president Prasanna H.M. said, “While we have no objection to reserving 50% as we had done last year, beds in most hospitals are now occupied by private COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients.” He further added, “We will be in a position to hand them over as and when the beds fall vacant.” More ICU beds sought This time, the government has asked hospitals to include more ICU and High Dependency Unit (HDU) beds in the 50% government quota. As of now, nearly 90% of ICU beds in most hospitals are occupied. Also most hospitals do not have separate COVID-19 ICU. Due to all these issues, it will take a couple of weeks for hospitals to hand over beds, the doctor said. Last year, a cold war had ensued between the government and private hospitals over bed allocation. While private hospitals demanded that the 50% reservation should be for both government referred and private walk-in patients, the government wanted 50% only for government-referred patients. There had been instances wherein officials shut out-patient departments of several hospitals that did not comply with the Order. Dr. Prasanna said PHANA had requested Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) and BBMP Commissioner Gaurav Gupta to ensure that such ‘ugly scenes’ did not recur this time. “We are ready to give 50% beds but allow us to hand them over in a phased manner,” he said. Pointing out another issue, the doctor said even if hospitals set aside the prescribed 50% beds in one go, there is no clarity in the Order as to how the government will compensate for the unoccupied beds. “Last time, we had demanded payment of at least 25% of the fixed cost per day towards each unoccupied bed. But that was not paid,” he said. However, Mr. Gupta said these are all logistical issues which are being addressed by the hospital bed management team. “We have told the hospitals clearly that we need the beds at the earliest failing which action will be initiated. In genuine cases where beds are 100% occupied, officials will check the veracity and take a call,” he said. The Commissioner said the BBMP had already started the process of referring patients for treatment under government quota in private referrals from Wednesday. Pending bills Most hospitals, especially in districts are yet to get their bills cleared by the government. Over 50% of the claims by private hospitals are yet to be settled, heads of various hospitals said. Referral of patients to private hospitals for treatment under government quota had been stopped from November first week. Dr. Prasanna said of the over Rs. 600 crore claims made by private hospitals, only bills to the tune of Rs. 260 crore had been cleared. Officials in Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST) said attributed the delay to detailed scrutiny of bills and alleged that some hospitals had submitted false claims.  We have told the hospitals clearly that we need the beds at the earliest, failing which action will be initiated. In genuine cases where beds are 100% occupied, officials will check the veracity and take a call.

08 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||4 electrocuted while putting up pandal||Four workers were electrocuted on Wednesday morning, and five others were severely injured while putting up a pandal for a stone-laying ceremony of a proposed residential apartment at Indalbele in Anekal on the outskirts of the city. The incident occurred between 11 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. on a four-acre plot of land. “The victims were holding an iron pole that touched a live wire,” said a senior police officer. Iron is a good conductor of electricity, and the men collapsed immediately. He added that the victims were working with Ushakiran Tent House in HSR Layout, which gave pandals and tents on rent. The contractor of the construction project had hired a pandal and other material from Ushakiran. The labourers were at the site to put up a shamiyana for the ceremony that was scheduled on Thursday. When the labourers erected iron rods for the pandal, the site supervisor told that they had set it up at the wrong location. He told them to shift it by a few feet so that it was closer to the centre of the plot. “However, instead of dismantling the rods, the labourers lifted the entire iron structure. As they did so, it came in contact with a 66/IIKV electric wire that was passing through the property. They were electrocuted,” the police officer added. The labourers were rushed to a nearby private hospital. The doctors declared four persons brought dead while five others are in the ICU. The deceased are Akash, 30, from Kalaburagi; Mahadeva, 35, from Hanur, Chamrajnagar; Vishakantha, 35, from Narasipura in Mysuru district; and Vijaya Singh, 30, from Jharkhand. “We have taken up a case under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC against the site supervisor, owner of Ushakiran Tent House, land-owner, the developer, project manager and contractor. None of the labourers had been provided safety gear,” said the police, adding that officials from the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company visited the spot and are expected to submit a report. Bescom officials said the pandal was placed right below their power cable. “We have lodged a police complaint against the developer and stalled construction,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/4-electrocuted-while-putting-up-pandal/article34268386.ece
08 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mother kills 3-year-old daughter||The police on Wednesday arrested a 26-year-old woman for allegedly killing her three-year-old daughter and dumping the body at a construction site in Annapoorneshwari Nagar. According to the police, the accused, Sudha, was angry with her daughter, Vinutha, for always taking her father’s side. She pretended her daughter was missing and joined her husband Eeranna in searching for her. When Eeranna couldn’t locate her, he filed a missing person complaint on Tuesday with the Jnanabharathi police. Sanjeev Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police (West), said that the couple along with their daughter lived in a rented house at Mallathalli. While Eeranna worked at a private firm, Sudha was part of the housekeeping staff at a granite shop and worked there from 9 a.m. to noon. She would often take her daughter to her workplace. On Tuesday, after picking up his wife and daughter from the granite store, Eeranna switched on the television to watch the news. When Sudha objected, Vinutha told her not fight with her father. Enraged, Sudha allegedly took the girl out late in the evening while Eeranna was at work and murdered her. When Eeranna returned home, the door was locked. He called his wife on her mobile phone. She informed that Vinutha went missing while she was buying snacks for them at the chaat shop. Searched with husband Worried Eeranna and Sudha, along with a friend, searched for the girl before filing a complaint with the Jnanabharathi police. On Wednesday morning, the Annapoorneshwari Nagar police found the body at the construction site. There were ligature marks on the neck. When the police questioned the parents, they realised that something was amiss in Sudha’s statement. “She said she was in a chaat shop when her daughter went missing. However, during the course of the investigation, we found that she had not visited the chaat shop. Instead, she was placed near the area of the construction site with her daughter. We have CCTV footage of them,” said a senior police officer. Sudha claimed that the child would always take her father’s side in any argument and would report on her movements to him. “She claimed that Vinutha often humiliated her and called her names. Enraged by this, she decided to kill her,” Mr. Patil said. The police are trying to ascertain if there were other reasons for the murder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mother-kills-3-year-old-daughter/article34268394.ece
08 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Notices served on senior Sanskrit scholars raise heckles||A move to recover “dues” from two elderly Sanskrit scholars of international repute has drawn ire from the academic fraternity. Many have expressed anger for not considering their body of work before notices were served by officials of the Registrar of Societies. Ninety-eight-year-old K.S. Varadacharya, a renowned scholar of Vedanta, Pracheena Nyaya, and Naveena Nyaya, and octogenarian H.V. Nagaraja Rao, an authority in Sanskrit grammar, Yoga Sutras, and poetics, are among the 11 scholars, earlier associated with the Academy of Sanskrit Research at Melkote, to have received notices to recover the honorarium that was drawn during their tenure with the academy. Sources said that five of 11 persons are already dead. The notice, a copy which is with The Hindu , has been served from the office of the Mandya District Registrar of Societies, seeking dues of Rs. 5.16 lakh from Mr. Varadacharya, who was the project leader, and Rs. 55,654 from Mr. Rao, who was an editor at the academy. Both are recipients of the President’s award for their academic contribution. Another senior scholar, A. Varadachar, has received notice for recovery of Rs. 2.82 lakh. The 11 persons worked in the academy between 1996 and 2004 when they received honorarium in the range of Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 8,000 for research work. They worked in projects that were Centrally sponsored in the fifth and sixth five-year plans. In all, the total recovery from these academicians will amount to Rs. 13.97 lakh. The District Registrar in his report has said that it was illegal for retired government employees from being re-appointed on contract basis to institutions linked to the government. While two earlier notices served in March 2009 and March 2013 had been stayed by the High Court, the latest notice comes following the final order of the court. It allowed the District Registrar to issue notice before taking adverse action against the petitioner under Section 26 of the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960. Mr. Varadacharya and Mr. Rao have retired as senior researchers from the Oriental Research Institute in Mysuru. Now students of Mr. Varadacharya have shot off a letter to the Vice-Chancellor of Karnataka Samskrit University that administers the academy, which was earlier registered under the Societies Act. They have described the notices as “great injustice and deep insult to these scholars” disregarding their body of work. During his tenure, the nonagenarian scholar translated Sribhashya into Kannada and brought out Vishisthadvaitha Kosha , a 10-volume encyclopedia. “The academy is earning from the sale of these books,” the students pointed out. In his time at the academy, Mr. Rao contributed in the development of Sanskrit software, giving outputs from the Mahabhashya of Patanjali. “The appointments were made with the permission of the managing committee that comprised four serving IAS officers. These were men of eminence, and we wanted to do serious research,” rued Prof. Lakshmi Tatachar, former director of the academy, against whom also a recovery notice for dues of Rs. 45.2 lakh has been served. “These appointments were made when youngsters were either not interested or skilled for research. There were financial constraints to give a huge salary. When you are involved in research, raw talent alone will not bring results. Of about 40 persons working, about 15 retired persons were hired on contract,” he said. University Vice-Chancellor K.E. Devanathan acknowledged the development. “This is sheer ignorance and we did not know the notice was being issued. I will take up the issue with the government authorities to treat these cases sympathetically,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/notices-served-on-senior-sanskrit-scholars-raise-heckles/article34268420.ece
08 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Nearly 7,000 cases after six months||Karnataka on Wednesday reported 6,976 new cases of COVID-19, taking the total to 10,33,560. Of these, 4,991 cases are from Bengaluru Urban alone. It was on September 22 last year when the State had reported 6,974 cases. And, Bengaluru Urban had recorded 5,012 cases on October 6, which was the highest single day spike then. With 35 deaths, the toll rose to 12,731. This is apart from 19 deaths of patients due to non-COVID-19 reasons. As many as 2,794 persons were discharged on Wednesday, taking the total number of recoveries to 9,71,556. Of the remaining 49,254 active patients, 353 are being monitored in ICUs. While the positivity rate for the day stood at 5.56%, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) touched 0.50%. Testing As many as 1,25,390 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, including 1,16,957 RT-PCR tests. With this, the total number of tests rose to 2,22,14,842.

At workplaces With the Centre allowing vaccination at workplaces that have at least 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries above 45 years of age from April 11, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said vaccine distribution to workplaces will begin soon. This will further accelerate the vaccination drive and ensure quicker and better coverage, he said. The Minister, who held a video conference on Tuesday with district officials to review the COVID-19 situation in these districts, said several large IT firms and industries had earlier requested the department to allow vaccination at their premises. “We have almost vaccinated 50 lakh beneficiaries in the State. Soon we will reach one crore, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nearly-7000-cases-after-six-months/article34268404.ece
08 April 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Pulling off a win in Maski crucial for Vijayendra||Amid speculation about political future of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who has turned 78, his camp is eagerly looking at the results of the forthcoming byelections to a Lok Sabha constituency and two Assembly constituencies, particularly the Maski Assembly segment. Focus on Maski is because the Chief Minister’s son and BJP State vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra has taken up the responsibility of managing the party’s poll preparations, including campaign, in the constituency, where the party is yet to register a victory so far. If the party manages to win the byelection in Maski, then it is going to be a “hat-trick” of sorts for Mr. Vijayendra in terms of the Assembly constituencies where the party has managed to register its maiden victory under his supervision. The BJP had earlier won K.R. Pet and Sira constituencies in south Karnataka for the first time where the party’s poll campaign had been supervised by Mr. Vijayendra. If Maski goes in favour of the BJP, supporters of  Mr. Yediyurappa are bound to pitch for a higher responsibility for Mr. Vijayendra within the party, said a strategist close to him. The earlier two victories, attributed to campaign under the leadership of Mr. Vijayendra, had underscored his potential and another win would make even his detractors accept that he is a poll strategist, he added. Mr. Vijayendra has been campaigning at Maski since April 2. Caught the attention This projection of Mr. Vijayendra as a “poll strategist” has caught the attention of both the Opposition as well as BJP old-timers. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah has questioned the sobriquet of “poll strategist” being attributed to Mr. Vijayendra. “If he is really a Chanakya, why could he not cast his spell and ensure the victory of their candidates when his father had formed the KJP?” the Congress leader asked during the poll campaign in Maski. Some BJP old guard have been pointing out that the earlier two victories under Mr. Vijayendra’s leadership were in bypolls where the government’s influence is bound to work and not in general elections. They also insist that other political reasons worked in favour of the BJP in those earlier bypolls. However, the supporters of Mr. Vijayendra counter such an argument by pointing out that the BJP managed to pull off victories in K.R. Pet and Sira despite the party not having any strong organisational network there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pulling-off-a-win-in-maski-crucial-for-vijayendra/article34268424.ece
08 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Fees: Parents turn to KSCPCR||The Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) has received around 25 complaints against private school managements who are allegedly not allowing students to sit for online examinations as their parents have not paid the fees in full for the 2020-21 academic year. Fr. Antony Sebastian, Chairperson of the Commission, said that a majority of complaints were against private schools in Bengaluru. The number, however, is not a reflection of how pervasive the problem is, as a majority of parents are wary of lodging complaints against school managements for fear of exacerbating the problem, said members of Parent Teacher Associations (PTA). “Many parents are not willing to come forward to lodge complaints against schools as they do not want their children to be reprimanded or targeted in the classroom,” said Rudresh S., who is the president of a PTA in south Bengaluru. According to Fr. Sebastian, KSCPCR has issued summons to those school managements against whom complaints have been registered to resolve the issue. “Once we call them for a hearing, parents and school managements can agree to an amicable resolution. Our aim is to ensure that students’ academics are not affected,” he said. Complaints are closed after school managements give an undertaking that they will allow students to appear for examinations. A parent, who had complained to the Commission, said that her daughter, who is in class five in a school affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, had not been allowed to appear for the online examinations that began in the last week of March. “But after we complained to the Commission, the school allowed not only my daughter to appear for the examinations, but 20 other students whose parents had not paid the entire fees,” she said. A majority of the complaints received by the Commission were from parents who had already paid 70% of the tuition fees for the 2020-21 academic year. This is not the first time that private schools have been accused of resorting to such tactics to get parents to pay up. Earlier in the year, the Commission had received complaints that schools were blocking online classes for students who had not paid the fees. While parents are happy with the Commission’s intervention, many school managements told The Hindu that they need the money to bear recurring costs. A school management member, against whom a complaint had been lodged, said, “We allowed students to appear for the examinations because we want to avoid legal hassles. Parents should understand that we are private entities and cannot sustain if they do not pay fees.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fees-parents-turn-to-kscpcr/article34268393.ece

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the interim order on a PIL petition filed by K.B. Vijayakumar, a city-based advocate. The bench passed the interim order by assessing the nature of work undertaken in land allotted to the two institutes based on photographs produced by the petitioner. The petitioner had questioned the allotment of 15 acres to IUCYS and 10 acres to CUK within the bio-park maintained by Bangalore University while contending that the condition not to disturb the botanical park was meaningless as several trees were required to be felled for construction of buildings for these two institutes. The petitioner has sought a direction to the government and the BU to allot other plots to these institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-restrains-institutes-from-felling-trees/article34268389.ece

Speaking to presspersons in Chikkamagaluru on Wednesday, Mr. Ravi said creating anarchy could be easy. But that would not be the quality of a leader. “All these days he was a farmers’ leader. Now, he has become a labour leader.” The Centre had passed three laws in favour of farmers. But, Mr. Kodihalli Chandrashekhar termed it anti-farmer laws. “These are the people who wanted opportunities for farmers to sell their produces anywhere. When the opportunity was given through a law, they are opposing it”, he said. Further, he said the transport employees should withdraw the protest and give one month’s time to the government to deliberate on their demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kodihalli-creating-anarchy-ct-ravi/article34268793.ece

Although senior NWKRTC officials made an appeal to the striking employees to return to work, it did not make any impact on them and consequently, bus stands across these districts did not see any public transport bus operating. At some places, it seemed that the public bus stands had become private vehicle stands. Multi-utility vehicles, mini passenger vehicles and mini buses lined up at these bus stands as the Regional Transport Officers issued temporary permits to operate their vehicles on specific routes. Most of the passengers postponed their travel plans in view of the strike.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/public-bus-stands-dont-see-any-services/article34268612.ece

Though the NEKRTC authorities deployed a few private vehicles at certain bus stands to minimise inconvenience caused to the public, most of the passengers had to suffer as they could not find bus services to their destinations. Passengers coming to the bus terminals and going out of them desperately searching for private vehicles outside the bus stands was a common scene across the region in the morning hours. As the day grew, almost all bus stands in the region wore deserted look. In Kalaburagi, a few private buses deployed by the NEKRTC operated on major routes, including Kalaburagi-Bidar and Kalaburagi-Ballari. In Raichur, a few bus services of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments operated as usual and passengers used them to reach Kurnool, Mantralayam, Gadwal, Mahabubnagar and other towns and cities in the neighbouring States. However, passengers whose destinations were within the district and the State had to suffer a lot as the number of private vehicles was insufficient to meet the demand. Passengers outside Raichur Bus Stand complained that the private operators were taking advantage of the strike demanding double the normal bus fares. The Ballari district administration deployed 70 private buses at major bus stands across the district and they completed over 150 trips by 4 p.m. To avoid any untoward incidents, police forces were also deployed. Ballari Divisional Controller of NEKRTC Rajagopal Puranik said that the buses operated 37 trips in Ballari, Kudtini and Kurgod. The Ballari Division of the NEKRTC ensured that private operators did not overcharge the passengers taking advantage of the situation. The officers were found helping passengers in finding buses to their destinations and with the exact ticket fare to be paid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/20000-nekrtc-employees-strike-work-in-kalyana-karnataka/article34268607.ece

08 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||KSRTC strike has little impact on life in coastal areas||The strike by State-owned road transport corporation employees had little impact on life in the coastal belt which is largely dependent on private bus services. On major routes where KSRTC buses did not operate, private operators pitched in by operating their buses. The strike affected commuters in Sullia, Puttur and parts of Belthangady taluk in Dakshina Kannada which are served by KSRTC buses. However, it did not affect people in Udupi district which is entirely dominated by private bus operators. Private buses also entered the main KSRTC bus stands in Mangaluru and Udupi to pick up passengers. As the Kerala Road Transport Corporation operated its buses as usual between Kasaragod (Kerala) and Mangaluru, inter-State commuters did not face much trouble. Meanwhile, chairing a meeting, Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said that the district administration is considering using the services of the more than 2,000 heavy vehicle driving licence holders in the district to run KSRTC buses. The district administration will get the list of educational institutions that are solely reliant on KSRTC buses and make necessary transport arrangements for their students. He said that the contract carriage buses will be allowed to pick and drop passengers mid-way till KSRTC employees end their strike. Maxi-cabs having valid insurance cover and which are fit to operate will be permitted to ferry people. “If there is a need for temporary permits for operation of maxi-cabs and some private buses, we will issue them,” he said and added that the enforcement of restrictions for these vehicles will be relaxed during the period. A grievance redressal mechanism will be put in place in Mangaluru and Puttur to address complaints such as over-charging and overloading of passengers. This grievance redressal mechanism will be operated jointly by the KSRTC and private bus owners. The WhatsApp number for lodging grievances will be announced, he said. Arrangements will be made for vaccination of drivers and other personnel operating these vehicles, he added. Dakshina Kannada District Bus Owners Association president Dilraj Alva said that private operators are operating 75 buses to Puttur and Uppinangady. As many as 10 buses are operating on the Mangaluru-Dharmasthala route, two buses each to Mysuru and Kukke Subrahmanya and one bus to Hassan. Superintendent of Police Rishikesh Bhagwan Sonawane, Mangaluru City Corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) M.A. Nataraj, Regional Transport Officer R.M. Varnekar and KSRTC Divisional Controllers from Mangaluru and Puttur divisions and others participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ksrtc-strike-has-little-impact-on-life-in-coastal-areas/article34268778.ece
08 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Do not be misguided by Kodihalli Chandrashekhar’||Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa on Wednesday appealed to employees of State road transport corporations (RTCs) not to get misguided by people like Kodihalli Chandrashekhar and urged them to withdraw the strike. Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Eshwarappa said that the employees demand to consider them as government employees cannot be accepted. There are several government corporations and boards and if RTC employees demand was accepted, it would set off a chain of such demands by others. Mr. Eshwarappa said that the government would not accept the diktat of Mr. Chandrashekhar who has instigated the employees to go on strike. The strike per se was illegal and the government knows how to handle it. The government cannot sit idle when lakhs of people have been put to great hardship by the strike and it would find alternative ways. The strike would affect the state economy, he added. On invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act against the striking employees, Mr. Eshwarappa said that the government was not in a hurry. It was watching the situation. On the other hand, the general public which was aghast over repeated strikes by the employees would retaliate, the Minister cautioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/do-not-be-misguided-by-kodihalli-chandrashekhar/article34268770.ece

08 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Strike total as buses go off the road in Mysuru||The indefinite strike by the employees of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) that began here on Wednesday was total as none of the buses operated by the two divisions (urban and rural) hit the road. Nearly 545 buses belonging to the rural division and about 450-500 buses of the urban division stayed put in the depots. Private buses and other private transport vehicles came to the rescue of passengers as they ferried them to their destinations early this morning from the KSRTC’s mofussil bus terminus. The private bus operators were authorised to operate on several routes, including Bengaluru, Madikeri and Hassan, to deal with the inconvenience caused to passengers and ease the situation though not fully. Unlike the previous strike, the Transport Department appeared to have been prepared fully to handle the situation as the Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) had talks with the private operators in advance and arranged alternative modes of transport. Besides private buses, mini-buses and tourist vehicles were also operated. However, there were no services on long-distance routes. The services of the RTCs of Kerala and Tamil Nadu on certain routes came in handy. However, the intra-city operations were badly hit with nearly 450-500 buses operated on the routes across Mysuru keeping off the road. The city bus-stand was wearing a deserted look. The local commuters picked auto-rickshaws and taxis to reach their destinations. Not all were aware of the strike as many were found waiting for buses in the early hours of Wednesday at the mofussil bus terminus. Unable to get buses, the passengers were expressing their ire at the corporation for causing hardship to the public at a time when the State was in the grip of COVID-19 crisis. Sources in the KSRTC here said employees did not report to their respective depots with all of them joining the strike unmindful of the government’s appeal to reconsider their decision in view of COVID-19 crisis. From the Mysuru rural division, nearly 5,000 trips operated daily, with over 1,000 trips to Bengaluru alone, had to be cancelled. “Services normally start daily from 4 a.m. but we could not operate even one bus as no driver and conductor reported for duty,” a senior KSRTC official said. Many police personnel had been deployed at the bus terminus to deal with any untoward incidents triggering from the strike. KSRTC Divisional Controller (Rural division) K.H. Srinivas told The Hindu that the alternative transport arrangements made by the RTOs will continue from the mofussil bus terminus. Complaint Some commuters complained of private transport operators charging twice the normal fare citing various reasons, including rising fuel prices and insurance premium. In Kodagu, Chamarajanagar and Mandya, private operators pitched in to ferry commuters with the district administrations permitting their operations on several routes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/strike-total-as-buses-go-off-the-road-in-mysuru/article34268797.ece

No single bus operated from out of the four depots, Yadgir, Gurmitkal, Shahapur and Surpur, in Yadgir district. The central bus terminus in the district headquarters which always witnesses a rush wore a deserted look. The scene was not different in central bus terminuses in Gurmitkal, Shahapur, Surpur and Hunsagi too. “Yadgir district has a total of 316 schedules every day. The daily traffic revenue is Rs. 34 lakh. On the first day of the strike, the department has suffered a loss of Rs. 34 lakh,” DTO of Yadgir Ramesh Patil said.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Commuters hit hard by protests||The KSRTC employees’ strike hit hard the public in Malnad districts – Hassan, Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru. Except for the officers and the clerical staff of the corporation, none reported for duty on Wednesday, forcing the district administration to make alternative transport arrangements with the help of private operators. The senior officers continued to convince the employees to return to duty; however their efforts hardly yielded any results. Hassan division, which operates 518 routes daily, registered over Rs. 65 lakh revenue per day in the pre-COVID-19 times. It had come down to Rs. 50 lakh a day in recent months. “None of the drivers and conductors reported for duty. They have switched off their cellphones, to avoid receiving calls. However, we are trying to reach them. I am sending officers door to door with a hope that at least a few would come for duty”, Rajesh Shetty, Divisional Controller of Hassan, told The Hindu . The division had prepared a list of 250 important routes well in advance and handed over the list to the district administration so that private vehicles could operate those routes. Many government officers and teachers who travel to taluk centres from Hassan regularly had to depend on private vehicles. Dinesh G., principal of a degree college in Hassan, said he took his personal car to travel to Mysuru as he had to take part in the paper evaluation duty on the University of Mysore campus. A woman who had travelled to Shivamogga from Hyderabad by a night bus had no bus to reach her place Thirthahalli. She had to wait till the private buses operated on the route. T.R. Naveen, Divisional Controller of Shivamogga, said none of the 318 routes was operated in the division on the day. The division with four depots would register a revenue of Rs. 35 lakh on a normal day. The officer said private buses had been allowed to operate from the KSRTC bus stands. The public had been making use of the alternative facility, he added. Two buses operated The continuous efforts to convince the staff members yielded a small result in the Chikkamagaluru division. H.T. Veeresh, Divisional Controller of Chikkkamagaluru, said the officers could operate two buses in the afternoon. “One from Belur to Halebid and another bus from Kadur to Chikkamagaluru were successfully operated. We are hopeful that other employees will also join”, he said. The officer said his division would earn revenue of Rs. 55 lakh on any day and the daily expenditure would also be the same. Padayatra Pradeep, a driver-cum-conductor attached to Arkalgud depot, began a padayatra on wWednesday from Channarayapatna to Bengaluru as part of the ongoing strike by the KSRTC employees. Pradeep told media people that he would reach the Chief Minister’s residence by walk and submit his memorandum with the demands of the employees. Prohibitory orders Chikkamagaluru Deputy Commissioner K.N. Ramesh has clamped prohibitory orders within 200 metre radius around KSRTC bus stands in the district in view of the strike. The order came into effect on Wednesday morning and will be in place till further orders, said a press communiqué from the district administration. The prohibitory orders clamped under Section 144 of the CrPC will be in place around the bus stands at Chikkamagaluru, Mudigere, Sringeri, Koppa, N.R.Pura, Tarikere, Kadur and Ajjampura. This decision was taken as there were chances of damage to public property and inconvenience being caused to the passengers, the communique said . The order prohibits people gathering, carrying lethal weapons, and taking out protest rallies in the bus stands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/commuters-hit-hard-by-protests/article34268790.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Striking staff to lose March salary?||In what is being seen as a coercive move to break the Road Transport Corporations (RTC) employees’ strike, RTCs are said to be interpreting the “no work, no pay” order issued on Tuesday as one that can be used to withhold salaries for March, and not just for the days when they go on strike. The move has come under severe criticism from employee unions who have said it is “unfair” to withhold pay for days when employees have worked. A managing director of an RTC told The Hindu that unlike in other government departments, RTCs work on a rotational revenue model, which essentially means there is no reserve for salaries, and revenue from the first week is used to pay salaries. “Our revenues have already taken a hit from April 6, which has made it difficult to pay salaries for March,” the officer said, adding as an incentive those who worked on the strike days will be paid March salary. Echoing similar sentiments, Transport Minister Laxman Savadi campaigning for bypolls in Basavakalyan, said the strike was hurting them only as the revenue losses will end up jeopardising their salaries. However, none were willing to comment on record. R. Chandrashekhar, president, KSRTC Employees’ League, termed this a strong arm tactic to break the strike. “The RTCs and the government cannot deny us pay for work we have put in. This incident exposes the working conditions in RTCs. We have been extremely frustrated by such decisions by management and officers, forcing us to strike,” he said. Other unions have also appealed to the Chief Minister to not withhold March salary. “We request you to not deny the employees their rightful pay and immediately release pay for March,” said H.V. Anantha Subbarao, president, KSRTC Staff and Workers’ Federation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/striking-staff-to-lose-march-salary/article34268416.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Child trafficking racket busted||While probing the theft of a newborn from a BBMP maternity hospital in Chamrajpete an hour after its birth in May 2020, a police team uncovered an inter-State child trafficking racket. Two women, who are allegedly part of the racket, were arrested on Monday. The accused, Devi Shanmugam from Wilson Garden and Ranjana Devidas from Hongasandra, were caught red-handed while handing over a month-old baby, Kajol, to undercover women police personnel. Sub-Inspector Srinivasa K.R. from Talaghatapura, who led the operation that busted the gang, said they had been alerted that the women were selling a baby girl. An undercover team approached Devi seeking to buy the child. Devi reportedly claimed that she could get them a child from Mumbai for a price of Rs. 3 lakh. She asked them to come to Majestic railway station with the cash on Monday. The police filled the bag with currency notes and old newspaper bundles. When they met Devi at the station, she asked them to wait for a few minutes. Soon, a couple walked towards them and handed over the baby. Srinivas and his team immediately caught the couple, Shankar Damodar Nayar and his wife Sunitha Nayar. “They hail from Airoli in Thane and work as labourers. They claimed to have three children, and Kajol was their fourth child. They were living in poverty. Ranjana approached them with an offer. She promised them money if they gave her Kajol. She promised them that the baby would be taken in by a rich couple in Bengaluru and had a bright future ahead of her,” said Srinivas. Ranjana convinced the couple and brought them to the city to hand over Kajol to Devi. Sunitha and Kajol are currently at the State Home for Women while her husband has returned to take care of their other children. “They are victims, too, and will be counselled,” said the police. Devi and Ranjana have been taken into 10 days’ custody for further investigation. “The probe revealed that the duo have been running this racket for some time and have sold many children. They also arranged for women from Mumbai as surrogate mothers. We are questioning them to ascertain the extent of this racket,” Srinivas said. The police are yet to find the newborn stolen from the hospital at Chamrajpete.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/child-trafficking-racket-busted/article34268395.ece

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Prescribe size for closed and open areas for gatherings: HC||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday said that the State government must immediately step in to modify its recent COVID-19 guidelines, which allows gathering of 200 persons in closed spaces and 500 people in open areas, by prescribing the minimum size of the closed and open areas. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar issued the directions while hearing a batch of PIL petitions related to issues that cropped up due to implementation of lockdown and unlock processes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The bench prima facie found merit in the argument made on behalf of some of the petitioners that allowing gatherings of 200 persons in closed spaces and 500 people in open areas is meaningless without specifying the minimum size of the areas in which such large gatherings can be held. It was pointed out on behalf of petitioners that allowing a gathering of 200 to 500 people in small areas could lead to quick spread of COVID-19. On allegations by the petitioners that the State government is dilly-dallying with the guidelines on account of pressure from various groups, the bench directed the government to submit the notifications in which guidelines related to cinema halls and gymnasiums were relaxed. Surprise inspection Meanwhile, the bench directed the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to conduct surprise inspection of various establishments, including residential apartment complexes, to ensure that guidelines, like prohibition of use of swimming pools and party halls, are being adhered to. As the government has re-issued the guideline for earmarking beds in private hospitals for COVID-19 patients as was done in June last year, the bench directed the government to enforce the court’s earlier directions to ensure transparency in providing information on bed availability, and display rates for treatment of COVID-19 patients in private hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/prescribe-size-for-closed-and-open-areas-for-gatherings-hc/article34268401.ece

Tyagaraju, driver with Bengaluru city depot 33, drove through the day and was even felicitated by some NGOs. “While everyone in the transport sector suffered during the lockdown, my company gave us salary without even a cut, while we sat at home. I am thankful for that and hence ready to understand the financial situation of the government and co-operate,” he told media persons. However, he soon started getting threat calls from his peers, he claimed. The C.K. Achukattu police have registered a case against one Nayak, who allegedly made a threat call. Senior BMTC bus conductor Uma, who reported to duty on Wednesday, accused Kodihalli Chandrashekar, a farmers’ leader now spearheading transport strike, of “misleading” RTC employees. “What does he know of the RTCs? The demand for the Sixth Pay Commission is a complete break from the earlier negotiations over our salary hike and this has created discontinuity on the issue. There may even be a conspiracy to pander to demands for privatisation of RTCs,” she alleged. Bus attacked While the strike was largely peaceful, a KSRTC bus coming to the city from Hosur was attacked with stones and its windshield damaged in Anekal on Wednesday. Two bike-borne men wearing helmets pelted stones and fled, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-few-who-reported-for-duty-face-pressure/article34268408.ece

At a review meeting held in Madikeri, the Deputy Commissioner Charulatha Somal directed the officials to prepare for any contigency that may arise due to floods after the arrival of the south west monsoon in June. The Deputy Commissioner said there were heavy rains in the month of August in 2018, 2019 and 2020 which caused widespread damage including landslides resulting in loss of life and property. Hence vulnerable places prone to such incidents should be identified and precautionary measures should be in place. She stressed upon the imperatives of information gathering pertaining to weather and timely dissemination to the public so that they could also be forewarned of any impending eventuality. The Agriculture Department was vested with the task of collating all information pertaining to weather and sharing it with the district administration. She said advance information pertaining to weather conditions could help prevent or minimise damage. Calling for preparations at the taluk and hobli levels Ms.Charulatha Somal and directed the local officials to conduct review meetings to assess their level of preparations to handle any exigency. A task force will also be constituted to oversee the preparations to handle any natural disasters and it will comprise all officials drawn from various departments including Revenue, NDRF, SDRF, Fire Force, Police, CESC, Forest, and PWD.

This comes close on the heels of tax breaks for April and allowing private buses to use RTC bus stand infrastructure. However, on Wednesday, neither commuters nor private operators were happy. While commuters allege they were fleeced, private operators rued that passengers were few, causing them losses. “Private operators demanded almost double the normal rates and officials allowed it,” Fakirappa Byragond, a passenger in Raichur, said. Even in Bengaluru, private buses charged more than the prescribed rate card by BMTC. “On routes that we have been assigned, there were not enough passengers for the trips to be viable. So, we asked passengers to pay Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 extra than what the BMTC prescribed,” a bus operator admitted. S. Nataraj Sharma, chairman, Karnataka State Travel Operators Association, said most passengers appear to have stayed away from travelling given the wide publicity the strike got. “Most people didn’t want to take a chance. As a result, we have more buses than passengers. In Majestic, there are 360 buses, but passengers enough only for 50 to 60 buses. There is no profit for us,” he said. Radhakrishna Holla, president, Karnataka State Travel Operators Association, said private taxis too reported a similar response. However, with the bus strike being extended indefinitely, this will change from Thursday, said transport officials, and orders have been issued exempting from the permit clause so as to mobilise more vehicles, a senior official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/private-operators-hold-sway-but-many-unhappy/article34268414.ece

Ganglani, to five years’ simple imprisonment. The CBI had registered a case on July 31, 2002 against the then chief manager of the Basavanagudi branch of Canara Bank and other private persons, including Ganglani. It was alleged that Ganglani and the others had cheated the branch in a matter of closing foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) deposits by forging applications. CBI filed a chargesheet in June 2003 against four accused. The trial court convicted Ganglani and acquitted two other accused.

He was speaking to mediapersons in Haripad on Wednesday. Condemning the murder of a Youth League activist at Koothuparamba in Kannur and attack on Congress workers at Kayamkulam and Haripad in Alappuzha and other parts of the State, Mr. Chennithala said the attacks revealed the CPI(M)'s fear and frustration of losing power. “The CPI(M) should shed the path of violence. The murder of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) activist is similar to the assassination of Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) leader T.P. Chandrasekharan. The CPI(M) leadership should initiate steps to promote peace,” he said while demanding the government to bring the culprits to book. Booth capturing Mr. Chennithala said the CPI(M) had indulged in widespread booth capturing at the Taliparamba Assembly constituency and demanded re-polling there. “CPI(M) leader M.V. Govindan had called for bogus voting. As a result, United Democratic Front (UDF) agents were not allowed inside a number of polling booths at Taliparamba on polling day.

The election process in Edamalakkudy situated inside the Munnar forest division bordering with Tamil Nadu, ends only when the polling team reaches the collectorate to hand over the EVMs (electronic voting machines) and polling materials at the strong room. A 25-member polling team came back on Wednesday afternoon. Normally, the officials on polling duty move to Edamalakkudy prior to a day to avoid night travel. The chances of wild animal attack especially during night on a stretch of 18 km from Pettimudy are high. There were four polling booths set up at Edamalakkudy with two in Societykudy, the headquarters of nearly 22 settlements. The other two were in Parappayarkudy and Mulakutharakudy. The voting in booth number 30 was 50.6%, and in 30 A was 42.8%. The voting in booth number 31 was 48.95% and in booth number 32, it was 43 %. Of the 1,817 voters, only 842 persons cast their votes. The information from each booth was collected at intervals and relayed to the Collectorate using police wireless. Though the BSNL had set up a mobile tower at Societykudy, it was not functioning and the area remained cut off from mobile connection. A former official at Edamalakkudy grama panchayat' at Devikulam said that the low polling percentage might have been due to poor election campaign by the parties.

08 April 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||All three fronts in Wayanad exude confidence||A day after the polls, leaders of the three political fronts have expressed hope of registering a resounding victory in the district. CPI(M) district secretary P. Gagarin said that the LDF was in for a historic win in the three Assembly segments in the district. The decline in the polling would benefit the Left Democratic Front (LDF) as a huge number of United Democratic Front (UDF) voters had kept away from voting owing to internal issues in the Congress, Mr. Gagarin claimed. In Sulthan Bathery segment, nearly 7,000 voters failed to cast their votes, but the number of voters in Mananthavady and Kalpetta segments was almost equal comparing with the 2016 polls, Mr. Gagarin said. UDF convener N.D. Appachan said that the poll verdict would be a befitting reply to rumours propagated by the LDF. The anti-incumbency factor against the government was reflected in the poll, Mr. Appachan said. The active participation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the poll campaign would benefit the UDF, Mr. Appachan said. A slight decline in the polling percentage would not affect the UDF as borne out by the fact that the front had won the three segments even when the voting percentage had fallen to 72% a few years ago, he said. The issues related to debt-ridden farmers, the alleged apathy of the LDF government towards the health sector, increasing man-animal conflict, and the stance of the government in fixing eco-sensitive zones around sanctuaries would also be reflected in the results, he said. BJP district president Saji Sankar said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) would reap the rewards for its hard work. The people wanted a change in the government, and it would reflect in the results, he said. According to the final tally, 74.98 % of voters had cast ballot in Wayanad district. The percentage in the Kalpetta constituency was 74.34 %, in Sulthan Bathery 74.29 % and in Mananthavady 76.43 %. In the 2016 Assembly polls, 78.01 % of voters had cast ballot in the district. The percentage in the Kalpetta constituency was 78.48 %, in Sulthan Bathery 78.32 % and in Mananthavady 77.67%. However, the total percentage of votes declined from 78.01% to 74.98 % this time, a dip of 3.03%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/all-three-fronts-in-wayanad-exude-confidence/article34268677.ece

The Taliparamba UDF candidate, P.V. Abdul Rashid, had written to the Election Commission demanding re-polling in the constituency, he said. Mr. Sudhakaran said that while there was booth capturing and violence in Taliparamba, there was widespread use of fraudulent votes in Dharmadam where the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was contesting. He said the CPI(M) had captured all the booths in Malappattam and Pariyaram panchayats in Taliparamba constituency. He accused LDF candidate M.V.

It will establish port-to-port connectivity between Kochi and Tuticorin through Munnar and Theni. As per the revised alignment, the NH will take off a kilometre south of Kundannoor Junction, to prevent congestion at the junction. The stretch will be 45 metres wide, official sources said. PWD demand The PWD (NH Wing), which readied the alignment for the 8.50-km-long Thripunithura bypass, a project which ended up as a non-starter due to land acquisition issues, inadequate fund allocation, and lack of political will, had requested the NHAI that the changed alignment of the Kochi-Munnar NH should pass through the alignment finalised for the bypass project. “The PWD had partly completed land acquisition for the first phase of the bypass, from Mattakuzhy to Thiruvankulam. The NHAI will most likely include this stretch in its upcoming NH development project. With the NHAI taking steps to speed up development of the Kundannoor-Theni NH, we have requested that its entire alignment [including areas that fell in its second phase] be merged with that of the bypass, so that the long-overdue bypass project can be realised. Members of Parliament too are in sync with this,” said a senior official of the PWD (NH Wing). The advantage is that the NHAI will not have to acquire land afresh in areas that fall within the ambit of the Thripunithura bypass project. Still, landowners whose plots fall in the second phase work of the bypass are uncertain whether the NHAI will include that portion of the alignment in the revised alignment. Part compensation R. Varghese, a landowner said the PWD had paid only part or token compensation to people whose lands were acquired under the the first phase of the project — on the 3.44-km Mattakuzhi-Thiruvankulam stretch. “Many people have not been compensated, although their lands were frozen to be acquired at a later stage,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thripunithura-bypass-finds-place-in-revised-nh-alignment/article34268686.ece

The district had then recorded a polling percentage of 79.9. The highest turnout in the district was recorded in the Kunnathunad constituency that witnessed a four-cornered contest between the LDF, UDF, NDA, and 20 Twenty. The segment saw 80.99% of voters exercise franchise. At the same time, figures indicated a drop in poll percentage, as 85.93% polling was registered in 2016.

08 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||No room for EVM manipulation: experts||Electronic voting machines (EVMs) with people’s mandate locked inside will remain sealed in strongrooms for almost a month till the votes are counted on May 2. With EVMs not always beyond reproach at least among a section of the electorate who have consistently raised doubts about their sanctity, is there scope for any kind of external manipulation exploiting the long gap between voting and counting? Experts The Hindu spoke to largely ruled out such a possibility. “EVMs are a closed hardware system with little room for external interference remotely or through wireless technology. It can be manipulated only through physical access though even in that case, it cannot be broken into without being detected thanks to its architecture. Yes, a skilled electronic engineer may still manage to manipulate it, but it needs a lot of favourable factors to coincide making it an extreme possibility,” said Rahul Sasi, an international cyber security expert. highly improbable He ruled out the possibility of manipulating EVMs taking advantage of the prevailing extreme heat conditions also as highly improbable. That, Mr. Sasi said, required the generation of high electronic magnetic pulse using mammoth equipment, which would only enable the wiping out of data from EVMs and not their manipulation. Sivahari Nandakumar, senior engineer with Keltron, said that the control unit is switched off and the battery of the VVPAT (Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail) machine is removed at the end of polling, leaving both dead devices with no room for external manipulation. They are then sealed and locked inside a box and moved to strongrooms in the presence of polling officials and election agents of candidates. “In fact, the control unit bearing data is protected by a triple seal, which could be stamped by election agents in whose presence they are unsealed on the counting day. Any kind of manipulation of EVMs requires physical access that needs extensive conspiracy involving polling officials, cops guarding strongrooms, and election agents, leaving it highly improbable,” said Mr. Nandakumar. Former civil servant and activist Kannan Gopinathan said that while he was not competent to comment on EVM vulnerability during their long storage period till counting, he reiterated the argument that the Election Commission’s claim all along that EVMs were standalone devices remained disproved with the introduction of VVPAT machines. “EVMs are connected to external devices to upload the names and symbols of candidates after randomisation, and the choice is made about the constituency and booth to which they are deployed. My apprehension about this serious lapse was officially raised with the Election Commission, and when it did not evoke any response, I was forced to go public with it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-room-for-evm-manipulation-experts/article34268667.ece
08 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||A panchayat sets a model in vaccinating its elderly||Varapuzha panchayat in Ernakulam district has set a model of sorts for the rest of the State by vaccinating for free a majority of the people aged 60 years and above against COVID-19 through a week-long mega camp. The vaccination drive on a mission mode was undertaken realising that it will take long to cover the priority group of 60-year-olds through its sole community health centre. Following a brainstorming session of all stakeholders, a plan was drawn up to conduct a mega camp across seven centres, mainly schools and parish halls, covering the targeted people spread over all 16 wards of the panchayat. “We began with fieldwork to estimate the number of persons to be vaccinated. Going by our initial estimates, we have managed to cover about 95% of the target,” said Appu Cyriac, Chief Medical Officer, Varapuzha Community Health Centre (CHS). The participation of schools also facilitated the service of teachers, NCC cadets and Scouts cadet corps not to mention the internet connectivity and laptops for spot registrations. “The camp was aimed at the aged without the faculty or facility to register online. Initially, the plan was to restrict the camp to a single centre, which was later changed taking into account the hardships of people having to return without vaccination after taking the pain to visit the centre,” said Kochurani Joseph, Varapuzha panchayat president. The centres were so arranged to make each centre accessible to those from at least two wards or more. “We made arrangements for the spot registration of at least 10 persons at a time and three simultaneous vaccination points for want of staff though the entire staff of the CHS, except for a skeletal staff to maintain the out-patient, were engaged. Not less than 300 were vaccinated on all seven days,” said a staff associated with the campaign. Though the camp was explicitly meant for 60-year-olds and above, those aged above 45 years with certificates of co-morbidity were also vaccinated. “In the second phase after the election, we plan to engage mobile palliative care units to vaccinate the bed-ridden,” said Ms. Joseph.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-panchayat-sets-a-model-in-vaccinating-its-elderly/article34268689.ece

Clients who opt for long-term lease of these spaces can construct commercial space here using their funds. A model for this will be readied this year. The revenue sharing model will be on a PPP basis. The income from such real estate is apart from that from station naming (where the sponsor's name will prefix that of a station) and advertisements wrapped on trains. The KMRL is also banking on revenue from posters, videos and announcements within trains. The agency will speed up efforts to construct a Rs. 3,000-cr Bliss City, a modern entertainment and wellness destination in Kakkanad, to mop up additional revenue for the metro, for which a study report is awaited. “We hope to get possession of the entire 17.43 acres of land this quarter,” metro sources said.  ‘The KMRL gave concessions on rent to retail outlets due to the pandemic-induced lull in business’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kmrl-to-launch-drive-to-rent-lease-out-space-at-stations/article34268693.ece

Thus, he set out for Srinagar some 3,300-odd kilometres away from his home at Kodenchery town in Kozhikode with the blessings of his parents, who, though anxious, didn’t want to dampen their son’s adventurous spirit, on March 6. His only possessions being a backpack carrying a tent for his overnight stay and Rs. 13,000 from the previous month’s salary. Having crossed Kerala and Karnataka, Civin is now at Manchar near Pune in Maharashtra. “I always loved to travel and it was my dream to explore the country though the initial plan was to do it on my beloved motorcycle. But the expenses involved were beyond my means and hence I chose to walk,” said Civin. He starts at 7 a.m. every day and walks till 12 noon before taking a break. He resumes around 3 p.m. and calls it a day at 9 p.m. Though he has friends living in places along the way, he avoids visiting them since he doesn’t want to expose them to the risk of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-free-spirited-youngster-discovering-india-on-foot/article34268704.ece

P. T. Thomas, the UDF candidate in Thrikkakara constituency, retrieved his publicity materials from different parts of the constituency as part of the efforts to follow the green protocol in electioneering. The cleaning-up drive began at Panampilly Nagar on the day. The UDF workers will fully remove the materials from the constituency within a fortnight, said election committee chairman Joseph Alex. Besides taking back the boards and banners, posters pasted on the walls will also be removed, he said. In the Kalamassery constituency, the LDF workers too removed the campaign materials. P. Rajeev, the LDF candidate, led the workers in the campaign. In Ernakulam, the LDF candidate Shaji George Pranatha began the clean-up drive at Vaduthala.

Baby of Handloom Cooperative 3478 at Paravur on Wednesday. He added that there were around 800 weavers in the taluk under 13 cooperatives, and they had not been able to sell products due to pandemic restrictions. The stock is worth around Rs. 7 crore, and primary weavers’ cooperatives will be able to make headway provided it is sold out. Mr. Baby also said that the special rebate announced by the government for the Vishu season would help weavers sell out at least a portion of the stock. He recalled that the Chela Edit, a curated exhibition of products from Chendamangalam handloom cooperatives under the sponsorship of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), had helped weavers immensely. The event had attracted substantial crowd. Meanwhile, Handloom Association State secretary A.V. Babu said that over 18,000 weavers working under 360 cooperatives too were hopeful of earning returns from the sale of uniform for schoolchildren under a State government programme. At present, there is a stock of around 57 lakh metres of clothing materials, as they could not be sold during the 2021-22 scholastic year. However, production has resumed with the 2022-23 year in mind, he added. Uniform business The uniform business can grow up to Rs. 150 crore and will be a major source of income and support for weavers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vishu-season-brings-new-hope-for-handloom-weavers/article34268706.ece

The assurance was given to Justice V.G. Arun when a new petition moved by P. Radhakrishnan, Deputy Director, ED, Kochi against the registration of the second FIR based on a complaint from Sandeep came up for hearing. The petition also challenged a sessions court order allowing the Crime Branch to question and record the statement of Sandeep at the Central Prison in Thiruvananthapuram. When the petition was taken up, Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India appearing for the petitioner, sought to stay the investigation into the second FIR, arguing that it contained the same allegations that were levelled in the first FIR lodged. Opposing the plea, Senior Public Prosecutor Suman Chakaravarthy submitted that the FIR was quite different from the first one and that they were in no way connected with each other.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-action-against-ed-officials-till-today-govt/article34268710.ece

This is all the more important, since the commissioning of the Vizhinjam port will increase the influx of container lorries into Kochi through the NH from Alappuzha. The Kundannoor-Pettah-Karingachira stretch is too narrow and congested to accommodate even the present volume of vehicles, sources said.

08 April 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Plan to tackle COVID in Kollam||With average TPR touching 4 and the district moving towards a surge, the Health Department has launched an intensified one-month action plan to tackle the situation. No compliance Since there has been no protocol compliance during the last several days, the numbers of new COVID-19 cases are expected to shoot up within a week. Panchayat presidents, secretaries and sectoral magistrates along with Health and Police officials will prepare the action plan for each panchayat in the district. In the first week highly-exposed persons that include candidates, volunteers, micro-observers, schoolteachers and police officials will be tested. In the second week focus will be on polling officers, booth agents and Kudumbashree, ASHA and health workers. In the third week public places including markets and harbours, migrant labourer settlements, work sites and old age homes will be visited. Observations “The action plan of second week will be based on the observations and analysis of the first. Intensive contact tracing and detailed route map preparation will also be part of the plan. Primary contacts of the positive cases will be recommended mandatory quarantine and random testing will be restarted,” said Deputy DMO Dr.R.Sandhya. The Department will start 24-hour COVID-19 first-line treatment centres in all panchayats and awareness campaigns will be launched, sources said. As part of the Healthy Kerala campaign special squads will visit public places and wedding venues to ensure that the protocol is followed. “Containment zones will be under the strict monitoring of the Department. All private hospitals will be asked to make arrangements to admit COVID-19 patients,” she said. Government Medical College Hospital and Kollam District Hospital, two COVID-19 hospitals in the district, will take measures to accommodate more positive cases if required. Absentees The Health officials have also asked all offices functioning in the district to inform the department about absentees and all hospitals in the district have been instructed to conduct fever surveillance and collect the samples of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) cases. Samples “Samples of people coming from Europe, UK, Middle East, Nigeria and South Africa will be collected and sent for genotyping. Along with all this, the vaccination drive will be continued,” she said.

He also alleged that he has been attacked several times recently and CPI(M) workers are behind the attack. While Vishakh, a 32-year-old Kadakkal resident was arrested, his accomplice Vishnu Lal is undergoing treatment at Medical College Hospital as he sustained injuries when the cracker went off.

08 April 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Candidates confident of win in Kottayam||Even as the figures released by the Election Commission of India (EC) on Wednesday confirmed a drop in the total voter turnout in Kottayam, the parties and their candidates came up with claims of victory. As per the final figures released by the EC, the total polling percentage recorded by Kottayam stood at 72.16 as against 76.90 recorded in 2016. Of this, Vaikom stood on top of the tally with a voter turnout of 75.61% while Kaduthuruthy was at the last position with 68.05 %. The polling percentage in Pala, which witnessed a high-stake battle between Jose K. Mani and Mani C. Kappan, too recorded a drop from 77.25 in 2016 to 72.56 this time. The byelection in 2019, meanwhile, recorded an even lesser voter turnout of 71.43%. Margin of victory Notwithstanding the drop, both Mr. Mani and Mr. Kappan exuded confidence over winning the seat by a comfortable margin. While Mr. Mani sought to stay away from predicting his margin of victory, Mr. Kappan said he was expecting a margin of at least 15,000 votes. Similarly, in Poonjar, which witnessed a four-way contest involving the Kerala Janapaksham (Secular) leader P.C.George, the voting percentage came down from 79.15 % to 72.47 % this time. This sharp fall, however, did not deter Mr.George from celebrating his victory just hours after the polling drew to a close on Tuesday. While being clearly aware about a consolidation of Muslim votes against him, Mr.George appears confident about the Hindu and Christian voters showing up in full force to support him. Kanjirappally, which witnessed a three-cornered battle between the UDF, LDF and the NDA, reported 72.13% , down from 76.10 %. Meanwhile, party strategists are trying to figure out if the people have voted for a regime change and the impact of the Kerala Congress (M)’s decision to align with the LDF. Curiously, turnout was the lowest in the two seats of Kaduthuruthy and Changanassery, where the Kerala Congress parties had squared up against each other. “Notwithstanding the positions they hold within the respective coalitions, the decline in the voter turnout in these seats also point to a shrinking appeal of the Kerala Congress politics in Central Travancore. Middle class The apathy of the middle class, especially those from the Christian families, to mainstream politics and the imposing presence of the major players like the Congress, CPI(M) can be among the reasons for this,” noted a senior Kerala Congress leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/candidates-confident-of-win-in-kottayam/article34268743.ece
08 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||‘Not so green’ polls this time||Despite the best efforts on their part, officials of Suchitwa Mission and Haritha Keralam Mission in the district are not entirely satisfied with the implementation of green protocol during the Assembly polls. The two Missions had put their heads together to ensure that the election did not result in a heap of waste. Several awareness programmes were held for the purpose, especially for polling officers, resource persons, candidates as well as political party leaders. However, a lapse on the part of the government machinery against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic defeated the purpose to an extent, said M. Mini, District Coordinator of Suchitwa Mission. Owing to the pandemic, the Health Department had warned against use of steel cups for water and tea distribution in booths, and ground-level workers had to use disposable paper cups. The food distributed among polling officials was packed in plastic covers, which added to the pile of disposables. “While trying to prevent the spread of COVID, we were creating more non-biodegradable waste,” she said, adding that the Health Department and the district administration should discuss and come up with a solution to the issue. “Reuse is one of the basic tenets of green protocol. Using anything that is not reusable is a violation of the code,” Ms. Mini added. Green Booths On the other hand, the two Missions had coordinated well to manage Green Booths and disposal of waste. The Haritha Keralam Mission had deployed Harithakarma Sena members across the district to collect waste, especially at Green Booths. They were coordinated through a mobile application developed by the Suchitwa Mission. “Though there was only one Green Booth in a local body, some local bodies took an extra effort to make sure that all of their booths were Green Booths. A few NGOs also joined hands to manage such booths,” said P. Prakashan, District Coordinator of Haritha Keralam Mission. The Missions had coordinated with IMAGE (Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly) to dispose of biomedical waste such as PPE kits, gloves and discarded masks. While Ms. Mini lamented the lack of awareness among common people, Mr. Prakashan said that there were some improvements. “I found some polling officials washing and drying plastic covers in which they got their food. It shows they have some sense of the danger those objects pose,” he said. “However, the controversy over the ‘Green’ of ‘Green Booths’ that gave it a political colour was senseless,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/not-so-green-polls-this-time/article34268680.ece

Officials said that Kunnamangalam Assembly segment witnessed the highest voter turnout (81.55%) and Kozhikode north the lowest (73.85%). The overall turnout is likely to increase when postal votes are added to the tally. As of now, 33,734 voters have cast their votes through the postal facility. Voters above 80 years of age, COVID-19 patients, those undergoing quarantine and differently abled persons are eligible for postal voting. Electors in the essential services category also exercised their franchise from March 28. The following are the segment-wise voter turnout — Vadakkara 79.33.%; Kuttiyadi 81.30%; Nadapuram 78.85%; Koyilandy 77.57%; Perambra 79.77%; Balussery 78.18%; Elathur 78.08%; Kozhikode North 73.85%; Kozhikode South 74.25%; Beypore 77.97%; Kunnamangalam 81.55%; Koduvally 80.04%; and Thiruvambady 77.04%. Of the 25,58,679 voters in the electoral list, 20,06,605 cast their votes at polling booths. They included 9,59,273 out of the 12,39,212 male voters (77.40%) and 10,47,316 out of the 13,19, 416 female voters (79.37 %). Sixteen out of the 51 transgender voters also exercised their franchise. Low turnout Meanwhile, political fronts are keeping their fingers crossed following the low turnout in the district. Some of the keenly contested seats remained unpredictable. Kozhikode has topped in voter turnout in the State, but it also meant that over 5 lakh voters stayed away from Assembly polls. The turnout was 81.89% and 81.27% in the 2011 and 2016 Assembly polls respectively. Many reasons have been attributed to the low voter turnout when compared to previous polls. One of the reasons could be the increase in the number of voters in each constituency and another is the double entry of names in the electoral rolls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kunnamangalam-sees-highest-voter-turnout-in-kozhikode/article34268682.ece

This is the third edition of the award, presented annually to eminent personalities for their contribution to the world of sports, and to commemorate the IIMK’s iconic Calicut Half Marathon which is now into its 12th year. The event, which is going completely virtual for the first time, is scheduled from April 9 to 11. Prof. Debashis Chatterjee, Director, IIM-K, gave away the award to Mr. Uttappa. The National Excellence Award is a replica of the IIM-K’s inspirational mnemonic - the “Arise Arjuna” statue. Presenting the award, Prof. Chatterjee recounted Mr. Uthappa’s immense contribution to cricket and how he ably carried his team forward by demonstrating resilience, focus, and determination - a quality that resonates with the legend of Arjuna. The award was instituted two years ago, with the first recipient being Para-Olympian and Arjuna awardee Dr Deepa Malik. Ms. Babita Kumari Phogat, renowned wrestler, also an Arjuna awardee, was conferred the award last year.

08 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Statute amendment: concern over delay in informing Chancellor||Over two weeks after the Calicut University Syndicate passed a resolution against cancelling new courses in affiliated Arabic colleges, the authorities have been accused of not informing the Chancellor’s office about a statute amendment for the purpose. One of the Syndicate members said on Wednesday that students in these colleges were concerned about the delay affecting the future of these courses. The then United Democratic Front (UDF) government had sanctioned two courses each in nine Arabic colleges in 2013-14. As many as 4,000 students are studying these courses. However, the statute amendment for the purpose had been delayed owing to a legal tangle. Later, when the media reported about an official proposal to the Syndicate against the statute amendment that would have led to scrapping of the courses altogether, it kicked up a row. Protests held Muslim organisations and pro-UDF outfits staged protests against the move. It was pointed out that the university’s move would lead to closure of the Arabic colleges. The State government too reportedly intervened in the matter apprehending that it might be interpreted as an “anti-minority move” that would affect the Left Democratic Front’s prospects ahead of the Assembly polls. The issue was taken up for debate at the Syndicate meeting held on March 20. It was decided to seek approval for the courses with retrospective effect. The university authorities had claimed that they were not aware of the move to cancel the courses. The Syndicate had also decided not to seek action against the officials who proposed there was no need for a statute amendment. Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj, however, said on Wednesday that the information on the amendment was likely to be passed on to the Governor’s office this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/statute-amendment-concern-over-delay-in-informing-chancellor/article34268670.ece
08 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Fresh probe into death of youngster||The District Crime Branch has started a fresh probe into the suspicious death of a 16-year-old student from Narikkatteri in Nadapuram in the wake of noticing two separate video clips in which the victim was reportedly found undergoing torture by his own elder brother. The video clippings secured by the squad from social media are now with the cyber forensic team. A Deputy Superintendent of Police who heads the probe has recorded the statements of a few local residents who had earlier complained that it was a murder. Though the investigation team recently quizzed the victim’s father, he was found ignorant of the new developments, police sources said. It was on May 17 last year that the body of K. Abdul Azeez, a student from MIM Higher Secondary School, Perode, was found hanging in his house. The case was then recorded as an unnatural death by the local police under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Though the case was later handed over to the Crime Branch following suspicion that it was a murder, they ruled out the possibility in the absence of circumstantial evidence. The case was taken up again by the Crime Branch as a local action committee intensified its protest after watching the new video clips.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fresh-probe-into-death-of-youngster/article34268674.ece
08 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||High vigil in politically sensitive areas||In the wake of isolated post-poll violence and political stand-off in some northern Kerala districts, the high-security, 24x7 surveillance measures taken by the police on the Election Day will be continued as such in all the politically sensitive areas in Kozhikode district. The provisionally created police sub-divisions for election vigil under the supervision of Assistant Commissioners and Deputy Superintendents of Police will also maintain status quo. Considering stray incidents of street scuffles in rural areas, all local patrol squads have been asked to intensify the frequency of their day-and-night rounds within Nadapuram, Kuttiyadi, Vadakara, Valayam, Edachery and Chombal police station limits. Vehicle checking will be intensified with the support of highway squads. Though no prohibitory orders are in place, the police have started discouraging overcrowded meetings, provocative demonstrations, and sloganeering in sensitive locations. Flash inspections will be carried out in areas where minor clashes were reported after the elections.  Regional meetings Efforts are also on to convene regional meetings of political party leaders to ensure their support for the peacekeeping process. The Station House Officers concerned will take the lead role in arranging such meetings and review the feedback. A similar district-level meeting with the participation of senior political party leaders is also under the consideration of the authorities ahead of the declaration of election results. Provocative social media posts will be instantly reported to the cyber cell for action. Leaders of youth organisations have been asked to keep an eye on such incidents. In many of the recent local clashes, inciting posts against candidates and political party leaders have been found triggering huge unrest. According to police higher ups, post-poll vigil taken after the recent local body elections had been a huge success in suppressing political tensions and promoting social harmony. Suggestions put forth by the police had also been accepted as such by political party leaders who took the message to the grassroots-level, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-to-continue-vigil-in-politically-sensitive-areas-in-district/article34268678.ece
08 April 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||Cruel, planned: IUML||The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has condemned the killing of its activist Mansoor at Koothuparamba. Accusing the CPI(M) of the killing, IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty said on Wednesday that it was cruel and preplanned. Mr. Kunhalikutty said the murder followed a warning on social media that the IUML would remember the election day forever. He said the CPI(M) could not wash its hands of the murder. Muslim Youth League (MYL) State secretary Mujeeb Kaderi said the CPI(M) had unleashed violence as they saw defeat in the election. Inaugurating a protest here, Mr. Kaderi said the cultural leaders who joined the electioneering campaign for the CPI(M) should air their comments on the CPI(M) killing too. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, who visited the house of Mansoor on Wednesday, termed the killing premeditated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cruel-planned-iuml/article34268722.ece

Sreedharan, who contested the Assembly elections from the Palakkad constituency on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ticket, said here on Wednesday that he had begun preparations to set up his MLA office in the town. Exuding confidence in the ballot, Mr. Sreedharan said that he would work for the development of the region irrespective of the election result. “I will be here with the people of Palakkad and will continue to work for their welfare no matter I win or not,” he said. Mr. Sreedharan said his politics was about development and industry. “I will focus on drinking water and waste management,” he said, adding that he would not have to wait until he becomes an MLA to work for people’s welfare. The technocrat also said that the BJP was strong and that the party did not require any corrections. Because of the BJP’s strength, he said he did not have to work too much in the elections. Cong. laughs at move Meanwhile, the Congress too expressed confidence in retaining the Palakkad seat. District Congress Committee (DCC) president V. K. Sreekandan rather sarcastically said that Mr. Sreedharan would be referring to opening a railway office and not an MLA office. He said the Congress candidate and incumbent MLA Shafi Parambil would have a comfortable victory in Palakkad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sreedharan-to-set-up-mla-office-in-palakkad/article34268709.ece
08 April 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||In Pathanamthitta, political parties keep fingers crossed||The overall polling percentage reported by Pathanamthitta, which came down from 71.66 in 2016 to 67.18 this time, has got political rivals - United Democratic Front, Left Democratic Front and the National Democratic Alliance - guessing its ramifications on the poll prospects. While each side is trying to claim that their voters have turned out, there exists a school of thought that the falling polling percentage was indicative of the deep-seated public disengagement from politics. Detailed review The parties, meanwhile, are awaiting booth-level figures to hold a detailed review of the trend. While the total polling percentage itself was the lowest among all districts in the State, a segment-wise analysis showed that even Konni, which had witnessed one of the most high-voltage electioneering led by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reported a fall in percentage from 73.04 to 71.42. Support base The CPI(M), which is the leading partner of the LDF claimed that their core support base was politically alert and turned up in huge numbers to suggest that the low percentage should worry the rival fronts. The voting percentage recorded the sharpest fall in Pathanamthitta and Thiruvalla, which can be attributed to a friction within the UDF and the NDA over the selection of candidates, said K.P. Udayabhanu, CPI(M) district secretary. The UDF leaders, on the other hand, appeared unfazed by the fall in percentage as the actual number of voters stood much higher than in 2016. “The strong urge for a regime change among the voters was so strong that majority of the electorate performed the exercise in the morning hours itself. The trend sent the LDF into a panic mode, forcing them to unleash violence against UDF workers and candidates in several locations,” held Babu George, president of the District Congress Committee. The NDA, meanwhile, appeared less enthusiastic about engaging in a number-game post polling and held that the parties did not put up enough work to draw the voters to the booths. “The lack of enthusiasm among the voters were visible right through the period of campaigning and the COVID-19 appears to have played a role,” observed Ashokan Kulanada, district president of the Bharatiya Janata Party . Though anti-incumbency and Sabarimala were the two key factors highlighted by the UDF and the NDA to determine the final outcome, their reasoning does not explain the sharp fall this time. Sharp jump For instance, the voter turnout in the region recorded a sharp jump of eight percent during the 2019 Parliament election, which had been primarily fought over the Sabarimala issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/parties-keep-fingers-crossed/article34268742.ece
08 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||BJP hopes to unsettle LDF, UDF calculations||The emergence of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a third force in Kerala politics appeared to have introduced an element of unpredictability into the post-poll calculations of the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist) campaign managers strived to read the runes in 140 constituencies on Wednesday. The BJP factor loomed in the background. The LDF sought reassurance in the estimation that the government did not face an anti-incumbency factor. The front believed that its governance record and manifesto moored to welfarism and development had improved its chances for a second term in power. However, the LDF seemed unsure how the Nair Service Society’s poll day spotlighting of the Sabarimala issue would impact Hindu voters. By some accounts, the LDF hoped to retain most of its seats in Kollam, Alappuzha and Thrissur, to increase its tally in Thiruvananthapuram, and to defeat the BJP in Nemom. Banking on KC(M) The coalition has put much stock in the Kerala Congress (M) to make gains in Kottayam and Idukki. It believed the “apolitical” Twenty20 would eat into UDF votes in Ernakulam. The LDF hoped to dominate the Malabar region and foray into the Indian Union Muslim League bastions in Malappuram. Like the LDF, the UDF also hoped to win a ruling majority with a clear margin. It has sensed a political drift in its favour. Sabarimala had billowed its sails. The LDF’s alleged attempt to open the seas to foreign trawlers had manifested as a powerful headwind. Rahul Gandhi’s campaigning would tip the balance in favour of the UDF. The Congress has tried hard to make a comeback in Kollam, Alappuzha and Thrissur. It expected a surge in its popularity in Kozhikode, Kottayam, and Idukki. The BJP has narrowed down its victory chances to less than five constituencies. However, it felt it had made inroads into the Christian community’s electoral bastions in central and southern Kerala. The National Democratic Alliance has high hopes for Nemom, Kazhakuttam, Konni, Malampuzha, and Manjeswaram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-hopes-to-unsettle-ldf-udf-calculations/article34268713.ece
08 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||A gift from USSR to go on display at KSSTM||The Kerala State Science and Technology Museum (KSSTM) here has become the proud owner of a handful of components of a USSR-make Minsk computer. Used in the early days of the Indian space programme at Thumba, the Minsk was perhaps the first computer to make its way into the State capital in the 1960s. A ferrite core memory plane and the logic circuits from a second generation Minsk were among the parts donated by John T. George, who headed the Computer Division at the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in the 1960s. Mr. George, now 85, had retired as head, Quality Assessment Division, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), in 1996. KSSTM director G.P. Padmakumar accepted the components from Mr. George recently. They will go on display at the Computer Gallery of the museum, he said. The transfer was facilitated by the Computer Society of India (CSI), Thiruvananthapuram chapter. Many uses then Back then, the Minsk, a gift from the Soviets, was used for ‘wind weighting,’ determining the azimuth and elevation settings of the sounding rocket based on wind measurements taken before the launch, Mr. George, who had left the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) to join the space programme in 1964 and help develop the computer division, told The Hindu . “The Minsk was so named because the computer was built in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, which was then a part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). A necessary attribute of computers is the random access capability, and the ferrite core memory was the first to possess this capability,” he said. The Minsk took up a lot of space. There were seven full-size cupboard-like structures, a console, a teleprinter input system and a printer. For cooling, there were five 1.5-tonne air conditioners. Upgrades done “The Soviets gave us the Minsk-2 version. Later on, we augmented the capability of the computer to the Minsk-22 version,” recalled Mr. George. Subsequently, replaced by the more powerful IBM-360/44, the Minsk was donated to a government-run educational institution. Prof. Achuthsankar S. Nair, head, Department of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Kerala, and chairman, CSI Thiruvananthapuram chapter; and senior officials of KSSTM and CSI were present at the function.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-gift-from-ussr-to-go-on-display-at-ksstm/article34268683.ece

The Assembly constituency-wise polling percentages also have been released. Of the 28,19,710 eligible voters in the district, 19,74,345 exercised their franchise. A total of 9,51,978 male voters, 10,22,343 female voters and 24 of the 61 transgender electors in the district also cast their vote. Ten of the 14 Assembly constituencies in the district registered a polling percentage above 70%. The four city constituencies of Thiruvananthapuram, Vattiyurkavu, Nemom and Kazhakuttam failed to make the 70% mark. Aruvikkara tops With a turnout of 73.27%, Aruvikkara topped the polling percentage in the district, followed by Parassala (72.43%) and Kattakada (72.22%). The Thiruvananthapuram Assembly constituency has the lowest voter turnout in the district — 61.85%. Kazhakuttam recorded a turnout of 69.61%, Vattiyurkavu 64.15% and Nemom 69.81%.

08 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Tepid response to vaccine sparks worry||Though the State has begun an aggressive vaccination campaign against COVID-19, trying to vaccinate as many people as possible in the 45 years plus age group, the lukewarm response is raising concerns. While the response in districts such as Thiruvananthapuram, which has been administering over 20,000 doses a day, is encouraging, lack of trust in the new vaccines are in evidence in Idukki, Malappuram, and Kasaragod, officials said. When vaccination was opened up for the 60 plus age group on March 1, the response had been phenomenal. “We expected a similar response when vaccinations were opened up for all above 45 years on April 1. But there is no urgency amongst people though cases are climbing,” an official said. However, some district health administrations said the lukewarm response last week was because of the polls. With the election over, vaccination would pick up. “There is no crowding because it has now been made available right from primary health centres upwards and in a lot more private hospitals,” a district official said. “We need the whole-hearted involvement of LSGI officials to take vaccination ahead. We hope vaccination will pick up pace in a week,” K. Sakeena, district medical officer, Malappuram, said. Media reports about even vaccinated people getting COVID infection have created confusion among the public and some sceptical questions on why one should get vaccinated if it is not to free people from a restricted life are questions health officials are facing in the field. “The messages on what should be expected after vaccination should be conveyed more lucidly to people. No vaccine gives an assurance that it can prevent all infections. But all vaccines give 100% assurance against serious disease, hospitalisation, and death. There have been very few infections in people who completed at least three weeks after their first vaccine dose. Though a few infections were reported in fully vaccinated healthcare workers, these were all mild,” a health expert said. The pandemic could be prolonged if people refuse to get vaccinate. If vaccination pace does not pick up and reach at least 70 % of the population, disease transmission may not reduce and will lead to the emergence of more mutant variants. ‘Less infectious’ Scientists still do not know for sure if a vaccinated person can transmit infection to others. But there are research studies which suggest that even if a vaccinated person contracts COVID-19, he may be less infectious. A research study from Israel reported that people who had been administered Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and who contracted COVID afterwards, had lower viral loads than unvaccinated people who caught the infection. Lower viral load indicates that the person is less contagious and with sufficient coverage in the population, vaccination can reduce transmission, it is hoped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tepid-response-to-vaccine-sparks-worry/article34268717.ece

The amount has been made available to the NHAI from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) that has been authorised to provide the funds for meeting the 25% cost of land acquisition. The amount has been transferred to the NHAI on the basis of a letter from the Regional Officer, NHAI, on March 18 seeking Rs. 585,53,04,650 as part payment towards the 25% cost of land acquisition as per a tripartite agreement reached between the NHAI Principal Secretary, PWD, and the Chief Executive Officer, KIIFB. As per the pact inked to overcome the rising cost of land acquisition and expedite the six-laning of the NH 66 corridor, the State has to give Rs. 1,978.96 crore to the NHAI. The State has given Rs. 604.90 crore and Rs. 525.70 crore — in three tranches — to the NHAI already. To ULCCS The NHAI had recently awarded the works for six-laning of 39 km from Thalapadi to Chengala to the Uralungal Labor Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS) paving the way for the commencement of the NH development.

The opening of the parking lot was further delayed after the inspectorate said that fire exit stairs needed to be added to the structure. The construction of the same has been ongoing. The multilevel parking lot had a formal inauguration in October last year, around a year after the construction had started under the Smart City projects. The structure of the parking lot inside the Corporation premises was completed by December 2019. But the work on the fire safety equipment and testing had remained pending. The technicians from the Coimbatore-based company, which constructed the facility, were unable to travel to the city due to COVID-19, which further delayed its commissioning. Automatic system “We initially thought the parking lot could be opened by the last week of March. However, with the elections being declared, the other processes were further delayed. Earlier, the company officials expressed a doubt on whether a fire exit staircase is required, as no one is personally going up to the higher levels and the cars are lifted up and down using an automatic system. The Electrical Inspectorate is expected to accord clearance soon,” said a Corporation official. With the upper floors being unusable, the ground floor has been made use of mostly for parking cars of Corporation officials. Visitors to the Corporation continue to park on either side of the road. 102 cars at a time Across seven floors, the facility can accommodate 102 cars at a time. On swiping a card provided at the entry point, a ramp will arrive at the ground floor. The driver can leave the vehicle and exit the ramp. Executed under the Central government’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme, the parking lot was completed at Rs. 5.64 crore. Out of the construction cost, 50% was borne by the Corporation, 30% by the Centre and 20% by the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/work-on-fire-exit-stairs-for-capital-parking-lot-under-way/article34268735.ece

She said that those who had been part of election campaigning should subject themselves to RT-PCR tests as there had been huge crowds as part of campaigning in some areas. The decisions to step up vigilance were taken at a meeting of the district task force on Wednesday. Those who had been part of campaign activities and were experiencing fever, cough or physical difficulties should mandatorily take the COVID-19 test within two days. Others who were part of the campaigning should also take the tests as soon as possible. Even if the test results were negative, those who displayed symptoms should continue in self isolation. With SSLC examinations beginning on Thursday, students whose parents or relatives were staying with them and had been part of campaigning activities should also take the RT-PCR test. Those who had worked as poll agents in the various booths in the district on polling day should also take the RT-PCR test within two days, said the Collector.

08 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Cong., CPI(M) spar over NSS statement on Sabarimala||The Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) continued to spar over whether Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair had crossed the line of political neutrality by purportedly batting for a regime change at the start of the polling for the Assembly elections on Tuesday. Nevertheless, the NSS leadership appeared to maintain an impenetrable posture on Wednesday. It issued no press release or made any attempt to clarify Mr. Nair’s stance. Law Minister A.K. Balan said Mr. Nair had played the Left Democratic Front false. His invocation of the Sabarimala issue as a negative against the government was shocking. Mr. Nair had batted for the Congress and UDF leadership. He had abandoned the politically central position of the NSS. The Congress had warned of an election day bomb. EC moved The party knew it would come in the form of Mr. Nair’s partisan statement. Mr. Balan had moved the Chief Electoral Officer against Mr. Nair. He said Mr. Nair had portrayed the election as a contest between believers and non-believers. CPI(M) acting State secretary A.Vijayaraghavan said the Assembly results on May 2 would prove Mr. Nair wrong. The NSS leader had no stranglehold over the Nair community. Electricity Minister M.M. Mani accused Mr. Nair of being politically partisan to the UDF. He said Mr. Nair had attempted to improve the Congress’s prospects on polling day. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala slammed the LDF for attempting to intimidate the NSS. The NSS leadership had articulated its time-honoured position on Sabarimala. It had not tried to woo voters for the UDF or dent the prospects of the LDF. The LDF had authored its ruin by trampling on the faith of devotees. The government had wantonly indulged in corruption and corruption. Voters had shown the LDF the door. The CPI(M) had unleashed violence against its political opponents. Its bullying tactics had no place in democratic Kerala. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and BJP leader P.K. Krishnadas also slammed the LDF’s attack on the NSS general secretary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-cpim-spar-over-nss-statement/article34268707.ece

08 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSDMA moots chemical spill contingency plans||A strategic environment impact assessment carried out by the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) in the aftermath of the oil spill at the Travancore Titanium Products Ltd. (TTP) has pointed to the need for chemical spill contingency plans for the State, districts and factories. On February 10 this year, hundreds of litres of furnace oil had spilled into the coast following a pipeline rupture at TTP, Kochu Veli, sparking environmental concerns and a public outcry. “The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) along with the Coast Guard must develop a detailed oil contingency plan for the State by considering the existing system in Kerala and with the help of all stakeholders. Contingency plans should be developed for State, districts and companies. Off-site and on-site emergency plans are essential for chemical factories,” says the report prepared by the Kerala State Emergency Operations Centre, KSDMA. Such contingency plans need to be updated annually, it adds. Ban discharges It further recommends that discharges from factories into public areas should be strictly prohibited. Local emergency teams should be formed in all factories with the help of volunteers for tackling emergencies. Oil spills can have disastrous long-term impact on the environment and human activities. Mousse, the emulsified mixture of water and oil, becomes even stickier than oil, causing it to stick to organisms and materials much more readily. Citing studies, the report warns that oil spills can pollute groundwater, wells, and, in the coast, pose a threat to marine life. The KSDMA report recommends the establishment of a separate mechanism by the PCB and the Factories and Boilers Department for funding emergency responses to oil spills. Furthermore, it should be ensured that victims of such mishaps benefit under the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991. TTP flayed The report criticised TTP for failing to have “an on-site or off-site oil spill contingency plan,” despite the State government undertaking possessing the capability to produce 40-45 tonnes of titanium dioxide daily. The oil spill resulted in the contamination of the seashore, the report pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chemical-spill-contingency-plans-needed/article34268736.ece

08 April 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Despite low turnout, parties stay rosy||The low polling percentage in Thrissur this time, compared to the last Assembly elections, leaves all political parties confused about their chances. The parties have been busy calculating various factors, including socio-religious equations, political undercurrents and personnel influences of the candidates, which hold key in deciding the final verdict. Postal votes The district recorded 73.76 % votes in the elections held on April 6. However, this polling tally is without calculating postal votes, including the COVID-19 special votes. Constituency-wise polling percentages are as follows: Chelakkara (76.1); Kunnamkulam (76.43); Guruvayur (68.46); Manalur (73.20); Wadakkanchery (76.18); Ollur (73.87); Thrissur (68.86); Nattika (71.41); Kaipamangalam (76.69); Irinjalakuda (74.80); Puthukkad (75.58); Chalakudy (72.63); Kodungallur (75). In the 2016 Assembly elections, the district recorded 77.74 % voter turnout. It registered a voting percent of 78.36 % in Lok Sabha election and 74.88 % in the 2011 Assembly election. In the recently held local body elections, there was 75.07 % polling in the district. “Actually, there is not much of a dip in the polling percentage this time. If you calculate the large number of postal votes in the wake of COVID-19, it will be almost the same as the last elections. However, the increase or decrease in the polling percentage will not affect the chances of the LDF,” said CPI(M) district secretary M.M. Varghese. “We will win all the 13 seats in the district, including Wadakkanchery, which we lost for a slender margin last time,” he said. Upbeat mood The UDF camp too is optimistic of improving its seat share. “We will emerge victorious in five-seven seats in the district this time,” said M.P. Vincent, district congress committee president. “It was like the parable of the race between the rabbit and tortoise this time. Though we were late in deciding the full list of candidates, the campaign gained momentum by and by and we reached much ahead of the rival parties,” he added. Mr. Vincent also made it clear that it was “a misconception” that if there was a dip in the poll percentage, it would harm the chances of the UDF. He attributed the low percentage of polling in Thrissur and Guruvayur to the lost interest of BJP supports in voting. “In Guruvayur, they didn’t have any candidates. In Thrissur, Suresh Gopi, their much-hyped candidate, failed to make any impact on voters,” Mr. Vincent said. The NDA camp is also optimistic about improving its vote share in the district. They are keeping their hopes high in a couple of constituencies, including Thrissur, Manalur and Irinjalakuda.  The district recorded 73.76 % votes in the Assembly elections||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/despite-low-turnout-parties-stay-rosy/article34268833.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||With Joji, Dileesh Pothan scores a hat-trick||The face mask, a necessity in the post-pandemic world, might be a hindrance for many, but in the cold and sinister world painted by director Dileesh Pothan in Joji , it is a perfect tool to hide your criminal intentions and guilt. “Wear a mask and come down,” asks a co-conspirator of sorts to the man who has just committed his first crime, and is struggling to contain his glee. In his third outing Joji , Pothan trains his lens on an affluent family living amid vast pineapple farms in Erumely in Kottayam. Kuttappan (P.N. Sunny), the patriarch of the Panachel family, has such a tight, authoritarian control over his family that his youngest son Joji (Fahadh Faasil) seeks his permission before touching the car key, to take his father, who is down with a stroke, to the hospital. Joji, on the other hand is the meek one, like the white horse he rears. But then, appearances can be deceptive. Beneath all the tight control with which Kuttappan lords over them, discontent and resentment are brewing. Among the three brothers, Jomon (Baburaj) is the closest to his father. The second son Jaison (Joji Mundakkayam) is yearning for independence and his wife Bincy (Unnimaya) for freedom from the back-breaking and thankless household work. None of them have a plan, while a seemingly aimless and disinterested Joji has one. Original world Scriptwriter Syam Pushkaran and Pothan bring together elements from Shakespeare’s Macbeth and K.G. George’s emergency-era classic Irakal to construct a wholly original world, where self-interest and money define all human relationships. The family, even with all its financial powers, with which they are not beyond threatening the reluctant local priest to attend a family function, is but constantly concerned about the talk of the town. The transformations in the behaviour and habits of the family members after Kuttappan’s stroke are minutely etched out. The script mocks traditions and its self-appointed protectors. Humour appears in the unlikeliest of places, like in Pothan’s previous works. Here, one of the laugh out scenes happens during a funeral procession. When you get used to this dark humour, and is guffawing comfortably, a shock lands like a country bomb thrown at your face in a beautifully staged sequence. Minimalistic style The style is minimalistic, yet without leaving out anything. The pace is steady and consistent all through, with the viewer never ever daring to waver in attention. Justin Varghese’s background music, with its evident western orchestral influences, gives to the film a sombre, brooding quality. Joji is as much a perceptive study of the slow unravelling of a criminal mind as it is an indictment of the society and the family structure that is the origin point of that criminality. Dileesh Pothan has scored a hat-trick, with three films that are unlike each other.  Joji is currently streaming on Amazon Prime. S.R.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Irul gropes partly in the dark||In the initial parts of Irul , when one sees the usual tropes of horror thrillers, complete with a grand mansion in a secluded area at night, a stranded couple, and a mysterious man who seems to own that mansion, one expects the script to have some delightful trick up the sleeve to upset our expectations. However, here, the effort seems to be to ensure that the audience will not get too much of a surprise and to not try anything out of the tested path. Alex Parayil (Soubin Shahir), a writer, takes his girlfriend Archana (Darshana Rajendran), a lawyer, on a weekend getaway. During the night ride, in pouring rain, the car breaks down in a secluded area. They take shelter in a nearby mansion, where they are welcomed by a mysterious man (Fahadh Faasil). But things, as expected, take a darker turn soon, with events paralleling those from Alex’s recent book Irul seeming to have taken place there. Right from the beginning, director Nazeef Yusuf Izuddin places the viewer in Archana’s shoes. She does not know where Alex is taking her. She has not read Alex’s book, which she learns from the conversations between him and the man at the mansion, is about a serial killer. She is also, just like the viewer, caught in the confusion of whom to trust between the two men, both of whom tell her equally convincing stories to explain the happenings in the mysterious mansion. Mysteries in the cellar Yet, beyond the customary jump scares, the film never really manages to send chills down your spine, even at the heights of the confrontation between the two men or when the three of them go down to the cellar to explore the mysteries in there. One stand-out scene is a shouting match between the three characters, which might serve to disorient the viewer who is already confused about the motives of the two men. Some of the dialogues and exchanges have a tinge of artificiality and a staged feeling about them. This is especially so in the discussion about Alex’s book. Those discussions though throw up interesting tangents on how much the personal experiences of writers matter in the content that they produce, but these remain as mere diversions. Even in a film with just three characters, the three accomplished performers do not really get to dazzle the audience. If only at least half the attention that was paid to the sound design and the art direction was given in fleshing out the script and working on the dialogues, Irul would not have felt like a half-baked, half-hearted effort that it is now. The film is currently streaming on Netflix. S.R. Praveen||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/irul-gropes-partly-in-the-dark/article34268863.ece

The last time the single-day positive cases reached the 200-figure mark was in December 2020. The number of positive cases registered on Wednesday in Anantapur city was 90, 17 in Kadiri and 14 in Dharmavaram, while the remaining towns in 63 mandals recorded cases in single digit. While the district administration was testing close to 6,000 samples in December and January, the number of positive cases fell sharply till February-end and in March the number of samples tested per day stood at an average of 2,000 per day, but the COVID positive cases got registered either in single-digit or in double digits below 50. Protocols ignored Lackadaisical behaviour on part of the public attending religious functions and large gatherings in social functions like marriages and birthdays resulted in the spike in the number of cases. One apartment in Ramnagar recorded five positive cases in a week and a 76-year-old woman died of COVID on Tuesday. The DMHO and GGH health staff arranged a medical camp and COVID tests for all remaining residents on Wednesday. The Bhrahmotsavams of Kadiri Narasimhaswamy have been taking place from March 23 and a large number of people came from Karnataka, A.P. and Telangana. A large number of positive cases coming from the towns from where the devotees had visited Kadiri, has created doubt among the people if the non-COVID compliant behaviour there was the source of these new infections. Candlelight rally The police department had been conducting awareness programmes in the district asking people to wear masks and the district administration too did not leave any stone unturned to spread awareness and held a candlelight rally on Wednesday in the city asking people to wear masks and maintain social distance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/spike-in-covid-cases-in-anantapur/article34268807.ece
08 April 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Dalit sarpanch ‘stopped’ from entering office||Fakkeeramma, a Dalit Sarpanch of Kallumadi Panchayat, alleged that she was not allowed to enter the village secretariat office on Wednesday and that it was locked allegedly by some followers of the former YSRCP sarpanch Saubhagyamma. Ms. Fakkeeramma sat in front of the locked entrance of the sarpanch office and staged a dharna. As support for dharna, several villagers came with plastic pots and raised slogans against the alleged autocratic behaviour of “caste Hindus” in the village. The dispute began with the sarpanch alleging that she was not handed over the charge and that she was not allowed to monitor the functioning of the mineral water plant in the village. The panchayat secretary allegedly refused to give it and wanted the panchayat members to pass a resolution as to who should possess the keys. With the intervention of Joint Collector A. Siri and with the help of local police, the sarpanch called off the dharna and an agreement to pass a resolution about the control over the mineral water plant was arrived at. The lock of the village secretariat office was opened in the afternoon and it began functioning. When Ms. Fakkeeramma tried to enter the secretariat, the employees there seemed to have locked the premises and allegedly did not allow her to enter. The panchayat secretary, however, alleged that she had picked up an argument over handing over of keys of the water plant, and she herself locked the premises. Ms. Fakkeeramma had contested as rebel YSRCP candidate after the sarpanch post was reserved for the SCs. In 2008 when a Dalit family from outside the village had entered the Chennakeshava Swamy temple in Kallumadi, a big furore arose and many people in the village allegedly stopped visiting the temple since then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dalit-sarpanch-stopped-from-entering-office/article34268331.ece

Mr. Viswanatha, who is working in the Arohak Inc, New Jersey in the U.S. at present, recently received International Achievers’ Award-2021 presented by the New Delhi-based Indian Achievers’ Forum Organizations. The forum said in its release that Mr. Viswanatha was honoured for his extraordinary skills in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research areas and his social work initiatives. To his credit, he has several international patents granted for his work along with nine others. The well recognised among them are on women’s security using Internet of Things (IoT) and recycling construction and demolition (C&D) waste, which were awarded Australian patents in December last year. Women’s security Mr. Viswanath explains that the intelligent women’s security using streetlight, auto-run unmanned aerial vehicle and IoT technology can provide a movement system and a light source which can be repositioned via the moving object and thereby find their locations. The “APIC- Recycling C&D Waste” is related to an intelligent process for the recycling of C&D waste and recycle the useful material into useful products. The C&D waste comprise the debris generated during construction and demolition activities. This process would convert them into reusable material instead of sending them into landfills, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/techies-stem-clubs-foster-innovation-at-govt-schools/article34268805.ece

08 April 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Girl subjected to incestuous assault||In a horrific incident, a 20-year-old girl, an MBBS aspirant, was allegedly sexually assaulted by her brother and cousin many times over the past few years in Kothagudem. The episode came to light late on Tuesday night after the victim, a resident of the mines rescue station area in the coal town, lodged a complaint with the Two Town police about her ordeal at the hands of her ‘brothers turned sexual predators’. Hours after an FIR was lodged based on her complaint, the victim’s cousin, a software professional, allegedly committed suicide by hanging at his house in Kothagudem in the early hours of Wednesday, sources said. The victim endured the sexual violence and mental trauma for months in silence as the two accused threatened to kill her if she informed about it to anyone. When the victim reported the matter to her mother and parents of her cousin, they allegedly turned a deaf ear. The hideous crime sent shockwaves in the coal town and exposed the growing susceptibility of women and girls to domestic and sexual violence, exacerbated by the pandemic-induced crisis. In her complaint, the victim recounted the months of ‘torture’ at the hands of her two brothers during her college days and later during the lockdown last year. In a deeply moving account of her ordeal, she said her father, an employee of the SCCL in Manuguru, deserted her mother more than a decade ago. “My own brother secured a job in the same company in 2016 and shifted all of us including my mother and elder sister to his quarters in Kothagudem,” she said, alleging that her brother sexually assaulted her many times during her school and Inter college days. The victim accused her cousin brother, a resident of Ramavaram locality, of raping her several times after her abrupt return to the coal town from a Khammam-based NEET coaching centre due to lockdown last year. “The State government’s recent decision to close all educational institutions including coaching centres owing to threat of second wave of COVID-19 compelled me to come back home again. Unable to bear the imminent torture at the hands of the monsters and threat to my life anymore, I have approached the police seeking action against the duo and also my mother and the parents of my cousin,” the victim said. Circle Inspector of Police, Kothagudem-II town, B Satyanarayana, told The Hindu that a case against the two brothers was registered based on the complaint filed by her on Tuesday night. The victim’s mother and the parents of her cousin have also been booked under relevant Sections of the IPC for ‘aiding’ the duo in the crime, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/girl-subjected-to-incestuous-assault/article34268653.ece

Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar said that the Kuppam Urban police received a complaint over the desecration of idols at a Subramaniam Swamy temple atop a hill in Gonuguru village. The police despatched three special teams to investigate the case. During the investigation, it was found that the woman, who was suspected to be mentally unstable, allegedly desecrated the idols on March 31 in an inebriated condition. Mr. Senthil said that the temple was located at a very isolated place and was very rarely visited by devotees unless on special occasions. Even the priest visited the temple only once a week. He said that when the police questioned the woman, she reportedly revealed that on March 31, after consuming toddy, she desecrated the idols and subsequently placed them in a ditch 20 meters away from the temple. She told the police that she went back to the village and told the residents that “she has killed Murugan”, who did not take her seriously owing to her her mental condition. The incident came to light on April 6 when the priest visited the temple. The SP said the police had installed CC cameras at almost all the religious places vulnerable to attacks by miscreants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/woman-held-for-desecrating-idols/article34268809.ece

Raghu Ramakrishna Raju for “violating the party discipline and making wild allegations against party president and Chef Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.” Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Suresh alleged that Mr. Raghu Ramakrishna Raju had violated party discipline and, as per the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, stern action should be taken against him for avoiding such instances in the future. Mr. Suresh said that the party would suspend Mr. Raghu Ramakrishna Raju in case the Speaker failed to take action. Mr. Raghu Ramakrishna Raju had no moral right to speak about the cases against Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, as there were CBI and ACB cases against him as well.

08 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telangana to raise Rs. 8,000 cr. through OMB in 1st quarter||The State government has decided to raise Rs. 8,000 crore through open market borrowings (OMB) during the first quarter of the current financial year. The State has accordingly given its willingness to participate in the auctions to be conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during the next three months. The RBI said the schedule for auction has been finalised in consultation with the State governments/Union Territories and the total quantum of the market borrowings during the quarter is expected to be Rs. 1.78 lakh crore. Accordingly, the State has confirmed its participation in the auctions for raising Rs. 4,000 crore in four instalments of Rs. 1,000 crore each and another Rs. 4,000 crore in two instalments of Rs. 2,000 crore each. The first of the auctions would be held on April 15 in which Telangana has decided to raise Rs. 1,000 crore. The quantum of OMB could increase if the government prefers to opt for the green shoe option and raise additional resources as part of the auctions. The State government had borrowed Rs. 12,500 crore during the first quarter ending June 30 last year owing to significant drop in revenue due to lockdown and the pace of economic activities remaining slow after the restrictions were lifted. The economic activities witnessed significant improvement since the third quarter of the previous financial year with Excise and Registration and Stamps departments contributing to the bulk of the revenues towards the end of the financial year. The government opted for open market borrowings in first quarter as it would need resources to fulfil its immediate commitments like additional burden of more than Rs. 800 crore every month for implementation of 30% fitment hike to all categories of employees from this month itself and crediting of the amounts into the accounts of over 60 lakh farmers under Rythu Bandhu. The first instalment of Rythu Bandhu expected to be credited into the farmers’ accounts for Kharif season (Vaanakalam) is expected to be around Rs. 7,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-to-raise-rs-8000-crore-through-omb-in-1st-quarter/article34268643.ece
08 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Collector to spend time at orphanage||The Telangana High Court on Wednesday directed Nalgonda District Collector Prashanth J. Patil to spend two hours on weekends for six months in an orphanage comprising 40 students in lieu of punishment in a contempt of court case. In a connected matter, the HC instructed Sandhya Rani, a retired District Supply Officer (DSO), to serve food to all the inmates of an orphanage within 10 kms of her residence on the coming Ugadi and Sriramanavami festival days. Nearly four years ago, a single judge imposed a fine of Rs. 2,000 each on Mr. Patil and Ms. Sandhya Rani, who were working then as Warangal district Joint Collector and DSO respectively, holding them guilty in a contempt of court case. A rice mill owner from Parvathagiri of Warangal filed a writ petition in 2015 alleging that revenue officials were not allotting any paddy to his mill for custom milling, having earlier registered a case for violations of licence conditions. The single judge passed an interim direction to authorities to allocate and deliver paddy to the petitioner’s mill for custom milling. A year later, the mill owner moved the HC again stating that the authorities were not complying with the HC order. The judge held Mr. Patil and Ms. Sandhya Rani guilty of contempt of court and imposed Rs. 2,000 fine each. Seeking to set aside the punishment, the two officers filed appeal petitions which came up for hearing on Wednesday before a Bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy. Declining to allow the appeals, the CJ suggested that the officers can do social service in lieu of punishment. The government counsel said that percentage of girl students in government schools was taking a dip. He said Mr. Patil would strive to induct 600 girls in government schools of Miryalaguda. However, the Bench turned down the proposal stating that it was Mr. Patil’s responsibility to do so being the District Collector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/collector-to-spend-time-at-orphanage/article34268330.ece
08 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP in Telangana merges with TRS||The two-member Telugu Desam Party was merged with the ruling TRS in the Assembly on Wednesday after they submitted a letter to Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy requesting him to recognise them as members of the ruling party. One of the two members, Sandra Venkata Veeraiah, had already unofficially quit TDP and announced his decision to join TRS last year. On Wednesday, it was the turn of the other member Mecha Nageswara Rao to announce his resignation from the party and join the TRS. Both Mr. Veeraiah and Mr. Nageswara Rao later met the Legislative Affairs Minister V. Prashant Reddy seeking to merge TDP with TRS. Mr. Reddy arranged their meeting with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao who, as TRS president, conceded the request and wrote to the Speaker to admit them into the party. They also met the Speaker to complete the formalities. After they handed over the letter to the Speaker, sources said the latter found merit in the proposal as it will not attract provisions of anti-defection law because the two members constituted the total membership of TDP in the Assembly. The law envisaged that two-thirds of members of a party were enough for effecting the merger. Legislature Secretary V. Narasimha Charyulu issued a bulletin formalising the merger wherein he said the Speaker had positively considered the two letters received from TDP members and the TRS president. They will now be allotted seats along with members of TRS in the Assembly. The strength of TRS in the 119-member Assembly went up to 104 with the latest addition. In June 2019, twelve of eighteen Congress members who constituted two-thirds of the party merged with the TRS in a development that led to the Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka forfeiting his position as Leader of Opposition. ‘Opportunistic move’ Meanwhile, the TDP Khammam Parliamentary Constituency president K. Venkateshwarlu flayed the decision of the TDP’s lone MLA in the State, representing Aswaraopeta constituency of Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, Mecha Nageswara Rao, to join the ruling TRS. He said Mr. Nageswara Rao had won the 2018 Assembly election from Aswaraopeta owing to the tireless efforts by the TDP cadres. Terming his reported decision to switch over to the TRS as an ‘opportunistic’ move under the garb of development, he demanded that Mr. Rao resign to his MLA post and seek re-election from Aswaraopeta Assembly constituency before joining the TRS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-in-telangana-merges-with-trs/article34268297.ece

08 April 2021||KANNUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Muslim Youth League worker murdered||Eleven accused have been identified in the murder case of a Muslim Youth League activist, District Police Chief (Kannur City) R. Elango has said. Mansoor, 22, a resident of Chokli Pullukkara, was killed in a clash around 8 p.m. on Tuesday, the election day. He was attacked by a group of more than a dozen people, who also hurled bombs, the police said. “We are investigating whether there was a conspiracy in the murder. A special team will be formed to investigate the case,” Mr. Elango said. CPI(M) activist Shinos, a neighbour of Mansoor, has been taken into police custody in connection with the clash. Brother too injured Though Mansoor was rushed to a hospital in Thalassery and later to a hospital in Kozhikode, he succumbed to his injuries around midnight. The police said the post-mortem report attributed the youth’s death to injuries sustained in bomb blast. His brother Muhasin was also injured in the attack and is undergoing treatment in a Kozhikode hospital. Muhasin told media that the gang had intended to assault him. They carried out the attack after confirming his name. He said the gang comprised DYFI members and he knew the attackers. Muhasin said his brother was attacked when he came to his rescue. Abdullah, father of Mansoor, said his son was hacked to death in front of him. The group dragged the elder son away. His younger son was beaten up when he tried to stop them. Abdullah said that though Mansoor was part of the Youth League, he was not active in politics. The attack reportedly followed a clash between IUML and CPI(M) activists at Mukilpeedika. Muhasin was the UDF agent in booth number 150. The clashes occurred allegedly after CPI(M) activists objected to the IUML workers bringing people for open voting. Muhasin was threatened during the polling. Muhasin was on his way home after polling when he came under attack. In Kasaragod, CPI(M) and BJP workers clashed soon after the polling. Yuva Morcha Kasargod district vice president Sreejith Parakkalayi was injured in an attack at Parakkalayi, Kanhangad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/muslim-youth-league-worker-murdered/article34268304.ece

Justice P.V. Asha issued the directive on petitions filed by S. Sarma, MLA, and Kerala Legislative Assembly Secretary challenging the ECI’s decision to keep in abeyance the proceedings for the proposed election. When the petition came up for hearing, counsel for the petitioners contended that the ECI had not stated the reasons or extraordinary circumstances for keeping the election proceeding in abeyance. There was a total lack of transparency in the ECI’s decision to postpone the election. Before April 21 Counsel for the ECI submitted that the notification would be issued before April 21. The election schedule would be announced in the notification and the ECI would act within the time frame stipulated by the Representation of the People Act.

08 April 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD plans vertical silos to store ghee||In an attempt to meet the increasing demand for its famed laddus, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has resolved to set up vertical silos for storing ghee at a cost of Rs. 4.15 crore. Four 27-kilolitre open type silos with a storage capacity of 24.5 metric tonnes have been proposed to be set up opposite the ghee tank shed on the northern side of the main temple. Average consumption The average consumption of ghee – the main ingredient of the laddus and other prasadams at the Lord Venkateswara temple—is around 13 metric tonne on a normal day, which goes up to 15 metric tonne on the days when devotee footfalls at the temple is more. At present, ghee is being stored in tanks and the total storage capacity of the tanks is about 82.40 metric tonnes, which is sufficient to meet the requirements of the temple for about six days. However, considering the growing demand for laddus, the TTD has resolved to set up an additional boondi making kitchen close to the one outside the temple complex, thereby increasing its production capacity from the present 3.75 lakh to about 6 lakh a day. It is against this back drop that it has rather become imperative on the part of TTD to go for the proportionate increase in the storage capacity of ghee, besides ensuring that the stock (ghee) lasts for at least 12 days even during the peak usage. Former dairy consultant and ghee committee member Vijay Bhaskar Reddy suggests vertical silos with scientific cleaning of the ghee tanks that works on ‘Clean In Place’ (CIP) mode instead of manual cleaning as it also saves time. The mechanical works including the design, manufacturing, supply, testing and commissioning of the silos are expected to cost around Rs. 3.20 crore, while the cost of the civil works such as construction of the required base for silos, RCC roof structure for (CIP) system and office rooms has been put around Rs. 95 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-plans-vertical-silos-to-store-ghee/article34268344.ece

BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra, who addressed various meetings on Wednesday as part of the campaign for Tirupati Lok Sabha bypoll, accused the volunteers of crossing their limits to work in support of the incumbent government. “Today, the West Bengal Government is on its way out, and it will be the turn of Y.S.

With each of the volunteers expected to reach out to 50 households, Mr. Patra wondered how could the government afford to pay the volunteers from the taxpayer’s hard-earned money. ‘Will contest polls’ Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao said the green signal given for the MPTC and ZPTC polls even as the model code of conduct issued by the Election Commission of India was in force was an incursion by a constitutional body into the domain of the other. “The BJP will contest the polls come what may,” he remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-likens-volunteer-system-in-ap-with-the-one-in-west-bengal/article34268825.ece

Artists of the TTD’s Annamacharya Project presented select ‘Annamaiah Sankirtans’, while some, dressed up as the poet and mythological characters, gave a spell-binding performance. The trek began at Padala Mandapam, with Hari Narayanacharyulu, a descendant of Annamacharya, performing Vedic rituals at the poet’s statue. As Annamacharya is believed to have been initiated into Sri Vaishnavism by the first seer of Sri Ahobila Mutt, its present pontiff Sri Ranganatha Yathindra Mahadesikan will participate in a special event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rituals-mark-trek-to-tirumala/article34268815.ece
08 April 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. apathy taking a toll on projects, says Panabaka||Former Union Minister and TDP candidate for the Tirupati (SC) Lok Sabha constituency has lamented the sluggish progress of projects sanctioned during her stint at the Centre. “In fact, several projects have either remained non-starters, or got stuck in the middle,” Ms. Lakshmi said while addressing a meeting on Wednesday. Citing the example of the NTPC-BHEL Power Projects Limited (NBPPL) plant at Mannavaram, she said, “The then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had laid the stone for the project. But, it is on the verge of closure now.” The Gudur flyover that remained incomplete, the Nadikudi-Srikalahasti railway line, land acquisition for the Gudur-Dugarajapatnam railway line, expansion of Renigunta railway station, and development of Tirupati airport into an international facility were all progressing at a snail’s pace, she alleged, and blamed the present government for not taking interest to complete them in a time-bound manner. Ms. Lakshmi observed that the 75% jobs for locals had turned out to be a myth, as the families that had sacrificed their lands for developing the Sri City industrial township had to be content with menial jobs, with ‘outsiders’ bagging a chunk of the jobs that needed skills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-apathy-taking-a-toll-on-projects-says-panabaka/article34268827.ece

In a letter to the DGP on Wednesday, Mr. Naidu alleged that the miscreants were apparently encouraged by the government’s ‘lukewarm response” to the temple attacks in the recent past. “The police, instead of arresting the culprits, are harassing the TDP leaders ,” Mr. Naidu alleged in the letter. “On April 6, the police picked up 40 TDP leaders and moved them from one police station to another without giving them food. They were served notices under Section 160. They belong to four villages. Former sarpanches and candidates for MPTC polls are among them. When a few party leaders went to the police station seeking justice, they too were booked,” Mr. Naidu alleged.

The plan was to sell 16 acres in the first phase.

Only 409 buses of a total fleet of about 23,000 made trips. Owing to restrictions on public gatherings due to the pandemic, workers did not hold any protest rally but stayed home and did not report to work. In many districts, Road Transport Corporation (RTC) officials failed to convince employees to report to duty. Normal life was hit in most parts of the State – Bengaluru, Old Mysore, Kalyana Karnataka, and Mumbai Karnataka regions – where the strike was almost complete. In the coastal belt, where private bus operators dominate the market, life was less affected. The four RTCs suffered a total loss of Rs. 17 crore on Wednesday, government sources said. Though the government roped in private transport operators, a large chunk of commuters seemed to have suspended their travel plans, since they were warned of the strike. 10-km walk However, the strike left many commuters, especially the poor and women, stranded across the State. Commute to work and home were severely impacted, especially pinching daily-wage earners. “We have to go to work or else lose pay. But private vans charged almost three times what they do regularly,” said Suma, a garment worker from Vidyaranyapura in Bengaluru. She walked for nearly 10 km on Wednesday. This was not an isolated case. In many parts of Bengaluru, people heading to work were either stranded or walked. Muniyappa, a painter from Tumakuru, walked from Bommanahalli to BTM Layout. Many said they could not afford private transport. Many heading to hospitals or with small children were particularly hassled. Panic flight Given that the call was for an indefinite strike, there was panic flight from the city, fearing they would be trapped for days to come. “I have to go back to my village in Madhugiri for a medical emergency in the family. Since the strike is said to be indefinite, I cannot afford to wait,” said Prashanth Kumar, a carpenter, waiting for a private bus at Jalahalli Cross in Bengaluru. The area saw huge crowds through the day waiting for private buses. Stranded midway While some could reach their destinations, others were struck midway and landed in taluk centres. Paravva Dodmani, who reached Kundagol, got stuck there. “I came by a private vehicle from Hubballi hoping I would get a private vehicle here. But, I waited for four hours as there were no vehicles to the villages,” she said. Some families, who had brought patients to the Bagalkot district hospital, were forced to sleep on the hospital premises as they could not go back to their villages. “I sent my son home and I am waiting for bus services to resume,” Meherjan Abiduddin, a farm labourer from Nidagundi, said. In Mysuru, Dheeraj K., a marketing executive, looked worried as he was unsure of getting a direct bus to Hubballi. “I have to break my journey, catching private buses from one place to another, to finally reach my destination. This affected my schedule as I cannot say when I can reach Hubballi,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-transport-workers-strike-hits-services/article34268296.ece

08 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Meeting of TS, AP to resolve bifurcation issues up in the air||A meeting convened by the Union Home Ministry to resolve the pending bifurcation issues between the two Telugu States, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, ended inconclusively with the Centre stressing the need for effective coordination between the two States to resolve amicably majority of the issues. Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, who chaired the meeting on Wednesday, reportedly said that the Centre would interfere in issues of extreme importance warranting its interference. But it was for the two States to take the initiative for amicably resolving other issues at their level. Finance department principal secretary K. Ramakrishna Rao, also secretary of State Reorganisation Affairs, explained TS’s stand on the pending bifurcation issues. Apportionment of assets and liabilities of Schedule IX and X institutions between the two States, payment of power dues by Telangana to AP Genco, division of Singareni Collieries Company Limited, division of Andhra Pradesh Bhavan in New Delhi and final allocation of DSP (civil), additional SP (civil) and SP non-cadre officers, were among other issues that figured in the more than one-hour video conference. The observation of CAG about pending apportionment of Rs. 1.51 lakh crore under capital heads and other amounts too, is said to have come up during the discussions. The Union Home Secretary is understood to have suggested that the two States could seek the cooperation of the CAG for reaching a broad agreement in this direction. While the meeting agreed that a decision on the division of assets of AP Bhavan was pending at the highest level (Chief Ministers of two States), the Union Home Ministry had suggested that the AP government seek clarification from the legal authorities on the division of SCCL. Senior officials said that the Attorney General had already clarified that SCCL belonged to Telangana on the basis of location of its entire operations in the State. The Centre, however, reiterated its stand that the two States should pro-actively find an amicable resolution to the stand-off on AP Heavy Machinery and Engineering Limited (APHMEL), a subsidiary of SCCL, located near Vijayawada in AP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/meeting-of-ts-ap-to-resolve-bifurcation-issues-up-in-the-air/article34268645.ece
08 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||First convocation of horticulture varsity held||The first convocation of Sri Konda Laxman Telangana State Horticultural University was held on Wednesday where Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, in her message, stressed the importance of horticulture sector as a major driver of growth. It was more remunerative because of its higher productivity compared to agriculture crops. The sector provided employment possibilities across primary, secondary and tertiary sectors and had potential for diversifying towards entrepreneurship, she added. Ms. Soundararajan said the current turnover of horticultural industry was reckoned to be at least Rs. 13.2 lakh crore at a conservative estimate and had potential to grow by leaps and bounds in the years to come. She called for massive investments in the sector and entry of major players of horticultural industry as India was set to emerge as a major exporter of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables. The investment in horticulture sector was expected to triple in the coming years to meet the increasing demand from a rapidly increasing global population. Referring to the position of Telangana in the sector, she said the State had the potential to increase its contribution towards the economy by way of exports as the area and production of fruits and vegetables had been increasingly steadily. The convocation address was delivered by Trilochan Mohapatra, secretary, Department of Agricultural Research and Education, and also Director General, Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

08 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Plea to restart suburban trains||The continuing stoppage of local suburban trains including MMTS trains from the lockdown of last year made the Suburban Train Travellers Association approach senior South Central Railway (SCR) executives to immediately start the services taking into consideration the needs of daily wage earners, vendors and general public on Wednesday. Association general secretary Noor Ahmed Ali submitted memoranda to Assistant General Manager Arun Kumar Jain and senior officials of works, electrical and operations departments, bringing to their notice the woes of suburban passengers living in Medchal, Bolarum and Malkajgiri areas due to lack of a proper public transport system for many years. It was pointed out that even 'DEMU' services were withdrawn from Jan.1/2019 and the MMTS Phase Two continues to be a non-starter due to the financial constraints and the government not releasing its share of the amount. Even passenger services on these sections have either been converted or cancelled with as many after considerable amounts have been spent on station buildings, extension of platforms, drinking water and toilet facilities.In this context, Mr. Ali pointed out that Malkajgiri had been an important station right from Nizam State Railway. Many South-bound trains originate in the morning and terminate at the Kacheguda station. But, it is very difficult to reach Kacheguda as there are no connecting local trains from any corner and passengers have to depend on private transport, he said. Railway authorities can consider running DEMU trains on Medchal-Malkajgiri-Secunderabad section or ‘modify’ the track at Sitaphalmandi to ensure that the trains are run between Sitaphalmandi-Bolarum to avoid waiting at outer signal. The plea was also to arrange halts to Ajanta, Rayalaseema, and Repalle-Kacheguda Express trains at Malkajgiri, the newly converted Kacheguda-Guntur Express can also be considered to be extended up to Medchal. He also requested running of MMTS trains from Lingampally to Umdanagar to connect to Patancheru and Hyderabad. The demands should be considered sympathetically on humanitarian grounds for providing better, safe and fast public transportation system services for weaker section people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/plea-to-restart-suburban-trains/article34268631.ece

08 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Mosquito menace leads to protest||On Tuesday, dozens of men raising slogans against Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation barged into the south zone office of the civic body. The men waved mosquito-swatting bats and demanded action against the nightly aerial menace that’s bedevilling large swathes of the city. “We cannot read, we cannot watch TV, we cannot entertain guests. Our whole focus is on killing mosquitoes and not getting bitten by them,” says Raza Abbas Zaidi, a resident of Noor Khan Bazaar, who led the protest. “We have peace only for a few hours in the daytime. Between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. we cannot step outside. We thought a new mayor will bring about some change but nothing is happening so we protested,” said Mr. Zaidi, who runs an NGO. The complaints about mosquitoes stretch the length and breadth of the Musi river and in areas abutting lakes and nalas. “Earlier, GHMC would carry out fogging activity every alternate day. Now there is nothing. I live near Salar Jung Museum. The whole area is covered in a cloud of mosquitoes in the evening. I think it is due to the garbage that is not being cleared regularly,” says Hyder Ali, who joined the protest on Tuesday. “Malakpet, Chanchalguda, Gowliguda, Dar-ul-Shifa, Dabeerpura and most areas in the Old City are affected by the mosquitoes,” says Mr. Ali According to GHMC officials the unseasonal spread of mosquito menace is due to stagnant water, both indoor and outdoor. “We have 185 lakes and domestic drainage is flowing into them. We are getting complaints and we are trying to redress them. The community should take charge. If apartments and households don’t release their domestic waste into water bodies the problem can be solved,” says an entomologist of GHMC. “We have deployed 11 drones, are cleaning up lake edges of water hyacinth, releasing gambusia fish into water bodies, desilting nalas and cleaning river Musi,” said the official listing measures of the civic body to control the menace. The stifling heat of summer and the mosquito menace has meant that citizens cannot even keep doors and windows open. “It's actually the first summer when the menace is this bad in the area. The mosquitoes appear to be some mutated species because no repellent is killing them. Can't even keep the doors and windows locked all the time because in this heat wave we do need some ventilation. And there's only so much relief we can find using bats,” says Maleeha Fatima, a resident of Hussaini Alam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-swatting-issue-this/article34268637.ece
08 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Covaxin demand high, stock low||Scores of people opting for immunisation against COVID-19 have been asking for Covaxin, but vaccination centres set up at government and corporate hospitals are running short of the stock. Senior officials in the Health department said that stocks of the city-based Bharat Biotech-developed vaccine are comparatively lower than that of Covishield, and appealed to beneficiaries not to differentiate between the two. Initial demand After the COVID-19 immunisation programme was launched on January 16, demand for Covishield was high. Gradually, however, the demand for Covaxin has spiked. Sources in the Health department also confirmed that vaccine beneficiaries have been insisting on the later. “A lot of people, including top officials, ask for Covaxin. First and second dose administered to a person should be of the same brand. As per norms, second dose of vaccine of one company has to be reserved after giving first dose of it so that we do not run out of stock,” sources in the department said. No new stock Sources in corporate hospitals said that they too have run out of Covaxin doses for the new set of beneficiaries. The type of vaccine available on a particular day is displayed at the vaccination sites in a few corporate hospitals here. “Out of every three doses, one is Covaxin and two are Covishield. The ratio is decided by the Central government. The availability of Covaxin is less across the country,” said a senior Health official, who added that the State has nine lakh doses of the two vaccines put together.  Out of every three doses, one is Covaxin and two are Covishield. The ratio is decided by the Central government.

From the current 50,000-60,000 a day, the government targets to immunise around 1.5 lakh persons daily. Health Minister Eatala Rajender said preparations to this effect have been activated. More tests Addressing a press conference at the State Health Campus here on Wednesday evening, he said daily testing to detect coronavirus would also be increased to 1 lakh. On Tuesday, 74,274 samples were examined as compared to the usual 56,000-64,000 samples. Prior to the press conference, the Minister held a review meeting with superintendents and directors of government healthcare facilities where COVID-19 patients are treated. The infrastructure and treatment provided were discussed at the meeting. Mr Rajender emphasised that there was no dearth of medicines at the facilities. He added that 90% to 95% of the cases were asymptomatic. He also mentioned that 99.5% of the patients have recovered, but urged people to continue wearing masks and observe COVID-appropriate behaviour. Stressing that rapid antigen tests has made it possible to find out results quicker, the Minister said the time saved is utilised to trace contacts immediately if one tests positive. Early detection helps in early treatment and quick tracing of contacts, thereby avoiding severity of the infection in a person, he said. Caution against overcharging Managements of private hospitals were urged not to scare or overcharge patients. Mr Rajender reiterated that COVID-positive persons isolating at home would be provided with medical kits, as it was being done earlier. Last year, however, there were complaints that some people in home isolation had not received the kits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-to-step-up-vaccine-coverage/article34268625.ece

Called the Medtronic Engineering and Innovation Center (MEIC), it is the largest such for the firm outside of the US. A global hub for development, testing and qualification for some of the most advanced and innovative technologies, it employs engineers currently in the areas of software development and testing, test automation, mechanical design, analysis and hardware. While unveiling plans to invest Rs. 1,200 crore over the next five years in August, the company had said the headcount of the centre will go up to 1,000 over the same period. Vice-president Indian Subcontinent and Minimally Invasive Therapies Group APAC Madan Krishnan said Medtronic has been in Hyderabad for about a decade. Its headcount stood at 400, with 150 professionals recruited in less than a year. The investment, he added, is likely to be made ahead of the timel-ine. Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao, who inaugurated MEIC, commended the company leadership for keeping their commitment with Telangana and India. The development “is surely going to energise the ecosystem for Medtech research in India,” he said, adding Medtronic joins a marquee list of companies, including Amazon, Google, Apple, Salesforce and Novartis, that have made Hyderabad their second largest home outside of the U.S. Noting that medical devices sector has been identified as one key focus sectors by the State government, Mr.Rao said Hyderabad’s position as the Life Sciences capital of the country is only getting strengthened by the day. The State government’s progressive policies and a stress on innovate, scale up and manufacture were contributing to the growth. The Minister appealed to the Centre to consider incentives and continued support to the companies which will engage in development of medical devices. Robust framework Union Pharmaceuticals Secretary S.Aparna, who addressed the event virtually, sought to highlight the growth prospects that exist for med devices sector in the country in the backdrop of the potential in terms of manpower, technology and institutions. The Centre had been supporting the sector in a “big way”. The country is also moving into a regulatory framework for the medical devices sector. “In the next few months, will see a transition to a stronger and robust regulatory framework,” something that the sector had also been pursuing and presents opportunity to create a strong network of certification, validation and testing facilities, she said. Medtronic chairman and CEO Geoff Martha and U.S. Consul General in Hyderabad Joel Reifman also addressed the event virtually.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/medtronic-scales-up-operations/article34268630.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao,” he alleged. Mr. Sravan also alleged that the CM was resorting to unethical, farce and manipulative politics through TNGOs to win the elections at any cost in Nagarjunasagar.

08 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Compile data of contempt cases against officials: HC||Telangana High Court on Wednesday directed the Registry to collate data of contempt of court cases being faced by Sangareddy Additional Collector Veera Reddy, Revenue Divisional Officer S. Srinu and Tahsildar U. Uma Devi. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy passed this direction while hearing appeals made by the three officers challenging a single judge order holding them guilty in a contempt of court matter. They were punished with two-month simple imprisonment and fine of Rs. 2,000 each. The counsel for the petitioners told the bench that affidavits filed by the officials tendering apology were presented in the court. The bench sought to know how many such contempt cases are being faced by the officials and directed the Registry to collect the data on the matter. The CJ observed that “...the State and its machinery shows scant regard to the orders of the court...then the court would also treat them with equal distinct.” Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy remarked that the officials seemed to have got confidence that they despite being punished in contempt of court cases can get away by filing an appeal. The CJ noted that if the officers think they can get away by filing an appeal, “then this court will shake and stir their confidence.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/compile-data-of-contempt-cases-against-officials-hc/article34268655.ece

08 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Two girls rescued, restored to parents||Two minor girls were rescued and restored to their parents due to the prompt action of Anti-Human Trafficking Unit and co-ordination with NGOs one based in Darjeeling and others based in the city. According to police sources, one of the minor girls who was undergoing training to become a beautician in Darjeeling was lured by Kaaynath Hussain and Faisal who promised her a job in a beauty parlour in Hyderabad. In order to mask the girl’s age, they secured a document proving four years of training and persuaded her parents to sign a few legal papers. As the COVID-19 lockdown was winding down, the girl was brought to Hyderabad in September 2020. But instead of being given work in a beauty parlour, the girl was made to do household chores. Finally, in February the girl managed to dial her parents about her plight. Initially scared about the financial liability of violating legal agreement, the parents of the girl reached out to Anugyalaya Dargjeeling Diocese Social Service Society. The child protection officer of Anugyalaya Darjeeling got in touch with Red Alert organisation and with the help of Pratham Council for Vulnerable Children managed to raise a police alarm. A team of AHTU led by Sub Inspector, Renuka Reddy carried out the rescue operation at Studio F Saloon, Near Shilpa Park, Kondapur.

The oustees from the submerging villages under Mallannasagar project had to vacate one by one to the R&R Colony, though the facilities were yet to be in place. According to sources, about 200 families from Vemulaghat village in Toguta mandal that waged a stiff fight with the government demanding implementation of Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act – 2013 (LA Act – 2013) vacated the village.

08 April 2021||Mumbai,||Sachin Vaze drops ‘letter bomb’; CBI to quiz him||The CBI on Wednesday received a court nod to question Sachin Vaze over corruption allegations against former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh as the suspended police officer dropped a “letter bomb” with damaging claims against him and Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab. In a related development, a report submitted by the Mumbai Police to the Home Department said Mr. Vaze was reinstated in the Crime Intelligence Unit in June last year on the insistence of the then police commissioner, Param Bir Singh, despite strong objection raised by the then Joint CP (crime). Mr. Vaze, in news since an SUV laden with explosives was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in February-end, has continued to hog the limelight with new revelations related to him and a clutch of important persons coming out almost daily. Mr. Vaze on Wednesday claimed Mr. Deshmukh had demanded Rs. 2 crore from him to continue his service in the Mumbai Police and alleged that Mr. Parab had asked him to collect money from some contractors in Mumbai. Mr. Parab rubbished Mr. Vaze’s claim. Mr. Vaze, who was reinstated in the police service last year, made the sensational claim in a letter which he tried to submit before a special NIA court. However, special judge P.R. Sitre refused to take his letter on record and asked him to follow the required procedure. The suspended assistant police inspector, an accused in the explosives case and the subsequent death of businessman Mansukh Hiren, is currently in the NIA custody. “I duly was reinstated in service on June 6, 2020. That soon after my reinstatement there were certain agitators (people, who wanted) to reverse the reinstatement. Apparently, then it was ordered by (NCP president) Sharad Pawar to again place me under suspension. That, at that time the then Home Minister sir (Mr. Deshmukh) also told me that he would convince Pawar saheb and for that purpose he (Mr. Deshmukh) asked me to pay Rs. 2 crore,” Mr. Vaze claimed in the four-page handwritten letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sachin-vaze-drops-letter-bomb-cbi-to-quiz-him/article34268549.ece

We had been warning people for months. The way the number of patients is rising, the government facilities are likely to run out of space. These are testing times and I urge all to not speak the language of conflict and to not fall prey to the provocation by anyone,” Mr. Thackeray said at a meeting with representatives of trader associations. The CM said that the government would ensure that no trader faced loss. “Such times tell who a friend is and who is a foe. We are together in this and our aim is to defeat the novel coronavirus,” he said. Mr. Thackeray’s appeal comes on a day when another delegation of retail traders met Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis to seek his intervention. Hoteliers too have come together to form United Hospitality Forum of Maharashtra (UHFM),which will be organising silent protests at restaurants across cities in Maharashtra on April 8.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/lockdown-is-not-against-anyone-cm-tells-traders/article34268550.ece

Everyone knows that the best way to beat the virus is to wear masks and follow social distancing. Please wear masks. I appeal to everyone,” Mr. Jain said. “Daily cases have gone above 5,000. The way cases are increasing, it could break the old record [of cases],” the Minister added.  Meanwhile, the surge in COVID-19 cases continued in the national capital with 5,506 new cases being reported in the last 24 hours — the highest in more than four months. The total number of cases stood at 6,90,568, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government. The last time more cases were reported was on November 24, when 6,224 cases were reported in a day. Twenty deaths were also reported in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of deaths to 11,133.

New cases were falling in early 2021 and on January 16, the number of daily new cases had dropped to 94. But it slowly increased to 200 on February 24 and it has been on the rise since. Mr. Jain also said that the night curfew has been imposed as the government had received reports that a lot of parties were happening. “At parties, people come into close contact and we want to avoid it,” he said. He said that Delhi’s positivity rate is still lower than other States and the government is focusing on containing it further. New trend “The new trend shows that people between 20 and 45 years are getting infected as they are more mobile. It seems that they are not heavily affected but the chances of the virus spreading increases when they go home, as their parents and other family members are exposed to risk. Therefore, we said that the vaccination should be rolled out to everyone barring age, as soon as possible,” Mr. Jain said. A total of 41,412 beneficiaries took the COVID-19 vaccination in the city till 6 p.m. on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/health-minister-warns-daily-cases-could-hit-a-new-peak/article34268543.ece
08 April 2021||New Delhi,||Officials demarcate loading zones in redeveloped stretch||Three to four loading and unloading zones will become operational on a pilot basis at Chandni Chowk ahead of the April 17 inauguration of the area’s redevelopment project, government officials said on Wednesday. Nine such zones have been demarcated along the 1.3-km pedestrianised stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid, said officials. The zones are among the most significant components of the project given the mixed residential and commercial nature of the area as well as the presence of wholesale heritage markets in and around its vicinity. Local shopkeepers too had been demanding clear delineation of such points. The stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid is being turned into a vehicle-free zone – no vehicles will be allowed between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. – though non-motorised vehicles will be allowed. There will be tree-lined footpaths on either side of the road as well as a wide central verge. Barriers are being installed to prevent motor vehicles from entering the pedestrianised area in addition to the installation of CCTV cameras to regulate such vehicles. Manual rickshaws Only manual rickshaws will be allowed on the redeveloped stretch which will be marked, regularised, and colour-coded. Their operators will be given badges so that unauthorised rickshaws cannot enter the area. Shopkeepers will be allowed to move goods only on these rickshaws which, however, will not be allowed to overtake each other. Meanwhile, government officials said the Public Works Department (PWD) has been directed to ensure that the redeveloped stretch, due to its proximity to the Red Fort, a World Heritage site, is maintained along similar lines post inauguration. The PWD will not only maintain the stretch on its own but also appoint a company for security, horticultural and sanitation services. The company engaged by the PWD for the purpose will be responsible for the upkeep of toilets, mechanical sweeping of the stretch cleaning of dustbins, the security of installations and care of tree avenues. Phase II of the project, revolving mainly around facade restoration of buildings on either sided the road, will get underway soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/officials-demarcate-loading-zones-in-redeveloped-stretch/article34268540.ece

08 April 2021||New Delhi,||AAP protests Centre’s move to export vaccine||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday protested near the BJP HQ against the Centre’s decision to export COVID-19 vaccine and demanded that the drug should be first made available free of cost to all Indian citizens. “The COVID-19 vaccine was not created in BJP HQ. This vaccine has been made by Indian scientists. Today, the number of cases in India is among the highest in the world due to which we are being defamed. People are losing their jobs and lives, and what exactly is our government doing? They are planning to export the vaccine to 68 countries only for the Prime Minister to gain applause,” AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said. The party said that AAP workers were stopped before reaching the BJP HQ by Delhi police. “Citizens 18-45 years old, people like me, who have to leave their homes daily, have to travel for work using different modes of transport to earn a living, our economy is running due to the contribution of each of us, we go out every single day, meet different people, come back home and may pose a threat to them as spreaders,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aap-protests-centres-move-to-export-vaccine/article34268544.ece
08 April 2021||Pune,||Only 3 days of vaccine stock left in Maharashtra: Tope||Warning that Maharashtra had only three days’ vaccine stock left, Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday urged the Centre to expedite the delivery of urgently needed vaccine doses to the State. Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Mr. Tope said that the State’s daily vaccination rate was the fastest in the country and that Maharashtra needed a stable supply of at least 40 lakh doses of COVID-19 vaccines each week. “At present, we just have 14 lakh vaccine doses, which will get over in the next three days. We have asked for 40 lakh more vaccine doses per week. At the moment, Maharashtra is reeling under a severe shortage with many districts and vaccination centres reporting that they have no doses to administer,” the Health Minister said. Mr. Tope also spoke of the various demands he made to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan during a two-hour videoconferencing with the health ministers of nine States on Tuesday evening. In a jibe at Union Minister Prakash Javadekar’s earlier remarks that Maharashtra was not utilising the vaccines given by the Centre, Mr. Tope said the State government had risen to the “challenge” evident in the minister’s provocative statements. “We have taken up this challenge. Each day, we are carrying out an average 4.5 lakh vaccinations and propose to take this figure to 6 lakh. Today, we are forced to shut vaccination centres and are compelled to tell health workers to go home because we do not have sufficient doses,” Mr. Tope said. At the same time, he clarified that while the Centre was not opposed to sending vaccines to Maharashtra, the speed of delivery was very slow. “I would like to say that Dr. Vardhan is a soft-spoken and helpful person. I have urged him to pay attention to Maharashtra and expedite delivery of vaccine doses,” Mr. Tope said. More than 85 lakh people in Maharashtra have been vaccinated so far since the roll-out of the inoculation drive.  Meanwhile, former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, the BJP Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, hit out at Mr. Tope, saying that Maharashtra had enough vaccine stock and that the ministers in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government ought to directly resolve any issues with the Centre instead of speaking to the media. “The allegation made by ministers and leaders in the State government regarding dwindling vaccine stocks is not true. Maharashtra has been given the highest number of vaccines in the country by the Central government. These things need to be discussed with the Centre instead of talking to the media,” Mr. Fadnavis said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/only-3-days-of-vaccine-stock-left-in-maharashtra-tope/article34268547.ece
08 April 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra touches new highs in cases, deaths||Maharashtra’s case surge continued to skyrocket as the State posted its highest-ever single-day jump of 59,907 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday as its active case tally breached the five-lakh mark to reach 5,01,559. The State also recorded an all-time high fatality spike of 322 deaths (128 of which were reported in the last 48 hours while the rest were from an earlier period) pushing the death toll to 56,652. Just 30,296 patients were discharged as the State’s recovery rate dipped to 82.36%. While the total case tally has now touched 31,73,261 the cumulative recoveries stand at 26,13,627. “Of a total 2,11,48,736 laboratory samples tested thus far, 31,73,261 (with the average case positivity rising to 15%) have returned positive with over two lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said, adding that the State’s case fatality rate had incrementally declined to 1.79%. Pune district recorded yet another staggering surge of more than 11,000 new cases to take its total case tally to 6,07,032. As per the State Health Department figures, 12 deaths were reported as the fatality count rose to 8,486. According to district authorities, however, the active case tally has surpassed 85,000 while the death toll has crossed 10,300. Mumbai, too, reported an unprecedented 10,442 new cases, taking its total tally to 4,83,042 of whom 83,185 are active. As many as 24 fatalities took the city’s death toll to 11,856. All major civic bodies, including Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli, in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region reported spikes of more than 1,500 cases. Nagpur district in Vidarbha added more than 5,700 cases as its total cases climbed to 2,59,341 of whom 59,595 are active.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-touches-new-highs-in-cases-deaths/article34268552.ece
08 April 2021||Islamabad,||Russia to supply military gear to Pakistan||Russia’s Foreign Minister on Wednesday said Moscow and Islamabad would boost ties in the fight against terrorism, with Russia providing unspecified military equipment to Pakistan and the two holding joint exercises at sea and in the mountains. Sergey Lavrov spoke on the second day of a two-day trip to Pakistan. It’s the first visit by a Russian Foreign Minister in nine years, part of an effort to improve ties. It comes as Moscow seeks to increase its stature in the region, particularly in Afghanistan. There, it has sought to inject itself as a key player in efforts to find a peaceful end to decades of war. “We stand ready to strengthen the anti-terrorist potential of Pakistan, including by supplying Pakistan with special military equipment,” Mr. Lavrov said, without going into detail about the equipment. Washington is reviewing an agreement it signed more than a year ago with the Taliban as it rethinks a May 1 withdrawal of its soldiers. Meanwhile, Moscow has stepped up its involvement in Afghanistan, emerging as a significant player. Last month, it hosted talks between the Taliban and senior government officials, and Mr. Lavrov suggested another high-level meeting could again be held in Moscow. Mr. Lavrov arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday from neighbouring India, with whom Moscow has had a long and solid relationship. The apparent reset in Pakistani-Russian relations, however, is by contrast a recent phenomena. In the 1980s, Pakistan was a staging arena for anti-communist Afghan rebels who were aided by the U.S. to oust the former Soviet Union, which negotiated an end to a 10-year occupation in 1989. Gas pipeline Russia is also building a gas pipeline between the southern port city of Karachi and eastern Lahore. Pakistan’s Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said Islamabad will also buy 5 million doses of the Russian made COVID-19 Sputnik V vaccine, and expressed a desire to eventually manufacture it in Pakistan. He said Pakistan also wanted Russian expertise to modernise its antiquated railway system as well as its energy sector. The visit underlines the waning influence of the U.S. in the region, while Russian and Chinese clout grows, says Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the U.S.-based Wilson Center. “There’s a good reason why this is the first Russian Foreign Minister visit to Islamabad for nearly a decade: Russia-Pakistan relations are on the ascent,” he said. He also noted a new 25-year development agreement between Iran and China. Pakistan also is a key player in China’s Belt and Road Initiative — a massive, cross-continental infrastructure development project aimed at expanding China’s commercial connections globally. “America will soon be ceding important real estate to its top rivals,” said Mr. Kugelman. “That’s the cost of an impending U.S. withdrawal from the region. But with the U.S. intent on pulling back, it is seemingly a cost it is willing to bear.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-to-supply-military-gear-to-pakistan/article34268234.ece
08 April 2021||Washington,||U.S. military cites rising risk of Beijing’s move against Taiwan||The American military is warning that China is probably accelerating its timetable for capturing control of Taiwan, the island democracy that has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war. The worry about Taiwan comes as China wields new strength from years of military buildup. It has become more aggressive with Taiwan and more assertive in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. Beijing also has become more confrontational with Washington; senior Chinese officials traded sharp and unusually public barbs with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in talks in Alaska last month. Tough choice A military move against Taiwan, however, would be a test of U.S. support for the island that Beijing views as a breakaway province. For the Biden administration, it could present the choice of abandoning a friendly, democratic entity or risking what could become an all-out war over a cause that is not on the radar of most Americans. The U.S. has long pledged to help Taiwan defend itself, but it has deliberately left unclear how far it would go in response to a Chinese attack. This accumulation of concerns meshes with the administration’s view that China is a frontline challenge for the U.S. and that more must be done soon — militarily, diplomatically and by other means — to deter Beijing. “We have indications that the risks are actually going up,” Adm. Philip Davidson, the most senior U.S. military commander in the Asia-Pacific region, told a Senate panel last month, referring to a Chinese move on Taiwan. “The threat is manifest during this decade — in fact, in the next six years,” he said. On Wednesday, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said the military threat against his country is increasing, and while he said it was not yet “particularly alarming,” the Chinese military in the last couple of years has been conducting what he called “real combat-type” exercises closer to the island.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-military-cites-rising-risk-of-beijings-move-against-taiwan/article34268236.ece
08 April 2021||Islamabad,||Backlash after Pakistan PM links rape to dress of women||Pakistan rights campaigners have accused Prime Minister Imran Khan of “baffling ignorance“ after the former cricketer blamed how women dress for a rise in rape cases. In a weekend interview, Mr. Khan said an increase in rapes indicated the “consequences in any society where vulgarity is on the rise”. “The incidents of rape of women... (have) actually very rapidly increased in society,” he said. He advised women to cover up to prevent temptation. “This entire concept of purdah is to avoid temptation, not everyone has the willpower to avoid it,” he said, using a term that can refer to modest dress or the segregation of the sexes. Hundreds of people signed a statement circulating online on Wednesday, calling Mr. Khan’s comments “factually incorrect, insensitive and dangerous”. “Fault rests solely with the rapist and the system that enables the rapist, including a culture fostered by statements such as those made by (Khan),” the statement said. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent rights watchdog, said on Tuesday it was “appalled” by the comments. “Not only does this betray a baffling ignorance of where, why and how rape occurs, but it also lays the blame on rape survivors, who, as the government must know, can range from young children to victims of honour crimes,” it said. Pakistan regularly ranks among the worst places in the world for gender equality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/backlash-after-pakistan-pm-links-rape-to-how-women-dress/article34268233.ece
08 April 2021||Tehran,||Iranian ship attacked in Red Sea, report says it was Israeli payback||An Iranian freighter was hit by an “explosion” in the Red Sea, Tehran said on Wednesday, after U.S. media reported Israel had struck the ship in retaliation for past Iranian strikes on its vessels. Iran was at pains to stress that the freighter was a civilian ship, although other sources said it had been used by Iranian commandos as a base for shipping protection and other duties in the area. The explosion comes at a sensitive time as U.S. President Joe Biden attempts to revive a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran which was strongly opposed by Israel and abandoned by his predecessor Donald Trump in 2018. The blast struck the “Iranian commercial vessel” MV Saviz off the coast of Djibouti on Tuesday morning, Foreign Ministry spokesman Said Khatibzadeh said, adding an inquiry had been opened into the cause. No causalities “The accident caused no casualties and a technical investigation is under way to determine its circumstances and origin,” he said. “Our country will take all necessary steps through international bodies in this regard.” Mr. Khatibzadeh said the Saviz was a “civilian vessel” that had been deployed in coordination with the International Maritime Organization to protect shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Many foreign governments have stationed protection vessels in the area since a rash of attacks by Somali pirates between 2000 and 2010. “This ship has been serving as Iran’s logistics station — for technical and logistical support — in the Red Sea,” the spokesman added.  The New York Times cited a U.S. official as saying Israel had informed Washington it had struck the ship in “retaliation for earlier Iranian strikes on Israeli vessels”. The paper said that according to the Israelis, “the Saviz had been damaged below the water line”. There was no immediate reaction from the Israeli authorities to the Times report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iranian-ship-attacked-in-red-sea-report-says-it-was-israeli-payback/article34268244.ece

But even as he expressed optimism about the pace of vaccinations, he warned Americans that the nation is not yet out of the woods, urging them to continue to wash their hands, socially distance and wear masks. “Let me be deadly earnest with you: We aren’t at the finish line. We still have a lot of work to do. We’re still in a life and death race against this virus,” Mr. Biden said on Tuesday. But he expressed hope that his announcement, that every adult will be eligible by April 19 to get in a virtual line to be vaccinated, will help expand access and distribution of the vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/all-adults-in-us-eligible-for-vaccine-from-april-19/article34268239.ece
08 April 2021||Tehran,||Rouhani says Vienna talks open ‘new chapter’||Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that talks in Vienna on rescuing a troubled 2015 nuclear deal had opened a “new chapter”. An Iranian delegation met on Tuesday with representatives of the remaining parties to the agreement to discuss how to bring Washington back into it and end crippling U.S. sanctions and Iranian countermeasures. U.S. President Joe Biden has said he is ready to reverse the decision of his predecessor Donald Trump to withdraw from the agreement and reimpose unilateral sanctions. But differences remain over the mechanics of the move as Tehran has since responded by suspending compliance with some of its own obligations under the deal. The U.S. was not present at the discussions because Iran has refused to meet the U.S. delegation so long as its sanctions remain in place. Instead, the EU acted as an intermediary, but all sides gave a positive assessment of the opening talks. “A new chapter has just been opened yesterday,” Mr. Rouhani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/rouhani-says-vienna-talks-open-new-chapter/article34268242.ece

Gone are reports of a “wicked plot” aimed at overthrowing King Abdullah II, and in the streets, Jordanians voiced relief. “When the crisis erupted on Saturday, there was no one in the streets. People were afraid,” said Shady, 41, who owns a clothing store in Amman. “But thank God, it was resolved within the royal palace.” Amman prosecutor Hassan al-Abdallat on Tuesday banned the publication of any information about the alleged plot said to involve Prince Hamzah, the king’s half-brother, in order to keep the security services’ investigation secret. The government had accused Prince Hamzah — a former Crown Prince who was sidelined as heir to the throne in 2004 — of involvement in a conspiracy to “destabilise the kingdom’s security” and arrested at least 16 people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/jordan-press-mute-prince-following-govt-order/article34268245.ece

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Deconstructing declarations of carbon-neutrality||At the latest count by the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), at the beginning of April, 32 countries had declared, in some documented form (https://bit.ly/3ungBAu), their proposed intention to achieve carbon neutral status by mid-century or thereabouts. Of these, only eight have any firm status, the rest being in the form of proposed legislation or mentions in policy documents. Since some months ago, the UN Secretary General has taken the lead in sparking off an international chorus, led by global civil society organisations based in the developed countries and encouraged by their governments, that is urging all countries, especially India, to make explicit declarations. Temperature goal The impetus for such declarations arises from Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement (https://bit.ly/3wzicF4) that states that “In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country Parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty”. The temperature goal referred to is the much better known declaration of intent of the Paris Agreement, of limiting temperature rise to well below 2°C and further pursuing efforts to restrict it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It is evident that the balance of emissions and removal of greenhouse gases is not sought on a country-wise basis but for the world as a whole. Though both developed country governments and civil society outfits commonly state this as an individual commitment by all countries, the text of the Paris Agreement clearly indicates, based on considerations of equity and differentiation, that this is a global goal. However, there are two, related and more critical, issues that are often ignored. The first is the compatibility of the intent of Article 4.1 and Article 2. Is the achievement of carbon neutrality compatible with achieving the 1.5°C or 2°C. goal? And whether the mid-century carbon neutrality goals of developed countries are compatible with Article 2.2 that declares that the Paris Agreement “will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances”. Current pledges fall short The hard scientific reality is that such a three-way compatibility between temperature goals, carbon neutrality, and equity is not only not guaranteed, but cannot be achieved for the 1.5°C temperature goal at all. And even for the 2°C goal, the current pledges are highly inadequate. This harsh conclusion follows from straightforward scientific considerations, based on the global carbon budget, which indicates the limits on global cumulative emissions, from the pre-industrial era to the time when net emissions cease, that correspond to definite levels of global temperature rise. According to the The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5° warming (https://bit.ly/39Sag8p), what remains of this global carbon budget from 2018 onwards, for a 50% probability of restricting temperature rise to less than 1.5°C, is 480 Giga-tonnes (billion tonnes) of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2eq). At the current rate of emissions of about 42 GtCO2eq per year, this budget would be consumed in 12 years. To keep within the 480 Gt budget, at a steady linear rate of decline, global carbon neutrality must be reached by 2039. While this is quite clearly infeasible, other pathways that either frontload or backload the period of most rapid decline have even greater barriers to realisation. For a 50% probability of restricting temperature rise to below 2°C, the budget is considerably more generous, amounting to about 1,400 GtCO2eq, that provides considerably greater room for manoeuvre. Emissions in the West But the hollowness of nation-level carbon neutrality declarations by developed countries is brought out more starkly when we consider the details, as in the case of the United States and the European Union. Emissions in the U.S. (not considering land use and land use change and forest related emissions) (LULUCF), peaked in 2005 and have declined at an average rate of 1.1% from then till 2017, with a maximum annual reduction of 6.3% in 2009, at the height of a recession. Even if it did reach net-zero by 2050 at a steady linear rate of reduction, which is unprecedented, its cumulative emissions between 2018 and 2050 would be 106 GtCO2, which is 22% of the total remaining carbon budget for the whole world — so high, that unless others reduced emissions at even faster rates, the world would most certainly cross 1.5°C warming. Indeed, if the U.S. has to stay within its fair share of the remaining carbon budget, it would have to reach net zero emissions (with linear reduction) by 2025. It would still owe a carbon debt of 470 GtCO2 to the rest of the world for having used more than its fair share of carbon space in the past. At a very moderate carbon price of $30 per tonne of CO2, this translates to a carbon debt of over $14 trillion, that the U.S. owes the world. Similarly, the European Union, to keep to its fair share of the remaining carbon budget would have to reach net zero by 2033, with a constant annual reduction in emissions. Individual countries will have different dates for a fair net zero — Germany’s is 2030. If the EU reaches net zero only by 2050 it would consume at least 71 GtCO2, well above its fair share. Either way, the EU owes the world a carbon debt of about $9.3 trillion (at the same price of $ 30/tCO2) for past emissions. Regrettably, a section of the climate policy modelling literature has promoted the illusion that this three-way compatibility is feasible through speculative “negative emissions”, ostensibly through dramatic expansion of carbon capture, primarily by the biosphere. They have also been promoting the other illusion that not resorting to any serious emissions increase at all is the means to guarantee the successful development of the Third World. India has no carbon debt India clearly should not join this game of carbon neutrality declarations, for a number of reasons. For one, India has to stay focused on development — both as its immediate need as well as its aspirational goal. While sustainability is desirable, the question of how low India’s future low-carbon development can be is highly uncertain. India’s current low carbon footprint is a consequence of the utter poverty and deprivation of a majority of its population, and not by virtue of sustainability. Second, India does not owe a carbon debt to the world. India’s emissions (non-LULUCF) are no more than 3.5% of global cumulative emissions prior to 1990 and about 5% since till 2018. Nor are India’s current annual emissions such as to seriously dent the emissions gap between what the world needs and the current level of mitigation effort, even as India’s mitigation efforts are quite compatible with a 2°C target. Any self-sacrificial declaration of carbon neutrality today in the current international scenario would be a wasted gesture reducing the burden of the developed world and transferring it to the backs of the Indian people. Much of the argument for India declaring a target year for net-zero derives unfortunately from some form of climate hubris, accompanied by the hype that India risks being “left out” of some imagined global convergence in the climate arena. One variant of the hubris sees India taking the lead in some global ecological alternative driven by frugality, minimal consumption and little technological advance. Another imagines that India will somehow, in very short order, emerge as a global leader of green manufacturing and industry. While the latter is belied by the character of India’s overall growth trajectory, the former is clearly socio-politically infeasible and morally unacceptable. India’s twin burden of low-carbon development and adaptation to climate impacts, is onerous and no doubt requires serious, concerted action. India’s approach to eventual net-zero emissions is contingent on deep first world emissions reductions and an adequate and unambiguous global carbon budget. Meanwhile, India must reject any attempt to restrict its options and be led into a low-development trap, based on pseudo-scientific narratives. T. Jayaraman is with the M.S.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||For Lok Adalats, speed overrides quality||Justice delayed is justice denied. Access to justice for the poor is a constitutional mandate to ensure fair treatment under our legal system. Hence, Lok Adalats (literally, ‘People’s Court’) were established to make justice accessible and affordable to all. It was a forum to address the problems of crowded case dockets outside the formal adjudicatory system. The first National Lok Adalat (NLA) of 2021 will be held on April 10. As of now, Lok Adalats have been functioning for 38 years, but have they performed efficiently? Do they empower the poor or coerce them to accept unjust compromises? Do they trade justice off for high settlement numbers and speed, ignoring the old dictum that justice hurried is justice buried? Have we tailored a dual system of justice dispensation, where the formal legal system, i.e., the court, is meant only for the rich and powerful, as was recently stated by former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi? These questions are worth consideration. Lok Adalats had existed even before the concept received statutory recognition. In 1949, Harivallabh Parikh, a disciple of Mahatma Gandhi, popularised them in Rangpur, Gujarat. The Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, inserted Article 39A to ensure “equal justice and free legal aid”. To this end, the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, was enacted by Parliament and it came into force in 1995 “to provide free and competent legal services to weaker sections of the society” and to “organise Lok Adalats to secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice on a basis of equal opportunity”. A dispute resolution avenue As an alternative dispute resolution tool, Lok Adalats are regularly organised to help parties reach a compromise. Motor-accident claims, disputes related to public-utility services, cases related to dishonour of cheques, and land, labour and matrimonial disputes (except divorce) are usually taken up by Lok Adalats. The State Legal Services Authorities (SLSAs) have been organising Lok Adalats on a daily, fortnightly and monthly basis. Data from the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) show that Lok Adalats organised across the country from 2016 to 2020 disposed of 52,46,415 cases. Similarly, National Lok Adalats (NLAs) organised under the aegis of NALSA settle a huge number of cases across the country in a single day. For instance, NLAs conducted on February 8, 2020, disposed of 11,99,575 cases. From 2016 to 2020, NLAs have disposed of a total of 2,93,19,675 cases. The Indian judicial system is often lambasted, perhaps justifiably, for its endemic delays and excessive backlogs. As per the National Judicial Data Grid, 16.9% of all cases in district and taluka courts are three to five years old; for High Courts, 20.4% of all cases are five to 10 years old, and over 17% are 10-20 years old. Furthermore, over 66,000 cases are pending before the Supreme Court, over 57 lakh cases before various HCs, and over 3 crore cases are pending before various district and subordinate courts. Justice V.V.S. Rao, former judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, calculated a few years ago that it will take around 320 years to clear the existing backlog of cases. As a result, litigants are forced to approach Lok Adalats mainly because it is a party-driven process, allowing them to reach an amicable settlement. When compared to litigation, and even other dispute resolution devices, such as arbitration and mediation, Lok Adalats offer parties speed of settlement, as cases are disposed of in a single day; procedural flexibility, as there is no strict application of procedural laws such as the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872; economic affordability, as there are no court fees for placing matters before the Lok Adalat; finality of awards, as no further appeal is allowed. This prevents delays in settlement of disputes. More importantly, the award issued by a Lok Adalat, after the filing of a joint compromise petition, has the status of a civil court decree. As per data from NALSA, subject matter-specific NLAs were organised in 2015 and 2016 on a monthly basis. Therefore, each NLA dealt with a specific type of dispute on a single day, each month. However, from 2017, this practice was discontinued. Thereafter, each NLA has been handling all types of cases on a single day. This was done to reduce the costs of organising the NLAs, and more importantly, to allow parties more negotiation time. But this, in turn, led to a significant drop in the number of cases settled. In 2015 and 2016, ten NLAs were held each year that disposed of 1,83,09,401 and 1,04,98,453 cases respectively. In 2017 and 2018, the number of NLAs dropped to five, with 54,05,867 and 58,79,691 cases settled respectively. In 2019, four NLAs were organised, and they disposed of 52,93,273 cases. In 2015, the average number of cases settled per NLA was 18,30,940, which came down to 10,81,174 in 2017, but rose to 11,75,939 in 2018, and 13,23,319 cases in 2019. This throws up questions about the efficiency of NLAs. The data show that the average number of cases disposed of per NLA since 2017 has gone up even when the number of NLAs organised each year has reduced. This proves that on average, the system is certainly efficient. To overcome the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, e-Lok Adalats were organised at both national and State level. However, the first national e-Lok Adalat was conducted both physically and virtually using videoconferencing tools, and it disposed of 10,42,816 cases. But this was less than the average of settled cases in 2017, 2018, and 2019. This suggests that the performance of the NeLA was less efficient than physical National Lok Adalats organised in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, who chairs the SC’s e-Committee, recently published the draft of phase three of the e-Courts project. Once implemented, it may prove to be a game-changer in improving the efficiency of the adjudicatory process. Conciliatory role However, besides efficiency and speed, Lok Adalats both online and offline should focus on the quality of justice delivered. The Supreme Court, inState of Punjab vs Jalour Singh (2008), held that a Lok Adalat is purely conciliatory and it has no adjudicatory or judicial function. As compromise is its central idea, there is a concern, and perhaps a valid one, that in the endeavour for speedy disposal of cases, it undermines the idea of justice. In a majority of cases, litigants are pitted against entities with deep pockets, such as insurance companies, banks, electricity boards, among others. In many cases, compromises are imposed on the poor who often have no choice but to accept them. In most cases, such litigants have to accept discounted future values of their claims instead of their just entitlements, or small compensations, just to bring a long-pending legal process to an end. Similarly, poor women under the so-called ‘harmony ideology’ of the state are virtually dictated by family courts to compromise matrimonial disputes under a romanticised view of marriage. Even a disaster like the Bhopal gas tragedy was coercively settled for a paltry sum, with real justice still eluding thousands of victims. A just outcome of a legal process is far more important than expeditious disposal. With Justice N.V. Ramana’s elevation as the new Chief Justice of India, it is hoped that he would take some concrete and innovative steps in improving the quality of justice rendered by National Lok Adalats.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Abortion is a woman’s right to decide||Given the phenomenal expansion in feminist jurisprudence over the last decade, particularly on the issue of a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion, it now appears quite plain that the central government’s amendment to the abortion laws not only retains the traditional notion that the state must intervene and decide for women as to when and in what circumstances abortions may be carried out, but even the pathetic measures set out in the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act 2021 are too little and have come too late. After much stonewalling This government seems to be incompetent in understanding a woman’s right over her own body. The government’s conduct is particularly appalling since it comes after over a decade of procrastination and obstruction where indigent women in difficult circumstances tried to have abortions done and were stonewalled by government officials and prosecutors. The passing of this Act marks a new phase of the struggle to assert the absolute right of a woman over her body. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 (MTP) may have been considered progressive at that time considering that provisions in the Indian Penal Code regarding termination of pregnancy were enacted over a century ago in keeping with the British law on the subject. Abortions were made a crime and the woman concerned and her doctor would invariably land up in jail. Section 3 (https://bit.ly/3dFBgZH) put an outer limit of 20 weeks on the length of the pregnancy and required two doctors to certify that the continuation of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the woman or grave injury to her physical or mental health or that there was a substantial risk that the child born would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. Explanation 1 dealt with rape cases where it was to be presumed that the anguish caused would constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the woman. Explanation 2 laid down that any pregnancy occurring as a result of failure of contraception would likewise be presumed to constitute a grave injury. Account needed to be taken of the pregnant woman’s actual or reasonably foreseeable environment. Section 5 created an exception to the 20 week limit whenever such an abortion was immediately necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman. The 1971 Act was based on “The Report of the Shantilal H. Shah Committee to Study the Question of Legislation of Abortion” 1967, which set out the limitations of technology which made it hazardous for women to have abortions done after the 20th week. This limitation disappeared with the phenomenal improvement in technology and processes rendering it possible to carry out abortions safely right up to full term. Thus the excuse of “safety of the woman” was no longer tenable to be used for restricting women’s rights. The after-effect The central government has been criminally negligent in allowing the law to stand as it has for five decades. It has pushed women seeking abortions underground where terminations are carried out in unhygienic and dangerous places, and in horrific situations. Even today about 800,000 illegal and unsafe abortions are performed every year in India, many of them resulting in morbidities and death. The government has not cared. Political parties of all hues had one thing in common; women dying do not matter. The decision of the Bombay High Court in Nikita Mehta vs State of Maharashtra , saying that it was not open for the courts to double guess the statutory restrictions, sparked the debate around the right to abortion in India. From 2008 onwards, over 300 petitions were filed in the Supreme Court and the High Courts. Given the gruesome context from which these petitions sprung the Supreme Court generally responded well by ignoring the statutory provisions as it was patent that not allowing abortions to take place would have caused grave injustice to the woman. The Court then routinely allowed abortions way past the 20 week limit. In Murugan Nayakkar vs Union of India & Ors , the abortion was permitted at 31 weeks, very close to full term. The  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act 2021  fails miserably on the main count while introducing few collateral progressive measures. First, the Act fails to recognise the absolute right of a woman over her body in taking decisions regarding abortions and reproductive health. It still reserves to the state the right to dictate to the woman that she cannot have an abortion at will. Second, even though the limit has been pushed back from 20 to 24 weeks, this comes with the same state conditionalities as before. Third, 24 weeks is not rational given today’s technology where abortions can be done safely up to full term. Medical boards are obstacles By far the biggest failure of the government lies in enacting section 3(2B) which requires the pregnant woman to approach a medical board in cases of substantial foetal abnormalities and where she has crossed the 24 week limit. These boards impose insurmountable obstacles to the woman seeking late abortions. First, what used to be an exchange between the pregnant woman and her gynaecologist who would take a decision as to safety, has now been replaced by a board of a minimum of three doctors. This is totally unnecessary and breaches privacy. Second, and this is indicative of complete non-application of mind, the Act provides in section 3(2C) for a single board for a State. Given the millions of abortions taking place in India past the deadline, it is impossible for one board to handle all cases. Third, assuming multiple boards will be established, the records show that no State has the finances or the human resources to maintain the operation and functioning of these boards. Fourth, the right to seek termination is restricted to “such category of women as may be prescribed by rules”. One wonders what categories of women would be permitted termination of pregnancies! The main objection remains; that boards are totally unnecessary and an invasion of privacy, and pregnant women, like they used to do, should be left alone to consult their gynaecologist in late term pregnancies and carry out their abortion under the certificate of their own gynaecologist that the abortion can be performed safely. This is the trend worldwide and in the courts. The Indian government needs to wake up and educate itself on women’s emancipation worldwide.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The art of regulation||The passing away of G.V. Ramakrishna (GVR), the first Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in its statutory avatar, is not an occasion to mourn, but to celebrate a life of public service that was exemplary in its sweep and its incisiveness. It is also a good occasion to reflect on regulatory philosophy and temperament. At the outset, it is necessary to look at the objective of regulation. In an unregulated space, physical, intellectual or financial muscle often enables stronger elements to claim a disproportionately large territory of activity and influence. The level playing field that regulators are tasked to maintain is the best enabler that an ordinary person has.  It is important for regulatory organisations to understand ground-level realities, and to respect the view that they are, at best, important supporting actors in the theatre of wealth creation and distribution. Provisions that exist in law and regulations must be enforced in an appropriate manner and at an appropriate time to send out signals to the rest of the regulated universe that transgressions will not be tolerated. At this juncture, it is useful to reflect on GVR’s approach. In its early days, SEBI did not have the powers that are now vested in it. At the same time, GVR had to get the broking universe to behave in a manner that did not disrupt markets but discouraged rogue elements. It is widely believed that he persuaded brokers to believe that SEBI had powers that it actually did not have, and the fear that he would be exercising these (non-existent) powers kept them largely within the confines of good conduct and behaviour. It follows that good intentions can be enforced, even when legislative backing does not exist. Fast forward to the period between 2005 and 2007 — SEBI, though fully conscious that it did not have express powers of disgorgement, ordered the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains on the principle that a regulator should not countenance the existence of unjust enrichment. Similarly, in the absence of any specific provision in law, the regulator introduced the ‘consent’ scheme, based on the ‘settlement’ scheme in the United States, to clear the pipeline of relatively minor and often technical violations, so that the manpower and expertise available within the organisation could focus on systemically important large cases. Underlying this approach was the firm belief that between what is prescribed and what is proscribed, there is a wide space within which well-intentioned persons can intervene. Fear and respect Persons in regulatory organisations are often in the position of judges, having to decide on matters on the basis of evidence produced before them. In this exercise, natural justice as manifested in the audi alteram partem (hear the other side) principle is a non-negotiable requirement. SEBI, over the years, has passed orders suspending persons from participating in the market with immediate effect. The penalty kicks in before a person who has been found guilty has had an opportunity to appeal against the impugned order. One such case, which came to the notice of the then Chairman, was the order passed by SEBI in the IPO scam matter of 2003-05. That order, running into more than 100 pages, was shown to the Chairman before it was put up on the website. Two material corrections were made after reading only the last (operative) part of the order. In one correction, the direction to “change the management of the depository” was reworded as “revamp the management”. The second, and more important change, was to build into the order an immediate post-decisional hearing by giving the affected party the opportunity to appeal within 15 days of the order. This led to a few review applications, and SEBI itself overturning the order, in regard to those cases, in a matter of a few days, thus avoiding severe punishment such as suspension from the market to persons who were not in default.   It is normal for a regulator at the commencement of their term to seek to evoke fear in the community, so that it is clear whose writ runs in the market. Over time, the attempts to balance conflicts in public interest and find appropriate solutions should move the response from fear to respect. When persons heading regulatory organisations leave, the affection that they carry with them is the proverbial icing on the cake. When looking for persons to head senior positions in regulatory organisations, the essential attributes should be impartiality, objectivity, autonomy (as distinct from independence), and the ability to operate without fear or favour. G.V. Ramakrishna must have walked out of SEBI decades ago knowing that the icing on the cake would not melt for several years.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A way forward for trans persons||No less than 13 members of the transgender community have been selected recently as constables under the Chhattisgarh police. This is truly historic and thrilling for a community that had no legal recognition till the Supreme Court inNALSA vs. Union of India (2014)ruled that transgender persons have the right to decide their self-identified gender. The binary notion of gender, which denied equal protection of law to transgenders, was rejected and the required relief was provided by the top court. The transgenders, now in khaki, will be the first responders in handling law and order situations and others’ grievances. Though each of the selected persons has their own painful stories of abuse, discrimination and abandonment, their induction into the police force is a vital message to people that they are as physically and mentally competent as others. This is more significant in the backdrop of the fact that there was no reservation for the transgender community as a separate category. This may, hence, help in changing the perception of people who think of them as a fearful entity with a stigma of identity, disability, criminality, or untouchability. Earlier, a few transgenders were inducted into the Tamil Nadu police too. The journey of transgender people has indeed been a long struggle. However, soon after the 2014 Supreme Court judgment, the Chhattisgarh government constituted the Third Gender Welfare Board to take up various welfare measures in favour of trans people. Instructions were issued to all departments to include ‘third gender’ as an option (along with male and female) in official documents that require mentioning the gender or sex of a person. District-level committees were constituted to identify members of the transgender community so that welfare schemes could be implemented for their benefit. Sensitisation workshops were organised at State and district levels by the police department and police officers were apprised about the Central law and the Supreme Court’s ruling on transgenders. Training capsules were prepared for police training institutes with the help of transgender members of the Welfare Board. Further, after the announcement of vacancies, the police not only permitted the use of their sports ground for practice, but also helped them in preparing for the written examination. However, ultimately, it was the hard work of the transgender people themselves which ensured their success and marked their presence in the department. International conventions The recently enacted Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, which paved the way for issuing a certificate of transgender identity, is in spirit with international conventions, particularly the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966, and the Yogyakarta Principles, 2006. The Act recognises that transgender persons have a legal right to self-perceived gender identity in accordance with the principle of the “Psychological Test” instead of the “Biological Test”. According to law, transgender persons cannot be discriminated against in any matter relating to employment by any establishment. In another recent judgment, the Kerala High Court allowed a petition moved by a transwoman seeking admission into the National Cadet Corps based on her self-claimed gender identity. The court held that the provisions of the NCC Act cannot preclude the operation of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act. Thus, this new protective Central legislation has given a new lease of life to the whole community. The selected trans recruits are excited to start their new innings of life with novel challenges, but a lot more needs to be done to bring about changes in the perception of people towards this marginalised community. The law must be implemented in letter and spirit to fulfil its objective. At the same time, society needs to erase its biases and accept transgender people as equal human beings with humility.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Staying accommodative||Armed with a renewed mandate to contain inflation within a 2 percentage point range of the target 4%, and mindful of the pandemic’s latest wave, the RBI’s monetary policy committee has opted to reaffirm its growth-supportive “accommodative stance” and keep interest rates unchanged. The MPC, which met for the first time in the new financial year, also maintained its projection for GDP expansion in the current fiscal at 10.5%, notwithstanding the risks to the forecast from the current upsurge in novel coronavirus cases and associated localised lockdowns. Explaining the rationale for its policy stance of being prepared to stay accommodative for ‘as long as necessary’ to ensure that economic growth becomes ‘durable’, the committee was unambiguous that its actions were born of the need to stay supportive at a time when there was a real threat that “the renewed jump in COVID-19 infections... could dampen the demand for contact-intensive services, restrain growth impulses and prolong the return to normalcy”. That consumer confidence has dipped, as the MPC noted, is a clear sign that uncertainty clouds the outlook for growth. Add to this the fact that IHS Markit’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) survey for March revealed that business sentiment had slid to a seven-month low, even as the research firm’s subsequent India Services PMI report showed both manufacturers and services companies continued to shed jobs for a thirteenth month. With jobs and incomes remaining under stress for millions, and uncertainty over the efficacy and safety of the vaccines persisting even as authorities seek to ramp up the immunisation drive, it is hard to foresee consumption demand rebounding to pre-COVID levels any time soon. The MPC’s central remit on inflation also remains a concern. Core inflation, the panel observed, had hardened across the board and increased by 50 basis points to touch 6% in February. The RBI is cognisant of the fact that there are both upside and downside pressures that may impact the trajectory of retail inflation. Governor Shaktikanta Das has flagged the critical significance that this year’s monsoon rains will have on food prices, which have been a recent source of upward pressure on price stability. And both Mr. Das and the broader committee have stressed the vital need for the Centre and States to initiate some coordinated action to ease the tax burden on petroleum products, given the ripple ‘second-round’ effects that the high costs of transport fuels have on overall inflation. High international commodity prices and logistics costs are also threatening to push up input costs across the manufacturing and services sectors, posing a real challenge to policymakers, given that it is far harder to influence these variables. With the RBI’s own March survey on inflation expectations showing that urban households expect prices to accelerate over a one-year horizon, monetary authorities can ill afford to drop their guard on price stability. For, at stake is their hard-earned credibility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/staying-accommodative/article34268214.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Falling short||Easter has not brought good tidings to India. The number of daily new cases has risen by over a 100,000 — twice in three days. Delhi and Maharashtra have imposed night curfews, an idea, that is so shorn of evidence as being a deterrent to transmission that it only signifies panic. There is unalloyed acknowledgment at the Centre that India is in the midst of deep crisis and the blame has been squarely laid on the people who are not following ‘COVID-appropriate behaviour’. In January, India rushed through two vaccines and sought to give the impression that it was the vaccine manufacturing hub of the world and could provide for its own vast population as well as for the world outside. However, with the national second wave that began in March and growing public clamour for making the vaccine available to all adult Indians, the government is singing a different tune: that vaccines were not to be given by want but to be dispensed by need. Those who are most vulnerable to the disease: health-care workers, frontline workers, the elderly and those with comorbidities surely have the first right to protect themselves against the disease. The Serum Institute of India, unlike India’s public sector vaccine companies that have largely shut down, is a private contractor for whom India is just another buyer. It can manufacture no more than 65 million doses a month and there is only a vague assurance that “most” of it would be for Indians. Covaxin constitutes less than 10% of India’s vaccine portfolio and in March the Centre had ordered only 20 million doses more. Both firms have demanded that the government provide additional funds to expand manufacturing to enable more vaccines to Indians and the SII has also demanded a higher per vaccine price to guarantee prioritised supply. India has hit a record of administering 4 million doses a day — a significant number by global standards — and were this to increase given the widening public anxiety over the second wave, there is a need to replenish stocks every 10 days. Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have been complaining of vaccine shortages though the Centre is adamant that there isn’t one. While it is true that most countries have prioritised their health-care workers, they have also moved to rapidly expand access without barriers within. Several states in the United States, and Israel have unfettered access and the U.K. too has said it will prioritise its own needs before exporting. Therefore, the government must realistically clarify on its supply line and endeavour to accelerate universal vaccine access.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/falling-short/article34268215.ece

A New China News Agency broadcast heard in Tokyo to-day said the Chinese Embassy in India filed a strong protest with the Indian Government yesterday on the Indian action. The Chinese note said, “while flagrantly interfering in the internal affairs of Pakistan, the Indian Government has gone so far as to connive at the wilful trouble-making by Indians in front of the Chinese Embassy.” Peking’s official stand against India on the turmoil in East Pakistan followed an appeal by the Soviet President, Mr. Nikolai Podgorny, on Saturday night to the Pakistan President Gen. Yahya Khan, urging him to “stop bloodshed and the repression of the populace of East Pakistan”. The Chinese note dated April 6 said in the afternoon of March 29, several hundred Indians frantically shouted slogans against Chinese leaders in front of the Chinese Embassy and posted a ‘protest’ on the Embassy gate and plate “slandering China as aiding Pakistan Government in its war on the freedom-loving people of East Bengal”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/india-rejects-chinas-protest/article34268225.ece

Accordingly, NABARD will be provided a special liquidity facility (SLF) of Rs. 25,000 crore for one year to support agriculture and allied activities, the rural non-farm sector and non-banking financial companies-micro finance institutions, the RBI said. An SLF of Rs. 10,000 crore will be extended to the National Housing Bank for one year to support the housing sector. SIDBI will be provided Rs. 15,000 crore under this facility for up to one year for funding of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). All three facilities will be available at the prevailing policy repo rate. Signalling the importance of Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) to deal with bad loans, the RBI said it would constitute a committee to undertake a comprehensive review of the working of ARCs in the financial sector ecosystem and recommend suitable measures for enabling such entities to meet the growing requirements of the financial sector. It said while ARCs had grown in number and size, their potential for resolving stressed assets was yet to be realised fully. A six-month extension to September 30 for Priority Sector Lending (PSL) classification for lending by banks to NBFCs for ‘on-lending’ to sectors that contribute significantly to the economy in terms of export and employment — has been approved. This would provide an impetus to NBFCs providing credit at the bottom of the pyramid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbi-extends-fresh-support-of-rs-50000-cr-to-nabard-others/article34268188.ece

This is absolutely untrue and inaccurate,” Mr. Agarwal posted on Twitter, reacting to tweets and a document circulated on social media. “A claimant is seeking INR 16 Lakhs (USD 22k) from OYO’s subsidiary leading to a petition at NCLT,” he tweeted. Mr. Agarwal asserted that OYO had paid the amount, which had already been banked by the claimant “under protest”. OYO has also challenged the NCLT order against its subsidiary (OHHPL) for the amount of Rs. 16 lakh. “OYO is recovering from the pandemic steadily and our largest markets are operating profitably,” the firm’s CEO added. “We are surprised to hear that the Hon’ble NCLT has admitted a petition against OHHPL, a subsidiary of OYO for Rs. 16 lakh in a contractual dispute, which dispute is not even with this subsidiary,” an OYO spokesperson said. “We have filed an appeal. The matter is sub-judice and we would refrain from commenting further on the merits of the matter at this stage.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/oyo-says-unit-facing-claim-at-nclt-has-filed-appeal-in-case/article34268207.ece

08 April 2021||MUMBAI,||Bank stocks lift Sensex as investors cheer RBI’s tack||Investors joined industry groups, fund managers and bankers in welcoming the RBI’s growth-supportive monetary policy on Wednesday with a rally in banking stocks lifting the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex. The 30-share Sensex jumped 460.37 points, or 0.94%, to close at 49,661.76. Banks led the gains with State Bank of India climbing 2.25% and ICICI Bank advancing 2.05%. “The momentum [in the market] accelerated post the RBI monetary policy as lot of banking counters started rebounding sharply,” said Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking. “The up move was mainly propelled by the banking space,” he added. ‘Explicit guidance’ “The RBI policy statement is a clear commitment to assuage uncertainties in the market through guaranteed, continued liquidity support and explicit guidance to navigate through the current COVID surge, the duration of which is uncertain,” said SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara. “Permitting banks to co-lend through NBFCs and bringing it under PSL guidelines will broad-base lending,” he added. The RBI on Wednesday stressed that as part of retaining its accommodative policy stance, it would stick to its commitment to ensure ample system liquidity. As part of its liquidity measures it said it was putting in place a secondary market G-sec acquisition programme or G-SAP 1.0. “Indian market is invigorated by RBI’s long-term dovish stance till the economy reverts to normalcy,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. “A big cheer is the G-Sec buying program of Rs. 1 lakh crore to ensure liquidity and flatten the long-term yield curve. RBI’s decision to maintain its high GDP growth forecast also helped calm the market over its fears about the second wave of infections,” he added. “Beset with multiple challenges, the foremost being the uncertainty stemming from the second wave and rising inflationary risks, the RBI did well to hold the policy rates while continuing the accommodative stance,” said Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII. Help cut term premium Commenting on the secondary market G-Sec acquisition programme, Sampath Reddy, CIO, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance said, “it indicates an intention to calendarise its [RBI’s] G-sec purchases and will help to manage the yield curve and may help to reduce the term premium as well.” A. K. Das, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of India said the policy announcement represented a balanced approach to make economic revival deep-rooted, to ensure orderly development of financial markets and keep price movement at manageable levels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/bank-stocks-lift-sensex-as-investors-cheer-rbis-tack/article34268194.ece

Others penalised by the watchdog include Nita Ambani, Tina Ambani, K.D. Ambani and other family members. Ms. Nita is the wife of Mukesh Ambani and Ms. Tina is wife of Anil Ambani. RIL’s promoters and Persons Acting in Concert (PAC) failed to disclose the acquisition of more than 5% stake in the firm back in 2000, SEBI said in its order. In 2005, Mr. Mukesh and Mr. Anil had split the business empire built by their father Dhirubhai Ambani. As per the order, RIL’s promoters acquired 6.83% stake in the company during 2000 through conversion of 3 crore warrants issued to them in 1994. SEBI noted that the 6.83% shares acquired by RIL promoters together with PACs consequent to the exercise of option on warrants attached with non-convertible secured redeemable debentures were in excess of the ceiling of 5% prescribed under the takeover norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sebi-slaps-rs-25-cr-fine-on-ambani-brothers-others/article34268323.ece
08 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Titan revenue surges 60%, pay restored||Titan said it clocked a revenue growth of 60% for the overall fourth quarter on a low base in March 2020 as the impact of the pandemic on consumer sentiment seemed to fade away in the early part of Q4. Revenue grew by more than 36% in the comparable January and February months, Titan said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. According to Titan, the wedding jewellery segment was the growth driver in the fiscal and its share in overall jewellery revenue had increased meaningfully, compared with last year. Efforts to raise Tanishq’s market share fetched good results. In May last year, mid to senior employees of Titan took pay cuts to help Titan tide over the pandemic-brought uncertain environment. “In the light of better-than-expected recovery, the company has fully reinstated the cash component of the salary cuts with retrospective effect,’’ it said. The performance during the financial year has been the result of the agility in navigating through the crises, Titan said in the filing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/titans-revenue-surges-60-salaries-restored/article34268180.ece

08 April 2021||Buenos Aires,||India off to a winning start against Argentina||The Indian men’s hockey team made a positive start to its tour of Argentina, defeating the reigning Olympic champion 4-3 in the first practice match here on Tuesday. Nilakanta Sharma (16th minute), Harmanpreet Singh (28th), Rupinder Pal Singh (33rd) and Varun Kumar (47th) were the scorers. Drag-flicker Leandro Tolini (35th and 53rd) and Maico Casella (41st) reduced the margin. Both teams were slow to get off the blocks in the first quarter, but India picked up pace in the second. Perfect assist Shilanand Lakra set up India’s first goal as his perfect assist found Nilakanta inside the circle and the striker put the ball past the Argentina goalkeeper.  Argentina secured a penalty corner soon but the experienced custodian P.R. Sreejesh made a brilliant save. Dilpreet Singh then earned India a penalty corner in the 28th minute and Harmanpreet made no mistake to hand his team a 2-0 lead. Argentina made a strong comeback in the third quarter, scoring in the 32nd minute through Tolini, who was spot on in converting a penalty corner. India won a set-piece in the 33rd through Jaskaran Singh and the seasoned Rupinder was bang on target. Argentina, however, made it 2-3 in the 41st minute through Casella. India put up a resolute fight to maintain its lead in the final quarter. In the 47th minute, Dilpreet earned another penalty and Varun, who returned to the squad after recovering from a hamstring injury, sent the ball crashing into the Argentina net. Spirited defence Though Argentina pulled another back in the 53rd through Tolini, India put up a spirited defence to end the game in its favour. India is scheduled to play six matches against Argentina during its 16-day tour, including the double-header FIH Hockey Pro league games on April 11 and 12.  The result:   India 4 (Nilakanta 16, Harmanpreet 28, Rupinder Pal 33, Varun 47) bt Argentina 3 (Tolini 35, 53, Maico Casella 41).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-off-to-a-winning-start-against-argentina/article34268371.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||IPL’s reigning behemoth MI primed to crush all comers||They said it cannot win in the United Arab Emirates. It proved them wrong in 2020. They said it wins only during odd years. It proved them wrong in 2020. They now say no team has won a hat-trick of titles. Mumbai Indians is set to pay them no heed again. It enters the 14th edition as the front-runner to win a record-extending sixth crown. Rohit Sharma’s army — oops, paltan — carries the tag of being the “the most well-prepared outfit” in the tournament’s history. It’s no wonder, therefore, that it has a ready-made replacement for each of its starting XI. Such is the bench strength that despite injuries and possible pandemic-enforced absences, MI can field a side full of international cricketers right through the season. Two of its key batsmen — Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav — will be eager to celebrate their much-awaited international debuts by continuing to make a mockery of opposition bowlers. And as if that weren’t enough, Hardik Pandya will resume all-round duties after featuring in the UAE purely as a batsman while he rehabilitated his back. He played the finisher’s role to perfection last edition, but this time around, having bowled full tilt during India’s T20I series against England, Hardik is set to unleash his complete potential. It really doesn’t augur well for MI’s opponents. Lethal pace combo While the top seven are as ferocious as any in the world, the pace combination of Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah is as lethal as it gets. The only possible weak link is the spin department. But with leg-spinner Piyush Chawla, the third-highest wicket-taker in IPL history, having been roped in, there is cause for optimism. Not only can Chawla be handy, he can also act as the perfect mentor for promising leggie Rahul Chahar. Don’t be surprised if by May 30, both Chawla and Chahar have proven all their detractors wrong and are singing “Where’s the competition?” along with the rest of their teammates.   X-factor   Six-hitting prowess: In 2020, MI clobbered a staggering 137 sixes, a whopping 32 more than next-best Rajasthan Royals. While de Kock (22) and Rohit (19) started it off in the PowerPlay, Suryakumar (11) and Ishan (30) kept them coming in the middle to allow Hardik (25) and Pollard (22) to go berserk at the end. In a game of small margins, these lusty blows have often proven decisive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ipls-reigning-behemoth-mi-primed-to-crush-all-comers/article34268313.ece
08 April 2021||Madrid,||Real has Liverpool’s measure||Vinicius Junior scored a goal in each half as Real Madrid defeated Liverpool 3-1 in the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals on Tuesday. Marco Asensio also scored for Madrid, which took full advantage of Liverpool’s defensive blunders in the first half to take a commanding lead ahead of the second leg in England. Mohamed Salah netted the lone goal for Liverpool early in the second half before Vinicius Junior sealed the victory for the hosts. Manchester City defeated Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at home in the other quarterfinal on Tuesday. Liverpool looked lost at the start of the match at the Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium in Madrid, unable to get a shot on goal in the first half. Perfect pass Vinicius Junior opened the scoring on a breakaway in the 27th after a perfectly timed long pass over the top by Toni Kroos. Another long pass by Kroos — and a defensive blunder by Liverpool — led to Asensio’s goal in the 36th. Liverpool complained of a foul by Lucas Vazquez on Sadio Mane just moments before Madrid’s second goal.  The English side improved after the break and was able to pull one back early in the second half with Salah finding the net from close range after a shot by Diogo Jota was partially blocked by Luka Modric in the 51st.  Phil Foden capped a fine Champions League display for Manchester City with a 90th-minute goal to secure a 2-1 win over Dortmund. Ilkay Gundogan brought down a cross at the far post and laid the ball off for Foden to sweep into the net, after Marco Reus had equalised for the visitors in the 84th minute. Kevin De Bruyne, pulling the strings in midfield for City throughout the game, scored the opening goal in the 19th minute after a flowing move and also sent in the cross that led to the winner. Jude Bellingham thought he had equalised for Dortmund in the 37th but the goal was harshly disallowed for a foul on City goalkeeper Ederson, even though there appeared to be little contact.  The results:   Manchester City 2 (De Bruyne 19, Foden 90) bt Borussia Dortmund 1 (Reus 84).   Real Madrid 3 (Vinicius Junior 27, 65, Asensio 36) bt Liverpool 1 (Salah 51).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/real-has-liverpools-measure/article34268317.ece
08 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Bharat willing to adapt quickly||K. Srikar Bharat, the wicketkeeper-batsman from Andhra who is in the Royal Challengers Bangalore squad for this year’s IPL, says he understands the T20 format better now and is willing to adapt as quickly as possible. In an exclusive chat with The Hindu after a training session, the 27-year-old Bharat said there has been a constant effort to improve his game and mindset. “Being with a team like RCB and a captain like Virat Kohli is something which every cricketer should dream about,” he said. “I believe Virat is an institution and having set such high standards for Indian cricket itself, I am going to learn a lot about how to be a better cricketer,” said Bharat. “There is so much happening around in the RCB nets. Honestly, Virat is phenomenal and a role model for millions of Indians,” he said. “My approach to IPL is not just about making efforts one or two weeks before coming to RCB. I know the importance of giving my best to the team’s success in any given situation,” the India-A cricketer with a near-decade, long experience said. “There is a lot of thinking going into each session of training — be it on the field or in the gym,” Bharat said. “It is such a professional outfit that motivates you to step into a different zone,” he said. “I prefer the longer route to realise my goals. Learning happens everywhere be it a First Class match or playing for India-A or IPL. It is important for me to keep things simple, enjoy what you have been doing rather than look too far ahead,” Bharat said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bharat-willing-to-adapt-quickly/article34268319.ece

The Australian had arrived in Chennai on April 3 with a negative test report. But he tested positive in his second test on Wednesday, and will now be in isolation at a designated medical facility, a club statement said.

But RCB received a boost ahead of its opener on Friday, with opener Devdutt Padikkal joining the squad. Padikkal had tested positive for COVID-19 on March 22 and was in isolation since then, with head coach Simon Katich telling the media on Tuesday that Padikkal needed just a negative test report before entering the bubble. Ready for action In a video released by the team on Twitter, Padikkal said, “As per BCCI and IPL protocol, I had to quarantine at home for two weeks. Now I have joined the camp after two negative tests, and I am feeling completely fine now, and I just can’t wait to get back.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rcbs-daniel-sams-tests-positive/article34268310.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Yuki gears up for US Challengers||From Singapore, Lucknow to Dubai, it has been a spring of hope for Yuki Bhambri, who lost two years to a knee injury. By defeating two of the country’s best players Ramkumar Ramanathan and Prajnesh Gunneswaran in qualifying for the Dubai ATP-500 event, the 28-year-old Yuki showed that he was getting into his groove. He played well against Aljaz Bedene of Sovenia, a top-60 player, before losing in three sets. After Singapore and before going to Dubai, Yuki had used the time to play doubles in the $15,000 event in Lucknow with Saketh Myneni and won the title. “Having good results does make you confident,” said Yuki, who will leave for Florida to compete in two Challengers in Orlando and Tallahassee. “I enjoy playing in the US. I am looking forward to these events as I have not been there for a long time,” said Yuki. It has been two weeks of solid preparation for Yuki back home in the Capital, as he got to train with Saketh Myneni, Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Vijay Sundar Prashanth. Looking forward “Got to practice with good players, as the ITF tournament was happening here. I am looking forward to playing tournaments again,” said the wiry Yuki, who has shed a lot of weight and become more athletic. Yuki is hoping that his body would cooperate for some robust tennis. “I have been relatively okay. Some days my knee does hurt. “Am still figuring out all the exercises that need to be done consistently to make sure that I am pain free,” said Yuki. Looking ahead, Yuki said that as the Grand Slams were nearing, he was keen to do well in the French Open and Wimbledon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/yuki-gears-up-for-us-challengers/article34268375.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sania back on track for Tokyo Olympics||Sania Mirza was one set away from at least a silver medal — with Rohan Bopanna in the mixed doubles semifinals — in the 2016 Rio Olympics. They lost to Venus Williams and Rajeev Ram and were also denied a bronze by the Czechs, Radek Stepanek and Lucie Hradecka. After the birth of her son the 34-year-old Sania, ranked 156th in doubles, has now set the Tokyo Olympics as her main target. When she left the WTA Tour in October 2017, Sania was ranked No. 9 in the world. Quite judiciously, Sania has preserved most of her 12 protected ranking entries to get ready for Tokyo. She has played six tournaments on her return over the past two years. She won Hobart immediately after getting back and competed in the Australian Open. She availed of wild card entries in Doha and Dubai, conserving her protected ranking entry.  With the rules allowing her an extended period of protected ranking entry till October 2021, Sania will have the option of choosing a doubles partner for Tokyo, ranked in the top-300. A top-10 player gets direct acceptance into the doubles draw of 32, with a partner. Considering all these facts, the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) has, in its meeting held on Wednesday, drafted Sania back into its fold with adequate government funding. Sania was part of the TOPS scheme earlier in the current Olympic cycle, but withdrew from the scheme when she left the Tour in 2017. Sania is busy preparing in Dubai, with India’s No. 1 singles player Ankita Raina, for the Billie Jean King Cup World Group play-off to be played against Latvia on April 16 and 17 in Jurmala. The onus will be on the Asian Games gold medallists, Rohan Bopanna and Divij Sharan, to ensure a men’s doubles entry for Tokyo, so that India can field a mixed doubles team for a shot at a medal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sania-back-on-track-for-tokyo-olympics/article34268321.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sharath steps up Olympic preparation||A. Sharath Kamal is awaiting a final word from the TableTennis Federation of India (TTFI) on his proposal to have training sessions with his mixed doubles partner Manika Batra ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games. In the background of Manika declining to join Sharath in Chennai for a camp and also staying away from the national camp held in Sonepat late last year, it remains to be seen how TTFI plans to deal with the Pune-based National champion. Sharath, a qualifier in the Olympics singles draw as well, has engaged the services of youngsters Manush Shah and Sudhanshu Grover as sparring partners in Chennai till April 18. Financial assistance Meanwhile, the Mission Olympics Cell of the Sports Authority of India on Wednesday, approved financial assistance of Rs. 1.26 lakh (plus local transport) to Sharath for inviting Shah and Grover for 21 days to Chennai. It was also decided to include Olympic qualifier Sutirtha Mukherjee in the TOPS Core team until this year’s Olympic Games. Elaborating on his plans, Sharath said, “From April 20, I would like to focus on the preparations for mixed doubles with Manika. “I have suggested to the TTFI to hold a preparatory camp (for the four qualifiers, including G. Sathiyan and Sutirtha).” When asked about the possibility of sparring with left-handers in the camps, for both singles and mixed doubles, Sharath said, “I plan to add Sanil Shetty to the proposed TTFI camp. Since in our country, we don’t have left-handed women players of good playing strength, we [Sharath and Manika] will practise against male players.” The recently-elected Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of TTFI, Dhanraj Choudhary said Sonepat or Bangalore could be the venue of the preparatory camp. “We are looking only at air-conditioned facilities to hold the camp and a decision will be taken in the TTFI Executive Board meeting within a week,” said Choudhary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sharath-steps-up-olympic-preparation/article34268369.ece
08 April 2021||Augusta,||Fast conditions set to pose supreme challenge||Augusta National has served a warning to the world’s greatest golfers with firm and fast conditions like some have never seen ahead of Thursday’s start of the 85th Masters. Five months after Dustin Johnson shattered the course record with a 20-under par 268 in rain-softened conditions, the Masters is back in its typical April setting and serving up lightning-fast greens with firm fairways to roll balls into danger. “With firm greens, this golf course needs to be respected,” three-time Masters winner Phil Mickelson said. “And I think it has been a long time since it has had to be respected.” Reigning US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, whose power-driving game could benefit from long rolls on many holes, says he will focus on his irons into notoriously undulating Augusta greens. “I’ve never seen it this fast, this quick, this early, but I certainly love the challenge,” DeChambeau said. “We had a hole location on 17... if you just got it past the hole, it would roll off the front of the green. Literally it moves a dimple and it’s gone.” Spain’s Sergio Garcia, the 2017 Masters winner, makes his 22nd start at Augusta National and he’s seen nothing like this. “The greens are probably the fastest and firmest I've seen them on a Monday or Tuesday forever,” he said. “If we get lucky and the weather stays nice, it’s going to be a challenging Masters.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fast-conditions-set-to-pose-supreme-challenge/article34268308.ece

Speculation has grown over the future of the 30-year-old De Gea, who has not started a match since the 0-0 draw with Chelsea on February 28. The former Atletico Madrid star, previously the undisputed number one at Old Trafford and capped 45 times by Spain, has been linked with a move to Atletico, Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain. “When you’re a part of Man United, there will always be players that come in and they’re not just there to fill the squad,” he said. “David (De Gea) has had 10 fantastic years at Man United. Dean comes in and he wants to play. It’s a healthy competition.” Solskjaer said both goalkeepers were happy to sit on the bench if the other got the nod. “Every time I try to explain to players why they aren’t playing, those discussions remain private,” said the Norwegian.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/solskjaer-welcomes-rivalry-between-henderson-and-de-gea/article34268762.ece

08 April 2021||CENTURION,||Fakhar powers Pakistan to series win||Opener Fakhar Zaman hit a second successive century to help Pakistan win the deciding ODI against South Africa by 28 runs and take the series 2-1 on Wednesday. This is Pakistan’s first ODI series win in South Africa since 2013. Fakhar made 101 and captain Babar Azam 94 from 82 balls to propel Pakistan to 320 for seven. South Africa was 292 all out in reply, with three batsmen scoring half-centuries but none converting it to a big score. South Africa had to change more than half its team after five players left for the IPL and batsman Rassie van der Dussen was ruled out with injury. Fakhar, who had blasted 193 in a losing cause in the second ODI, made 101 from 104 balls this time and shared a 112-run opening stand with Imam-ul-Haq (57). The tourists were 206 for one at one stage before reaching 320 for seven.  The scores: Pakistan 320/7 in 50 overs (Imam-ul Haq 57, Fakhar Zaman 101, Babar Azam 94, Hasan Ali 32 n.o., Keshav Maharaj 3/45) bt South Africa 292 in 49.3 overs (Janneman Malan 70, Kyle Verreynne 62, Andile Phehlukwayo 54, Mohd.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Jamakkalam 2.0||How many of you remember waiting for guests to arrive before rolling out your Bhavani jamakkalam s, those rugged and thick, traditional carpets? High on everyday utility value, these traditional carpets of Tamil Nadu were woven in various sizes to suit different requirements — puja mats for one person to sit on, dining mats for a short row of guests and so on. For weddings and other social gatherings, jamakkalam s would be custom-woven to the dimensions required. With changing lifestyles, the Bhavani jamakalam s are now on the verge of vanishing completely. “I was saddened to know that in the Bhavani region of Tamil Nadu, where these jamakkalam s are handwoven, there are just a handful of weavers left who still weave them. All of them are over 60 years of age, and unable to train the next generation of weavers as no one is showing interest in this art,” says Amar Ramesh, who made a documentary on Bhavani jamakkalam s recently. “Bhavani jamakkalam is a GI-tagged product and the pride of the State, and it is reserved only for handloom weaving,” says Mythili Rajendran, Managing Director, Tamil Nadu Handloom Weavers’ Cooperative Society Co-optex, Chennai. The society has taken the initiative to revive jamakkalam s of Bhavani by encouraging weavers in Kumarapalayam, Mahendranchavadi, Erode and Salem regions of Tamil Nadu to also weave these products of heritage value. “We procure the Korvai pattern of these handwoven jamakkalam s, through additional incentive. Then we market them to our customers,” she adds. “Traditionally, these carpets are woven with coarse yarn and strictly adhere to six standard colours: red, blue, green, white, orange, and yellow. But with our design intervention, we have introduced pastel shades, other colour combinations and design patterns, which would make them suitable for home décor,” Mythili says. Co-optex also launched table mats, bags, coasters and other products using this technique. “Our jamakkalam carpets are of two categories: one is for everyday usage using cotton yarn, and the other is woven with artificial silk, to be used as wedding mats for newly married couples traditionally. We are trying to make customers understand that these carpets are best suited for our weather conditions, easy to wash and maintain,” adds Mythili. Poongodi B, assistant professor at Kumaraguru Institutions, has a decade’s experience working with handloom weavers in Pollachi. She began researching the socio-economic conditions of the handloom jamakkalam weavers. “I conducted the research among 17 weavers living in 11 villages, and studied the various aspects of jamakkalam weaving. “Based on that I had come up with certain innovations. For example, we provided them with a jacquard box that can be integrated in the pit loom to weave designs in the carpets, moving away from the standard stripes,” says Poongodi. She says innovative colour palettes and different yarns, such as combinations of jute and cotton or fibre and cotton, will result in better product design. “My idea is to use them for laptop holders, table runners and shopping bags. Our institute has set up a Centre for Weavers, at Bhavani, to provide design intervention, and technological and skill upgradation.” P Sakthivelu, a 64-year-old jamakkalam weaver from Periyamolapalayam, says, “Two weavers are required to weave one standard-size jamakkalam in a day, in the kuzhi thari [pit loom]. It fetches us Rs. 250 per head per day. Unless the wages are doubled, no one will show interest in this work, which also involves physical drudgery.” “People still use these traditional jamakkalam s, but the main issue is powerlooms duplicating these outside the State and passing them off as Bhavani jamakkalam s with GI tag,” he says. Producing it in power looms is in violation of the Handloom (Reservation of Articles for Production) Act, 1985. Joining forces While shooting his documentary last year, Amar had organised a dinner meet between the jamakkalam weavers and young weavers from other weaving traditions, at Aappakudal village in Erode. “Some of the young weavers came forward to learn and save the weave; the jamakkalam weavers agreed to teach them,” he says. Adds Sakthivelu, “We have introduced three more colours (pink, violet and coffee brown) and weavers in this region take customisation orders. Intense training and out-of-the-box thinking is the need of the hour.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/jamakkalam-20/article34268170.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||An uphill battle||The Winter Olympics in Beijing will begin on February 4, 2022. Which gives Arif Khan just 10 more months. A slalom and giant slalom skier’s prime years, he says, are between the ages of 25 and 32. He is 31. This could be his last shot at realising a longtime dream: representing India at the Winter Olympics. Arif almost made it the last time. He had to average 140 points from five slalom races for the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. He was on track after good performances in Turkey, Bulgaria, Norway, and Sweden. One more good race in Iran would have given him the ticket to the 2018 Games. Then, it was cancelled due to bad weather. However, the door was still not shut. Arif had a chance to compete in a race in Switzerland before the deadline. But, he needed Rs. 1.5 lakh to get there. He had exhausted the money he had borrowed from friends and family. There was neither Government backing nor private sponsorship for a hardly known sport in the country (there still isn’t). He could not go to Switzerland, and so he waited for four more years. Now, Arif is in a similar situation. He needs to score at least 160 points each from five races. There are 10 months to go for the 2022 Games and over 100 races to choose from for qualification. But, Arif, for the next four months, will need about €40,000 (about Rs. 34 lakh) for training and travel. Although he has started a crowdfunding campaign, the response, so far, has been lukewarm. Nevertheless, he trains seven hours every day to be in the best possible shape, with a singular focus on getting to Beijing. In slalom skiing, in which Arif is attempting an Olympic berth, the skier has to ski (usually in in excess of 90 miles per hour) between poles that are spaced closely together. It is faster than the other skiing races, like giant slalom or downhill, and hence has less margin for error. But Arif is confident. “I already feel good to go for the races but I feel I can up the level of training before competition,” he says over the phone from his training base in Austria. “I am looking at racing in Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Chile from August or September this year.” Childhood lessons It is tempting to think that Arif was destined to be a skier. His father was a ski guide and owned a ski shop. The place where he was born, Gulmarg in Kashmir, is among India’s primary skiing destinations. Prolonged snowfall meant he could not play other sports, like cricket or volleyball, for six months. It was not hard for him to fall in love with skiing. Arif recalls his first lesson. “It was in 1994. I was four. We had to walk about 500 meters to the ski shop. And, there was thick snow. My father had groomed a small ski slope just outside the shop. We started at around 9.30 am; and went on till 12.30.” His father took out the smallest pair of skis. “It was red Atomic [the brand] skis,” he recalls. Once he taught him how to wear it, his father held him as he slid back and forth the little slope. “I was slipping. But I loved the speed. ” Arif soon found balance. Next, he was in pursuit of excellence. He wanted to represent India at the Winter Olympics. With the modest financial backing of his family and friends, he started training abroad, mostly in the European circuit, where skiing is most popular. Against all odds Arif says there is a world of difference between him and the top-ranked skiers. “They make millions of euros a year. They are backed by big sponsors. They have a personal coach. They have a team of doctors, physios, and nutritionists. They can prepare slopes overnight for training. All of these cost about Rs. 1.5 crore a year.” Arif, meanwhile, shares coaches, stays in low-cost accommodation and opts for buses and trains instead of planes to reduce his expenses. Yet it costs him Rs. 60 lakh a year to pursue his goal. His father supports him. His business, however, took a hit due to the conflict in Kashmir and the pandemic last year. There are a few friends and well-wishers who donate for his dream. Arif also takes up temporary gigs — as a ski instructor or an assistant coach — in the places he trains. With all these difficulties, has the thought of hanging up his skis ever crossed his mind? “Yes, every day,” he laughs before turning serious, “But I want to put my country on the skiing map. If I can achieve something, the global skiing community will take note of where I am from. It might make them see India as a potential top skiing destination.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-uphill-battle/article34268165.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The working #villacation||The villas are alive with the sound of laughter... and the clack of keyboards. Once weekend getaways and Saturday night party destinations, these sprawling homes are now occupied through the week as families and WFH professionals discover the perks of taking ‘villacations’. “We have doubled with respect to occupancy level and demand,” says Amit Damani, co-founder of Vista Rooms, a boutique brand for villa rentals in India. “What we clicked in Fiscal Year 20 (in terms of business), we were able to accomplish in six months (October to March) of FY 21, after zero revenues in the first two quarters. That is the kind of demand we have seen,” he says, adding that people are now ready to pay 20% more. Devendra Parulekar is matter-of-fact when he says, “We increased the price because of demand.” The founder of SaffronStays (a micro hospitality collective that operates 150-plus holiday homes pan India) says that since September 2020, the pandemic notwithstanding, he has seen enormous traffic on his portal. Villas that were priced at Rs. 40,000 for a night are now selling out even at Rs. 50,000-60,000 per night. The need to escape As lockdown was lifted in phases last year, people wanted to escape the confines of their city apartments and relocate to large vacation homes, says Devendra. Tired of being stuck within four walls, in addition to cooking, washing, cleaning, mopping, they needed a getaway. “Since WFH had become the norm they realised it didn’t matter if they worked out of Alibaug in Maharashtra or Naukuchiatal in Uttarakhand. This is how we suddenly saw an uptake,” he adds. Some of his patrons have done as many as six to seven stays over the last three months. While privacy, exclusivity, change of pace and absence of other people are primary appeals of the villa life, large open spaces, manicured lawns and private pools are additional perks. Not to mention these spaces look great on social media (#villacation). From St Barths to Shimla, this life has caught the fancy of celebrities and working professionals alike. Palm-fringed contemporary villas, white-washed Greek style homes, stone mansions... the style of architecture varies to suit one’s mood. Feeling like British royalty today? No worries: You can choose between Parsi Manor in Matheran, The Mansion in Kasauli, Milton Abbott Estate in Udhagamandalam and Alpinia in Coonoor... The settings are diverse: enveloping strawberry farms in Panchghani, vineyards in Nashik, apple orchards in Shimla and mountain tops in Malavali. Prefer views of water? Try the oceanside villas on the ECR, Chennai, or the riverside homes in Kamshet. The duration of the stay varies anywhere between three nights to a fortnight and sometimes longer. Saurabh Garg of NoBroker (a property rental/sale website in India) says professionals in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru have taken the idea of villacation a little too seriously: moving into villas in the outskirts of their respective cities for three to six months. The duration depends on negotiations with the landlords. “Our website has seen a surge in searches for villas,” says Saurabh, adding that the practice of work from home has pushed this cause further. Explaining the economics, Saurabh says, “A person staying in Koramangala or Indranagar (Bengaluru) will end up paying Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 60,000 a month for a three BHK. But now that they don’t have to go to work, they say ‘okay, I will stay close to the airport or Electronic City for a few months and get a villa at similar price. This way they get a bigger house, more space and more greenery.” Saurabh says NoBroker’s overall property listing of villas has increased over the last six months: 103% from January to February this year and 117% from February to March. Devendra and Amit agree. “Lot of people started using their second home and ended up staying there for three months. They realised that while this was great, they should rent the place out so they can maximise their yield on it,” says Amit, adding that in the last six months he has added 100 new homes to VistaRooms’ portfolio, taking the total tally of properties to 400. The number of people reaching out to Devendra, to list their villas on his website, has dramatically increased as well. “Not just that, people who had been sitting on land parcels have decided to build villas and get in touch with us,” says Devendra. To the hills we go Small groups of friends, working professionals and families who are compatible, as well as comfortable with each others’ hygiene (a requisite perhaps more vital than sense of humour or honesty, in a pandemic) have been renting out a space together, and splitting the cost. Prices can start at around Rs. 12,000 per night and go up to a couple of lakhs. “A section of high net worth individuals who missed out on their international holiday this year don’t mind spending around three lakhs a month on a villacation,” says Amit. Sometimes corporates book them for their offsites. A selection of villas also comes with private butlers and house keeping staff . “People are crazy about home-cooked meals. It doesn’t have to be butter chicken, all they sometimes want is simpledal chawal,” says Devendra. Often, vegetables are grown in the kitchen garden and guests can lend a hand with gardening. “In Alibaug, we introduce them to the popti style where the meal is cooked in earthern pots, over a slow fire underground,” he says. Villas in Goa, Alibaug and homes in the hills like Udhagamandalam, Kasauli, Coonoor, and Coorg are the most popular. People prefer driving to destinations that are around three to five hours from their base city. Devendra observes that in the pre-Covid days bookings at Udhagamandalam were by clients from Delhi and Mumbai. But now, it is entirely by people from Chennai and Bengaluru. Adds Devendra, with a laugh, “A lot of these clients were patrons of luxury hotels. But after a taste of the villa life there has been a shift in their vacation pattern.” Deven Thuppali is one such convert, as he admits gleefully. The resident of Anna Nagar West in Chennai, moved to a four-bedroom villa in Thiruvidhandai on ECR when the lockdown began last year. Along with his family and two dogs, he stayed there for a month. The only qualities he was looking for in an alternative home was a tranquil space, free of pollution and traffic. Around the same time, a few of his friends too made the same move. “I moved into Villa Elysiam and then came back again when the second lockdown started, this time for two weeks,” he says. He paid a rent of nearly Rs. 60,000 for a month. Moving here opened him to a new world that he was alien to in his earlier congested surroundings. “I started cycling and jogging. And it was pleasant to see the kind of greenery that’s all around,” he says. He enjoyed the villa life so much that he recently bought one there and moved in. “Everything is available here: grocery, hospital and great fish which I buy straight off the fishermen’s boats,” says a gleeful Dev. His pooches are just as delighted: running around the expanse and rolling on the lawn while the family sets up a moonlit barbecue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-working-villacation/article34268177.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Hand the chimp a popsicle||A rustle of dry leaves, distant subdued growls and an occasional splash of water are the only sounds that can be heard on a hot sultry day at the Arignar Anna Zoological Park (AAZP), popularly known as Vandalur zoo, in Chennai. With the mercury shooting up steadily, zoo authorities are creating cool zones for the 2,600 animals and birds from 180 species. Bamboo grass thatched shelters are up at 15 enclosures providing shade. “Work is on for adding another 21 shelters in animal enclosures,” says Naga Sathish Gidijala, Deputy Director of AAZP. Water sprinklers are in place in a majority of the enclosures, working round the clock to keep the animals cool. “Our footfalls right now are barely 40% of the pre-COVID levels,” says Gidijala, indicating the severe cash crunch the zoo is facing. “As a self-sustaining unit, our main revenue comes from the gate tickets, which saw a major setback last year. The Government had given Rs. 6 crore funds last year which took care of the animal feed. This summer, due to the cash crunch we are only focussing on the animals and their well being, but could not take up any upgradation of visitor facilities,” adds Gidijala. Nevertheless, at the aviary section, the birds get regular showers. And the chimps look happy, enjoying icy watermelon popsicles.   Incorrigible Cheepa, the chimp at Visakhapatnam’s Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (IGZP), is in a petulant mood. He snarls at his keeper and looks away grumpily when visitors enter. “The summer heat is making things difficult for them,” says the keeper. Fortunately, a few enclosures away, the Royal Bengal tiger is cheerful, as he enjoys the spritz of water from a newly-installed sprinkler. Beside his enclosure, a white tiger swims languidly in the pool, then snoozes under the trees. At the coastal city’s zoo park, arrangements are being made to protect 810 animals of 90 species from the sweltering heat. The animals are at present housed in 77 enclosures spread across the 625 acres of the zoo park. “We have put cool roof paints on night houses, covered most enclosures with palmyra leave shades and set up water sprinklers,” says IGZP curator Nandani Salaria. For the birds, aviaries have been covered with palm leaf mats, which screen the sun’s rays and reduce the heat considerably. Khus-khus mats are hung over the enclosures of exotic species like the blue green macaw. Summer care includes cooling foods such as watermelon, cucumber and coconut water along with supplements like Vitamin B Complex for the zoo’s oldest animals like Sirish, the white tiger and the Indian gaur, Raja. In addition, fans are being placed in enclosures for animals like the wild dog, panther, chimpanzee, white tiger and hyena.   Rows of crotons are a welcome addition to the greenery at the Coimbatore Zoo. “We added ornamental plants at the entrance before summer set in. The vast stretches of green lawns are relaid and kept moist through the day. Though the sun is beating down, there’s always a cool breeze that ensures a comfort zone for animals,” says E Senthilnathan, Zoo Director. The VOC Park Zoo in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, spread across four-and-a-half acres, is home to over 500 animals including reptiles, mammals and birds. “For big-bodied birds like emu, we spray water on the dense feathers twice a day. Every morning we spray water on the ground for heat dissipation. For spotted deer, we keep refilling water at ponds. The dense greenery provides enough shade and they feel free to run and graze,” he adds. Besides placing additional troughs of water at enclosures of birds and reptiles, they are given fruits that are high in water content. “Parakeets, cockatiels and African grey parrots now enjoy grapes, oranges and mosambi instead of their regular diet of seeds. Mammals like monkeys relish watermelon and musk melon.” He adds, “Till kathiri veyil or agni nakshatram , when the peak summer season gets over and we get the first monsoon shower, we follow this routine.”   At Hyderabad’s sprawling Nehru Zoological Park, despite the scorching weather, the tuskers are a happy lot — now, they get extra time to frolic in the shower. The leopard settles in front of a water sprinkler in his enclosure, yawning gently. “More than 50 air coolers are erected in animal enclosures of monkeys, tigers, lions, jaguars, cheetahs and leopards. Air conditioners and exhaust fans have been installed in the nocturnal animal house and shelters have been provided to all the herbivore enclosures,” says VVL Subhadra Devi, Curator, Nehru Zoological Park. The diet is tweaked to include summer seasonal fruits like watermelon, muskmelon and citrus-variety fruits. “Ample drinking water is being provided to all animal houses from time to time to avoid dehydration. Vitamin -C and B-Complex supplements are dissolved in the water,” says the curator. In addition, water troughs are kept at various places in the zoo for the free ranging animals and birds.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Recreating a legacy||In the busy streets of Chennai, the familiar silhouette of a lady emerges from a car. An elderly woman watching from close quarters gasps in surprise. It is her hero, the late J Jayalalithaa. Running over, she falls at her feet and cries, “Amma! Amma!” Except, it wasn’t the real ‘Amma’, but actor Kangana Ranaut who was dressed for her part as the lead in the upcoming film Thalaivi , directed by AL Vijay, based on the life of the late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. Designer Neeta Lulla — who painstakingly put together Kangana as well as Arvind Swami’s looks (as MGR) for the film — says that every time she recounts this incident she gets goosebumps. Work on the biopic started in 2019. Over the course of the year that followed, Neeta found herself immersed in all things Jayalalithaa. She read about the former cine icon, watched her movies and interviews, observed her attire, and listened to her songs. She sings a line from ‘Enna Porutham’, one of her current favourites. “I have watched each of her songs at least 16 times. Every time I saw them, a new detail cropped up,” says Neeta, over phone from Hyderabad. Giving the example of a particular sari, she says, the first time it appeared to be blue in colour. Then it looked aqua. “And then we found it had embroidery on it. We sketched out the details and on a closer look found that the embroidery also had flowers that did not show initially. And after that, we saw a certain colour and pearls in it. It was freaking us out. I wanted to add every single detail every single time,” she laughs. Technicalities matter Research continued on a day-to-day basis. And as more facts and details surfaced, costumes had to be tweaked accordingly. It took a lot of effort to create the inner structuring — made with layers of sponge and Lycra — that helped Kangana attain the same body specifics as Jayalalithaa. Neeta did not want to use silicone as that would add weight and was not conducive to the hot temperatures they shot at in Chennai, Hyderabad and Mysuru. For the measurements of the inner structuring, she got in touch with the tailor who used to stitch Jayalalithaa’s garments. The whole process involved a lot of technicalities. “That is why I call myself a technician, not a costume designer. It is imperative to make the characters look believable. You have to understand figure types and work on a subject holistically,” she remarks. The prosthetics, however, were created by a team in the US. There were various aspects of the former politician’s lifespan that had to be looked into, and with each detail that was unearthed the style changed. “Jaya amma as a child, entering films at the age of 16, followed by the stage where she entered politics, and eventually becoming a Chief Minister. I had to look at her real life costumes and recreate those,” says Neeta. This process involved a lot of buying as well as borrowing, she laughs. Vintage saris for the ‘70s look were sourced from friends’ grandmothers. Trips were made to numerous sari shops in and around the city and to Kancheepuram. They then had to be printed to get the desired look. The cheapest saris were the ones we borrowed, she laughs. Neeta is currently occupied with Shaakuntalam , starring Samantha Akkineni . Known for doing costumes for magnum opus productions such as Jodhaa Akbar, Panipat and Devdas , where each character had an elaborate wardrobe and ornate jewellery to match, Thalaivi , in comparison, was a contrast especially in terms of grandeur. And yet it was far from easy. “Characters from books, and kings and queens don’t really have photographs. With this film since everything was documented, I have to say this has been the most challenging film of my career,” says Neeta, adding, “I have tried to recreate the look to the best of my ability. The rest is for the audience to decide.”  I call myself a technician, not a costume designer. It is imperative to make the characters look believable.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Assassin on the stand||In May 1949, the Punjab High Court, then in session at Shimla, was knee-deep in its most important, high-profile case. Nathuram Godse, who would soon be sentenced to death for assassinating Mahatma Gandhi, made his final statement, sparking debate. To this day, many interpretations of this speech remain active. In 2003, it resulted in Paul Zacharia’s critically acclaimed Malayalam novella, Ithanente Peru , which examines Godse’s defence of the assassination. Many years on, Chennai-based theatre director Prasanna Ramaswamy manifests a physical form to this literarary work through her play, This Is My Name , produced by Chennai Art Theatre, which will reach audiences this weekend. The novella shines light on Godse thinking about his actions and defending himself, by drawing parallels from history and other fundamentalist actions. Zacharia recalls, “I have read a lot on Godse. His defence speech especially, shows him as a peculiar character. You cannot but be struck by his argument. I think that left a mark in my mind… I am not a Godse lover, but here’s a strange character in human history! So I thought I’ll try to interpret him in my own way.” Ithanenta Peru thus came to fruition. The powerful writing is what lured Prasanna to the work, seven years ago. Adapting this literary work into theatre was a challenge in itself, and this interpretation was particularly difficult to pull through. “In my previous work too, I have been speaking about perpetration, whether it be in the context of war, caste or any kind of oppression or marginalisation, by bringing out the poetry of the victims. But, since almost 17-18 years, I have been thinking about how I can put the perpetrator on stage. And to do that, this [the book] is fantastic work,” says Prasanna.  This Is My Name , though derived largely from Zacharia’s work, is an interplay of multiple narratives written by Prasanna. The director has woven two intertexts into the play, pitching one against the other, about how any art form irrespective of whether it is part of a singular faith or not, has its own cultural richness and identity. “Can’t we stay with it or work with it, without being fundamentalist? This is a personal question that I wanted to explore,” says the director. The other question looks at how pliable art is. The first parallel narrative features Bharatanatyam artiste Anita Ratnam. Set in the present, the scene depicts an interaction between Ratnam and a journalist who questions the contemporaneity of her work. “I am arguing that I won’t throw away the artform’s cultural richness just to prove a point. I can also make contemporary statements using past literature,” says Ratnam. The scene resonates with Ratnam as an artiste, because it is an experience that she is not alien to, as a dancer who constantly employs traditional motifs in her work. A physical form Like Prasanna’s other plays, This Is My Name , with a strong cast of Nikhila Keshavan, Anita Ratnam, Sarvesh Sridhar, Nikhil Kedia, Dharma Raman and Darshan Ramkumar, too will rely on movement and music. Prasanna believes theatre should not limit itself to a spoken lingo. Visual art too plays a role in this production — artist Gurunathan Govindan has created three paintings which play a vital part in one of the sequences. Original music is composed by Anandhkumar and executed by singers Saranya Krishnan and Subhashri Vidya, and percussionist Guru. For Prasanna, Ratnam and most of the cast and crew, This Is My Name is also their first outing on stage since March 2020. This Is My Name will be performed on April 9 and 11 at 7 pm at Alliance Française of Madras. Tickets can be purchased on BookMyShow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/assassin-on-the-stand/article34268152.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A monkey walks into a bar...||Chef Manu Chandra recalls the Bengaluru summer of 2012, when he was busy building the first cocktail menu of his then yet-to-open Monkey Bar. “My manager and I both realised that we hadn’t had a good aam panna in really long,” recalls the chef. They plucked raw mangoes, roasted them over a coal fire — “it adds that smokiness” — and turned it into the aam panna of their childhood. And from there, created mangaa, which has ruled the roost at Monkey Bars in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata for the past nine years. Now, try it in Chennai as the brand’s latest outlet prepares to open to the public at a sprawling indoor space in VR Chennai on April 8. In town for the launch, Manu (chef partner) and pioneering restaurateur AD Singh (founder and managing director of The Olive Group), discuss how they encourage diners to experiment. So while a vodka-laced rasam Mary cocktail might be a hit in Mumbai’s Monkey bar, a Malabari mutton kulcha served with coconut chutney is served up in Delhi. In Chennai, they are bringing in hit dishes from the other cities, as well as exclusive creations. For instance, six of their cocktails have been created just for this city: Pied piper (with a jeera -infused whisky base), sip me tender (based on white rum and tender coconut), imli sour (which is exactly what it sounds like), sip semma , Madras men (with coffee shrubs made in-house), and old fashioned kacheri (an almond-infused, sweet and zesty take on the classic cocktail). Pan-India legacy The team behind Monkey Bar — aka Olive group of restaurants — was among the first to popularise the gastropub culture across India. The Olive group is also behind some of the country’s most popular restaurants, each with a distinct personality — sunny families who frequent SodaBottleOpenerWala; connoisseurs who patronise Toasts and Tonic for its myriad varieties and taste notes of, well, gins and tonics; the fine-dining crowd that steps into an Olive Bar and Kitchen in Mumbai, Delhi or Goa. At Monkey Bar, as the chef explains, the idea is not to have a dimly-lit, loud pub but a relaxed space with comfortable seating where the food is as important as the drinks, as the company you want to kick back with. The layout at their VR premises reflects this, with standing tables, large booths, and tables for six, three and two set up at varying levels, in addition to a row of chairs by the curved bar. But the first thing to grab guests’ attention is, of course, the monkeys. Painted in typical Chennai garb against tell-tale city backdrops, monkeys gaze out, assuring you that this is not a space that takes itself too seriously. In pre-pandemic times, mingling was a key aspect of Monkey Bar’s operations and floor plan. “We would refuse to book a large table for just four people — if there was room for more guests; we insisted that you shared your table. I would often see two different groups share a table, and then come back as friends the next time,” says Manu, adding that married couples have walked up to him to say that they met at a Monkey Bar. “And this no-reservation rule is for everyone,” he underlines, “We have had members of the Indian cricket team wait their turn for a table like everyone else.” The devil is in the details Celebrity patronage aside, when bringing a restaurant to a new city, a host of little details matter, from the humidity in its air to the softness of its water. Chef Manu explains why, with a curious example. “I’m surprised at how under-seasoned a lot of the stuff is. Why is that?” he asked his team a day after landing in the city. Considering that Monkey Bar has always carried a lot of the same items in Kolkata, Mumbai and the now-shut original Bengaluru gastropubs, this difference was unexpected. “They said, ‘Chef, we’re seasoning it and seasoning it, but something in the water is impacting the seasoning.’ We checked, and saw that it is RO water. RO water is softened — and when it is, it gains the tendency to absorb more salt. It’s amazing how each geography throws up a fresh challenge, especially when you’re trying for consistency.” The food that did reach our table, though varied and experimental, was nothing if not utter comfort food — a creamy laksa; a rich Chandra Ji mutton curry (Manu’s family recipe) served with gobindo bhog rice; jackfruit “tacos” made complex with the Rajasthani flavours of ker sangri ; chocolate cake laced with Nutella and a generous splash of rum. There was also an intriguing nod to another popular Olive brand, The Fatty Bao, in the form of a ghee roast paneer bao. If a telling mural near the entrance is any indication, we will be welcoming The Fatty Bao to Chennai next.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-monkey-walks-into-a-bar/article34268157.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The man, the myth, the legend||It is going to be 45 years since a Telugu speaking neighbour pestered me into watching 16 Vayathinile . He knew I had given up watching Tamil films, after getting frustrated with the reigning screen gods, fighting a losing battle with the bulge and receding hairlines. While Kamal Haasan and Sridevi had author-backed roles, there was Rajinikanth effortlessly playing a village lout mirroring mischief and menace. I made it a point to watch Moondru  Mudichu and Avargal where he played an antagonist — not the regular kind with a bunch of underlings and a scantily-clad siren swaying in the background, but heartless and vile in thoughts and actions. No screen villain has given me goose bumps like Rajini in these two films. Add Gayathri to that list. Fifteen films starring Rajini were released in 1977 and most of them had him playing characters with shades of grey, all of which he performed with aplomb. The year 1978 was a mixed bag for Rajini, who either essayed a villain or played second fiddle to Kannada stars like Krishna and Vishnuvardhan. Producers were wary about backing him as a protagonist. Producer Kalaipuli S Thanu, who was then a distributor, had agreed to distribute Bhairavi after he was handed a few ‘stills’ of Rajini striking a pose with a gun, whip, snake, and a goat on his shoulder. Posters were printed and ads were given in newspapers with Thanu adding the moniker ‘Superstar.’ A 35-foot-tall poster of a towering Rajini was erected in front of a theatre. Thanu had not watched the film until the day of the release. “He was sporting black pants and a pink T-shirt. The theatre manager introduced us when Rajini wanted to meet the distributor,” remembers Thanu. Rajini shook hands and said, “Superb poster, terrific publicity.” Bhairavi was his first hit as the leading man. Where it began “There was a fire in his eyes,” the late legendary filmmaker K Balachander had told me, whilst rubbing his fore finger with his thumb, when I asked what he saw in the young man with beady eyes and unkempt hair, and who wanted to be an actor despite not being able to speak Tamil. To his credit, Balachander did not try to change anything. His only advice to the actor was to suggest he learn Tamil. Rajini learnt Tamil and imbibed bits from his screen idols: the gait and laughter from Sivaji Ganesan, tossing the cigarette from Shatrughan Sinha, the brooding, palpable but not overt menace from Amitabh Bachchan. And from Raj Kumar, he learnt humility, addressing fans as God. (Rajini once told me that he ran away from home just to meet Raj Kumar at his Trustpuram residence.) Balachander’s last directorial with Rajini was Thillu  Mullu , after which he realised that he could no longer write films that would satisfy his fans. Instead, he started producing blockbusters with him. Filmmakers Bharathiraja and Balu Mahendra too realised that it was more difficult to write a script for Rajini than Kamal. At this stage, producers like Saravanan and Balaji stopped approaching the duo as they became unaffordable. Tête-à-tête with Superstar When I first met Rajini in 1981 for an interview, he was staying at Poes Garden in Chennai. He was excited about conversing in Kannada and full of questions about Bengaluru. He drove me to the sets of his first multi-lingual, Garjanai , in his white Fiat constantly waving and urging fans on bicycles not to come too close. A fight sequence was being shot in a glass house in Arunachalam Studio in Chennai. He was pleasant, answering questions between shots and frequently enquiring if I was comfortable. During the course of the shoot, a stunt man suffered a deep gash while punching glass and Rajini was deeply anguished, after which he was restless until he returned from the hospital. Later, whenever I bumped into Rajini in AVM Saravanan’s office or on location, he would smile and ask “ chennagiddhira ? (how are you?)” in Kannada. When I once visited AVM to interview him for a Bombay tabloid, he suddenly asked, “Why don’t you ask me about people like Vivekananda?” I told him readers might not be interested, like how they would not be interested in a philosopher’s opinion about cinema. He glanced at me, smiled and answered my questions. Later, there was a phase when he donated his bungalow in Velachery to an international religious organisation, and wanted to seek peace in the mountains. Reliable sources say that Kamal persuaded him against taking that drastic step. Today, theirs is a relationship of mutual respect. Like none other When Rajini opened and entered the gates of Tamil Nadu with Apoorva  Raagangal , his debut film in 1975, he did not push them shut behind him. A band of Kannada actors followed, including Mohan, Arjun Sarja, Dilip, Rajeev and later Prakash Raj. Each made a mark, the most successful being Mohan. Rajini, however, still rules even after four decades. What is still fascinating is that he appeals to today’s generation, who do not know him at his peak. The excitement his films elicit remains unmatched. The secret of his success is that everybody identifies with the characters he plays. They live their fantasies through him, of an underdog surmounting seemingly impossible adversities and adversaries to emerge triumphant.  Whenever I bumped into Rajini, he would smile and ask “ chennagiddhira ? (how are you)” in Kannada||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-man-the-myth-the-legend/article34268140.ece

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Ambattur UGVs march along||“You think of ‘unmanned’, and you think of drones, in the sky,” says 25-year-old Vibhakar Senthil. In Ambattur — widely regarded as the Detroit of India — his start-up Torus Robotics is set to change that, by making Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) for the Indian Army. At the Aero India 2021 in Bengaluru, attended by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Torus Robotics signed an MOU with the Government, on the joint development of UGVs for the armed forces with BEML Limited. “With BEML, we are now developing a high-altitude Logistics UGV with 750 kilograms payload. It will be an all-terrain vehicle to supply to and from bases [without the need of human presence] in bad weather conditions, for the Northern Command,” says Vibhakar. At university in SRM, Kattankulathur, Chennai, Vibhakar, with his classmates, M Vignesh and K Abbhi Vignesh, spent time researching the robotics industry in India. A combination of patriotism — Vibhakar says he had hoped to join the Indian Army once — and passion for robotics, led them to focus on the defence sector. “We researched the issues our jawans faced during border patrol because of infiltration, heavy burden, high altitudes and lack of oxygen, and the corresponding mental health issues. We were wondering if robotics could solve that issue of logistics,” says Vibhakar, adding, “The idea is not to replace jawans , but to aid them.” When Torus Robotics was officially established in 2019, it was with the help of someone who knew the in and out of the armed forces. Lieutenant General CA Krishnan (retired) mentored the three on the needs of the sector. “He was in the Army Design Bureau and we will be officially incorporating him in the company in June,” Vibhakar adds. Why the focus on UGVs UGVs in the defence sector are mainly used for surveillance (border patrol), reconnaissance (scouting and collecting information), combat (like tanks, but smaller), and logistics (ferrying supplies from one base to another, where regular vehicles have trouble going) — the fourth is currently their highest priority. “You can also adapt UGVs for supplementary activities by making them amphibious or nocturnal and so on,” says Vibhakar. In July 2019, Torus Robotics finished its first project for Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), manufacturing and assembling a UGV. It has been put to use by the Indian Army, which had further tests and research done on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/ambattur-ugvs-march-along/article34268167.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The working #villacation||The villas are alive with the sound of laughter... and the clack of keyboards. Once weekend getaways and Saturday night party destinations, these sprawling homes are now occupied through the week as families and WFH professionals discover the perks of taking ‘villacations’. “We have doubled with respect to occupancy level and demand,” says Amit Damani, co-founder of Vista Rooms, a boutique brand for villa rentals in India. “What we clicked in Fiscal Year 20 (in terms of business), we were able to accomplish in six months (October to March) of FY 21, after zero revenues in the first two quarters. That is the kind of demand we have seen,” he says, adding that people are now ready to pay 20% more. Devendra Parulekar is matter-of-fact when he says, “We increased the price because of demand.” The founder of SaffronStays (a micro hospitality collective that operates 150-plus holiday homes pan India) says that since September 2020, the pandemic notwithstanding, he has seen enormous traffic on his portal. Villas that were priced at Rs. 40,000 for a night are now selling out even at Rs. 50,000-60,000 per night. The need to escape As lockdown was lifted in phases last year, people wanted to escape the confines of their city apartments and relocate to large vacation homes, says Devendra. Tired of being stuck within four walls, in addition to cooking, washing, cleaning, mopping, they needed a getaway. “Since WFH had become the norm they realised it didn’t matter if they worked out of Alibaug in Maharashtra or Naukuchiatal in Uttarakhand. This is how we suddenly saw an uptake,” he adds. Some of his patrons have done as many as six to seven stays over the last three months. While privacy, exclusivity, change of pace and absence of other people are primary appeals of the villa life, large open spaces, manicured lawns and private pools are additional perks. Not to mention these spaces look great on social media (#villacation). From St Barths to Shimla, this life has caught the fancy of celebrities and working professionals alike. Palm-fringed contemporary villas, white-washed Greek style homes, stone mansions... the style of architecture varies to suit one’s mood. Feeling like British royalty today? No worries: You can choose between Parsi Manor in Matheran, The Mansion in Kasauli, Milton Abbott Estate in Udhagamandalam and Alpinia in Coonoor... The settings are diverse: enveloping strawberry farms in Panchghani, vineyards in Nashik, apple orchards in Shimla and mountain tops in Malavali. Prefer views of water? Try the oceanside villas on the ECR, Chennai, or the riverside homes in Kamshet. The duration of the stay varies anywhere between three nights to a fortnight and sometimes longer. Saurabh Garg of NoBroker (a property rental/sale website in India) says professionals in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru have taken the idea of villacation a little too seriously: moving into villas in the outskirts of their respective cities for three to six months. The duration depends on negotiations with the landlords. “Our website has seen a surge in searches for villas,” says Saurabh, adding that the practice of work from home has pushed this cause further. Explaining the economics, Saurabh says, “A person staying in Koramangala or Indranagar (Bengaluru) will end up paying Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 60,000 a month for a three BHK. But now that they don’t have to go to work, they say ‘okay, I will stay close to the airport or Electronic City for a few months and get a villa at similar price. This way they get a bigger house, more space and more greenery.” Saurabh says NoBroker’s overall property listing of villas has increased over the last six months: 103% from January to February this year and 117% from February to March. Devendra and Amit agree. “Lot of people started using their second home and ended up staying there for three months. They realised that while this was great, they should rent the place out so they can maximise their yield on it,” says Amit, adding that in the last six months he has added 100 new homes to VistaRooms’ portfolio, taking the total tally of properties to 400. The number of people reaching out to Devendra, to list their villas on his website, has dramatically increased as well. “Not just that, people who had been sitting on land parcels have decided to build villas and get in touch with us,” says Devendra. To the hills we go Small groups of friends, working professionals and families who are compatible, as well as comfortable with each others’ hygiene (a requisite perhaps more vital than sense of humour or honesty, in a pandemic) have been renting out a space together, and splitting the cost. Prices can start at around Rs. 12,000 per night and go up to a couple of lakhs. “A section of high net worth individuals who missed out on their international holiday this year don’t mind spending around three lakhs a month on a villacation,” says Amit. Sometimes corporates book them for their offsites. A selection of villas also comes with private butlers and house keeping staff . “People are crazy about home-cooked meals. It doesn’t have to be butter chicken, all they sometimes want is simpledal chawal,” says Devendra. Often, vegetables are grown in the kitchen garden and guests can lend a hand with gardening. “In Alibaug, we introduce them to the popti style where the meal is cooked in earthern pots, over a slow fire underground,” he says. Villas in Goa, Alibaug and homes in the hills like Udhagamandalam, Kasauli, Coonoor, and Coorg are the most popular. People prefer driving to destinations that are around three to five hours from their base city. Devendra observes that in the pre-Covid days bookings at Udhagamandalam were by clients from Delhi and Mumbai. But now, it is entirely by people from Chennai and Bengaluru. Adds Devendra, with a laugh, “A lot of these clients were patrons of luxury hotels. But after a taste of the villa life there has been a shift in their vacation pattern.” Deven Thuppali is one such convert, as he admits gleefully. The resident of Anna Nagar West in Chennai, moved to a four-bedroom villa in Thiruvidhandai on ECR when the lockdown began last year. Along with his family and two dogs, he stayed there for a month. The only qualities he was looking for in an alternative home was a tranquil space, free of pollution and traffic. Around the same time, a few of his friends too made the same move. “I moved into Villa Elysiam and then came back again when the second lockdown started, this time for two weeks,” he says. He paid a rent of nearly Rs. 60,000 for a month. Moving here opened him to a new world that he was alien to in his earlier congested surroundings. “I started cycling and jogging. And it was pleasant to see the kind of greenery that’s all around,” he says. He enjoyed the villa life so much that he recently bought one there and moved in. “Everything is available here: grocery, hospital and great fish which I buy straight off the fishermen’s boats,” says a gleeful Dev. His pooches are just as delighted: running around the expanse and rolling on the lawn while the family sets up a moonlit barbecue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-working-villacation/article34268498.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Recreating a legacy||In the busy streets of Chennai, the familiar silhouette of a lady emerges from a car. An elderly woman watching from close quarters gasps in surprise. It is her hero, the late J Jayalalithaa. Running over, she falls at her feet and cries, “Amma! Amma!” Except, it wasn’t the real ‘Amma’, but actor Kangana Ranaut who was dressed for her part as the lead in the upcoming film Thalaivi , directed by AL Vijay, based on the life of the late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. Designer Neeta Lulla — who painstakingly put together Kangana as well as Arvind Swami’s looks (as MGR) for the film — says that every time she recounts this incident she gets goosebumps. Work on the biopic started in 2019. Over the course of the year that followed, Neeta found herself immersed in all things Jayalalithaa. She read about the former cine icon, watched her movies and interviews, observed her attire, and listened to her songs. She sings a line from ‘Enna Porutham’, one of her current favourites. “I have watched each of her songs at least 16 times. Every time I saw them, a new detail cropped up,” says Neeta, over phone from Hyderabad. Giving the example of a particular sari, she says, the first time it appeared to be blue in colour. Then it looked aqua. “And then we found it had embroidery on it. We sketched out the details and on a closer look found that the embroidery also had flowers that did not show initially. And after that, we saw a certain colour and pearls in it. It was freaking us out. I wanted to add every single detail every single time,” she laughs. Technicalities matter Research continued on a day-to-day basis. And as more facts and details surfaced, costumes had to be tweaked accordingly. It took a lot of effort to create the inner structuring — made with layers of sponge and Lycra — that helped Kangana attain the same body specifics as Jayalalithaa. Neeta did not want to use silicone as that would add weight and was not conducive to the hot temperatures they shot at in Chennai, Hyderabad and Mysuru. For the measurements of the inner structuring, she got in touch with the tailor who used to stitch Jayalalithaa’s garments. The whole process involved a lot of technicalities. “That is why I call myself a technician, not a costume designer. It is imperative to make the characters look believable. You have to understand figure types and work on a subject holistically,” she remarks. The prosthetics, however, were created by a team in the US. There were various aspects of the former politician’s lifespan that had to be looked into, and with each detail that was unearthed the style changed. “Jaya amma as a child, entering films at the age of 16, followed by the stage where she entered politics, and eventually becoming a Chief Minister. I had to look at her real life costumes and recreate those,” says Neeta. This process involved a lot of buying as well as borrowing, she laughs. Vintage saris for the ‘70s look were sourced from friends’ grandmothers. Trips were made to numerous sari shops in and around the city and to Kancheepuram. They then had to be printed to get the desired look. The cheapest saris were the ones we borrowed, she laughs. Neeta is currently occupied with Shaakuntalam , starring Samantha Akkineni . Known for doing costumes for magnum opus productions such as Jodhaa Akbar, Panipat and Devdas , where each character had an elaborate wardrobe and ornate jewellery to match, Thalaivi , in comparison, was a contrast especially in terms of grandeur. And yet it was far from easy. “Characters from books, and kings and queens don’t really have photographs. With this film since everything was documented, I have to say this has been the most challenging film of my career,” says Neeta, adding, “I have tried to recreate the look to the best of my ability. The rest is for the audience to decide.”  I call myself a technician, not a costume designer. It is imperative to make the characters look believable.

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The man, the myth, the legend||It is going to be 45 years since a Telugu speaking neighbour pestered me into watching 16 Vayathinile . He knew I had given up watching Tamil films, after getting frustrated with the reigning screen gods, fighting a losing battle with the bulge and receding hairlines. While Kamal Haasan and Sridevi had author-backed roles, there was Rajinikanth effortlessly playing a village lout mirroring mischief and menace. I made it a point to watch Moondru  Mudichu and Avargal where he played an antagonist — not the regular kind with a bunch of underlings and a scantily-clad siren swaying in the background, but heartless and vile in thoughts and actions. No screen villain has given me goose bumps like Rajini in these two films. Add Gayathri to that list. Fifteen films starring Rajini were released in 1977 and most of them had him playing characters with shades of grey, all of which he performed with aplomb. The year 1978 was a mixed bag for Rajini, who either essayed a villain or played second fiddle to Kannada stars like Krishna and Vishnuvardhan. Producers were wary about backing him as a protagonist. Producer Kalaipuli S Thanu, who was then a distributor, had agreed to distribute Bhairavi after he was handed a few ‘stills’ of Rajini striking a pose with a gun, whip, snake, and a goat on his shoulder. Posters were printed and ads were given in newspapers with Thanu adding the moniker ‘Superstar.’ A 35-foot-tall poster of a towering Rajini was erected in front of a theatre. Thanu had not watched the film until the day of the release. “He was sporting black pants and a pink T-shirt. The theatre manager introduced us when Rajini wanted to meet the distributor,” remembers Thanu. Rajini shook hands and said, “Superb poster, terrific publicity.” Bhairavi was his first hit as the leading man. Where it began “There was a fire in his eyes,” the late legendary filmmaker K Balachander had told me, whilst rubbing his fore finger with his thumb, when I asked what he saw in the young man with beady eyes and unkempt hair, and who wanted to be an actor despite not being able to speak Tamil. To his credit, Balachander did not try to change anything. His only advice to the actor was to suggest he learn Tamil. Rajini learnt Tamil and imbibed bits from his screen idols: the gait and laughter from Sivaji Ganesan, tossing the cigarette from Shatrughan Sinha, the brooding, palpable but not overt menace from Amitabh Bachchan. And from Raj Kumar, he learnt humility, addressing fans as God. (Rajini once told me that he ran away from home just to meet Raj Kumar at his Trustpuram residence.) Balachander’s last directorial with Rajini was Thillu  Mullu , after which he realised that he could no longer write films that would satisfy his fans. Instead, he started producing blockbusters with him. Filmmakers Bharathiraja and Balu Mahendra too realised that it was more difficult to write a script for Rajini than Kamal. At this stage, producers like Saravanan and Balaji stopped approaching the duo as they became unaffordable. Tête-à-tête with Superstar When I first met Rajini in 1981 for an interview, he was staying at Poes Garden in Chennai. He was excited about conversing in Kannada and full of questions about Bengaluru. He drove me to the sets of his first multi-lingual, Garjanai , in his white Fiat constantly waving and urging fans on bicycles not to come too close. A fight sequence was being shot in a glass house in Arunachalam Studio in Chennai. He was pleasant, answering questions between shots and frequently enquiring if I was comfortable. During the course of the shoot, a stunt man suffered a deep gash while punching glass and Rajini was deeply anguished, after which he was restless until he returned from the hospital. Later, whenever I bumped into Rajini in AVM Saravanan’s office or on location, he would smile and ask “ chennagiddhira ? (how are you?)” in Kannada. When I once visited AVM to interview him for a Bombay tabloid, he suddenly asked, “Why don’t you ask me about people like Vivekananda?” I told him readers might not be interested, like how they would not be interested in a philosopher’s opinion about cinema. He glanced at me, smiled and answered my questions. Later, there was a phase when he donated his bungalow in Velachery to an international religious organisation, and wanted to seek peace in the mountains. Reliable sources say that Kamal persuaded him against taking that drastic step. Today, theirs is a relationship of mutual respect. Like none other When Rajini opened and entered the gates of Tamil Nadu with Apoorva  Raagangal , his debut film in 1975, he did not push them shut behind him. A band of Kannada actors followed, including Mohan, Arjun Sarja, Dilip, Rajeev and later Prakash Raj. Each made a mark, the most successful being Mohan. Rajini, however, still rules even after four decades. What is still fascinating is that he appeals to today’s generation, who do not know him at his peak. The excitement his films elicit remains unmatched. The secret of his success is that everybody identifies with the characters he plays. They live their fantasies through him, of an underdog surmounting seemingly impossible adversities and adversaries to emerge triumphant.  Whenever I bumped into Rajini, he would smile and ask “ chennagiddhira ? (how are you)” in Kannada||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-man-the-myth-the-legend/article34268725.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Chennai UGVs march along||“You think of ‘unmanned’, and you think of drones, in the sky,” says 25-year-old Vibhakar Senthil. In Chennai’s Ambattur — widely regarded as the Detroit of India — his start-up Torus Robotics is set to change that, by making Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) for the Indian Army. At the Aero India 2021 in Bengaluru, attended by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Torus Robotics signed an MOU with the Government, on the joint development of UGVs for the armed forces with BEML Limited. “With BEML, we are now developing a high-altitude Logistics UGV with 750 kilograms payload. It will be an all-terrain vehicle to supply to and from bases [without the need of human presence] in bad weather conditions, for the Northern Command,” says Vibhakar. At university in SRM, Kattankulathur, Chennai, Vibhakar, with his classmates, M Vignesh and K Abbhi Vignesh, spent time researching the robotics industry in India. A combination of patriotism — Vibhakar says he had hoped to join the Indian Army once — and passion for robotics, led them to focus on the defence sector. “We researched the issues our jawans faced during border patrol because of infiltration, heavy burden, high altitudes and lack of oxygen, and the corresponding mental health issues. We were wondering if robotics could solve that issue of logistics,” says Vibhakar, adding, “The idea is not to replace jawans , but to aid them.” When Torus Robotics was officially established in 2019, it was with the help of someone who knew the in and out of the armed forces. Lieutenant General CA Krishnan (retired) mentored the three on the needs of the sector. “He was in the Army Design Bureau and we will be officially incorporating him in the company in June,” Vibhakar adds. Why the focus on UGVs UGVs in the defence sector are mainly used for surveillance (border patrol), reconnaissance (scouting and collecting information), combat (like tanks, but smaller), and logistics (ferrying supplies from one base to another, where regular vehicles have trouble going) — the fourth is currently their highest priority. “You can also adapt UGVs for supplementary activities by making them amphibious or nocturnal and so on,” says Vibhakar. In July 2019, Torus Robotics finished its first project for Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), manufacturing and assembling a UGV. It has been put to use by the Indian Army, which had further tests and research done on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/chennai-ugvs-march-along/article34268502.ece

08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Jamakkalam 2.0||Do you remember waiting for guests to arrive before rolling out a Bhavani jamakkalam , that thick, rugged, traditional carpets? High on everyday utility value, these traditional carpets of Tamil Nadu were woven in various sizes to suit different requirements — puja mats for one person to sit on, dining mats for a short row of guests and so on. For weddings and other social gatherings, jamakkalam s would be custom-woven to the dimensions required. With changing lifestyles, the Bhavani jamakalam s are now on the verge of vanishing completely. “I was saddened to know that in the Bhavani region of Tamil Nadu, where these jamakkalam s are handwoven, there are just a handful of weavers left who still weave them. All of them are over 60 years of age, and unable to train the next generation of weavers as no one is showing interest in this art,” says Amar Ramesh, who made a documentary on Bhavani jamakkalam s recently. “Bhavani jamakkalam is a GI-tagged product and the pride of the State, and it is reserved only for handloom weaving,” says Mythili Rajendran, Managing Director, Tamil Nadu Handloom Weavers’ Cooperative Society Co-optex, Chennai. The society has taken the initiative to revive jamakkalam s of Bhavani by encouraging weavers in Kumarapalayam, Mahendranchavadi, Erode and Salem regions of Tamil Nadu to also weave these products of heritage value. “We procure the Korvai pattern of these handwoven jamakkalam s, through additional incentive. Then we market them to our customers,” she adds. “Traditionally, these carpets are woven with coarse yarn and strictly adhere to six standard colours: red, blue, green, white, orange, and yellow. But with our design intervention, we have introduced pastel shades, other colour combinations and design patterns, which would make them suitable for home décor,” Mythili says. Co-optex also launched table mats, bags, coasters and other products using this technique. “Our jamakkalam carpets are of two categories: one is for everyday usage using cotton yarn, and the other is woven with artificial silk, to be used as wedding mats for newly married couples traditionally. We are trying to make customers understand that these carpets are best suited for our weather conditions, easy to wash and maintain,” adds Mythili. Poongodi B, assistant professor at Kumaraguru Institutions, has a decade’s experience working with handloom weavers in Pollachi.  “I conducted the research among 17 weavers living in 11 villages, and studied the various aspects of jamakkalam weaving. “Based on that I had come up with certain innovations. For example, we provided them with a jacquard box that can be integrated in the pit loom to weave designs in the carpets, moving away from the standard stripes,” says Poongodi. P Sakthivelu, a 64-year-old jamakkalam weaver from Periyamolapalayam, says, “Two weavers are required to weave one standard-size jamakkalam in a day, in the kuzhi thari [pit loom]. It fetches us Rs. 250 per head per day. Unless the wages are doubled, no one will show interest in this work, which also involves physical drudgery.” “People still use these jamakkalam s, but the main issue is powerlooms duplicating these outside the State and passing them off as Bhavani jamakkalam s,” he says. Producing it on power looms violates the Handloom (Reservation of Articles for Production) Act, 1985. Last year, Amar had organised a dinner meet between the jamakkalam weavers and young weavers from other weaving traditions, at Aappakudal village in Erode. “Some of the young weavers came forward to learn and save the weave; the jamakkalam weavers agreed to teach them,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/jamakkalam-20/article34268497.ece
08 April 2021||April 08 2021 00:00 IST,||An uphill battle||The Winter Olympics in Beijing will begin on February 4, 2022. Which gives Arif Khan just 10 more months. A slalom and giant slalom skier’s prime years, he says, are between the ages of 25 and 32. He is 31. This could be his last shot at realising a longtime dream: representing India at the Winter Olympics. Arif almost made it the last time. He had to average 140 points from five slalom races for the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. He was on track after good performances in Turkey, Bulgaria, Norway, and Sweden. One more good race in Iran would have given him the ticket to the 2018 Games. Then, it was cancelled due to bad weather. However, the door was still not shut. Arif had a chance to compete in a race in Switzerland before the deadline. But, he needed Rs. 1.5 lakh to get there. He had exhausted the money he had borrowed from friends and family. There was neither Government backing nor private sponsorship for a hardly known sport in the country (there still isn’t). He could not go to Switzerland, and so he waited for four more years. Now, Arif is in a similar situation. He needs to score at least 160 points each from five races. There are 10 months to go for the 2022 Games and over 100 races to choose from for qualification. But, Arif, for the next four months, will need about €40,000 (about Rs. 34 lakh) for training and travel. Although he has started a crowdfunding campaign, the response, so far, has been lukewarm. Nevertheless, he trains seven hours every day to be in the best possible shape, with a singular focus on getting to Beijing. In slalom skiing, in which Arif is attempting an Olympic berth, the skier has to ski (usually in in excess of 90 miles per hour) between poles that are spaced closely together. It is faster than the other skiing races, like giant slalom or downhill, and hence has less margin for error. But Arif is confident. “I already feel good to go for the races but I feel I can up the level of training before competition,” he says over the phone from his training base in Austria. “I am looking at racing in Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Chile from August or September this year.” Childhood lessons It is tempting to think that Arif was destined to be a skier. His father was a ski guide and owned a ski shop. The place where he was born, Gulmarg in Kashmir, is among India’s primary skiing destinations. Prolonged snowfall meant he could not play other sports, like cricket or volleyball, for six months. It was not hard for him to fall in love with skiing. Arif recalls his first lesson. “It was in 1994. I was four. We had to walk about 500 meters to the ski shop. And, there was thick snow. My father had groomed a small ski slope just outside the shop. We started at around 9.30 am; and went on till 12.30.” His father took out the smallest pair of skis. “It was red Atomic [the brand] skis,” he recalls. Once he taught him how to wear it, his father held him as he slid back and forth the little slope. “I was slipping. But I loved the speed. ” Arif soon found balance. Next, he was in pursuit of excellence. He wanted to represent India at the Winter Olympics. With the modest financial backing of his family and friends, he started training abroad, mostly in the European circuit, where skiing is most popular. Against all odds Arif says there is a world of difference between him and the top-ranked skiers. “They make millions of euros a year. They are backed by big sponsors. They have a personal coach. They have a team of doctors, physios, and nutritionists. They can prepare slopes overnight for training. All of these cost about Rs. 1.5 crore a year.” Arif, meanwhile, shares coaches, stays in low-cost accommodation and opts for buses and trains instead of planes to reduce his expenses. Yet it costs him Rs. 60 lakh a year to pursue his goal. His father supports him. His business, however, took a hit due to the conflict in Kashmir and the pandemic last year. There are a few friends and well-wishers who donate for his dream. Arif also takes up temporary gigs — as a ski instructor or an assistant coach — in the places he trains. With all these difficulties, has the thought of hanging up his skis ever crossed his mind? “Yes, every day,” he laughs before turning serious, “But I want to put my country on the skiing map. If I can achieve something, the global skiing community will take note of where I am from. It might make them see India as a potential top skiing destination.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-uphill-battle/article34268501.ece
08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||40-bed makeshift hospital at Singhu set to expand services||A 40-bed makeshift hospital has come up behind the main stage at Singhu border to treat the protesting farmers who have been at the site for over four months now. The makeshift hospital, which became operational on Tuesday, has been built by the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and is set to expand to a 24/7 facility over time. Currently, patients are being treated in the temporary structure and also inside the INLD office at the Singhu border. Common complaints Those treating the farmers said that dehydration and fever were the most common complaints from the patients. Anil Sekhawat, one of those treating the patients, said, “Several patients have complained of fever, body pain, weakness, diarrhoea, cough and cold. While we do not have the required facility for a COVID-19 test to be done, we are getting other tests like those for typhoid and malaria for those complaining of fever.” The hospital, currently has a strength of 15 doctors and nursing staff to monitor the patients throughout the day. “The doctors and nursing staffers are mostly from neighbouring areas like Sonipat and Bhiwani. They are travelling to the protest site on a daily basis. Over time, once we increase the strength, the facility will be made into a 24/7 one. While there were existing hospitals at the protest site, the INLD thought of making another one as the number of patients have increased. In the first two days we have already seen 8-10 patients visit us,” said Dr. Sekhawat. Same ailments were found to be the common complaints at another makeshift hospital which was set up by the Life Care Foundation, a non-profit organisation, in the initial days of the protest. Om Prakash, who has been treating farmers at the hospital over the past few days said, “We admit around 20-25 people throughout the day, mostly those who complain of dehydration. At the OPD, on an average, we have been treating around 200-250 patients, most of who come with fever and other problems. Even though we are not testing for COVID-19, if we find someone with symptoms, we ask them to visit hospitals in Narela or elsewhere.” Avtar Singh, who started the Foundation, added that several locals have also visited the makeshift hospital over the past few weeks. “Recently we have seen local patients visiting us daily to get physiotherapy sessions. Some have even recovered from ailments which they had for several years,” said Mr. Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/40-bed-makeshift-hospital-at-singhu-set-to-expand-services/article34268531.ece
08 April 2021||Chandigarh,||CM extends night curfew to entire Punjab||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday announced extension of night curfew to the entire State and a ban on political gatherings till April 30, while slamming his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal and SAD’s Sukhbir Badal for their “irresponsible conduct” in attending rallies without following COVID-19 protocol. Making it clear that those violating the ban on political gatherings, including leaders, will be booked under the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act, Capt. Amarinder said he has been forced to order the ban on political gatherings as his pleas to parties to refrain from organising such events had been ignored. The Chief Minister said he was surprised at the “behaviour of certain political leaders, including Kejriwal and Badal, who had been attending political rallies without following safety protocols”. He said “such irresponsible conduct doesn’t behove them”. He also directed Punjab DGP, Dinkar Gupta, to ensure strict implementation of the night curfew. As part of the fresh curbs, the number of people who can attend funerals and weddings has been reduced to 50 people indoors and 100 for outdoors. Wearing masks has been made mandatory for all government employees while in office, an official statement said here while detailing the fresh set of restrictions imposed as the number of COVID-19 cases continued to remain high in the State. These restrictions, coupled with the ones imposed earlier, which include closure of schools and educational institutions, shall remain effective till April 30. However, there was some respite for shop owners in malls, as the Chief Minister allowed entry of 10 people per shop at any given time, as against the earlier order of not allowing more than 100 people in the entire mall at one time. This would imply that 200 people will be allowed in a mall with 20 shops at any given time, said the statement.  62 COVID-19 deaths Punjab had on Tuesday reported 62 more fatalities due to COVID-19, pushing the toll to 7,216 while the State had witnessed 2,924 more cases, taking the infection tally to 2,57,057. The Chief Minister, in his weekly review of the COVID-19 situation, expressed concern at the high positivity and mortality rates in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cm-extends-night-curfew-to-entire-punjab/article34268518.ece
08 April 2021||New Delhi,||Model Town residents complain of ash, suffocation for over 2 hrs||Residents of Model Town 3 complained of ash settling in their area in the wee hours of Monday. They said it was “suffocating” for more than two hours. When contacted, the Fire Department said that no fire was reported from the area during that particular time. The Delhi government also did not comment on the reason behind it. A Forest Department official, after checking the issue, said it could be due to ash being dumped in a lake near the area, but said they could not confirm it at this point. “Around 2 a.m. on Monday, we woke up to a burning smell and suffocation. When we opened our doors for some fresh air, we and found that ash was settling down all over our colony. It was raining ash and it was suffocating till 4.30 a.m.,” said Akanksha Jain, 36, a resident of Model Town 3. “We called the Model Town police station and the duty officer said that there was a forest fire near Queen Mary’s School. The officer said that ash flew to many parts of Model Town,” she added. Vinod, a sanitation worker in the area, also said that he found ash in many parts of the area. “There was black colour ash at many places due to a fire,” he said. Ms. Jain said that it was not limited to their colony. “Later, I was out for work and I ound it in other parts of Model Town and even at the metro station,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/model-town-residents-complain-of-ash-suffocation-for-over-2-hrs/article34268529.ece
08 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘Submit unredacted statements of witnesses’||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed a local court to place before it the unredacted statements of protected witnesses in a sealed cover in a case related to the north-east Delhi riots last year in which Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha is facing prosecution. A Bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani asked the local court to place the statements before April 14, the next date of hearing. Tanha bail plea The High Court had on March 18 reserved its order on Mr. Tanha’s plea seeking bail in the case. It had also asked the police to file written submissions, unredacted copies of witnesses statements and other relevant documents. The Special Public Prosecutor (SSP), representing the police, had said that the unredacted copies are with the trial court. The SPP said when the investigating officer had applied for protection of witnesses, the statements were signed and sealed by the trial court judge and redacted copies were given to the investigating officer. Mr. Tanha was arrested in May last year for allegedly being part of a “premeditated conspiracy” in the riots. He has been charged under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. He has challenged a trial court’s October 26, 2020 order dismissing his bail application. His bail plea was, however, opposed by the Delhi police on the ground that the riots were premeditated and a conspiracy was hatched of which Mr. Tanha was a part. His counsel, on the other hand, had argued that he has been in custody since May 2020 and even the chargesheet has been filed. Before the trial court, Mr. Tanha’s counsel had claimed that he was not present in Delhi during the riots and did not visit any of the protest sites where rioting and violence occurred. No physical evidence The counsel had contended that there was no physical evidence connecting Mr. Tanha to the riots and no allegations with respect to any funds being received by him for terrorist activities. The trial court, in its October 26, 2020 order, had refused the bail plea on the ground that he allegedly played an active role in the entire conspiracy and that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the allegations against him were prima facie true.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/submit-unredacted-statements-of-witnesses/article34268520.ece
08 April 2021||Guwahati,||Name Ministers, MLAs involved with drug dealers: Manipur Cong.||The Manipur unit of Congress has asked the BJP-led government to name the Ministers, MLAs and police officers who have nexus with drug dealers and kingpins of the illegal trade. The demand was based on a statement by BJP legislator Lourembam Rameshwor, also Deputy Chairman of Manipur State Planning Board, that the drug menace can be overcome only if some Ministers, MLAs and police officers work with sincerity. “The statement by the BJP legislator on a public platform on April 2 regarding the insincerity of some Ministers, MLAs and police officers in waging war on drugs questions the State government’s efforts to check the menace,” Congress spokesperson Ningombam Bupenda Meitei told journalists in Imphal. “Given the situation, the government should come out with a list of lawmakers and police officers involved in drug-related crimes. If it cannot, the much-hyped war on drugs is a complete failure.” Claiming that none of the current Congress MLAs are involved in drug-related crimes, Mr. Meitei pointed out that former Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh had, in order to clear the people’s doubts, handed over a drug seizure case to the CBI after one of his relatives was allegedly involved in it.  Drug seizure case The party also asked why the BJP-led government was refusing to file an appeal in the High Court regarding a drug seizure case involving Lhukhosei Zou, a former autonomous district council chairman, while it legally pursues certain cases where the accused have already been acquitted.

08 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||IIT-D researchers develop device to diagnose dengue within an hour||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology here have developed a handheld Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)-based platform for early diagnosis of dengue and also gives dengue test results within one hour (rapid diagnosis). HIV detection The institute said that the handheld device has been successfully tested on the clinical blood samples collected from hundreds of individuals in collaboration with ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR), New Delhi, and also helps in rapid detection of HIV. Conventional tools “Early diagnosis of dengue is the key to prevent deterioration of a patient’s health. However, conventional diagnostic tools like nucleic acid detection using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is a time-taking process and it also requires expensive equipment and reagents for the diagnosis of dengue,” the institute said outlining the need for the device. Speaking of the handheld device, the project’s principal investigator, J.P. Singh, professor at IIT-Delhi said, “This ultrasensitive and handy device has wide range of applications in the early stage onsite detection of viral diseases and can produce the final report of investigation within an hour.” The research work was funded by IMPRINT India programme of the Ministry of Education with New Age Instruments and Materials Pvt Ltd as the industry partner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/iit-d-researchers-develop-device-to-diagnose-dengue-within-an-hour/article34268526.ece
08 April 2021||Guwahati,||Rechargeable batteries for e-vehicles get IIT boost||A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati has developed a technique of boosting the performance of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs). The advanced technique can precisely estimate the state of charge (SOC), one of the most important internal aspects of a battery, the team from the institute’s Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering said. The research by Professor Somanath Majhi, Associate Professor Sisir Kumar Nayak and research scholar Gautam Sethia was published in IEEE Transactions on Circuit and System I: Regular Papers, a scientific journal. The SOC indicates the remaining charge that can be withdrawn from a battery before it gets fully discharged. “The knowledge of remaining capacity helps optimise a battery’s capacity utilisation, prevent its overcharging and undercharging, increase its lifespan, reduce cost, and ensure the safety of the battery and its surroundings,” Prof. Majhi said.  Widely used batteries Lithium-ion batteries are preferred in cellphones and laptops for their low carbon emission, high energy density, low self-discharge rate, and low maintenance cost. They are also being widely used in EVs and microgrids of renewable energy sources. “The EVs are becoming the most suitable alternatives to the conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles. The battery acts as the prime energy source of electric vehicles. The precise estimation of SOC that cannot be directly measured by any sensor plays a vital role for their efficient operation,” Prof. Majhi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rechargeable-batteries-for-e-vehicles-get-iit-boost/article34268515.ece
