17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.K. nod for extradition of Nirav Modi in PNB case||The U.K.’s Home Department has approved the extradition of diamond merchant Nirav Modi to India in connection with the Rs. 13,758 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud, about two months after the Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London ruled that a prima facie case was made out against him. “The Secretary of State for the U.K.’s Home Department, Priti Patel, has cleared Mr. Nirav Modi’s extradition,” said a CBI official on Friday. The accused now has the legal recourse of approaching the U.K. High Court within 14 days to seek permission for moving an appeal against the Secretary of State’s decision. “Unless there is an appeal, a requested person must be extradited within 28 days of the Secretary of State’s decision to order extradition (subject to any appeal),” according to the U.K. government’s website. In its order dated February 25, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court found sufficient grounds warranting Mr. Modi’s trial in India. It also took on record the evidence furnished by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate, alleging that he had conspired to destroy the proof against him and intimidate witnesses. Employees confined The agencies alleged that he kept his employees, some of whom were dummy directors in the firms floated by him, in illegal confinement in Cairo. He also disposed of their mobile phones in Dubai. A Dubai-based server, in which information on the electronic communications between the accused persons was stored, was also destroyed. The U.K. court did not find any merit in Mr. Nirav Modi’s submissions on the state of his mental health and the condition of barrack 12 in Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail, where he would be kept after extradition. Based on a video inspection, the court observed that the prison was spacious enough and had sufficient security. The court was also convinced that he would get a fair trial in India. The businessman had fled the country on January 1, 2018. On India’s request, he was arrested in London on March 19, 2019, and he has since then been in judicial custody there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/uk-nod-for-extradition-of-nirav-modi-in-pnb-case/article34340475.ece

17 April 2021||Mangaluru,||People concerned over incomplete work on shoulder drains||As construction of the jinxed flyover at Shastri Circle and a vehicle underpass at Basrur Moorkai nearing completion, residents of Kundapura town are worried over possible flooding of service roads as the shoulder drains have remained incomplete. In such a situation, the entire 2 plus 2 km stretches of service roads between Vinayaka talkies and Shastri Circle get submerged in rainwater thereby affecting movement of vehicles as well as pedestrians alike, said Rashtriya Heddari Jagruthi Samiti office bearer Kishore Kumar. Consequently, the samiti has convened a meeting of residents of the town, including representatives of various associations, professionals and others to chalk out the future course of action. The flyovers were part of four-laning of National Highway 66 between Talapady in Dakshina Kannada and Kundapura taken up by the National Highways Authority of India through concessionaire M/s Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt. Ltd, about 12 years ago. Mr. Kumar said the concessionaire had even slowed down the work on flyovers a fortnight ago ostensibly due to funds shortage. Upon the samiti informed the same to Kundapura Assistant Commissioner, the company restarted the work which is nearing completion at present.   The samiti said mere completion of flyovers was insufficient unless service roads on either sides were properly laid and shoulder drains were sufficiently built. Rainwater pouring on the surface of about 1 km stretch of flyovers was bound to enter service roads while shoulder drains of service roads on both the sides were left incomplete at many stretches. Whatever drains built were filled with trash and there was no escape way for the rainwater, Mr. Kumar said. With the monsoon fast approaching, there was every possibility of the service roads getting flooded, as witnessed during the last Monsoon thereby hampering smooth movement of vehicles and pedestrians. NHAI has not provided any pedestrian path along service roads, he said wondering the fate of people walking along the highway. Residents were worried as there was no word or sign either by NHAI or by Navayuga on improving service roads. Saturday’s meeting becomes crucial as people would be asked to give their feedback on the future course of action, Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/people-concerned-over-incomplete-work-on-shoulder-drains/article34341147.ece

17 April 2021||HUBBALLI,||Hubballi professor gets a surprise from ‘Gulzar Sahab’||Never in his dream had Mustaque Ahmed S. Mulla thought that a letter he wrote to award-winning poet and lyricist Gulzar would lead to a moment he would cherish for life. It was in the second week of March that Prof. Mulla, principal of Tippu Shaheed Institute of Technology at Old Hubballi, happened to watch a reading of Mirza Galib’s poem by Mr. Gulzar in the ‘Jashn-e-Rekhta’ programme. A fan of ‘Gulzar Sahab’, Prof. Mulla could not resist penning down what he felt. He also wrote about Mr. Gulzar’s determination on reading and writing in Urdu in its own ‘Rasmul Khat’(script) and his views on learning Urdu and expressing it Devanagari script. Mr. Gulzar’s 1972 film Koshish revolved around visually-impaired characters and Prof. Mulla related to it as his father was disabled. He wrote on how the film changed his view of his father, posted the letter and had almost forgot about it. One afternoon, a few days later, Prof. Mulla’s cell phone rang and to his surprise, the person identified himself as Gulzar. He could not believe that a Dada Saheb Phalke award winner would personally call him and checked to confirm what he had heard. The conversation extending to over 15 minutes will remain etched in the memory of Prof. Mulla and his daughter Nikhat Sameen, who was by his side. “Gulzar Sahab thanked me for my letter and sought to know about Hubballi and its literary culture. His poetry, films, the region, my father, his struggle, Koshish... all figured in the conversation,” Prof. Mulla recalled. Mr. Gulzar asked Ms. Sameen, a postgraduate students, about the city, its literary circles and her literary inclination. She requested Mr. Gulzar to send an endorsed copy of his latest Urdu poetry collection Bal o par sare.  “He said he would send it. A few moments later, he called back to ask whether she knew Urdu. At that moment, I said, I too had the right to an endorsed copy, being her father,” Prof. Mulla told The Hindu . Ms. Sameen told her father that more than a poet and lyricist, Gulzar Sahab was a great human being who respected others’ sentiments. After the conversation, Mr. Gulzar sent two books, one in English for Prof. Mulla and one in Urdu for Ms. Sameen, with endorsement. These days, Prof. Mulla’s house has visitors who comes to see the books with Mr. Gulzar’s handwriting. Prof. Mulla never gets tired recalling the pleasant surprise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hubballi-professor-gets-a-surprise-from-gulzar-sahab/article34340613.ece
17 April 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Gujarat hospitals gasp for oxygen||Hospitals in Gujarat are facing an acute shortage of oxygen as COVID-19 cases and deaths soar in the State. There have been several instances of patients dying in hospitals or ambulances without supply of oxygen, including five patients at a private hospital in Navsari. “There is a massive shortage of medical-grade oxygen in hospitals. The government has ramped up capacity but it isn’t enough,” said a top hospital manager. The government has directed that 70% of the total oxygen produced in the State be reserved for medical and healthcare purposes. Though the supply is being streamlined in major cities, the situation is worsening in smaller towns as the virus penetrates the hinterland. Sources said it will take 2-3 more days to streamline supply in smaller towns. The State hit its highest single-day toll of 8,920 new cases and 94 deaths on Friday. The actual number of cases and deaths is likely to be substantially higher than the official numbers if the long queues outside crematoria in all major cities are anything to go by. In one crematorium in Surat, as many as five bodies were cremated on one pyre. In Rajkot, local media reports said 52 persons died of COVID-19 on Friday. “There is no respite from the surge in cases and deaths. We are likely to cross the 10,000 cases per day mark in the next few days, while the active cases are likely to reach around 1 lakh by the end of this month,” a medical expert said.

17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Girls grapple with pressures during pandemic: study||Twenty-five girls from seven cities set out to interview their peers to record the impact of COVID-19 on their lives and found that adolescent girls were grappling with an increased pressure to get married, spent longer hours on household chores, lacked tools to continue school education online, and reported an increase in gender-based violence. The study titled ‘COVID In Her Voice: A Girl-led and Centred Participatory Research Study’ was released on April 13. It was conducted by girls aged 13-24 from Ahmedabad, Alwar, Bareily, Delhi, Lucknow, Mumbai and Pune within their communities. Unique method It adopted a unique methodology where girls were trained as researchers to conduct interviews with a total of 153 girls from their respective communities. The study was supported by the U.K. government and conducted by EMpower, a global philanthropy focused on at-risk youth in emerging markets. Among the biggest challenges girls faced was the inability to attend online school. This was a result of nearly 80% respondents reporting an increase in household chores, which meant that 64% of girls and young women felt they did not have the space or get the time to study online. Lack of access to resources and technology was also a challenge — nearly 28% of those surveyed didn’t have the tools such as mobile phones or Internet access to learn online. With households from marginalised communities facing financial stress due to the economic impact of COVID-19, girls believed that the pressure to get married had increased, with nearly 42% reporting this. Almost 90% of girls reported experiencing mental distress and despair without any access to information about coping mechanisms. Their mental distress was exacerbated because of barriers in communicating with friends and teachers. Up to 26% respondents believe there was an increase in gender-based violence and felt that fears and threats of violence intensified restrictions on their freedom. On concluding the field research, seven girl leaders finalised a list of priority recommendations which include establishing girl-friendly spaces within the community such as skills training centres and violence-free spaces. They also seek well-maintained, safe and free toilets in close proximity to communities, as well as digital hubs in the community with charging stations and WiFi access, especially in the smaller cities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/girls-face-more-pressure-during-pandemic-study/article34341068.ece
17 April 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Gujarat hospitals gasp for oxygen||Hospitals in Gujarat are facing an acute shortage of oxygen as COVID-19 cases and deaths soar in the State. There have been several instances of patients dying in hospitals or ambulances without supply of oxygen, including five patients at a private hospital in Navsari. “There is a massive shortage of medical-grade oxygen in hospitals. The government has ramped up capacity but it isn’t enough,” said a top hospital manager. The government has directed that 70% of the total oxygen produced in the State be reserved for medical and healthcare purposes. Though the supply is being streamlined in major cities, the situation is worsening in smaller towns as the virus penetrates the hinterland. Sources said it will take 2-3 more days to streamline supply in smaller towns. The State hit its highest single-day toll of 8,920 new cases and 94 deaths on Friday. The actual number of cases and deaths is likely to be substantially higher than the official numbers if the long queues outside crematoria in all major cities are anything to go by. In one crematorium in Surat, as many as five bodies were cremated on one pyre. In Rajkot, local media reports said 52 persons died of COVID-19 on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gujarat-hospitals-gasp-for-oxygen/article34341205.ece

17 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Districts face shortage of vaccines||A shortage of COVID-19 vaccines was reported from a number of districts across Tamil Nadu. While a few districts have already run out of Covaxin, the available stocks of Covishield will last only a few days in a number of districts. Many districts were looking for fresh supplies to continue vaccination. The surge in cases has led to an increase in demand for the vaccines, resulting in quick depletion of the stocks, a section of health officials said. Owing to the depleting stocks, persons who lined up to get the jab were turned away in a number of districts. The State’s daily vaccination coverage was more than two lakh on Thursday and Friday. Sources in the Health Department said that as of April 15, the State had 7.41 lakh doses of Covishield and 1.75 lakh doses of Covaxin. Chennai had a major share, with about 4.3 lakh doses, and authorities of the four major government medical college hospitals said they had adequate stocks. However, several districts were hit hard. Health officials in Villupuram said the stocks at government and taluk hospitals had depleted, and no vaccination session was held on Friday. “On average, the seven government hospitals in the district have been administering 400-600 doses a day. But we were unable to continue the drive till Friday afternoon because most centres had depleted their stocks. We took down the phone numbers of senior citizens and those aged above 45, who had lined up for the shot and sent them back,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tn-districts-face-vaccine-shortage/article34340521.ece
17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cash, other freebies worth Rs. 1,000 crore seized by EC in ongoing Assembly polls||The Election Commission of India on Friday said it had seized cash, liquor, drugs, precious metals and other freebies worth Rs. 1,001.43 crore meant for distribution to voters in the ongoing Assembly elections. “Seizures crossed Rs. 1,000 crore for the first time in any Assembly electoral process,” the ECI said in a statement. Of the total seizures as on Thursday in Assam, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and the States where byelections are being conducted, Tamil Nadu topped the tally with seizures of Rs. 446.28 crore. It was followed by Rs. 300.11 crore in West Bengal, Rs. 122.34 crore in Assam, Rs. 84.91 crore in Kerala and Rs. 36.95 crore in Puducherry. A total of Rs. 10.84 crore was seized in connection with the various bypolls. In 2016 for the five Assembly elections, the total seizures were only Rs. 225.77 crore. When asked about FIRs filed against those involved and the details of political parties and individuals involved, an EC spokesperson did not respond. Association for Democratic Reforms founder Jagdeep S. Chhokar said the ECI may not necessarily know which parties are responsible. When the ECI comes across cash or other freebies, they seize the items.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cash-other-freebies-worth-rs-1000-crore-seized-by-ec-in-ongoing-assembly-polls/article34341063.ece
17 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Naga tribe declines to pay ‘taxes’ to extremist groups unless they unite||A Nagaland tribe has declined to pay “taxes” to several extremist groups in the State unless they unite for the greater cause of the Nagas. The “no unity, no tax” declaration by the Konyak community in the State’s Mon district is believed to be a move to provide fiscal relief to the people by ending multiple taxation. Nagaland has several extremist groups and all except a hardline faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) have signed ceasefire agreements with the Centre. Each of these groups runs parallel governments and extracts taxes from the people, the police personnel included. People end up paying at least 24-25% of their annual income to these extremist groups, and defiance has at times been met with a violent response. The decision by the Konyak Union, the apex body of community-based organisations is the first tribe-specific instance of resisting “taxation”. A civil society organisation called Against Corruption and Unabated Taxation was the first to speak out against taxation by the groups in 2015, but it represented all Naga and non-Naga communities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/naga-tribe-declines-to-pay-taxes-to-extremists/article34341070.ece

Of these 29 shall be ICU beds. The modified order comes after discussions between BMC and the hospital management. “It has been brought to the notice of MCGM that presently 30 critical patients undergoing cancer treatment and another 22 critical patients undergoing cardiac/nephro treatment are already admitted and considering their medical condition, shifting them to other hospital at this juncture may prove fatal,” the new order said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bmc-modifies-order-on-jaslok-hospital/article34341166.ece

He said: “If we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details.” The SII is making the AstraZeneca vaccine Covishield.

17 April 2021||Tirunelveli,||Director of stevedore companies held for Rs. 13.88-cr. GST evasion||A director of Thoothukudi-based two stevedore companies has been arrested in connection with alleged GST evasion to the tune of Rs. 13.88 crore. Based on intelligence inputs, officers of the Commissionerate of GST and Central Excise, Madurai conducted investigation and found that two Thoothukudi-based companies involved in extending stevedoring services, steamer agent services and freight forwarding services had evaded GST to the tune of Rs. 13.88 crore. The modus operandi involved in this tax evasion is that the said companies had collected GST from their clients but failed to remit it to the Government by suppressing the value of goods and service tax in their GST returns resulting in the evasion of GST to the tune of Rs. 9.56 crore and also has fraudulently availed Input Tax Credit of Rs. 4.32 crore without any proper invoices / bills. Subsequently, cases were registered against the two companies for this crime, which is punishable with imprisonment up to 5 years with fine, if the value of tax evasion exceeds Rs. 5 crore. The officers of the CGST and Central Excise Commissionerate on Thursday arrested the director of both the companies. He was produced before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Madurai who remanded him in judicial custody till April 29. Further investigations are on, an official statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/director-of-stevedore-companies-held-for-rs-1388-cr-gst-evasion/article34340582.ece
17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bharat Biotech to make 6 cr. doses by July||The production of indigenously developed Covaxin vaccine will be doubled by May-June and then increased nearly 6-7 fold by July-August 2021. Currently, Bharat Biotech makes one crore vaccine doses a month. Production may reach nearly 10 crore doses a month by September, the Department of Biotechnology said on Friday. The DBT has funded three other state-run facilities — the Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, Mumbai; Indian Immunologicals Limited, Hyderabad and Biologicals Limited, Bulandshahr — to make vaccines. Haffkine has been given Rs. 65 crore but it will take 6-12 months to be able to produce the vaccine; the other facilities are expected to begin producing 10-15 million doses a month by August. The mainstay of production will be Bharat Biotech which is in the process of scaling up its Bengaluru manufacturing facility. “Scaling up a manufacturing facility to be able to make 10 crore doses a month is a huge challenge,” Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, told The Hindu. “But we’ve asked all companies to accelerate.” “Haffkine didn’t immediately have the facilities to handle live virus and so building those would take time, Ms. Swarup said. “We don’t how long COVID will last but there may be other needs in the future. These are now investments for the future,” she added. “Inter-ministerial teams had visited the sites of vaccine manufacturers in India to get their inputs on how production can be ramped up. In this period, there have been extensive reviews and feasibility studies on the plans being discussed with vaccine manufacturers,” the DBT’s press statement noted. On Friday, India administered 2.2 million vaccine doses, much below its peak of April 5 when it administered over 4.3 million doses. So far India has administered 111 million doses, making it the third largest inoculator in the world. However this has covered only 7% of India’s population with only 1.1% getting fully inoculated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bharat-biotech-to-make-6-crore-doses-by-july/article34340470.ece

Centre should tell us the remedy or NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control) is expected to guide us. We have not yet received any communication from them,” Mr. Tope said. He said the State government had also written to the NCDC and was waiting for a response. “We await their reply even today.” The Minister’s statement comes days after reports that double mutations had been detected in 61% of 361 samples collected between January to March. Interestingly, no official report has yet been submitted, with Mr. Tope also saying he had only oral information on the double mutation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-guidelines-on-mutations-maharashtra/article34340471.ece
17 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Jagan requests Centre to send 60 lakh COVID vaccine doses||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting supply of 60 lakh doses of COVID-19 vaccine to enable the State to immunise the entire population aged above 45 for the first dose in the next three weeks. Record vaccination Assuring the Prime Minister of full cooperation for the Central government’s efforts to tackle the pandemic and its massive inoculation drive, the Chief Minister said the State government had taken up vaccination on a large scale as part of the Tika Utsav, and 6,28,961 persons had been vaccinated on April 14, which was the highest on a single day. It could be achieved by deploying the ward and village volunteers (each one of them catering to the needs of 50 families) across the State, he said, and added that the volunteers were roped in to mobilise the eligible persons. The Chief Minister said that vaccination was carried out in one village or ward secretariat in the purview of each primary health centre both in the rural and urban areas. This saturation approach not only helped the district administrations in focussing on containing the pandemic but also facilitated community mobilisation in the true spirit of Tika Utsav. The Chief Minister further said that the State proved its capability by vaccinating over six lakh people per day, but the same could not be continued as the vaccine stock was exhausted. If sufficient stocks of the vaccines were made available, the dream of vaccinating all vulnerable people could be realised, he said in the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-seeks-supply-of-60-lakh-vaccine-doses/article34340486.ece

17 April 2021||New Delhi,||India likely to receive normal monsoon: IMD||India is likely to receive “normal” monsoon rainfall this year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said as part of its official April forecast. Except for parts of eastern and northeastern India, many parts of the country are expected to get “above normal” rainfall, the IMD’s models show. “Normal” rainfall refers to a range — 96%-104% of the Long Period Average (LPA) of 88 cm. Earlier this week, private weather forecasting company, Skymet Weather, too, said it expected India to get normal rainfall, but said this was likely to be 103% of the LPA, whereas the IMD, on Friday, has estimated it to be 98% of the LPA. The April forecast, which is based on an analysis of select meteorological factors in March, is updated in May, along with estimates of how the monsoon will perform in different geographical regions. In 2019, the IMD forecast 96% LPA in April, but India ended up with record excessive rainfall of 110%. In 2020, it said 100% LPA, but India wound up with 109%. IMD officials, however, said it was unlikely there would be such excessive rain this year. In 2019, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) — defined as a swing in temperatures in the western and eastern sections of the Indian Ocean, where a positive phase usually corresponds to good rains over India — contributed to the excess rains. Last year it was La Nina — the converse of an El Nino and associated with a cooling of the equatorial central Pacific — again a feature correlated with heavy India rains. “This year, the models show a weak IOD and neutral conditions in the central Pacific. It’s unlikely there will be over 105% LPA this year,” D.S. Pai, a meteorologist with the IMD’s National Climate Centre, Pune, told The Hindu . Though the IMD now issues short-term and extended range forecasts — that is, an estimate of rainfall in time frames of three days to 15 days — for the first time this year, it will begin giving monthly forecasts for all months. It has so far refrained from giving a forecast for June and September, months that are known to be erratic as those are the months when the monsoon enters and exits the country, respectively, posing a challenge to meteorologists. Dr. Pai, however, said the IMD’s work for several years in honing the skills of a class of models, called dynamical models, has improved their forecasting abilities over three weeks. “So we can now extend it to monthly forecasts. The overall aim of these models is to be able to accommodate changes in the global weather that will influence the monsoon. This is more useful for planning,” he said. The IMD also said it was developing  a separate forecast for the Monsoon Core Zone (MCZ), which represents most of the rain-fed agriculture region in the country. “A separate forecast for the MCZ will be more useful for agricultural planning and crop yield estimation, etc. In the second stage forecast in May, IMD will issue a separate probabilistic forecast for the MCZ, based on MME [Multi Model Ensemble] system and a new statistical model,” said a statement. Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, tweeted that the reduction in rainfall in eastern India has been consistently decreasing. For an adequate monsoon, it is important for a temperature gradient to be present between the ocean and the land. In recent years, however, the India Ocean has been warming faster than the land surface, reducing this temperature differential and affecting the monsoonal flow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-likely-to-receive-normal-monsoon-imd/article34340398.ece
17 April 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata blames BJP for COVID-19 surge||On the eve of the fifth phase of the Assembly election, West Bengal saw a record 6,910 new COVID-19 cases and 26 deaths, including a candidate, prompting Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to blame the BJP for the surge. Speaking at a public meeting, Ms. Banerjee blamed the spike on “BJP people” from “worst-hit” States like Gujarat brought in for erecting stages and marquees for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s poll rallies. “I will tell the EC to stop the inflow of outsiders from States like Gujarat who are responsible for the COVID-19 spread in Bengal ... We have nothing to say if the PM or other leaders come for campaigning ... Why should the BJP bring people from worst-affected States to set up podiums andpandalsfor rallies?” she said. The Trinamool Congress chief said local workers and decorators can be engaged for the purpose after necessary COVID-19 tests. Ms. Banerjee said the COVID-19 surge in West Bengal could have been under check had the Prime Minister ensured vaccination for every citizen of the State. “The virus had become weak in the last five-six months. But, the PM did not take steps to vaccinate every citizen. He did not even respond to my suggestion for free vaccination for people of the State for political reasons,” she said. Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah along with several political leaders held a public meeting and a roadshow at Tehatta in Nadia, and BJP president J.P. Nadda addressed a public meeting at Ketugram in Bardhaman district. CEO holds meeting The State’s Chief Electoral Officer, Aariz Aftab, held a meeting with representatives of political parties on maintaining COVID-19 protocols. Trinamool Congress leaders, who participated in the meeting, sought clubbing of the last three phases of the election after the fifth round of polling on Saturday. Another candidate contesting the West Bengal Assembly election died after testing positive for COVID-19 on Friday. Pradip Nandy, 73, a Samyukta Morcha candidate from Jangipur in Murshidabad, was representing the Revolutionary Socialist Party, a constituent of the Left Front. He is the second candidate to die of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours. On Thursday, Congress candidate from Shamshergunj, Rejaul Haque succumbed to the infection. At least four other poll contestants have tested positive for the infection. A number of hospitals in Kolkata are facing a shortage of beds as the number of patients continued to rise. The city recorded about 1,844 new infections in the past 24 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-blames-bjp-for-covid-19-surge/article34340416.ece

17 April 2021||JORASANKO,||In Jorasanko, a prestige battle for the BJP||In the tightly poised 11 seats in Kolkata city, where the Trinamool Congress has held ground in the past, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to make headway this time around, and one of the seats its hopes are pinned on is the ancestral home of the Tagore family, Jorasanko. The area’s fame outside Kolkata is its connection to the Tagore family, the Thakurbari, or mansion of the Tagore family, former home to Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, and currently a museum. The office of BJP candidate Meena Devi Purohit is, however, in a crowded area just below the incomplete Vivekananda Setu, a portion of which crashed in 2016 in the midst of the last Assembly election. The toll of that accident numbered 27 and it injured scores of others. The ill-fated flyover remains incomplete. “If elected, I promise a solution to the flyover issue. I’ll make sure that the flyover is either completed or completely removed.” Ms. Purohit told The Hindu . She has been a corporator in Kolkata for almost three decades and many civic issues of the area, rather than any civilisational ones, dominate the fliers she distributes. Both Ms. Purohit and Trinamool candidate Vivek Gupta are non-Bengalis. Mr. Gupta, owner of the newspaper Sanmarg, was earlier a Rajya Sabha MP from the Trinamool. The area is now dominated by trading communities from Rajasthan and workers from Bihar, as it is contiguous to Bara Bazaar, once the largest wholesale market in Asia. The three corporators from the area — Sunita Jhaveri, Vijay Ojha and Ms. Purohit are all non-Bengalis. Ms. Purohit, therefore, wears the accusation of the BJP being a “Bohorigato”, or a party of outsiders, very lightly. “We are a party founded by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, who is a son of Bengal, how can we be outsiders?” she says. Her confidence also stems from the fact that in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Assembly seat showed a lead of 14,000 votes for the BJP. The Trinamool’s hold on the city’s 11 seats is considered firm and the BJP’s own realistic assessment is that they are in the fight in only three to four seats, including Jorasanko. Unlike in other States, the BJP is more of a rural party in West Bengal than urban, and the Kolkata seats are hence a battle joined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-jorasanko-a-prestige-battle-for-the-bjp/article34340411.ece
17 April 2021||Kolkata,||Amid poll promises, distress brews in Bengal tea gardens||Over the past few elections, Benam Oraon, a tea garden worker at Nagrakata Tea Estate in West Bengal, attended several election meetings and kept a note of the promises which political parties made. This election, however, he is contesting the polls as a candidate from Nagrakata Assembly seat in Jalpaiguri district representing an unregistered Progressive People’s Party . “My election symbol is football. This is to give a message that tea garden workers have been treated like a football by the political parties,” he said. As the districts of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpaiguri go to the polls on April 17, more than 10 lakh workers of tea gardens and leaf factories are set to vote in the 13 Assembly constituencies. Behind the picturesque tea gardens in Darjeeling hills and the Dooars, there is a story of distress. Kiran Kalindi, a trade union leader of the Progressive Planters Workers Union (PPWU), said the wages of tea garden workers stand at Rs. 202 per day. “Several tea gardens remain closed in the Dooars. The workers are still demanding that a notification for inclusion of tea garden workers’ wages under the Minimum Wages Act,” said Mr. Kalindi. The issue of a legally binding wage for tea garden employees has been raised for many years but political parties have shied away from addressing it. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in its election manifesto for the Assembly election, has promised to increase wages to Rs. 350 per day. The Trinamool Congress has promised pucca housing to over three lakh permanent tea garden workers through the ‘Cha Sundari’ project, along with steps to ease distress faced by tribal communities. The party has also promised that 23 tea gardens will come under a renewal project. The Left parties, in their manifesto, have said they will place emphasis on addressing the concerns of workers of closed-down tea gardens and take steps for reopening them. Anuradha Talwar, an activist who works with tea garden workers, said the daily wages were as low as Rs. 68 during the Left Front regime. After a lot of pressure, it was increased to Rs. 202. “A similar promise of increasing the wages was made by the BJP in Assam but the owners went to court, and the tea garden workers were left in the lurch. Unless there is a legal guarantee of minimum wage, the workers will continue to suffer.”  Debjit Dutta, another activist, said as the BJP is keen on the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens, a sense of unease is visible. “The tea garden workers, who came from the States of Bihar and Jharkhand before Independence, have worked in the gardens for generations but cannot prove their citizenship,” he said. With no ownership of land or houses and denial of minimum wage, lakhs of workers continue to live in a vicious cycle of bondage, plucking and processing tea leaves, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-poll-promises-distress-brews-in-bengal-tea-gardens/article34340413.ece
17 April 2021||New Delhi,||Girls face more pressure during pandemic: study||Twenty-five girls from seven cities set out to interview their peers to record the impact of COVID-19 on their lives and found that adolescent girls were grappling with an increased pressure to get married, spent longer hours on household chores, lacked tools to continue school education online, and reported an increase in gender-based violence. The study titled ‘COVID In Her Voice: A Girl-led and Centred Participatory Research Study’ was released on April 13. It was conducted by girls aged 13-24 years from Ahmedabad, Alwar, Bareily, Delhi, Lucknow, Mumbai and Pune within their communities. Unique method It adopted a unique methodology where girls were trained as researchers to conduct interviews with a total of 153 girls from their respective communities. The study was supported by the U.K. government and conducted by EMpower, a global philanthropy focused on at-risk youth in emerging markets. Among the biggest challenges girls faced was the inability to attend online school. This was a result of nearly 80% respondents reporting an increase in household chores, which meant that 64% of girls and young women felt they did not have the space or get the time to study online. Lack of access to resources and technology was also a challenge — nearly 28% of those surveyed didn’t have the tools such as mobile phones or Internet access to learn online. With households from marginalised communities facing financial stress due to the economic impact of COVID-19, girls believed that the pressure to get married had increased, with nearly 42% reporting this. Mental distress Almost 90% of girls reported experiencing mental distress and despair without any access to information about coping mechanisms. Their mental distress was exacerbated because of barriers in communicating with friends and teachers. 26% respondents believe there was an increase in gender-based violence and felt that fears and threats of violence intensified restrictions on their freedom. On concluding the field research, seven girl leaders finalised a list of priority recommendations which include establishing girl-friendly spaces within the community such as skills training centres and violence-free spaces. They also seek well-maintained, safe and free toilets in close proximity to communities, as well as digital hubs in the community with charging stations and WiFi access, especially in the smaller cities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/girls-grapple-with-pressures-during-pandemic-study/article34340425.ece
17 April 2021||Chennai,||Researchers propose method to treat blood clots after jabs||The U.S. on April 13 paused the use of Johnson and Johnson’s vaccine following adverse reactions in a few vaccinated persons while investigations are on to understand the mechanism of the rare reaction better. This followed the fact that six people in about 7 million vaccinated with J&J’s vaccine developed blood clots in the days following vaccination. A similar adverse reaction to AstraZeneca’s vaccine has been observed in rare cases. In this situation, a German and Austrian group, led by Andreas Greinacher of University Medicine Greifswald, in Germany, has announced a partial understanding of this mechanism and a possible method of treatment. Several countries have set age limits for the use of the AZ vaccine. Researchers have come closer to identifying the reason for the blood clotting events, seen in rare cases, following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine. In two separate papers published in The New England Journal of Medicine , a group of researchers from Norway and another from Austria and Germany have outlined how this adverse reaction resembles a reaction to heparin — a blood thinner. Heparin can induce a condition where the platelet number dips and blood clots form. This is known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). After vaccination, the vaccinated person develops specific antibodies which can bind to the platelets or thrombocytes and activate them to form clots which could eventually block the blood vessel (thrombosis). There is an accompanying decrease in the free platelets (thrombocytopenia). The researchers are not sure whether it is the vaccine that is causing the reaction or it is due to some factor in the person’s constitution. The researchers differentiate the blood clots arising from vaccination from HIT and have also outlined a way to test patients exhibiting the worrying symptoms and to manage the condition. They have developed a screening assay to determine whether the person has developed these particular antibodies. The researchers advise first ruling out heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and then testing for vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) followed by specific treatment of the condition with immunoglobin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/researchers-propose-method-to-treat-blood-clots-after-jabs/article34340428.ece
17 April 2021||New Delhi,||We are continuously ignored by govt., say Pandits in Kashmir||A report prepared by the Concerned Citizens’ Group, led by former External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha, has said Kashmiri Pandits, who did not migrate from the Kashmir Valley even at the peak of militancy, “were being continuously ignored in the plans of the government for the economic rehabilitation of the community”. “Blaming the Bharatiya Janta Party [BJP] for their woes, the Kashmiri Pandit representative said that it used the plight of the Pandits in every election, including in the ongoing West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. However, it does nothing for them, especially for those who never migrated out of the Valley even in the worst of times,” the report said. The report said Kashmiri Pandits had become very insecure in the last few years and “fear they could be targets of a false flag operation before the next general election in India.” “Many alluded to the all-pervasive role of the intelligence agencies in the Valley with access to every militant group through what they called embedded militants. A Valley resident said that there was trouble brewing in the Valley already,” the report said. The Concerned Citizens’ Group visited the Valley from March 30 to April 2. The group has asked the State and other political actors to address the sense of defeat and anger among the Kashmiris by opening up the democratic space for people to express themselves and asked it to restore the earlier policy of restraint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/we-are-continuously-ignored-by-govt-say-pandits-in-kashmir/article34340395.ece
17 April 2021||New Delhi,||Amid speculation, ex-Minister Natwar Singh meets Modi||Former External Affairs Minister K. Natwar Singh met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, triggering speculation. The former External Affairs Minister, who had been away from public life during the pandemic, was driven to the Prime Minister’s residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg for the meeting. It was learnt reliably that Mr. Modi discussed a number of issues during the meeting. It lasted for half an hour. Royal family Mr. Natwar Singh, who hails from the royal family of Bharatpur, joined the Indian Foreign Service on April 14, 1953. The former External Affairs Minister served in Indian missions in Beijing, Washington D.C., Warsaw and was in charge of the NAM summit of 1983 during the last stint of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Mr. Natwar Singh served as the External Affairs Minister in the first UPA government, headed by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, when India firmed up ties with the United States, which ultimately led to the India-U.S. civil nuclear deal. The former External Affairs Minister, who is also prolific writer, published his autobiography One Life is Not Enough in 2014.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-speculation-ex-minister-natwar-singh-meets-modi/article34340400.ece
17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Variants found in 1,189 samples||The Union Health Ministry on Friday said that so far 1,189 samples had tested positive for variants of concern for SARS CoV-2 in India. These include 1,109 samples with U.K. variants; 79 samples with the South African variant and 1 sample with the Brazil variant. The Ministry said the RTPCR tests being used in India did not miss the U.K., Brazil, South Africa and Double Mutant variants. “Indian Genomic Consortium for COVID-19 has shared the genome sequencing data with States multiple times and has so far processed more than 13,000 samples,” noted the release. Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers D.V. Sadananda Gowda on Friday noted that the Department of Pharmaceuticals and NPPA were continuously monitoring the production of Remdesivir. “The production has gone up from 28 lakh vials per month to 41 lakh vials per month during the last week,” he said. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday reviewed the preparedness of the AIIMS, Delhi, in the light of recent surge in cases. COVID-appropriate behaviour was the biggest tool to break the transmission chain, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/variants-found-in-1189-samples/article34340422.ece
17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Lift ban on export of vaccine raw material’||Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer, Serum Institute of India (SII), on Friday tweeted an appeal to U.S. President Joe Biden seeking lifting of the embargo on U.S. export of raw materials, which, he said, was affecting its production of COVID-19 vaccine. He said: “If we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details.” The SII is making the AstraZeneca vaccine Covishield. The appeal comes when the World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday urged countries in the southeast Asian region to apply all tools to prevent further infections and save lives. ‘Worrying trends’ “Cases are rising for the past several weeks. These are worrying trends as we continue to see opening of societies and emergence of variants. Basic public health measures remain the foundation of pandemic response and we need to reinforce them. We need to apply all the tools we have, and apply them together,” said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia region. Surveillance, testing, contact tracing, isolation, supportive quarantine and compassionate care — they all work to stop infections and save lives, and so do vaccines, she said. Consistent use of masks, hand hygiene, ventilation and social distancing continue to be best guards even today, and should be strictly followed, even by people who had already been vaccinated. On the role of virus variants in the current surge of cases, Dr. Singh said the WHO had been tracking variants globally since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. With the emergence of new variants of concern, these efforts had been stepped up to set up systems to quickly identify and study emerging variants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lift-ban-on-export-of-vaccine-raw-material/article34340424.ece
17 April 2021||LUCKNOW,||U.P. to shut down on Sundays, patients struggle to find beds||Mounting cases of COVID-19 forced the Uttar Pradesh government on Friday to declare a weekly shutdown in both rural and urban areas on Sundays and take steps to increase the number of COVID-19 beds in the city.  COVID-19 patients in Lucknow, meanwhile, continued to struggle to find beds in hospitals. The city was filled with testimonies of how patients were finding it difficult to get admitted in hospitals or secure oxygen supply smoothly in time. The State recorded 27,426 new cases and 103 deaths in the last 24 hours, including a massive 6,958 cases and 35 deaths in Lucknow, as per health department figures. Physiotherapist Ashish Srivastava’s father (73), a diabetic with breathing problems, died in a private hospital but it was preceded by the family’s desperate attempts to find him a bed in a hospital. Despite running around with an oxygen cylinder supporting the septuagenarian in a private car, the family alleged they failed to find a hospital that admitted him as hospitals demanded a COVID-19 report first or cited lack of beds. Mr. Srivastava said he dialled the COVID centre here for three-four days but they did not admit his father, who had tested positive. “We kept waiting outside the hospital with the oxygen. Despite registering several times at the COVID centre, he didn’t get the bed,” said Mr. Srivastava, adding that no officials offered help despite their pleas. Hospital negligence Retired district judge Ramesh Chandra also suffered a tragedy as his wife died with COVID-19 symptoms and was allegedly not admitted to any hospital. He alleged he was given false assurances of help by the officials leading to wastage of crucial time. His wife died due to the negligence of the administration, alleged the retired judge. The couple had been administered Covaxine shots but still ended up with symptoms. Mr. Chandra says he first took her to a government hospital but they said they could not accommodate her. “They made us wait for six-seven hours and told us to take the patient away. It would be at own our risk if we let her stay there, they warned us,” he said. He then tried other hospitals but even they refused before approaching a major private hospital where he was told they did not carry out any COVID test. He says he made calls to the numbers provided by the administration but nobody came home with medicine or admitted her to the hospital. “They kept us hanging. She died at home. They left her to die. Had they told us they can't arrange anything, I would have made alternate arrangements elsewhere in Gonda district,” he said. Patients and their kin are also dialling the emergency services of the U.P. police as they struggle to find beds in hospitals or get tested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-to-shut-down-on-sundays-patients-struggle-to-find-beds/article34340700.ece

In 2016 for the five Assembly elections, the total seizures had been Rs. 225.77 crore. When asked about FIRs filed against those involved and details of political parties and individuals involved, an EC spokesperson did not respond. According to Association for Democratic Reforms founder Jagdeep S. Chhokar, the EC may not necessarily know which parties are responsible. When the EC catches cash or other freebies being transported, they seize the items. “They should confiscate the vehicles and file FIRs,” he said. Out of the total cash of Rs. 344.85 crore seized, Rs. 236.69 crore was from Tamil Nadu, Rs. 50.71 crore from West Bengal, Rs. 27.09 crore from Assam, Rs. 22.88 crore from Kerala and Rs. 5.52 crore from Puducherry. West Bengal and Assam accounted for the majority of liquor seized, with Rs. 30.11 crore and Rs. 41.97 crore of the total liquor worth Rs. 85.01 crore seized respectively. Out of the Rs. 161.60 crore worth of drugs seized, Rs. 118.83 crore was from West Bengal, with Assam in second place with Rs. 34.41 crore. Tamil Nadu accounted for most of the precious metals seized worth Rs. 176.46 crore out of the total of Rs. 270.80 crore, while Kerala accounted for Rs. 50.86 crore, a distant second. “The stupendous rise in seizure figures is because of better preparedness and multi-pronged strategy of the Commission... For effective monitoring, Commission has appointed five SEOs,” the EC said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cash-freebies-worth-rs-1000-cr-seized-by-ec/article34340387.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||U.K. nod for extradition of Nirav Modi||The CBI had registered the first case against the diamond merchant and others on January 31, 2018, alleging that they cheated the PNB of about Rs. 6,498 crore by getting Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) issued fraudulently to overseas banks for securing buyer’s credit in favour of his three firms. Months later, the agency filed a charge-sheet against him and 24 others. Subsequently, in August 2018, the first extradition request was sent to the U.K. via diplomatic channels. The second chargesheet was submitted against 30 accused, including some companies, on December 20, 2019, regarding 150 outstanding LoUs that caused a loss of about Rs. 6,805 crore to the bank. Based on the CBI case, the ED also carried out a money laundering probe and attached assets worth hundreds of crores in India and abroad. As it turned out, Mr. Nirav Modi had allegedly established dummy companies in Dubai and Hong Kong to project them as the exporters of pearls to his three firms and importers of pearl-studded jewellery from them. In the PNB case, Mr. Nirav Modi’s uncle Mehul Choksi is also facing extradition proceedings in Antigua. He had taken Antiguan citizenship before he flew out of India in January 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uk-nod-for-extradition-of-nirav-modi-in-case/article34340388.ece
17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Must ensure democracy prevails in Afghanistan’||The U.S. decision to pull out all forces from Afghanistan is a “big step” that will have deep consequences, said External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who called for a “responsible drawdown” of American and NATO forces. Along with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and Afghanistan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib, Mr. Jaishankar said it was necessary that Afghanistan’s constitution, democratic processes and the rights accorded to women and minorities were ensured under any circumstances, and that the “endgame” in Afghanistan be “united, democratic and sovereign”. “What all of us see in [U.S.] President Biden’s announcement is a big step that is going to take Afghanistan in a certain direction and it is important that we all work together to ensure that the direction is right and the outcomes are good for Afghanistan,” Mr. Jaishankar said while speaking at the Ministry of External Affairs’ annual Raisina Dialogue on a panel with Mr. Zarif and Mr. Mohib during a virtual session. India’s concerns Mr. Jaishankar’s comment indicated India’s concerns about a hasty withdrawal of the U.S. and allied forces from Afghanistan, which could bring the Taliban into a powerful role in Kabul. On Thursday, the Chief of the Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, had said India’s concern was that “the vacuum that was going to be created should not create space for disruptors to step in, and, therefore, the violence continues in Afghanistan”. Mr. Mohib, who said he had called National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on Friday and spoke to him about the transition plan as well as the upcoming intra-Afghan and regional talks in Turkey, added that much would depend on the troops withdrawal plan and what kind of assistance they would continue to provide the Afghan National Security and Defence Forces (ANSDF). “We are in uncharted territory, and the devil is in the details of what we negotiate with NATO forces,” he said, referring to the continuing threat of violence from foreign fighters as well as the Taliban. In particular, referring to Islamic State (IS) fighters present in Afghanistan, Mr. Zarif said it was necessary to see that Afghanistan and all its neighbours faced “common threats, common challenges”. Development assistance Enumerating India’s development assistance to Afghanistan since 2001, Mr. Jaishankar said it was an “absolute fantasy” that India’s actions in Afghanistan were aimed at Pakistan, and a cause of bilateral differences and regional instability. He said India’s role, including in the construction of the Afghan parliament, the Salma Dam and road networks, was a “positive” one unlike other neighbours, in a pointed reference to Pakistan’s support to the Taliban and terror groups operating there.

Mr. Gandhi, who was scheduled to address a press conference on the second wave, however, cancelled it. Party insiders say he, along with other senior leaders, may do so after a virtual meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday. “The Central government’s COVID-19 strategy — Stage 1- Impose a Tughlaqi lockdown, Stage 2- Ring bells, Stage 3- Sing praises to the Lord,” Mr. Gandhi said on Twitter. On Instagram, he also shared a video clip of his comment from a virtual press conference last year on April 16 on how the lockdown will only allow authorities to ramp up medical facilities but the virus will return. Mr. Gandhi also shared a video of a news clip of hospital facilities being overwhelmed with fresh COVID-19 cases, in an attempt to convey that little was done in the past one year. ‘Mismanaged situation’ The Congress has been criticising the handling of the pandemic by the Modi government. Party chief Sonia Gandhi, at a recent meeting with Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States, accused the Centre of mismanagement. “The Modi government has mismanaged the situation — exported vaccine and allowed a shortage to be created in India. Mass gatherings for elections and religious events have accelerated COVID-19 for which all of us are responsible to some extent. We need to accept this responsibility and keep the interest of the nation above our own,” Ms. Gandhi told her party colleagues at the virtual meet on April 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-slams-modi-govts-strategy-on-covid-19/article34340407.ece

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia also asked the government to release the actual number of patients who died of COVID-19 and those who died with co-morbid conditions. The court observed that transparency was needed to remove general conception from the minds of people that the data shared by the government were not accurate. “Accurate reporting of RT-PCR testing with correct figures of positive results be made public. The State should not feel shy of publishing the correct data of RT-PCR testing results, if such figures are not being correctly reported,” the Bench said. The court said the State had nothing to gain by suppressing real and actual data, saying “suppression and concealment of accurate data would generate more serious problems, including fear, loss of trust and panic amongst public at large”. “Necessary arrangements should be made by issuing statement by responsible officer of the State with regard to the number of positive COVID patients, number of deaths due to COVID-19 and number of deaths due to COVID with co-morbidity so that faith and trust can be restored in the minds of public at large,” the court said. The High Court advised the government to establish an “honest and transparent dialogue” with the public to generate trust amongst public. The bench observed that such trust would eventually “persuade the public at large to strictly abide by the standard protocol of wearing mask in this grave situation”. The court has posted the matter for further hearing in April 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dont-conceal-covid-19-data-hc-directs-gujarat/article34340426.ece

17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘How can you ignore Governor on inquiry?’||The Madras High Court on Friday questioned the State government for not having taken Governor Banwarilal Purohit, in his capacity as the Chancellor of Anna University, into confidence before constituting a Commission of Inquiry last year into the charges of bribery, corruption, malpractice, financial irregularities, irregular appointments and so on against M.K. Surappa, whose three-year tenure as Vice-Chancellor ended on April 11. Justice M. Govindaraj asked how the government could “ignore” the Governor despite him being the administrative head of the university. The question was posed when Additional Solicitor-General R. Sankaranarayanan, representing the Chancellor, said the Governor attempted to find an amicable solution to the hostile relationship between the government and Mr. Surappa, in the interest of the institution, but the government did not respond. ‘The sole purpose’ Mr. Surappa had made the Chancellor too as one of the respondents to a writ petition filed by him in February this year. The petition had challenged a Government Order issued on November 11, 2020, for the constitution of the Commission of Inquiry. His counsel N. Vijayaraghavan contended that the sole purpose of the constitution of the Commission of Inquiry, under Section 11 of the Anna University Act, 1978, was to remove his client from the post of Vice-Chancellor. Now that his tenure had come to an end by the efflux of time and no extension had been granted, there would be no use in continuing the inquiry, he said, insisting that the government be asked to respond as to whether it still wanted to continue the probe. “Where are they going to remove me from? My residence? Their jurisdiction does extend beyond Chennai. What will they do if I go to Karnataka?” he asked. In response, Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan said the Commission of Inquiry was being headed by a retired judge of the High Court. Since Advocate-General Vijay Narayan had to argue the case on behalf of the State, he urged the court to adjourn the matter to enable Mr. Narayan to appear.  Request granted Accepting his request, the judge adjourned the case till June and extended, until further orders, an interim order passed by the court in favour of Mr. Surappa on February 27. By way of the interim order, Justice S. Vaidyanathan, the then portfolio judge, had restrained the government from taking any decision, for a period of two weeks, if the Commission of Inquiry completed its probe and submitted a report. On March 31, the interim order was extended till April 19. Since government counsel sought an adjournment on Friday, Justice Govindaraj decided to hear the case after the summer vacation and extended the interim relief until further orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/how-can-you-ignore-governor-on-inquiry/article34340569.ece

Over 2 lakh get jabs For the second day in a row, over two lakh people were vaccinated in the State. A total of 2,01,495 people received the vaccines. This took the total coverage to 45,92,124. While Covishield was administered to 4,636 healthcare workers, 12,991 frontline staff, 94,583 people aged 45-59 years and 63,164 senior citizens, Covaxin was administered to 1,461 healthcare workers, 2,058 frontline staff, 13,684 people aged 45-59 and 8,918 senior citizens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/daily-case-count-crosses-8000-mark/article34340546.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Summer camps and classes are unsafe, say experts||Ahead of the upcoming summer holidays, announcements have begun to crop up by private establishments in the city promising summer classes and camps for children between 5 and 15 years of age. Stating that she was planning to organise summer classes and activities for children from 4 years to 14 years, a parent in Tambaram said she had enough space and trained staff to help her ensure that physical distancing norms were followed. “All the facilitators who will be taking classes have been vaccinated and we will only allow children inside the space we are conducting the classes in. For 10 days, there will be two hour classes every day,” she said, stating that they were scheduled to start classes in March. For an ongoing swimming camp in the city, the organisers said that they were limiting the batch to not more than 10 at a time and had restricted the class timings to one hour everyday. The prospect of these camps might be alluring for parents whose children have been cooped up indoors for over a year now but the steadily increasing number of COVID-19 cases need to be considered. A representative from a design school that is planning on hosting a summer camp this year said enrolment has not taken off in a big way so far. “We are in a dilemma whether to go on with the camp this year given the health and safety concerns in place and are planning to take a call on this soon,” they said. Schools in Tamil Nadu have been shut since March 2020 and even when they reopened earlier this year for senior classes, a decision was subsequently taken to shut schools for students of Classes 9 to 11. Summer camps held by private establishments do not fall under the ambit of the School Education Department, a senior official said. Officials of the Health Department said summer camps for children were not permitted. As per the Government Order 342 issued by the Revenue and Disaster Management Department, dated April 8, on extending the lockdown with existing guidelines and relaxations and further restrictions, all social/political/academic/entertainment/sports/cultural and other functions shall be permitted in closed spaces with a maximum ceiling of 200 persons after duly following the Standard Operating Procedures. A subtle difference A health official said though summer camps seem to fall under this rule, in actuality it was aimed at one-time activities. “Summer classes are different. The camps will have a lot of interactions between children and have the potential to spread of infection,” he said. “Summer camps are not safe. We do not have much data regarding COVID-19 in children below 18 years of age. Similarly, we do not have data on vaccination against COVID-19 for children. Kids are superspreaders. They can carry the infection and spread the infection while remaining asymptomatic,” said R. Narasimhan, chairman of the Respiratory Research Foundation of India. He added that this was why doctors were concerned about children aged below 14 years. “They could carry it home and spread to their parents,” he said. Over the last year, classes for art, music, dance and theatre have taken the online route. A few companies are also taking the online route for summer camps, which seem to be the safest at the moment. “In the last one year, many of us who work in the performing arts space with children have adapted very well online. While screen time might be a concern among parents, interactive live classes is something children always look forward to,” said Dushyanth Gunashekar, co-founder of Crea-Play, an app that allows children to stage their stories digitally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/summer-camps-classes-unsafe-experts/article34340606.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Robot-assisted cancer surgery is more precise’||The Apollo Proton Cancer Centre completed its first robot-assisted cancer procedure for colon cancer in a 40-year-old patient from Bangladesh recently. The patient was discharged 48 hours after the procedure and post-surgery was uneventful, said Ajit Pai, senior consultant and lead surgeon, GI Oncology. Dr. Pai demonstrated the machine which uses an advanced robotics system. The machine, Da Vinci Surgical System, provides surgeons with a 3D image and enables them to reach areas that are humanly impossible to touch, he said. The equipment, a fourth generation robotic system, can be used for complex surgeries. It is especially useful to treat difficult cancers of solid organs such as the liver or pancreas. Remote operation The surgeon operates the equipment remotely but gets a 10-times magnified view of the surgery itself. The surgeon has total control of the surgical procedure. He sits at the console and manipulates the microfine instruments that are flexible and more manoeuvrable than the human hand. With only small incisions being made the patient does not exhibit scars or blood loss, he added. Reduces stay The equipment not only increases precision but also reduces the patients’ hospital stay as recovery from major surgeries is quicker. It reduces instances of infections as well, Dr. Pai added. He said the machine was especially helpful as it enables surgeons to see blind areas or nerves and nodules in organs. “It allows surgeons to undertake radical surgeries, it is more delicate and the operation is smoother. The patient recovers without damage to any critical structures and leaves without damage to healthy tissues,” he added. When the method is used for pelvic cancer surgeries, it allows for quicker return of bowel movement, continence and faster return of sexual function, he said. Rakesh Jalali, medical director and head, Radiation Oncology at the APCC, said patients were selected with care after consultation with a team of surgeons. As for the cost of the procedure, using the equipment specialists maintained that the cost was comparable to what was offered across the Apollo Hospitals group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/robot-assisted-cancer-surgery-is-more-precise/article34341023.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Practical exams begin for Plus 2 students in T.N.||Practical exams for nearly two lakh science group students commenced in State Board schools across the State on Friday. The Directorate of Government Examinations (DGE) issued Standard Operation Procedures for the conduct of practicals and all students and staff had to compulsorily wear masks as well as ensure physical distancing norms in the school labs. School Education Director S. Kannappan visited the Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Ashok Nagar where the exam was held for their Class XII students. “The practical exams are taking place in around 7,000 schools across the State and keeping the student’s welfare in mind, all safety measures are being followed strictly. We have ensured that they get simple experiments which they can complete, keeping the safety measures in mind and they have been trained in a short time for these exams since schools reopened in January,” he said. He reiterated that for students who have tested positive for COVID-19, the exam will be held at a later date as has already been announced by the DGE. The board exams for these students are scheduled to begin from May 5. Following the postponement of the CBSE Class XII Board Exams, several teachers’ associations and parents have appealed to the government for a similar order for the State Board as well. In an appeal to the Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary, the Tamil Nadu Students Parents Welfare Association said the State government should consider the anxiety that students and parents were under to take up the exams at a time when cases are increasing by the day, and asked for the board exams to be postponed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/practical-exams-begin-for-plus-2-students-in-tn/article34340588.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIRF demands withdrawal of vaccination circulars||The All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF) has urged the Southern Railway/Integral Coach Factory General Manager to withdraw the two circulars sent to employees aged 45 years and above that they should report after taking COVID-19 vaccination or go on leave. Referring to the advisory issued by the Department of Personnel & Training, AIRF president N. Kanniah said vaccination should be encouraged and not mandated. “While we appreciate the vaccination drive, the same cannot be compelled or ordered as individuals have their own medical complications and apprehensions…,” he said. The ICF and Southern Railway’s Thiruvananthapuram Division had issued circulars to staff asking them to get vaccinated before reporting to work or proceed on leave, which had caused “displeasure” among the employees. Mr. Kanniah said the Central government chose persons aged 45 years and above for vaccination as part of a strategy adopted after assessing the COVID-19 situation at the national level. “Nowhere in the DoPT order was it mentioned that vaccination was mandatory to attend office and those who do not get vaccinated should avail their own leave… we have written to the General Manager requesting him to withdraw both the circulars in the larger interest of the employees,” he said.   Meanwhile, Southern Railway’s healthcare infrastructure has been widened with the increase in the number of cases. According to railway sources, additional beds and isolation facilities were created to accommodate positive cases and asymptomatic persons suspected to have COVID-19. Access control Staff attendance was pruned to a minimum of 50% and strict access control measures put in place to check entry of visitors to the Zonal and Divisional headquarters. “A majority of visitors come with applications seeking allotment of berths under the emergency quota. Now, the number of such requests has come down drastically… There are many cancellations in the recent weeks due to the resurgence of the second wave of the pandemic,” a senior railway official said.

17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Why not have special vaccine camps for differently abled?’||The Madras High Court on Friday directed the Centre and the State government to report on Monday the possibility of establishing special camps in every district to administer COVID-19 vaccines exclusively to the differently abled. The court felt that the governments must give priority to the differently abled too since they were in a pitiable condition. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed State Government Pleader (SGP) V. Jayaprakash Narayanan to get appropriate instructions from the Health Secretary. The direction was issued after the SGP said the State government had already written a letter to the Centre, seeking permission to include the differently abled in the priority group for vaccination. Polio survivor Meenakshi Balasubramanian of Chennai had filed a public interest litigation petition in the court, stating that the physically challenged faced increased and devastating consequences due to COVID-19, and therefore must be administered the vaccines on a priority basis. In reply to this, the Centre stated that prioritisation was being done in the backdrop of the limited availability of vaccines. Vaccine availability “The decision on prioritisation has been taken by an expert group, based on scientific evidence and domain knowledge expertise, keeping vaccine availability and larger public interest in view,” the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said. It was also the stand of the Centre that multiple cases related to prioritisation were pending before different High Courts in the country, and they must be clubbed and heard together by the Supreme Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/why-dont-you-establish-special-camps-to-vaccinate-the-differently-abled-hc-asks-government/article34340520.ece

The Election Commission of India (ECI) ordered a repoll in the booth on the basis of a report submitted by returning officers and observers. The fresh voting will now take place on April 17 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. On April 6, three staff of the Greater Chennai Corporation, who were on poll duty in booth number 92 at DAV school in Velachery, were caught transporting an electronic voting machine and other paraphernalia in a two-wheeler on Velachery-Taramani High Road after the conclusion of the poll. Congress and MNM candidates lodged complaints with the ECI. Based on that, an inquiry was ordered. The staff members, who were found violating norms, were suspended and then the ECI ordered the repolling. There are 548 voters from two residential apartments, who are eligible to cast their votes in the booth. The Corporation staff distributed booth slips to the voters. As many as 13 candidates were allowed to do door-to-door canvassing on Thursday. Fresh polling staff have been posted. City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal said a three-tier security arrangement, comprising the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF), the Tamil Nadu Special Police and the city police personnel will be in place in the area. Over 25 Tasmac liquor shops located in the surrounding areas have been closed ahead of polling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/repolling-in-velachery-booth-number-92-to-be-held-today/article34341030.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Karnan’ director explains the film’s 1997 setting||Filmmaker Mari Selvaraj has put an end to the controversy regarding the period in which his latest film, Karnan , starring actor Dhanush, is set by stating that the film was set in 1997 to provide a reference to how people lived during the time. A section of DMK supporters had on social media criticised him for mentioning that the story, which is loosely based on the Kodiyankulam incident in 1995 when police launched a brutal assault on a Devendrakula Velalar village in Kodiyankulam near Tirunelveli, is set in 1997 instead. Many of them took issue with the fact that the film tries to blame the DMK for the incident when in fact the AIADMK was in power at the time of the actual incident. DMK youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin appreciated the film but pointed out this contradiction to the makers of the film.  Later on, the makers had changed the period to just the ‘Later part of the 90s’. Mr. Selvaraj sought to explain this in an interview to a Tamil magazine saying “The year is shown as 1997 to tell the audience that people did not have cell phones and access to buses. It was not my intention to refer to who was in power at the time.” He said the reference to the year would be removed completely.

17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Private hospitals see faster inflow of COVID-19 patients||Many private hospitals in Chennai are running to near-full capacity. The rapid surge in daily COVID-19 cases has led to higher and faster inflow of patients than last year. Authorities of a number of hospitals said they were operating at their maximum bed strength. Some hospitals were admitting patients depending on the number of discharges per day, while some had to keep patients waiting for want of beds. A few hospitals have decided not to stretch beyond their manpower capacity. “The inflow of patients has steadily increased in the last four weeks. The hospital has around 130 beds reserved for COVID-19 that includes the intensive care unit. In the last two weeks, our bed occupancy has been 90% to 92%. To admit new patients, we have to wait to see how many patients are being discharged on a particular day,” said Gomathy Narasimhan, chairman, Medical Advisory Board and senior consultant, HPB Surgery, Liver and Renal Transplant Surgeon, Rela Hospital. Currently, most patients, who come to the hospital are symptomatic, she said, adding: “We are seeing more symptomatic and more young persons. Category-wise, we are picking up more patients with moderate COVID-19. People should stay away from crowded places and avoid socialising.” Navin Gnanasekaran, associate director of medical services, MGM Healthcare, said COVID-19 cases had surpassed the previous peak numbers at the hospital both outpatient-wise and inpatient-wise. “Non-COVID-19 cases saw an 80% to 85% fall in numbers during the previous peak. They have not fallen by more than 10% this time around,” he said. He said around 70-100 patients with COVID-19 are the average in every corporate hospital with a minimum bed strength of 250 presently. “As a proportion, it is around 30-50% of the total bed strength of each hospital. This includes ward beds with oxygen, ICU beds and specialised ECMO ICU beds. Most hospitals are allocating 30-50% of their total bed strength and resources to COVID-19,” he said. Health checks, dental, ophthalmology and dermatological services (elective) were being wound up to accommodate resource allocation to COVID-19 care. “Elective surgeries and non-COVID-19 admissions are still on. The present challenge is to cater to both categories of patients as the latter has not seen a significant dip. Hence, there are challenges in converting care areas, stopping elective in-patient and out-patient work, resource allocation to the ICU and staff quarantine,” he explained. At Fortis Malar Hospital, its facility director C.K. Nageswaran, said the hospital had reserved 40 to 50 beds for patients with COVID-19, and bed occupancy has reached 100%. “In the previous surge, it took a long time for us to reach full capacity. In fact, COVID-19 cases were almost negligible by February 15 this year. We had decided on March 1 not to take any more patients with COVID-19. But the numbers went up from March 15, and by the end of the month, we reached our peak capacity. The numbers are increasing very fast,” he said. At Dr. Mehta’s Hospitals, Chetpet, 20 beds were earmarked for COVID-19. This included regular, oxygen beds and for ICU, while 70 beds were earmarked at Velapanchavadi, said N. Kannan, group medical director, Dr Mehta’s Hospitals. “We are getting 15 to 20 patients with COVID-19 daily. Currently, we are operating at an occupancy rate of 100%. Doctors are advising home isolation for mild to moderate cases, and all severe cases are advised to get admitted to the hospital,” he said.  Elective surgeries and non-COVID-19 admissions are still on.

17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Saving our environment, saving us||His passion for the environment started in childhood at Mudichur, a locality surrounded by waterbodies. The natural environment around his house and its slow degradation motivated him to volunteer for conservation. Arun Krishnamurthy, founder of Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI), embarked on a journey to clean up the lakes in his early 20s. A single man’s initiative, launched in 2007, has grown into a movement that has helped to restore waterbodies in 15 States and diversified to address other environmental issues. Days spent as a student volunteer taught him how a non-governmental organisation works, and his stint at Google, Hyderabad, encouraged him to think out of the box. “EFI was a purely volunteer-driven movement between 2007 and 2011. I initially used to mobilise volunteers for lake clean-ups through personal networks in Chennai, Coimbatore and Hyderabad. Student volunteers propelled the efforts,” says the 34-year-old activist. Mr. Krishnamurthy was the quintessential face of weekend volunteering for lake and pond clean-ups, a popular concept now in Chennai and many other cities. In 2009, teams used to motivate school students to volunteer through environment orientation programmes in Chennai and Hyderabad. “We used to do beach clean-ups. We created a platform for people who were ready to participate in and contribute to eco-system conservation,” he said. It was in 2012 that EFI was registered as a wildlife conservation and habitat restoration group. The same year, he was chosen for the Rolex Award for Enterprise. “I realised what I was destined for after the prestigious award. We focus on scientific restoration of waterbodies, not just beautification. We look for innovative solutions to sustain efforts,” he said. This non-profit trust has restored nearly 141 waterbodies across 15 States, and has engaged 14 full-time environmental professionals. Recalling that 57,000 volunteers were involved in restoration activities in 2018 in nine States, Mr. Krishnamurthy said, “People are our strength. It is the highest number of volunteers since EFI was started. Our focus on restoration changed after the government streamlined NGO participation in 2014 with the water security mission. We can achieve result-oriented restoration only if everyone comes together.” With the collaboration of the government, civil society, NGOs and industries, it became a success model for lake conservation. He is now involved in beach clean-ups through EFI’s Samudhra project. “We want to mitigate the localised ocean trash pollution in our coastal city. In the next three years, I want to enhance this project and invest time in urban afforestation and develop green cover on a 50-acre land parcel at Manali and Sriperumbudur,” said Mr. Krishnamurthy, who runs Krish Infomedia, a company specialising in digital marketing and psephology services. He also aims to build the next level of leadership to take up more environmental projects in 10 years. “My goal is to restore 50 lakes and ponds every year,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/saving-our-environment-saving-us/article34340539.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Right to privacy, reputation extinguishes after death: HC||The right to privacy of an individual and the reputation earned during their lifetime extinguishes after death, and therefore, neither of them can be inherited by the legal heirs of the deceased, as is the case with immovable and movable properties. The legal heirs also cannot attempt to protect them through the initiation of legal proceedings, ruled the Madras High Court on Friday. Justices R. Subbiah and Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup passed the ruling while dismissing an appeal preferred by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s niece J. Deepa. The appeal had been filed against a single judge’s refusal to injunct the release of Kangana Ranaut and Arvind Swami-starrer Thalaivi on the ground that the film was not made with her consent, and therefore, might sully the image of Jayalalithaa. Disagreeing with the appellant, the second Division Bench wrote: “Personality, reputation or privacy enjoyed by a person during his/her lifetime comes to an end with his/her death. We are of the opinion that a posthumous right is not an alienable one. Therefore, the appellant is not entitled for an injunction on the ground that the posthumous right of her aunt is sought to be sullied by the release of the film titled Thalaivi .” Authoring the verdict, Justice Subbiah also pointed out that the movie was yet to be released, and hence, it was too early for the appellant to claim that the makers of the film would cause damage to the reputation of her aunt. The Bench also agreed with senior counsel P.S. Raman, representing the movie’s director A.L. Vijay and producer Vishnu Vardhan Induri, that there was no obligation on the part of the film-makers to obtain the appellant’s consent before making a movie on her aunt’s life. The constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression was not conditioned or restricted on the premise that a film-maker must portray only a particular version of facts, it said. Passing a common order, the judges also refused to grant any relief against the web series Queen .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/right-to-privacy-reputation-extinguishes-after-death-hc/article34340542.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. sets record in job guarantee scheme||Tamil Nadu, one of the States hit hard by COVID-19, has created a record in the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in the just-concluded financial year (2020-21). After four years, the number of person days generated in the State crossed the 30-crore-mark. It stood at 33.4 crore person days. For 2020-21, the Centre had fixed a target of 27 crore person days for the State. Later, it revised the target to 32 crore person days. “This is a record for the State as the number of days of employment remained at 100 last year,” points out an official of the State Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department. When the generation of person days exceeded the 30-crore-mark last time, around 39.6 crore in 2016-17, the number of days of employment was increased to 150. Salem was one of those districts that exceeded the target of person days last year, generating about 1.24 crore person days against the approved 1.12 crore person days. Kancheepuram’s performance was said to be impressive in natural resources management, water conservation and plantation. As many as 174 check-dams were built. What was considered significant by the authorities than the increase in the generation of person days was that the MGNREGS ensured the disbursal of Rs. 160 crore-Rs. 185 crore every week to the beneficiaries, proving to be a steady source of support to the rural economy, the official feels. According to the data available on the website of the scheme, as maintained by the Union Ministry of Rural Development, the pandemic year — 2020-21 — saw an increase of around Rs. 2,000 crore in the payment of wages, compared with 2018-19 and 2019-20. Likewise, in terms of families that got jobs, 10 lakh more benefited last year than those covered in the other two years. In other words, while about 56 lakh families were given jobs during 2018-19 and 2019-20, around 66.5 lakh families were covered during 2020-21. The number of additionally employed people last year was approximately 14 lakhs. Around 69,250 differently abled persons had also found work. Development experts attribute the increase in the coverage of the scheme to the reverse migration in the wake of the pandemic. Contending that the scheme was carried out in adherence with “stringent precautionary measures” on account of the pandemic, the official claimed that no COVID-19 case was reported from the work sites. However, 404 beneficiaries tested positive.  This is a record for the State as the number of days of employment remained at 100 last year OfficialRural Development and Panchayat Raj Department||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-sets-record-in-job-guarantee-scheme/article34340544.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu’s development model has few parallels, says expert||Tamil Nadu’s development trajectory had few parallels in the country and the only two States that were comparable were Kerala and Himachal Pradesh, said Jean Dreze, honorary professor, Delhi School of Economics. Speaking at a panel discussion through video conferencing following the launch of the book, The Dravidian Model - Interpreting the Political Economy , here on Friday, he said all three States invested considerably in education early on. He said a key learning from the Tamil Nadu model was the viewing of education as a matter of social justice and thereby making it a political tool. He said there could not have been a better time for such a book as the investments made by Tamil Nadu in its public health system were showing in the relatively better handling of COVID-19. Acknowledging that there was scope for improvement, including in the area of education and learning outcomes as pointed out by the authors in their book, Mr. Dreze said Tamil Nadu still performed relatively better than almost all other States. M. Vijayabaskar, professor, Madras Institute of Development Studies, who co-wrote the book with A. Kalaiyarasan, assistant professor, MIDS, said it dealt with two core arguments. “First is that Tamil Nadu has been able to combine relatively high rate of human resource development along with a degree of economic dynamism, with few parallels within the country. Secondly, we attribute this dynamism and distinct development trajectory to the particular form of political mobilisation, which is the mobilisation against status-based inequalities, and the conception of social justice within a caste society,” he said. N. Ram, Director, The Hindu Publishing Group, said the book was an interesting contribution to the question of what the Dravidian experience is. He said the comparison with Kerala was, however, tricky, as it was way ahead on various indicators of human development. He said two chapters in the book, highlighting the rural transformation and how industrial development in Tamil Nadu was more inclusive with more entrepreneurs from the backward classes, were significant and required further study. He said it was remarkable how Tamil Nadu remains the State that had given least space for communal forces in the country. Mr. Ram, however, said the book underplayed the extreme oppression faced by Dalits in Tamil Nadu. S. Narayan, former Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister and author of the book The Dravidian Years , said the book provided an excellent analysis of the development trajectory during the rule of Dravidian parties. He, however, wondered whether the populist movement directly led to the development in all spheres of Tamil Nadu or whether an alternative narrative was possible. Quoting Periyar E.V. Ramasamy’s views on English language, Padmini Swaminathan, former Director, MIDS, questioned the failure of the Dravidian parties in providing English language education to all sections of society. Former West Bengal Governor and professor of Ashoka University Gopalkrishna Gandhi stressed on the need for the comeback of a strong Dravidian political voice in the country as federalism was becoming voiceless today. Highlighting the criticism of rampant corruption and other failures of the Dravidian parties, he, however, said the resurgent voice should be integrous, courageous and transparent. A.R. Venkatachalapathy, professor, MIDS, who moderated the discussion, said the book addressed the lack of serious scholarship on the achievements of the Dravidian rule and it would act as a harbinger of many such works to come.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadus-development-model-has-few-parallels-says-expert/article34341028.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||NH stretch ranks among top 20||The 148.30-km-long Krishnagiri - Walajahpet stretch of Chennai - Bengaluru Road has been chosen one among top 20 national highways stretches in the country. It came sixth in terms of the total score obtained. It got 87.15 points under three heads — user services, highway efficiency and highway safety. The 142.87-km stretch — running through four districts Krishnagiri, Tirupattur, Vellore and Ranipet — witnesses around 37,000 vehicles daily. “We have divided the stretch into three portions and have individual accident response teams with ambulances and cranes. Apart from this we have emergency calling booths every two kilometres through which people can call our control room,” said a source in the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The toll road, which is maintained by L&T Infrastructure, has lighting facilities in all urban stretches, enough signages that tell you where ATMs and pharmacies are located, toilets and drinking water facilities at both toll plazas. “We still have to widen two stretches for a length of 5 km at Ambur and also one near Palar River. These would be taken up by May and work will be completed in a year’s time. Our attempt is to provide quality services to road users,” explained the official. In the heading highway efficiency, for which 45 marks were earmarked, this stretch was given 41.60 points.

17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vivekh critical, on ECMO support||Actor Vivekh, who suffered a heart attack on Friday, is in a critical condition and is on ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) support at SIMS Hospital in Chennai. Raju Sivasamy, vice-president, SIMS Hospital, told reporters that he was brought to the hospital in an unconscious state at 11 a.m. by his family members. An emergency team, along with cardiologists, resuscitated him. “He was shifted to the Cath lab, after an emergency coronary angiogram showed 100% blockage in his left anterior descending artery (LAD). He underwent angioplasty and is currently in the intensive care unit on ECMO support,” he said. He said Mr. Vivekh’s condition would be reviewed after 24-hour observation in the ICU. “This is an acute coronary syndrome with cardiogenic shock. This is a separate cardiac event, and is not related to the COVID-19 vaccine,” he said. The clarification on vaccination was issued as the actor had received Covaxin on Thursday. “This came as a shock for us,” said Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, who was present along with the actor during the vaccination on Thursday. He, along with the Directors of Medical Education and Medical and Rural Health Services, met the treating team of doctors at SIMS Hospital. He said the actor had tested negative for COVID-19. A test had been conducted using GeneXpert, while a CT scan, too, did not show any COVID-19 findings. “This is a temporal association. He had a 100% block in the LAD and has now been treated for it. A 100% block does not happen in a day. A total of 860 persons received Covaxin jabs at the hospital on the same day. Anaphylactic reaction following the vaccine occurs in 15-30 minutes, for which we always keep a crash cart ready,” he said. He added that so far, Covaxin had been administered to 5.68 lakh people in the State. Vivekh, a Padma Shri recipient, has acted in over 200 feature films after being introduced by K. Balachander, whom he credits as his mentor. The comedian gained fame over the years by playing important roles in blockbusters like Run , Saamy , Minnale , Dhool , Kushi and Sivaji . The actor has also appeared as the lead in films, such as the recent Vellai Pookal , and was known for his close association with former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vivekh-critical-on-ecmo-support/article34340548.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Affiliated colleges worried by ‘withheld’ results||Many engineering colleges affiliated to Anna University have said the results of the November-December semester examinations have been withheld for a large number of students. The results were declared on April 11. “At each institution, a minimum of 40% students are facing such issues [of the results being withheld],” a faculty member of a private engineering college said. Anna University has mentioned either “withheld” or “withheld for clarification” or “results under process” as the reason for not declaring the marks. When colleges do not pay up the examination fee, the university withholds results; sometimes the university seeks clarifications about the candidates. The results of some students are withheld if malpractice is suspected. Owing to COVID-19, the university had conducted online proctored examinations using Artificial Intelligence. For the students, it was a new experience, teachers say. During the first wave of the pandemic, students took the examinations online in September. Though the university had held several training sessions, some students complained of delay in logging in for as much as 30 minutes. Some had trouble maintaining continuous Internet connectivity. A section of the students feels that the marks awarded to them should have been higher. A professor of a college in Kancheepuram district said students who had no history of arrears until the sixth semester had failed in the just-concluded seventh semester. “The published results have put the future of many final-year students in jeopardy. It is blocking the placement opportunity for the final-year students in companies that demand “no history of arrears,” he said. Even students who were placed are worried about the impact of the results on their placement and the lack of opportunity for revaluation, the professor said. The colleges fear that the poor results would affect admission in the coming academic year. When contacted, a university official said it would be incorrect to comment on the issue as the results were not published in full. “Many colleges have not paid the fees and some [of the results] have been withheld for suspected malpractice,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/affiliated-colleges-worried-by-withheld-results/article34340561.ece

Stalin for his appearance before it on May 6 in connection with two defamation complaints filed on behalf of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar. The State government has filed these defamation complaints in Principal Sessions Court against Mr. Stalin for his comments which were allegedly defamatory against Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Jayakumar in connection with the procurement of walkie-talkies. According to a government order dated February 10, Mr. Stalin has made a speech accusing Mr. Jayakumar of corruption on January 10, in Royapuram. Pointing out that the said portion of the speech was defamatory and was devoid of truth and good faith, the order further said that Mr. Stalin made the speech intentionally against the interest of public good. The order said that the speech constitutes an offence under Section 499 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code and added that Mr. Stalin must be prosecuted for this. These two cases were transferred to the special court for exclusive trial of cases against MPs and MLAs recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/summons-to-stalin-in-defamation-cases/article34340565.ece

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), they would start the process by next month. Since each train would require a month for the overhaul work, the officials plan to cover seven trains by the end of this year. From changing the bearings of motors to intensive cleaning of various parts, all aspects of a train would go through an overhaul, the officials said. Complete inspection “The coaches will be removed from the main body of the train. We will first check for cracks and if found, we will weld and repaint the coaches. Inside, the hand grabs, seats and maps will be checked to assess their condition and intensive cleaning of interiors, exteriors and ceiling panels will be done, along with repairs, if needed,” an official said. Then, the wheels of the train would be checked for their variations in height, width and diameter. “Owing to wear and tear, there will be variations and we have to take up re-profiling of the wheels to bring them back to their standard size. If left undone, then in future, it would cause problems and could also lead to derailing,” he said. Another important aspect is the deep cleaning of the ventilation and air-conditioning units wherein coils, condensers and their filters would be cleaned. “Over time, the ducts will develop fungus and the trains will begin to smell. To avoid such issues, this process will be helpful. The filters in this unit only help to provide fresh air in the coaches. So, when we do intensive cleaning, it will aid in keeping them in good condition for years,” another official said. Apart from all this, a few functional tests would also be done. After the first set of seven trains, the next set of trains will get ready for maintenance next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-metro-trains-to-go-through-first-overhaul-after-6-years-of-operations/article34341026.ece

Ramadoss on Friday said that the murder of a young woman belonging to the Vanniyar community in Deviyanthal village in Kallakurichi district was committed by a gang that, he claimed, is involved in “staged romantic relationships”. In a statement, he alleged that the woman was harassed by Rangasamy, who insisted that she marry him. “The harassment continued even after she got engaged. On April 2, Rangasamy waylaid her near her house and forced her to marry him. After she refused, Rangasamy, his brother Krishnasamy and his friend Ravindran slit her throat and threw the body in front of her house,” he alleged. The PMK leader claimed that certain Scheduled Caste leaders were encouraging youngsters to get involved in “staged romantic relationships”, which were resulting in social breakdown and the murders of innocent young women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gang-involved-in-murder-of-woman/article34341036.ece
17 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||FOGDA suggests 14-day intense lockdown||Noting that the rapid surge in COVID-19 cases could cause a huge burden on the healthcare workers, the Federation of Government Doctors Association (FOGDA) has suggested an intense lockdown for 14 days starting from April 18 to slow down transmission and give a breathing space for preparedness. In a representation to the Health Secretary, FOGDA put forward suggestions to tackle the present crisis as the daily COVID-19 cases were steeply increasing in the State. Such a sudden surge could make it difficult for the health infrastructure, and causes a huge burden on healthcare workers who are required to be deployed to treat patients with COVID-19 as well as take effective preventive measures. Workforce has to be deployed for the vaccination drive too, it noted. FOGDA suggested an intense lockdown for 14 days from April 18, giving a short leeway of three to four days for the public to make appropriate arrangements to cope during this lockdown period. This would help in overcoming the present crisis. The lockdown, as already experienced, would help in slowing down new cases of COVID-19 as well as provide a breathing space for the logistics preparedness, the association said. The association has requested the government to consider lowering the age restrictions for COVID-19 vaccinations from 45 years to 18 years so that there could be larger coverage, and also because more younger patients were suffering from severe COVID-19 now compared to last year. It demanded the government recruit 2,000 new doctors and nurses to manage both COVID-19 and non COVID-19 diseases. To encourage the healthcare workers, who were already fatigued, the government could release the promised COVID-19 related benefits such as one month special pay, Rs. two lakh ex-gratia for those who tested positive for COVID-19 and Rs. 50 lakh solatium for the families of the deceased healthcare workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fogda-suggests-14-day-intense-lockdown/article34340608.ece

Preliminary investigation had revealed that the idols went missing more than 50 years ago.

Referring to the advisory issued by the Department of Personnel & Training, AIRF president N. Kanniah said vaccination should be encouraged and not mandated. “While we appreciate the vaccination drive the same cannot be compelled or ordered as individuals have their own medical complications and apprehensions,” he said. The ICF and Southern Railway’s Thiruvananthapuram Division had issued circulars to staff asking them to get vaccinated before reporting to work or proceed on leave, which had caused “displeasure” among the employees. Mr. Kanniah said the Central Government chose persons aged 45 years and above for vaccination as part of a strategy adopted after assessing the COVID-19 situation at the national level. “Nowhere in the DoPT order was it mentioned that vaccination was mandatory to attend office and those who do not get vaccinated should avail their own leave…we have written to the General Manager requesting him to withdraw both the circulars in the larger interest of the employees,” he said. Meanwhile Southern Railway’s healthcare infrastructure has been widened with the increase in the number of cases. According to railway sources, additional beds and isolation facilities were created to accommodate positive cases and asymptomatic persons suspected to have been infected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/airf-demands-withdrawal-of-vaccination-circulars/article34340589.ece

Stalin on Friday wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner and Tamil Nadu’s Chief Electoral Officer, alleging a breach of protocol in several strong rooms in the State where polled EVMs are stored despite instructions from the Election Commission of India. In his letter, he listed the various incidents of alleged lapses across Tamil Nadu. On April 14, at the Sri Ram Engineering College in Perumalpattu, Tiruvallur, where polled EVMs of 10 Assembly constituencies are kept, covered vehicles were brought on campus during midnight in a suspicious manner, according to the letter. “Our party candidate objected to this, but the officials said the vehicles were mobile toilets for women police officers,” Mr. Stalin said. Similarly on April 15, similar covered vehicle were found stationed within 100 m from the strong room, on the premises of the Loyola College in Chennai, where polled EVMs from many Assembly constituencies, including Kolathur, have been stored. These incidents have created high suspicion over the security/protocol on strong room premises, and thereby, safety of the polled EVMs was in question, he said. He urged the Election Commission of India to ensure complete safety and security of all EVMs. He also called for the initiation of action against police officers incharge of the strong rooms in which the alleged incidents took place and the district election officers concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-alleges-breach-of-protocol-in-strong-rooms/article34340535.ece

Environmentalist R. Mohammed Saleem, who started the petition, alleged that over 70 trees were felled in the area to carry out the model road works under the Smart Cities Mission. He urged that the works must be stopped immediately and the Corporation must form a committee comprising residents, and environmentalists as stakeholders. “We are concerned about Coimbatore’s prioritisation with rapid development at the cost of the city’s public green spaces,” Mr. Saleem said in a statement. Lack of transparency In its present form, the model road project had a lack of transparency as the plan had not been made public and did not include residents and environmentalists as stakeholders, he claimed.

Velusamy, one of the farmers in the group, said only six of the 20 panchayats in Palladam got water under the PAP scheme. In the remaining areas, there were several farmers who were into cultivation of vegetables and greens or had coconut trees. A few years ago, the Public Works Department had recommended stopping water supply under the scheme to 9,000 acre that had been converted from agriculture lands to developed areas. Most of these were close to Tiruppur town. The water meant for these 9,000 acre should be diverted to 18 panchayats in Sulur and Palladam, he said. Further, just half a tmc of water was enough to fill the water bodies in these panchayats. The group of farmers recently held meetings in all the 18 panchayats to seek support from other farmers. “Groundwater is available at 1,300 feet or below in many of these areas. Diversion of the PAP scheme will benefit the farmers here,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-seek-extension-of-pap-scheme/article34341041.ece

17 April 2021||Kodaikanal,TAMIL NADU||No home isolation in Dindigul, COVID-19 patients have tough time||The recent case of three members of a family from Kodaikanal having tested positive for COVID-19 has put the spotlight on difficulties that patients face in the absence of the option of home isolation in Dindigul district. Smriti Lamech, her husband and 15-year-old son tested positive on Tuesday. All of them had mild symptoms. However, her 14-year-old daughter tested negative. Health Department officials told the patients that it was mandatory that they get themselves admitted to either the government hospital or a private hospital. Accordingly, they got themselves admitted to a private hospital on Wednesday morning. They took Ms. Lamech’s daughter along, as there was no one to take care of her. But the hospital lacked facilities, Ms. Lamech alleged, speaking to The Hindu.  “The hospital authorities asked us to arrange our own food. Despite it being a COVID-19 ward, there was no electric kettle or steamer for the patients. The roof started leaking in heavy rain,” she said. Most importantly, the doctor visited the patients only around 10 p.m. “After informing the doctor of the situation, we left to be in home isolation,” Ms. Lamech said. But the next day, the police and officials of the Departments of Revenue and Health insisted that they get themselves admitted to a hospital as the option of home isolation was not available in the district. ‘Severe inconvenience’ “So we made several calls to private hospitals and managed to get ourselves admitted to a private hospital in Coimbatore. Through the whole process, we have fulfilled our duties as honest and responsible citizens. But the district administration’s lack of planning for treatment and the absence of the option of home isolation has caused us severe inconvenience,” she said. When contacted, Block Medical Officer M. Aravind Krishnan said the Collector had ordered that the option of home isolation not be given to patients. According to the rules laid down by the district administration, all patients, irrespective of the severity of the infection, must be treated at hospital for seven days, he said.

Smriti Lamech, a resident of Kodaikanal, her husband and her 15-year-old son had tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday. The family members all had mild symptoms. However, Ms. Lamech’s 14-year-old daughter had tested negative for COVID-19. The health department officials had instructed the family members that it was mandatory for them to opt for hospital admission in either a government hospital or a private hospital. So, the family members got admitted to a private hospital in Kodaikanal on Wednesday morning. They took Ms. Lamech’s daughter along with them to the hospital as they had no one else to take care of the child. However, there were no proper facilities available at the private hospital, alleged Ms. Lamech, speaking to The Hindu.  “The hospital authorities asked us to arrange our own food. Despite it being a COVID-19 ward, there was no electric kettle or steamer available for patients. Following heavy rains, the hospital roof was leaking ," she said. Most importantly, the doctor at the hospital visited the patients only at around 10 p.m. “After informing the doctor about the situation in the hospital, we left for our residence to be under home quarantine," said Ms. Lamech. But, the next day the police, revenue and health department officials insisted that they get themselves admitted in a hospital as there was no home isolation option available in Dindigul district. “So, we made several calls to private hospitals and finally managed to get admitted to a private hospital in Coimbatore.

17 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Southern Railway comes down on officials for poor planning||Southern Railway headquarters has come down heavily on the officials for poor planning and deployment of inadequate and inexperienced workers for taking up doubling work between Tirumangalam and Thulukkapatti railway stations that led to massive disruption of train services on March 30 and 31. This is in contrary to the earlier claim by railway officials that technical glitch had caused detention of nearly 10 express and superfast trains for up to 10 hours on Chennai Egmore-Tirunelveli section March 30. Besides, several trains had to be short-terminated, diverted or cancelled on subsequent days too. The massive disruption of train services in the major route drew the attention of Railway Board following which Southern Railway launched an investigation into the bungling. After Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) completed the doubling work between Tirumangalam (Madurai district) and Thulakkapatti (Virudhunagar district) railway stations and Commissioner of Railway Safety clearing the section, the railway officials took up the work of integrating the new line with the existing broad-gauge line. The work involved points and crossings integration in four yards in Tirumangalam, Kalligudi, Virudhunagar and Thulukkapatti railway stations and 10 level crossing gates. After completing the preliminary non-interlocking (NI) work for nine days from March 22, the railway authorities had granted a line block on the section between 9.45 a.m. and 6 p.m. of March 30. The huge volume of work to be simultaneously taken up in four yards, including a major yard, and 10 LC gates with a traffic block of eight hours required meticulous planning and availability of experienced and adequate technical staff, an official circular from Southern Railway noted. However, the probe found that lack of proper planning and non-availability of adequate technical staff with experience led to bursting of block “abnormally” that got extended by almost 24 hours and disrupted train services. “The continuity of work as well as mismatch of cable wiring by unskilled wiremen created more work during the traffic block period,” the circular said. Besides, the delay in timely completion of engineering and traction distribution works led to further delay of signal and telecommunication works. “Commissioning of block proving axle counter (BPAC) on Tirumangalam-Tirupparankundram section took more than 24 hours as RVNL did not wire a new system, but instead depended on the old system,” the circular said. “All this point out lack of adequate preparation, taking up pre-NI and NI works without being ready for the same, lack of planning, foresight, inability to muster adequate resources resulted in bursting of traffic block on March 30,” it added. Consequently, Railway Board has directed the zonal railways to allow traffic blocks for taking up works only after senior most officer responsible for the work gave a certificate that all precautions were put in place. The circular said that hereafter only zonal headquarters would grant permission for blocks for pre-NI/NI works after receipt of a certificate, one week before the schedule of work, from the Divisional Railway Manager concerned that the executing organisation was ready in all respects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/southern-railway-comes-down-on-officials-for-poor-planning/article34340576.ece
17 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court Bench seeks Centre’s response to plea on new pension scheme||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday ordered notice to the Centre on a public interest litigation petition that sought direction to the government to ensure an assured monthly pension under the New Pension Scheme to retired Central government employees, which was not less than 50% of the last drawn pay on retirement. The petitioner, a retired government employee, G. Chinnadurai of Tirunelveli district, said that under the new pension scheme, there was no minimum assured pension for the pensioners. As per the scheme, 10 % of the pay and dearness allowance was recovered from employees and an equal amount of contribution was made by the government. In 2019, the government’s contribution was increased to 14 % of the pay and dearness allowance. After superannuation, 60% of the accumulations will be paid to the employee and the balance 40 % will be utilised for the purchase of annuities and amount that accrues out of the annuities would be paid to the applicant as monthly pension, he said. He said that the contributions are invested in markets through fund managers and the fund is managed by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority. It was mandatory for the employees. It was left to the market to decide the monthly pension that will accrue to the employee. This was affecting the retired life of the employees, the petitioner said. The petitioner said that he filed the petition as he was suffering financially due to the adverse implications of the scheme. Steps must be taken to ensure minimum financial security for the retired government employees, he said. A Division Bench of Justices T. S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi ordered notice to the Centre and sought response. The court granted time to the Centre to file the counter affidavit and adjourned the case till April 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-bench-seeks-centres-response-to-plea-on-new-pension-scheme/article34341139.ece

17 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||VCK has gone back to caste politics: BJP State president||Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi that has started to lose its political base in northern districts has chosen to take “caste politics” back, charged Bharatiya Janata Party State president L. Murugan. Addressing the media here on Friday after garlanding the statue of B.R. Ambedkar in the city, he said that VCK men were after the BJP cadres for sometime in Madurai. They caused hindrance to our candidate while campaigning. Earlier, they created a clash during the Pongal celebrations organised by the party. “Madurai police should arrest the accused and take appropriate action. Or else, we will stage protests across the State,” he told while addressing his party men. Stating that several VCK cadres in northern districts were joining the BJP, Mr. Murugan said that since the party’s base was shrinking, the VCK had gone back to caste politics. Listing out several measures the BJP-led Centre had taken in honour of Dr. Ambedkar, Mr. Murugan said that the party had every right to garland the statue. He was responding to the VCK cadres chasing away the BJP men who had gathered to garland the statue of Dr. Ambedkar here on Wednesday. He said it was Narendra Modi Government that had awarded Bharat Ratna to the leader and made his birth anniversary a public holiday. Five memorials had been constructed by the BJP Government for the leader. Besides, the digital payment app of the Centre was named after the leader as Bhim and a university in Madhya Pradesh was named after him. Party state secretary, R.

Mr. Pandian said that on April 7, a clash had broken between the youth of Dalit and Vanniyar communities. “The Dalit youths were rounded up and attacked with sharp weapons. Two Dalits Arjunan and Suriya were killed and three of their friends grievously injured,” he said. Mr. Pandian said that two major attackers from the Vanniyar community were sons of leaders from Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). "The Vanniyar community youth have remarked that the Dalit youth must have voted for 'pot' symbol during the clash," he said. The PMK was instigating hatred against people from Dalit community, alleged Mr. Pandian. As a result, the attacks on Dalits were prominent in many parts of the State. He said that the full statement given by Soundararajan, one of the Dalit youth who was injured, to the policemen had not been recorded in the FIR. "Especially, the conversation about the 'pot' symbol has not been mentioned in the FIR," said Mr. Pandian.

17 April 2021||Nagercoil,TAMIL NADU||Dream fulfilled: Marthandam girl visits ISRO facility||When sprinter Antony Felix, 12, of Paraicode near here received a pair of sports shoes from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as he had promised the boy a sports kit during his recent electioneering in Kanniyakumari district, it received a lot of media attention. Now, without much media glare, Mr. Rahul has fulfilled another promise he had made to a class 5 girl student from Marthandam. When, Mr. Rahul had addressed the students of St. Joseph’s Matriculation Higher Secondary School at Mulagumoodu near Nagercoil during his visit on March 1, he had told the students that a boy who he had met at Paraicode had sought his help for visiting a facility of Indian Space Research Organisation. “I’ve promised him,” Mr. Rahul said amidst cheers from the students. Teacher Beulet Jeril Subha of a nearby school, who was there along with her students, hesitantly approached Mr. Rahul with a request. “My daughter Jifa J. Bridly, a class 5 student, is now watching you live on television from our home at Marthandam. She wants to become an astronaut, and her dream is to visit a facility of Indian Space Research Organisation. Could you please help her?,” Ms. Beulet asked. Much to her surprise, the young leader asked his Personal Assistant to collect all information about the girl. The girl received a call from the Personal Assistant within a few days with an assurance that she would soon visit the ISRO’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram. “Meanwhile, Mr. Rahul had written a letter to ISRO Chairman K. Sivan seeking permission for Jifa’s visit to Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre and the permission was granted. We subsequently received a call from Vikram Sarabhai Space Research Centre asking us to tell them about our convenient date of visit after clearing COVID-19 tests. Once we got the COVID-19 test certificate, we were invited to visit the facility on March 22, an unforgettable event that further strengthened my daughter’s dream of becoming a space scientist,” Jayachandran, father of Jifa, who runs an electrical shop at Kalingarajapuram near Marthandam told The Hindu . The parents along with Jify were taken around the centre, with the only condition that they should not take any photographs as photography is strictly prohibited in the high security complex. “I saw the PSLV and GSLV there … As I entered the room where late President and ‘Missile Man’ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam used to work, I felt blessed. After this visit, I’ve decided that my ultimate destination is space for which I should qualify myself through sheer hard work,” says Ms. Jifa, who thanked her science teacher Gracelin for inculcating the interest in her. Role model Jify has told her father that like Kalpana Chawla, she would join the Aeronautical Engineering programme of Punjab Engineering College before moving to the United States for higher studies and to serve ISRO ultimately. “Kalpana Chawla is my role model. It was Ms. Gracelin who introduced Kalpana Chawla to me,” says Ms. Jifa. Asked about Mr. Rahul Gandhi, she said: “He is so simple… Though I did not get an opportunity to speak to him, he was kind enough to get me permission to visit an ISRO facility. Only because of him, I have realized my dream and this is my first step towards my destination.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dream-fulfilled-marthandam-girl-visits-isro-facility/article34340573.ece

17 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Map emerging virus data with micro-containment measures: L-G||Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Friday called for greater coordination in mapping of emerging coronavirus data with the activation of micro-containment measures on the ground. After inspecting the COVID war room at the Emergency Operation Centre of the Disaster Management Authority, Ms. Soundarajan said war room data needed to be translated into graded and effective risk reduction measures in places where incidence of infection was high. In addition to ramping up timely availability of medical facilities to home isolation patients who required it, micro-containment zones needed to be carved out to cut the transmission of COVID-19, she said. She also advised personnel manning the 104 COVID helpline to constantly liaison between patients calling in and hospitals and medical staff. The Lt. Governor, who earlier flagged off two fully-equipped mobile vaccination units, said the vehicles would be sent to factories that employ 100 workers or more, on a need to basis. She said that all necessary measures were being undertaken on a war-footing to keep the pandemic under control. The administration is in constant touch with officials in the regions of Karaikal, Yanam and Mahe to ascertain the status of COVID-19 control and to address specific requirements, Ms. Soundararajan said. According to the Lt. Governor, it was a creditable achievement that during the Tika Utsav campaign alone, about 53,000 people had been vaccinated in the Union Territory. There was no shortage of vaccines in the Union Territory after the Centre released a consignment of 1.1 lakh vials recently, she said. Preventing transmission Calling for continued public participation in the vaccination drive, Ms. Soundararajan said as more and more people became immunised, the lower the risks of transmission of the infection. Inaugurating a COVID-19 vaccination camp for farmers at Thattanchavady Mandi, the Lt. Governor, while urging the beneficiaries to not ignore safety norms post-vaccination, pointed out that the benefit of immunisation was that even the effects would be subdued in the eventuality of getting an infection. She appealed to those who took the first shot to ensure that they got the second one too to attain immunity. Alongside volunteering for vaccination, people also needed to adhere to safety protocols for some more time. “In spite of all the efforts of the administration, averting graded lockdown measures that could impact the local economy is in the hands of the people,” she said. Advisers to the Lt. Governor C. Chandramouli and A.P. Maheshwari, T. Arun, Health Secretary, and S. Mohan Kumar, Director of Health, accompanied the Lt. Governor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/map-emerging-virus-data-with-micro-containment-measures-l-g/article34341236.ece
17 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||It’s curtains for century-old textile mills||The curtains have virtually come down for the century-old Swadheshi-Bharathi and Anglo French Textile Mills with the Centre allocating around Rs. 40 crore as additional expenditure under the head of Industries Department for providing compensation to the mill employees in the Vote-on-Account passed by Parliament for the Union Territory. A Vote-on-Account for Rs. 3,934 crore was passed by Parliament in March to meet the Union Territory’s expenditure demands for five months after the Congress government lost its majority in the Assembly following defections from its legislature wing. No ambiguity According to an official source, in the Vote-on-Account, a sum of Rs. 40 crore has been set aside to provide closure compensation, gratuity and Provident Fund arrears to around 170 employees of Swadheshi-Bharathi and 700 of the AFT. “Now, there is no ambiguity on the closure issue. The managements had submitted a proposal for providing compensation to the employees. The attempt will be first to provide closure compensation, gratuity and PF. The budgeted amount will not be enough to provide compensation. We will also have to find resources to clear the liabilities and loans taken by the mills from banks and PIPDIC,” a senior official told The Hindu . Once all liabilities are cleared, the government will be left with several options: either revive the mills after modernisation or utilise the vast land parcels available with the mills for viable projects. In the New Bus Stand area itself, the mills own around 60 to 70 acres of land, the official said, adding that the onus would be on the next government to take a responsible decision. Contentious issue The closure of the mills remained a very contentious issue between the former Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi and the previous Congress regime, with the elected government taking strong objection to the closure decision mooted by Ms. Bedi based on the Vijayan Committee report. The government and mainstream political parties were in favour of providing a voluntary retirement scheme and then reviving the mills as their functioning is a sentimental issue for a large number of people in the Union Territory. Hundreds of families in the Union Territory were dependent on the mills for their earnings till a few years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/its-curtains-for-century-old-textile-mills/article34341240.ece

17 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Late diagnosis, delay in going to hospitals caused 75% fatalities’||Late diagnosis and delay in reporting to hospital is contributing to 75% of recent COVID-19 fatalities, Health Secretary T. Arun said on Friday. Addressing the media, Mr. Arun said in most instances seen recently among patients who died with 24 hours to 48 hours of hospitalisation, they waited for five or six days without diagnosing symptoms and reached a healthcare facility only after severe breathing difficulty. He appealed to everyone to visit a PHC and get themselves tested for coronavirus symptoms, such as a persistent cough, running nose, or fever. Noting that there had been a near 20-fold increase in COVID-19 cases compared to figures in early March, Mr. Arun said the situation warranted strict compliance with safety protocols, such as masking, hand sanitising and social distancing. He also urged everyone above 45 years to get vaccinated at ongoing camps at 100 sites. While in the five days of the Tika Utsav alone, about 52,000 people had been vaccinated, the total number of those immunised aggregated to 1.3 lakh in the Union Territory and an estimated 11 crore in the country to date. No need for fear Therefore, there is no basis for any fear over getting vaccinated as no adverse event had been reported at these camps, he said. Visitors could approach these vans with any of the designated photo identity documents between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.  The situation warrants strict compliance with safety protocols such as masking, hand sanitising and social distancing T.

17 April 2021||R. KrishnamoorthyTIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Teachers in a fix as State yet to act on UGC’s FIP guidelines||A year after University Grants Commission (UGC) renamed its ‘orientation programme’ conducted for newly-recruited faculty in colleges and other institutions of higher learning through its Human Resource Development Centres as ‘Faculty Induction Programme (FIP),’ the Department of Higher Education in Tamil Nadu has not yet issued an order to that effect, much to the chagrin of a section of young teachers for whom career progression hinges on their participation in the month-long programme. Unlike in the case of ‘orientation programmes’ that used to last for three weeks, the FIPs being of lengthier duration requires teachers to obtain the official sanction of month-long leave from the heads of their respective institutions. But the Regional Joint Directorates of Collegiate Education whom the colleges approach for sanction of leave for the month-long duration have not been able to act on the requests in the absence of an official order from the government. The higher education department still follows the pattern of granting leave for three weeks, causing anxiety to teachers, according to representatives of teacher welfare organisations. Last year, the teachers attending FIPs had to give an undertaking to the colleges that they would forego their leave from the ‘Earned Leave/ Privilege Leave’ provision for the additional week. This time around, the associations have approached the government for a decisive order, but are uncertain if there will be any outcome before the next government assumes charge. The associations, sources in the Higher Education Department said, have also urged the government to take cognisance of the UGC’s communication on reducing the duration of refresher courses from three weeks to two weeks, and for conducting these programmes on online platform, through official orders, as in other States. “These programmes devised for professional enrichment of teachers envisage their participation in a positive frame of mind and a sense of confidence. The uncertainty that prevails among the faculty over taking part in the programmes must be removed,” S. Senthilnathan, Director, UGC-HRDC, Bharathidasan University, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-in-a-fix-as-state-yet-to-act-on-ugcs-fip-guidelines/article34340552.ece

Velmurugan, 28, who was one among the 14 fishermen on board a mechanised boat which collided head on with a cargo ship from Singapore off Mangalore coast three days ago, returned home here on Thursday night. “I struggled in mid-sea for almost two hours,” he said. On April 11, 14 fishermen including seven from Tamil Nadu and another seven from West Bengal and Assam ventured into the sea for deep sea fishing along the Mangalore coast on a mechanised boat owned by Jaffar of Kozhikode, Kerala. On April 13, at around 11.30 a.m., when the sea was rough and visibility was poor, the boat collided with the cargo ship off 60 nautical miles from Mangalore coast. The boat capsized and all the fishermen aboard went missing. The Indian Coast Guard deployed helicopter and surveillance teams on a rescue operation. While the ICG retrieved three bodies, which were identified as Alexander (38), his father-in-law Manikdasan (60) from Kanniyakumari district and another fisherman from West Bengal (name unknown). The operation continued in the region in search of other missing fishermen. Meanwhile, two fishermen including Velmurugan and Sunil Das from West Bengal, who were struggling in mid-sea for over two hours, were spotted by some staff on board the Singapore cargo ship. Immediately, they rescued the duo safely. Fisherman Velmurugan reached home with the help of officials from the Tamil Nadu government. According to him, the whereabouts of three others, whose names were given as Palanivel, Vedamanikam and Balamurugan from Kannirajapuram, who were also on the same boat, were unknown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fisherman-who-went-missing-off-mangalore-coast-returns/article34340571.ece

17 April 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||‘Step up security at counting centre’||The DMK candidate Thanga Tamilselvan for Bodinayakkanur Assembly constituency here has lodged a complaint with the District Election Officer that there were power interruptions at the counting centre. In a press release issued on Thursday, he said that there was no power supply for 13 minutes at the campus on the night of April 14. The power generator did not function. Counting agents were in the dark. The counting centre, a college, does not have a compound wall. Fencing arrangement was not sufficient. So, he urged the District Election Officer to step up the police strength. An official said power supply was cut in the area following rain. There was some delay to switch on the generator. The back up service is working properly. The three-tier police security was being monitored by different teams of officers, including the SP and the Collector. The Deputy Chief Minister and AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam is contesting from the Bodinayakkanur constituency. Tension at Ramnad The entry of 31 staff inside the high-security counting centre here resulted in some uneasy moments after the DMK objected and attempted to resort to a stir on Thursday. The counting centre on Devipattinam Road has EVMs for the four Assembly constituencies in the district. Three-tier security with hundreds of police personnel had been set up. The Anna University campus had 31 staff stepping into the building. Though they explained that they were in the campus to conduct the online classes for their students, the DMK counting agent raised objections. So, District Election Officer and Collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver and Superintendent of Police E Karthik rushed to the spot. They pacified the counting agents but they were firm on their stand. Finally, the university staff had to withdraw. The agents said that the officials should have made alternative arrangements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/step-up-security-at-counting-centre/article34340580.ece

17 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Online classes not an easy option||Portions for even semester has been completed in most of the arts and science colleges in the offline mode, much to the relief of teachers who had to put up with health complications triggered by the online classes during the odd semester. The strain caused to the eyes due to the compulsion to sit before computers, laptops or smart phones for many hours at a stretch and back ache due to the seating position were mitigated to a large extent during the even semester for which the offline classes started during the first week of December 2020. “Most of the colleges have completed the theory classes and the mandatory 90 days of teaching-learning and have now set their attention on conduct of examinations and practicals. But for a handful of colleges that had started the offline classes a little late, all other colleges have fulfilled the teaching-learning requirement for the semester. The need for them to resume online classes for students from the start of April for the purpose of completing portions has, by and large, been obviated,” Regional Joint Director of Collegiate Education, Tiruchi, A. Megala, said. While the government had issued instruction for conduct of online classes for students from the start of this month, there was no specific mention of work from home option for teachers. The teachers keep going to colleges as usual, Prof. Megala said. Not all teachers are comfortable with the idea of conducting online classes for students sitting in empty classrooms. Teachers of colleges located in rural parts say the digital connectivity was far better at their homes. Now, there is apparently a sense of unease among teachers over the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 spread, and many apprehend that the teaching-learning during the odd semester of 2021-22 will be in the online mode. “The idea of handling online sessions from classrooms does not seem ideal for a number of teachers. In fact, both teachers and students are not comfortable with online classes and it is an open secret that students just register their presence online and spend their time on other purposes,” a senior professor of a government college said. “Considering the well-being of teachers and students in the long run, the higher education department could rather think on lines of supplying students with video content of recorded lectures, and putting in place a system wherein students could get their doubts clarified from the teachers at specific timings on a daily basis on working days,” he said.

17 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Last mile connectivity to Koraiyar Falls soon||The laying of a two-km-long road from Pudur to Koraiyar Falls in Pachamalai hills in Tiruchi district has gladdened the hearts of nature lovers and picnickers. The work, being executed at a cost of about Rs. 30 lakh, provides the vital last mile connectivity to the falls, a verdant spot. The road is being laid following persistent demands from activists who have been repeatedly petitioning the district administration and even the Chief Minister’s Special Cell. Those who visit this little-known place, on hearing about it through word of mouth, had to trek the stretch so far. “Many people who visit by cars and vans have to park their vehicles at Pudur and walk the two-km stretch as there was no proper road. Now they can drive right up to the falls,” said Saravanan Natesan, a regular visitor to the falls. Those travelling by the Thuraiyur-Palayam State Transport Corporation bus have to alight at Pudur and go by walk. The road stretch is expected to be completed within the next couple of months, official sources said. The Koraiyar falls is about 40 km away from Thuraiyur and can be reached via Adivaram, Keerambur, Sengattupatti, Moolakadu, Manalodai, Thonur, Chinna Iluppur, Periya Iluppur and Vanadu Pudur.  Steps needed “It will also be helpful if steps were built for about 600 metres of rugged terrain that leads to the falls,” Mr. Natesan said. Verdant places such as Mangalam Falls and Koraiyar Falls in Pachamalai hills remain largely unexplored due to poor accessibility, he said. “When in full flow, the falls are as good as Courtallam. A spell of good rain in the hill ranges can bring water to these falls for a few months,” Mr. Natesan said. Pachaimalai is situated on the Eastern Ghats with dry evergreen and dry deciduous forests located on the north-western border of Tiruchi district. The Forest Department has created an eco-tourism facility at Top Sengattupatti offering accommodation and guided trekking.

17 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Court orders attachment of train for not paying damages||The Third Additional Subordinate Court here passed an order on Thursday to attach the Vaigai Express rake following the failure of the Southern Railway to pay balance compensation amount to a labourer who had become immobile in a train accident reported in 2003, despite an order from the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court fixing the liability on the railways to pay the compensation. The Third Additional Subordinate Judge K. Vivekananthan passed the order to attach the rake from the locomotive to the brake van. The victim, Palanivel, was travelling from Chennai to Ariyalur in a general compartment of Vaigai Express when the train rammed a tractor at an unmanned level crossing near Vikravandi in February 2003 killing the tractor driver-cum-owner. Under the impact of the collision, the tractor was dragged for some distance causing a huge jerk in the general compartment that was attached close to the locomotive. Palanivel was thrown out of the compartment due to the excessive jerk leading to fractures on his two legs. He was taken to Villupuram Government Hospital from where he was shifted to JIPMER, Puducherry. Palanivel, who had become immobile, filed a claims petition in 2004 at the Third Additional Subordinate Court - also known as Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in Tiruchi, seeking compensation from the railways. The case kept dragging for several years and full-fledged commencement of the trial took place in 2015. The submission of Palanivel was that the railway authority should pay him the compensation. The court passed an order in January 2016 that the tractor owner was liable to pay compensation. Unsatisfied with the order, Palanivel preferred an appeal in the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in 2016. The High Court passed an order in November 2017 fixing the liability on the railways to pay the compensation, and issued a direction that it must be paid within six weeks from the date of receipt of the order. Palanivel, through his counsel R. Senthilkumar, filed an execution petition before the Third Additional Subordinate Court in 2018 seeking to enforce the High Court order. The issue kept dragging again with the railways making part payment of the compensation - totally amounting to about Rs. 4.8 lakh - along with interest and costs. The case came up before the same court on Thursday when the Judge passed an order to attach the Vaigai Express following failure of the railway administration to pay the balance money to Palanivel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-orders-attachment-of-train-for-not-paying-damages/article34340553.ece

17 April 2021||Tiruvannamalai,TAMIL NADU||NABARD supports digitisation of SHGs in Tiruvannamalai||With assistance from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the data of around 14,205 Self Help Groups in Tiruvannamalai district have been digitised under the E-Shakti Project, which aims at digitisation of all SHGs. There are over 20,000 SHGs in Tiruvannamalai district under the Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Mission (Magalir Thittam). “NABARD has taken up the initiative of digitising the database of SHGs through the E-Shakti portal. In the coming months, we will be enabling online loan applications and sanctions through E-Shakti,” said V. Sreeram, assistant general manager, NABARD, Tiruvannamalai. According to a press release, the Potential Linked Credit Plan (PLP) for the financial year 2021-22 prepared by NABARD has assessed the credit potential of Tiruvannamalai district at Rs. 6,108.24 crore. “The PLP for this financial year focuses on collectivisation of agricultural produce for enhancing the farmers’ income,” Mr. Sreeram said. During the previous financial year, 193 rural infrastructure projects at a cost of Rs. 42.66 crore were sanctioned under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF). Of this, funds to the tune of Rs. 8.7 crore have been released. Focus was given to the education sector, wherein RIDF sanction of Rs. 536.25 lakh was given towards construction of 167 schools. Under NABARD’s Farm Sector Promotion Fund, the focus will be more on the “honey bee-keeping value chain in Jawadhu Hills”, which is expected to transform the tribal community through additional livelihood prospects of collection of wild honey, bee wax and bee venom. Grant aid During the year 2020-2021, the project was sanctioned with a grant assistance of Rs. 17.12 lakh, of which Rs. 3.42 lakh was released to NGOs for implementation.

17 April 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Elephant released in MTR adjusting to new surroundings||An elephant that was captured from Dharmapuri and translocated to the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) is reported to be settling well to its new surroundings, and is believed to have been accepted into a herd of elephants inhabiting the region, forest officials said. Recent translocation efforts of elephants that have been released in the Sigur plateau have led to mixed results, with one elephant being recaptured in neighbouring Karnataka and made a captive animal, while another elephant died after its release in 2020. Another elephant, Vinayagan, from Coimbatore, is said to be doing well. Residents oppose move The most recent effort, to release the animal, said to be around 13-15 years of age in the MTR buffer zone was met with stiff resistance from local residents, who had opposed the move on grounds that the animal had been responsible for the deaths of two persons in Dharmapuri. However, forest officials said that the deaths were accidental and that the elephant was not known to be overly aggressive towards humans. Teams had been formed to monitor the elephant to ensure that it doesn’t enter human habitations. Forest officials said that the period of acclimatization seemed to be going well, with the elephant last seen in Kallampalayam, near Thengumarahada. L.C.S. Srikanth, Deputy Director (Buffer Zone) of MTR, said that forest staff had last seen the animal with a herd of other elephants. “This is a promising sign, and will hopefully ensure that it acclimatizes to its new surroundings, and also stays away from human habitations,” said Mr. Srikanth. S. Murali, Forest Range Officer, Segur Range, said that there were three nearby anti-poaching watcher camps in the region, and added that forest staff had last seen the herd move into neighbouring Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. “We have also directed the staff to keep a lookout for the elephant and see how it is coping with the new group,” he said. “If the herd accepts the elephant, it could also ensure that the herd keeps it in check, and modifies its behaviour, which we hope will ensure that it doesn’t have any more problematic interactions with humans,” said a forest official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elephant-released-in-mtr-adjusting-to-new-surroundings/article34340591.ece

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Districts face vaccine shortage||Shortage of COVID-19 vaccines were reported from a number of districts across Tamil Nadu. While a few districts have already run out of Covaxin, the available stocks of Covishield will last only for a few days in a number of districts. Many districts were looking for fresh supplies to continue vaccination. The surge in cases has led to an increase in demand for the vaccines, resulting in quick depletion of the stocks, a section of health officials said. Owing to the depleting stocks, persons who lined up to get the jab were turned away in a number of districts. The State’s daily vaccination coverage was more than two lakh on Thursday and Friday. Sources in the Health Department said as of April 15, the State had 7.41 lakh doses of Covishield and 1.75 lakh doses of Covaxin. Chennai had a major share, with about 4.3 lakh doses, and authorities of the four major government medical college hospitals said they had adequate stocks of the vaccines. However, several districts were hit hard. Health officials in Villupuram district said the existing stocks at government and taluk hospitals had depleted, and no vaccination session was held on Friday. “On average, the seven government hospitals in the district have been administering 400-600 doses a day. However, we were unable to continue the drive till Friday afternoon because most of the centres had depleted their stocks,” an official said. “We took down the phone numbers of senior citizens and those aged above 45, who had lined up for the shot and sent them back. We told them that we would call them up in two days after fresh stocks arrived,” he said. Officials in Cuddalore district said they were left with just enough stocks for a few days. Government hospitals in Virudhunagar district went without Covaxin for the last three days, while the Covishield stock would last only for the next three days. After being made to wait for a couple of hours, 100 people were asked to come back as and when the stocks were replenished at the government hospital at Rajapalayam. In Tiruchi, the last few vials of Covaxin flew off the shelves on Friday. While Deputy Director of Health Services S. Ram Ganesh said 1,000 doses were distributed to vaccination centres, including the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital and the Manapparai Government Hospital, on Thursday for use from Friday, government hospital sources said it was used up in half a day. Of the 1,000 doses, 750 were distributed to private hospitals, 200 to MGMGH and 50 to the Manapparai Government Hospital. “These vials were shipped from Cuddalore after we sent in a special request,” Dr. Ganesh said. “We have been instructed to utilise the Covaxin doses only for those taking the second shot. For people approaching us for the first shot, we are only administering Covishield,” a senior staff member at MGMGH said. At least 20 patients were turned away by the hospital on Friday after the Covaxin supply ran dry. Covishield, too, was in short supply in the district. Around 21,300 doses were available as on Friday morning, but at least 9,000 would be used up by Saturday, Dr. Ganesh said. The district would also run out of Covishield by Sunday if fresh supply was not provided. As many as 100 people aged above 45 who had registered for vaccination and arrived at the urban primary health centre in the Erode Corporation were sent back as vaccines were unavailable. They were given tokens and asked to come back on April 19. At the District Headquarters Hospital, only those who received their first shot were vaccinated. In the Nilgiris, many persons aged above 45 were turned away at the Government Headquarters Hospital. A 57-year-old woman from Adasolai, near Udhagamandalam, said she had hoped to be vaccinated on Friday, but doctors said they had run out of vaccines by 11 a.m. and she was asked to come back on Monday.  There has been a lack of supply to private hospitals too in the Nilgiris. In Tirupattur, officials said they had a day’s stock, while Tiruvannamalai had three days of supply. Sources in the Health Department said Coimbatore district received 10,000 Covishield doses on Friday, which were distributed to the major vaccination centres. Acknowledging a vaccine shortage at some centres, the sources said government-run centres were advised to share their doses among themselves. There was a huge crowd at the vaccination site at the Tirunelveli Collectorate. Valliammal from Sankarankovil was in tears after she was told to come on Saturday. Collector V. Vishnu said the spurt in demand over the past few days had led to this situation. Shortage was reported at several centres in Madurai district too. In Dharmapuri, the 2,800 doses available for the day were exhausted by the evening; most PHCs turned people away. At the Namakkal Government Hospital, the authorities said there was a shortage of vaccines on Friday. Vellore, Dindigul, Theni and Tenkasi had adequate stocks. Health Department officials said one lakh doses of Covaxin would arrive on Friday night and two lakh doses of Covishield on Saturday morning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/districts-face-vaccine-shortage/article34340540.ece

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Public trained to identify invasive flora||The public, trained in identifying invasive species of flora, may prove to be an extremely useful part of ascertaining the extent of invasive flora in the Nilgiris. Recently, the Ashoka Trust for Research on Ecology and Environment (ATREE), Bengaluru, along with Keystone Foundation in Kotagiri, organised a training programme for residents from local communities to identify around 27 species of invasive flora in different parts of the Nilgiris. Shiny Mariam Rehel, programme coordinator for the Biodiversity Restoration Programme at Keystone Foundation, said the residents would collect data on the type of invasive species present in a given location as well as the extent of the species in any given area and other parameters. “For instance, if we take the Sigur plateau, there are invasive species like parthenium, Lantana camara and Eupatorium species that have incredibly harmful effect on local biodiversity. Near water bodies, there are species of Eichhornia that are harmful. Through this training, we are trying to help people identify these plants, the locations, altitudes and extent of their spread in the Nilgiris,” said Ms. Rehel. The data from this exercise will be recorded through an open data kit - ‘Mapping of invasive alien species,’ that can be downloaded and used through mobile phones. It is hoped that the exercise could lead to a thematic map that can inform policy makers and help effectively remove invasive species from any particular landscape or environment. Continual data collection each year could also help track the spread or contraction of a particular species in different areas, researchers said. The Keystone Foundation said they hoped that they would also be able to include forest department staff, officials and policy makers in future training programmes. The initiative is being supported by funding from the National Geographic Society Grant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/public-trained-to-identify-invasive-flora/article34341050.ece

At Belagavi, the news of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa contracting COVID-19 dampened the spirits of the BJP camp. Most of the BJP leaders, including party candidate Mangala Angadi and her associates, did not venture out for door-to-door visits as most of them had taken part inprogrammes and meetingswith Mr. Yediyurappa. Ms. Mangala chose to remain at home for most of the day. Meanwhile, Congress candidate Satish Jarkiholi was busy visiting households, followers, temples, and mosques in the constituency, while his children Priyanka and Rahul also campaigned for him, covering nearly 70 villages in a single day. Basavakalyan saw hectic political activity, with Congress candidate Mala B. Narayana Rao, BJP rebel candidate Mallikarjun Khuba, and JD(S) candidate Syed Yasrub Ali Quadri visiting houses and shops. BJP candidate Sharanu Salgar canvassed in villages under Mantal Zilla Panchayat constituency in the morning and later in Basavakalyan. In Maski, too, local leaders and associates of the candidates were busy making appeals to voters.

17 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||EC flags 144 cases of COVID-19 norm violations||Even as Karnataka struggles to cope with the second wave of COVID-19, byelections have brought in anxiety over the spread of infection, especially with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa testing positive on Friday. It has emerged that five of his poll rallies during the past few days had attracted the ire of the Election Commission (EC) for violation of COVID-19 guidelines. The guidelines issued by the State were found to have been violated during three campaign rallies attended by Mr. Yediyurappa in Maski in Raichur, and two in Belagavi. Fines were levied on three campaign organisers in Maski, while advisory notices have been issued for the violations in Belagavi. In all, the EC has flagged 144 cases of violations of COVID-19 guidelines during the campaign by political parties for the byelections to Belagavi Lok Sabha, and Maski and Basavakalyan Assembly constituencies. While 17 FIRs were filed or are in the process of being filed, in about 75 instances fines were levied on the persons concerned. Incidentally, of the 17 FIRs, 15 were filed in Basavakalyan alone; the other two were in Maski. Violations of guideline were reported from the campaign of Home, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Basavaraj Bommai in Basavakalyan, with an FIR being filed. Another FIR has been filed for violation of guidelines during the campaign of Social Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu in Maski. Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar’s campaign also saw norm violations. Fines were collected from persons found violating the guidelines during the election campaigns of Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah in Raichur, former Ministers Krishna Byre Gowda, M.B. Patil, and H.K. Patil, BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel, and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar. Rallies in which BJP general secretary (in charge of Karnataka) Arun Singh and Congress general secretary (in charge of Karnataka) Randeep Surjewala took part were also found to have violated the norms. The campaigns of BJP candidate in Belagavi — Mangala A. Suresh Angadi, the wife of the late former Minister Suresh Angadi, whose death necessitated the bypoll — and her opponent Satish Jarkiholi also witnessed violations, resulting in fines being levied. Similarly, the campaign of the Congress candidate in Basavakalyan, Mala B. Narayana Rao, wife of the late legislator whose death resulted in the byelection, were also flagged for violations, with four FIRs being lodged. An FIR has also been lodged against JD(S) leaders in Basavakalayan. “Fines have been collected from those who organised the rallies where violations were reported,” an Election Commission source said. On the challenges in campaigning during the times of COVID-19, the BJP in-charge for Maski, N. Ravikumar, said that thousands always gather when leaders come for rallies. “In rural areas, masks are hardly used, so it becomes difficult for the organisers to enforce the rule.”  It was a challenge to hold bypolls now.

17 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Christian community flags issue of lack of burial space||With COVID-19 deaths on the rise, Christian community in Bengaluru has flagged the issue of shortage of burial places for those succumbing to the infection. The Archdiocese of Bangalore has appealed to the civic body to immediately allot five acres on the city’s outskirts. Bigger numbers In Kalpalli cemetery, one of the largest burial grounds for Catholics, 54 bodies were buried in March while 45 have been buried so far this month. In Mysuru Road cemetery, also for Catholics, two burials are taking place daily on an average since March. The Hosur Road cemetery that is open for all denominations is also reporting an average of three or four burials a day. These numbers since March exceed the normal monthly average of about 10 to 15 burials in the city while the community already faces a huge space constraint. “While last year average deaths reported was about 50 a month, this has increased to over 100 deaths since March this year,” a senior functionary in the Archdiocese said. In a letter to BBMP Commissioner Gaurav Gupta on Friday, Archbishop of Bangalore Peter Machado requested five acres to be allotted to Christians immediately. This is the second appeal for a burial ground in less than a year. The Archbishop had requested Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa for land earlier. The file had been moved to the Revenue Department and an announcement of the allotment was made in the BBMP Council. “Since the threat of pandemic had come down, the issue was also not pushed forward,” the Archbishop said in his letter. He, however, pointed out that with the second wave affecting thousands in Bengaluru, there is an urgent need for a cemetery for Christians. Some cremating Spokesperson for the Archdiocese J.A. Kanthraj said, “Families are requesting other families for space in the grave where already a body is buried. Where the burial has taken place more than six months before, such spaces are being dug up and the body is being buried.” He said that given the space crunch, some were even cremating.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/christian-community-flags-issue-of-lack-of-burial-space/article34340996.ece

17 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bus driver killed in stone-pelting incident||A driver working with the North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) succumbed to his injuries after stones were pelted at the bus he was driving. The deceased has been identified as Rabeed Rasul K. Avati. Mr. Avati, 56, was taking the bus on the Vijayapura-Jamkhandi route when unidentified persons pelted stones at the windshield. The broken pieces of glass caused agash on the driver’s neck. Mr. Avati, who was bleeding heavily, was immediately rushed to Jamkhandi Taluk Hospital, but could not be saved. Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi on Friday announced a compensation of Rs. 30 lakh and a job on compassionate grounds to a family member of the deceased. “Employees have been saying that they are conducting a peaceful strike, but they have now claimed the life of their own colleague. The incident is highly condemnable. The State government will never forgive the assaulters,” said the Minister in a press release. Soon after the announcement, NWKRTC managing director Krishna Bajpai visited the family of the deceased and handed over a cheque for Rs. 30 lakh. The KSRTC State Road Transport Corporation Employee League, the organisation observing the indefinite strike, also condemned the incident. “Our organisation is in no way linked to the incident. We have been asking employees not to resort to any kind of violence,” said R. Chandrashekar, president of the league. Buses operated   Though the office-bearers of the league have been reiterating that the indefinite strike will continue till the State government meets their demands, the number of employees reporting back to duty has also been gradually increasing by the day. On Friday, which was the tenth day of the strike, RTCs managed to run more than 5,500 buses, of which Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation operated more than 2,500. On Thursday, the corporations operated over 4,000 buses. On the other hand, the number of incidents of stone pelting on moving buses also increased. Till Friday, 80 buses had been damaged by miscreants. Officials claimed that because of the ongoing strike, RTCs had suffered a revenue loss of Rs. 187 crore so far. On RTCs operating more buses, Mr. Chandrashekar said, “The corporations are giving distorted figures. Officials are resorting to various tactics and pressuring the crew to report to work. No one is voluntarily reporting back to duty.” He also said that on Saturday, office-bears of the league would meet the Labour Commissioner and submit a requisition seeking the release of their salaries for the month of March. The RTCs have paid salary to only those employees who did not take part in the strike, he said. Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation dismissed 240 employees for taking part in the strike on Friday.  Employees have been saying that they are conducting a peaceful strike, but they have now claimed the life of their own colleague. The incident is condemnable.

17 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||GST: State issues notification related to five subsumed Acts||Nearly four years after Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into force in the country, the State government has notified that the authorities concerned will continue to exercise the powers and discharge functions as per the provisions of five Acts that were subsumed when the tax regime came into force on July 1, 2017. A notification from the Finance Department on March 15 stated that the “notification shall be deemed to have come into effect from July 1, 2017”. The notification has been issued under Section 174 of the Karnataka Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, and Section 24 of the Karnataka General Clauses Act, 1899. Specifying a list of authorities, the notification stated that they are deemed to have continued to exercise the same powers and discharge the functions authorised under the repealed Acts. “The notification became necessary since a member of the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal (KAT) pointed to the lacunae in a recent order. Without it, several appeals and reassessments done under the now-repealed Acts before GST was implemented would come under cloud. These have ramifications of several hundreds of crores to the State exchequer,” a source in the department said. The Acts that were subsumed when uniform GST was implemented on July 1, 2017, were the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003; the Karnataka Tax on Luxuries Act, 1979; the Karnataka Entertainment Tax Act, 1958; the Karnataka Tax on Entry of Goods Act, 1979; and the Karnataka Betting Tax Act, 1932 The issue came into focus in October 2020, in a case pertaining to DEN Network, a multi-system operator which had contested the tax slapped under the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act on the collection of activation charges for set-top boxes. In a split order at the KAT, one of the two members hearing the case had disagreed with the State representatives that it was automatic that these authorities would derive powers for assessments after GST came into force. The member pointed out that the government had not exercised powers under Section 174 of the KGST Act in the official gazette, specifying the competent authorities to exercise functions of reassessment and appeal. In the absence of such a notification, no authority or officer would be legally competent to carry out the functions in Section 174(1) of the SGST Act, 2017, read with the relevant provisions of the repealed KVAT Act, 2003, stated the order. Pointing to earlier Supreme Court orders on such a matters, and also on the Central General Clauses Act, 1897, the order stated that there was nothing in Karnataka comparable to the Maharashtra GST (Amendment, Validation and Savings) Act, 2016, to “save the provisions of repealed Acts” or anywhere in the country. The order did not agree with the State’s contention, which pointed to several High Court judgments on similar matters. Meanwhile, when the opinion of a senior officer in the Commercial Taxes Department was sought on the retrospective nature of the executive order, he clarified, “The transition provisions are already there in the Act, and the notification is in pursuant with the provisions.” He added, “There was some confusion prevailing and hence the notification was given with retrospective effect.” The officer said that this was an explanatory clarification to the existing transition provision, which is already there in the Karnataka Goods and Service Tax Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gst-state-issues-notification-related-to-five-subsumed-acts/article34341012.ece
17 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||31 police personnel, 450 family members test positive||The Police Department, which was battered by COVID-19 last year, has been hit by the second wave. While 31 police personnel – 18 in the city and 13 in rest of the State – have tested positive for COVID-19 since April 1, their families, too, are at risk. As many as 450 family members of police personnel tested positive in the same period. “Police personnel can give their full attention to the job only when everything is all right at home. Any issues at home will rob them of their morale and initiative. So the high number of positive cases being reported in police families is a matter of serious concern,” said Praveen Sood, DG & IGP, Karnataka State Police. Over 90% of police received their first dose and over 20% the second dose as well. However, vaccine coverage among their families has not been good, sources said. “We have asked our personnel to immediately take the second dose. Meanwhile, we are encouraging and organising drives to get all those among their families eligible for vaccines to get their jabs,” Mr. Sood said. The department has issued a new set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to police across the State, which calls for strict adherence to COVID-19 Appropriate Behaviour (CAB). Reverting to the practice last year, all police stations will establish a help desk outside the police station to curtail the entry of ‘all and sundry’ into the premises. All accused need to be produced before the magistrate through video conferencing and not physically, wherever possible. Several personnel had tested positive last year while processing arrested accused, who later tested positive. Such situations cannot be completely avoided. But producing the accused via video conference will help minimise contact, officials said. “The challenge this year is, normal life is on and so are policing duties. Trying to avoid contact in such a scenario is very difficult. But there is no other way,” Mr. Sood said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/31-police-personnel-450-family-members-test-positive/article34340629.ece

Commission member H. Venkatesha Dodderi, accompanied by senior BBMP officials, visited the houses of the gravediggers who live on the premises. After receiving a memorandum from the Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Dalitha Sangharsha Samithi, Mr. Dodderi directed BBMP officials to ensure that workers get their pending salaries in two days and protective gear immediately. Mr. Dodderi told The Hindu that as per BBMP records, 265 workers were working in 62 graveyards and electric crematoria. “Salaries have been disbursed to 149 workers. The remaining 116 will also get their salaries shortly,” he said and added that one of the major demands of the gravediggers was direct employment by the BBMP and regularisation of their services. There are many families who have been gravediggers for more than two or three generations. BBMP officials have been directed to rehabilitate the gravediggers living in graveyards and ensure that benefits of housing schemes are extended to them. “Officials have been directed to immediately provide toilet and bathroom facilities in all graveyards and electric crematoria. We have also recommended that children of gravediggers and assistants be admitted in residential schools, apart from being treated on a par with safai karmacharis. However, a policy decision is needed for the same,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/commission-steps-in-to-address-problems-faced-by-graveyard-crematoria-workers/article34340999.ece
17 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Entry to HC, trial courts in nine districts restricted||With the sudden and steep rise in number of COVID-19 cases, the High Court of Karnataka has re-introduced restriction on entry of litigants into its three Benches at Bengaluru, Dharward, and Kalaburagi, and district and taluk courts in nine districts. “Entry of litigants to the court complex will remain prohibited except when there is a specific order of the court permitting the presence of the litigants; and parties-in-person shall remain present only through videoconferencing,” said a notification issued by In-charge Registrar-General T.G. Shivashankare Gowda. Entry of litigants is prohibited in all the trial courts in the districts of Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Ballari, Bidar, Dakshina Kannada, Hassan, Kalaburagi, Mysuru, and Tumakur. Recording of evidence in all civil and criminal cases should be prohibited except in those cases where time-bound schedule has been fixed by the Supreme Court or the High Court, the notification stated while requesting the trial courts not to pass any adverse orders on the ground of absence of advocates and the accused who are on bail.  Meanwhile, a Division Bench headed by the Chief Justice extended all the interim orders (which are due to expire in the period between April, 17 and May 29, 2021), passed by the High Court (principal seat and Benches at Dharwad and Kalaburagi), all the district courts, civil courts, family courts, labour courts, industrial tribunals, and all other tribunals in the State over which the High Court has the power of superintendence, till May 29. If any orders of eviction, dispossession or demolition have been passed by the High Court, district courts or civil courts, the same shall remain in abeyance till May 29, and parties can move for vacating such orders, the Bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/entry-to-hc-trial-courts-in-nine-districts-restricted/article34341005.ece
17 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Labs swamped, results delayed||Laboratories, especially government-run facilities, seem to be buckling under the second wave of COVID-19 with people lining up to get tested. Over the last fortnight, an increasing number of citizens have reported significant delays, as long as four days, in getting their results. At a meeting on Friday with senior officials, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa stated that laboratories have to submit results within 24 hours. In govt.-run facilities While there have been complaints of private laboratories also delaying sending results, they are fewer in number when compared to government-run facilities. The delay implies loss of precious time in starting treatment. It also affects those who need to travel with negative certificates not more than 72 hours old. Pooja S., a software professional from Bengaluru whose mother got tested on Tuesday, said she received her results only on Friday. “Her symptoms had subsided so we told her not to isolate herself. We were shocked when we got the results,” he said. A media professional who gave his swab for testing last week said that he received his results only after four days, causing anxiety among his family members. A Bengaluru-based documentary filmmaker, after waiting for a week for his results, finally went to a private facility after the government-run laboratory failed to get back to him. Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said, “It has come to my notice that there is delay in getting COVID-19 reports. I have instructed the labs to give test reports within 24 hours of collecting the sample.” Manpower issue Officials in charge of these laboratories attributed the delays to testing being ramped up and the lack of manpower to meet this increase in volume of swabs. On Friday, as many as 1.33 lakh tests were conducted across the State. Given the situation, health experts have urged citizens to isolate themselves till they get their results. The fact that people are not doing so is worrying as they will continue to spread the virus to others at home and at their workplaces, they warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/labs-swamped-results-delayed/article34340636.ece

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar told Additional Advocate General M. Dhyan Chinnappa to seek instruction from the government in setting up committee so that grievances of citizens can be considered by the committee and people need not knock on the doors of the courts. The Bench, hearing PIL petitions on issues that had cropped up during the lockdown and unlock process of 2020, also told the AAG for information on the measures taken to ensure availability of sufficient beds in hospitals for COVID-19 patients, ambulance facilities, etc. When the counsel for petitioners pointed out that exorbitant charges are being demanded from people for cremation in the range of Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 40,000 and ambulances are not available in sufficient numbers for COVID-19 patients, the Bench asked the government to respond to the issues as the State is witnessing a sudden surge in the number of COVID-19 positive cases unlike in the first wave of the infection. The Bench adjourned further hearing till April 17 asking the government to submit its responses to the queries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-grievances-consider-forming-a-panel-hc-tells-govt/article34340631.ece

Twenty-two students were awarded the doctoral degrees, while 72 were from the executive postgraduate programme. In his address to the graduating students, Arvind Krishna, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IBM, said, “Your generation is more global, educated, tolerant, and technology savvy than perhaps any that has come before it. It is because of the kind of minds that exist here at IIM Bangalore that I know that we will surprise the pessimists.” Curiosity and persistence, he said, would help them be better business leaders. “Curiosity is what will allow you to find problems that are worth solving. It will give you a new sense of what the word ‘discovery’ means, and will lead you down all sorts of interesting paths. Ultimately, it is your propensity to learn throughout your life — not your intellect, not your degree, not even your experience — that will determine your success.”  Technology powerhouse He expressed optimism about India’s future: “India is a technology powerhouse with more than half of the world’s largest 1,200 multinationals having set up their R&D centres in the country. I have immense confidence in your generation’s ability to take on the challenges of our day, use this as an opportunity to build a better future and fix some of the fault lines that the crisis has exposed.” Chairperson of the IIMB Board of Directors Devi Shetty highlighted the efforts put in by the faculty, students, alumni, and staff of IIMB, while Rishikesha T. Krishnan, Director, IIM Bangalore, highlighted some of the achievements and accomplishments of the institute.

17 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Law on apartment associations has not been implemented for 47 years’||The High Court of Karnataka on Friday ordered issue notice to the State government on a public interest litigation petition complaining that apartment owners have been put to severe hardship owing to non-implementation of the Karnataka Apartment Owners Association Act, 1972, even 47 years after it came into force. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the order on a petition filed by Abhilash N., a resident of Thyagarajnagar. Though the Act came into force in July 1973, none of its benefit reached apartment buyers or owners sans its implementation, the petitioner said. “The apartment owners are unable to register their association to fulfil their purpose of maintenance, administer, carry out day-to-day activities relating to all aspect of building apartments, common areas, common facilities, and common services without getting registration by the owners,” the petitioner contended while pointing out that none of the benefits offered by the law is available to apartment owners owing to the government’s failure to implement it. Noticing that the government had not framed rules for implementation of the Act, the Bench asked the government whether an Act can be effectively implemented if the government failed to exercise its rule-making powers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/law-on-apartment-associations-has-not-been-implemented-for-47-years/article34340994.ece

Authorities at the HCG Plasma Bank have now appealed to people who recovered from COVID-19 to donate their plasma, which can then be administered to patients who are undergoing treatment. U.S. Vishal Rao, who heads the State-supported HCG Plasma Bank said they were urgently looking for plasma for a few critical patients. “I have sent messages to people asking them to put us in touch with people who might be willing to donate. Many of our earlier donors do not have antibodies and will not be able to donate. So we are desperately hoping for new donors to come forward,” he said.  25 to 50 calls a day He added that they were receiving 25 to 50 calls a day from patients including those from other States.

As of Friday, nearly 600 employees returned to duty and 232 buses were operated on the day.

17 April 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘Govt. has not learnt its lesson from first wave’||Criticising the Union and State governments for their ill-preparedness to handle the second wave of COVID-19, KPCC spokesperson and MLA Priyank Kharge and former Minister Sharan Prakash Patil said the governments had not learnt its lesson from the first wave. At a press conference in Kalaburagi on Friday, they alleged that the BJP leaders were busy with elections and protecting their power instead of preparing to handle the spread. “There is severe shortage of beds and oxygen cylinders. Remdesivir and allied medicines are being sold at inflated prices in the black market. Though there is a shortfall of COVID-19 vaccines in the country, the government has allowed the export of around six crore vaccines. The Centre is negligent and irresponsible that it has not spent a single rupee on the research and development of a vaccine. The available vaccines are developed by private parties,” Mr. Kharge said. Pointing to the widespread pandemic in neighbouring Maharashtra, he questioned the State government why it had not yet sealed the borders. “Officials in the borders areas are allowing the people coming from Maharashtra to enter the State after accepting bribes. The government should ensure they are properly screened. COVID care centres should be established in the border areasso that the infected people coming from the neighbouring States could be treated there,” Mr. Kharge said. Mr. Patil warned the government that the situation would go out of control and people would die on the roads without proper treatment if preparations are not started on war footing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-has-not-learnt-its-lesson-from-first-wave/article34340626.ece

17 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Cong. casts doubts on public hearing||The district Congress has alleged that about 300 ‘outsiders’ hired by those within the BJP backing the heli-tourism project, would be sent to attend the public hearing to browbeat any opposition or manipulate public opinion in favour of the project. The public hearing has been convened to invite objections as the heli-tourism project entails felling of nearly 150 trees to pave way for a helipad in front of the Lalitha Mahal Palace. The hearing will be held at Aranya Bhavan on April 23 from 11 a.m. KPCC spokesperson M. Lakshman told media persons here on Friday that “efforts will be made to manipulate the outcome of the public hearing through these outsiders’’ and it could lead to tension. The Forest Department would be entirely responsible for any untoward incident, he added. The Congress also alleged that the proposed helipad was only a pretext to allow vested interests to take over open land at the Chamundi foothills. While an helipad would not require more than half-an-acre the larger objective was to acquire the vast swathe of open spaces in the guise of promoting tourism and build luxury resorts, alleged Mr. Lakshman. He said this project was fuelled by “private interests” and the Congress would oppose it during the public hearing. Questioning the need for a new helipad, Mr. Lakshman claimed that nearly 800 trees would ultimately be felled for project implementation. When there was a helipad in the vicinity it could as well be utilised instead of chopping trees which will have a negative bearing on the environment. The Forest Department too came under flak for marking and identification of trees for felling even before convening a public hearing or consulting the Tree Authority and this tantamounted to a criminal act, according to the Congress. Mr. Lakshman said people of Mysuru are not anti-development but have questioned projects that was inimical to environment. He said there was no opposition to the project per se but people were questioning the need to chop hundreds of trees when there was a helipad already in the vicinity and these trees could as well be saved, said Mr. Lakshman. The Congress will file its objections to the project during the public hearing and the Forest Department should also take cognisance of over 70,000 signatories who had voiced their opposition through an online petition, he added. Similarly, the authorities should take note of the opposition aired by Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and the district in-charge Minister S.T. Somashekar, said Mr. Lakshman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-casts-doubts-on-public-hearing/article34341178.ece
17 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Study predicts 12.9 lakh cases, 13,600 deaths across Karnataka by May 10||The resurgence of COVID-19 is expected to continue in the coming days with a study predicting the number of cases to reach 12.9 lakh and deaths, 13,600, by May 10 in Karnataka. Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership initiative by Proxima, a management consulting firm, with technical support and guidance of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), has, in it is ‘COVID-19: Wave 2: Trend analysis and Projection’ said that the total cases in Karnataka, which stood at 11,09,650 on April 14, will reach 12,90,000 on May 10. Similarly, the number of persons dying by COVID-19 in the State is projected to reach 13,600 on May 10 from the 13,112, who had died till April 14. Jeevan Raksha’s convenor Mysore Sanjeev said the projections were based on its forecasting module Proxima Pandemic Management System (PPMS), which had also carried out similar projections between August 2020 and January 2021. Peak by May It may be mentioned here that the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee members had also opined that the second wave was expected to peak by May first week before dipping by the end of the month. “In the last 30 days, the four southern States – Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala – cumulatively added 4,01,690 COVID-19 cases and 1,754 deaths of which Karnataka alone contributed 37% of the cases and 40% of the deaths. This clearly indicates that there is a sharp deterioration in COVID-19 management in Karnataka when compared with its neighbouring states despite an increase in testing,” Mr Sanjeev said. In Bengaluru Also, Bengaluru has contributed 68% and 61% of the total incremental increase in State’s cases and deaths between March 16 and April 14. “The qualitative aspect of testing is a major issue in Bengaluru. Large number of tests are being conducted for transactional and administrative purposes with limited relevance from COVID-19 containment point of view,” he said. Jeevan Raksha pointed out that the growth pattern of COVID-19 cases in the country indicated that the numbers will continue to surge and reach 1,73,00,000 by May 10 against the 1,42,95,430 reported by April 14 night. The number of deaths are also predicted to cross 1,90,000 by May 10 with Maharashtra, Gujarat and Punjab, besides Delhi likely to witness a high number of deaths.   What the study says Actual cases till April 14 night: 11,09,650  Projected cases till May 10: 12,90,000  Actual deaths till April 14 night: 13,112  Projected deaths till May 10: 13,600||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/study-predicts-129-lakh-cases-13600-deaths-across-karnataka-by-may-10/article34340635.ece
17 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Property tax hike in Mysuru ‘unscientific’||The property tax hike announced by the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) with effect from April 1 has been flayed by the Congress on the grounds that it was unscientific. The party spokespersons, M. Lakshman, said here on Friday that the hike effected was two- to three-fold contrary to the public perception that the hike was by 15 per cent. He alleged there were instances when individuals who were paying tax to the extent of Rs. 9,000 per year, were now being levied Rs. 25,000 and this was almost a three-fold increase. Describing this as an ‘extortion’ by the State, Mr. Lakshman said the proposed tax on vacant plots was also condemnable. The hike in property tax is forcing the landlords to enhance the monthly rentals as a result of which house rent in Mysuru was soaring. The Congress will convene a public meeting at the Institution of Engineers on Sunday at 11 a.m. to chalk the next course of action and will even question the move in court of law if need be, said Mr. Lakshman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/property-tax-hike-in-mysuru-unscientific/article34341181.ece

17 April 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Patent for SD College||Sanatana Dharma (SD) College, Alappuzha, has been granted a patent for an invention titled ‘A Process of Preparing Metal Nanoparticles’. The patent has been granted by the Patent Office, Government of India, for a period of 20 years in accordance with the provisions of the Patents Act, 1970. It is the first patent awarded to the college, which is poised to celebrate its platinum jubilee in June 2021, SD College authorities said in a statement here on Friday. As per the statement, the invention paves the way for the synthesis of nano metals in a very cost-effective manner by single-stage auto-decomposition method. Citrus fruit extract “Usually various toxic reducing agents are used for the reduction of metal ion to zero-valent metal. In this method, it is very effectively replaced by citrus fruit extract. Proper tuning of the ratio of extract volume to metal ion concentration is very essential for the successful conversion of metal ion to metal nanoparticles. At present this method is applied to synthesis nano nickel, an efficient catalyst for hydrogenation, coupling reaction and reduction of nitro compounds. This can reduce the cost of synthesis of many industrially important organic compounds,” the research team said. The process leading to the patent was developed in the research lab of the Chemistry Department of SD College, which is an approved research centre of the University of Kerala, under the guidance of Prema K.H., associate professor of Chemistry. The research team behind the invention included research scholar Raji R. Krishnan; Edamana Prasad, professor, Department of Chemistry, IIT- Madras; Sreekanth J. Varma, assistant professor of Physics, SD College; and Aswathy Gopan, postgraduate student, Department of Chemistry, SD College. According to the researchers, other industrially important catalysts such as platinum and palladium and various other metals such as silver, copper and cobalt can also be synthesised by this method. The researchers said that they were working to increase the scale of production of nano metals on an industrial level and to transfer the technology to industry.  The high-end equipment procured using grants from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment along with financial support from the college management were instrumental in getting the patent, they said.

17 April 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Kochi-Dhanushkodi NH opening may be delayed||The opening of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway (NH 85) may be delayed as works on the Gap Road stretch of the Munnar-Bodimettu section are unlikely to be completed before the northeast monsoon. Though the second-level tarring of the 42-km Munnar-Bodimettu stretch is almost over, works on the landslip-hit Gap Road need more time, say revenue authorities. Earlier, it was decided to open the road before March 15. However, the work on the Gap Road stretch was a challenge to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) . There were three major landslips on the stretch on July 28 and October 8 in 2019 and on June 19, 2020 causing large-scale damage in the area. In the first two landslips, vast areas of farmland downhill were destroyed. The last landslip washed away nearly 200 metres of the road. While the compensation for the damage to the farmlands had been settled, the work resumed only after the visit of an IIT expert team that suggested construction of a retaining wall and other safety measures. There had been many bottlenecks since the works on NH 85 began in 2017. The works were to be completed so as to open the road in August 2019. Several stretches of the road between Munnar and Bodimettu were hit by landslips in the 2018 floods. Heavy rainfall also caused damage to the road the following year. The pandemic outbreak also delayed the works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-dhanushkodi-nh-opening-may-be-delayed/article34340737.ece

Shamseer, MLA, in the university. The protesters took out a rally and crossed the police barricade before staging the sit-in. The protest was inaugurated by KSU district president P. Muhammad Shammas. Mr. Shammas said that the hasty move to make appointments was “mysterious” and that the university rules were being flouted for the appointment of relatives of CPI(M) leaders and that the Vice-Chancellor was complicit in this. He said the Vice-Chancellor’s move to interview candidates at his home was against the norms. He alleged that there was an attempt to appoint the MLA’s wife to the permanent post of Assistant Director at the UGC HRD Centre in Kannur University, in violation of rules. Earlier, an attempt was made to appoint the MLA’s wife in the university. But the High Court had intervened and stayed the appointment, he said. Later, the police arrested and removed Mr. Shammas and other KSU activists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksu-activists-stage-sit-in-protest-in-kannur/article34340671.ece

17 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Over 16,000 samples collected for testing in Ernakulam||As part of a State-wide mass testing drive to contain the spread of COVID-19, Ernakulam collected 16,210 samples for testing on Friday, according to District Collector S. Suhas. The district has surpassed the day’s target of 15,500 tests. The two-day drive, for which the district administration had set a target of 31,000 samples, will continue on Saturday. Ernakulam recorded 1,391 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, and the active caseload has crossed 10,000, with 10,138 presently under treatment for the infection. Thrikkakara registered 56 new cases, followed by Keezhmad with 45, and Kalamassery, Vazhakulam, and Vengola with 36 cases each. Maradu saw 35 new cases, and Palluruthy recorded 34. Two health workers and three police officers were among those who were infected. A total of 515 people tested negative on Friday, and 25,750 people remain in quarantine. While 7,402 people are recovering at home, the number those admitted at private hospitals has grown to 645. At treatment centres at government hospitals, 276 people are recovering, while 372 people are at first- and second-line treatment centres. Mass testing camps were organised in different parts of the district on Friday, and seven mobile testing units were deployed to collect samples. People who were part of the electioneering process, those over the age of 45 who have not been vaccinated, people in containment zones and clusters, and contacts of patients were identified with the help of ASHA workers and asked to get tested. Prior to the launch of the testing drive, the administration had conducted a meeting with representatives of political parties. People who were part of electioneering squads, polling agents, those who distributed voter slips, and others who might have come in contact with several people during the campaign have been identified for testing. As part of the testing drive, select private laboratories have been roped in to scale up tests and offer testing for free. Meanwhile, in the Kochi Corporation, Mayor M. Anilkumar convened a meeting of standing committee chairpersons and the Opposition Leader, to discuss measures to contain the spread of the infection. The entry of visitors to the Kochi Corporation office will be restricted, and a help desk will begin functioning soon. The functioning of COVID monitoring committees at the division level will be intensified. Each monitoring committee comprises the division councillor, a health inspector, representatives of residents’ associations, and police officers. The committees were formed last year at the local body level to oversee disease containment measures. The first-line treatment centre at Palluruthy which had been shut down would be reopened soon, said T.K. Ashraf, chairman of the health standing committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/over-16000-samples-collected-for-testing-in-ernakulam/article34341125.ece
17 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Vacation Foster Care programme continues to be in limbo in district||The much-acclaimed Vacation Foster Care programme of the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) seems to be in limbo for the second successive year in the wake of a COVID-19 surge. It was suspended last year as well following the pandemic despite enthusiastic response from families as was evident in the 50-odd applications received by the DCPU. “We are yet to take a final call on going ahead with the programme, which will be subjected to a sanction from the Directorate of Women and Child Development. We will have to take into account the prevailing pandemic situation necessitating the testing of all parents concerned and restricting children inside homes,” said Bitty K. Joseph, Chairperson, District Child Welfare Committee. The DCPU has contacted the applicants from the previous year out of whom around 12 families had evinced interest in participating in the vacation foster care programme. The home study of these families has also been completed though any decision to go ahead with the programme will need the approval of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). The Ernakulam DCPU had rolled out the Vacation Foster Care programme in 2018 since which 39 children lodged at various child care institutes across the district got to spend their vacation with 30 foster families. Significantly, girls outnumbered boys 28 to 11, indicating the strong preference of families for girls. There were also instances of families taking home even siblings from child care institutes. Some families had even applied every year since the programme was launched and took home the same child on all occasions, thus establishing an emotional bond with the child. Before the pandemic, the programme used to evoke a very enthusiastic response, with the DCPU receiving as high as 160 inquiries on a single day. Last year when the programme was aborted, the DCPU had chosen to directly identify potential beneficiaries unlike in the previous years when it called for a list of children available for the programme from the registered child care institutes in the district. Children who are not able to return home even during the vacation are mostly considered for the programme. Once the beneficiaries are chosen, social workers assigned by the DCPU will undertake a home study, followed by counselling to ascertain whether the families are capable of taking good care of the children in a safe and secured atmosphere. Out of the 97 registered child care institutes in the district, around 50% have resumed operations now after a majority of inmates of the institutes got stuck in their homes after returning for the vacation last year following the announcement of the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vacation-foster-care-programme-continues-to-be-in-limbo-in-district/article34341122.ece
17 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||High wages driving labour migration to Kerala||The significantly higher remuneration for a daily wage worker apart, safety of women workers, rapid urbanisation of Kerala, structural changes in the economy of the State, better opportunities for skill development, and labour mobility continue to fire the engine of long-distance in-migration of unskilled workers into Kerala, says a study by the Kochi-based Centre for Socio-Economic and Environmental Studies. The study was based on in-depth interviews with more than 50 migrant labourers from 2015 to 2019 as well as focus group discussions in which questions were posed before groups of migrant labourers, their answers analysed and examined. Clarifications were sought from participants in these discussions to ensure that honest views were expressed. Most discussions took place in Ernakulam district. While in-migration from the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka has dwindled with better opportunities for daily wage workers in those States, Kerala is witness to in-migration from the geographically distant north, northeast and east Indian States, says N. Ajith Kumar who led the study. The co-existence of these several factors helps overcome the friction of physical, linguistic and cultural distances between the States of origin of the workers and Kerala, said the study titled ‘Exploring the Drivers of Long Distance Labour Migration to Kerala’. The long tradition of out-migration from Kerala to other States and emigration to other countries and higher educational achievements have triggered a drastic demographic transition in Kerala. But the growing urban-rural continuum in Kerala and barriers to emigration to other countries have inspired long-distance migration within the country. The study also pointed out that the initiatives by the Kerala government to provide social security to in-migrant workers had not been a big factor in drawing them to the State. The flow of in-migration from the two neighbouring States started around 1960 and peaked in the 1990s. However, the second half of the 1990s saw massive inflow from north, east and northeastern States. While the number of workers from the neighbouring States has fallen sharply, the number of their counterparts from the north, east and northeastern States in Kerala is overwhelmingly higher. The significant growth in in-migration contrasts sharply with the linguistic, cultural and geographical distances that separate Kerala and States like Odisha, Assam, and West Bengal from where a large number of workers come. Obviously, higher wages in Kerala is the most important factor. The national average daily wage for a male labour engaged in agricultural occupations (ploughing and tilling) in rural areas in December 2018 was Rs. 321 as against Rs. 767 in Kerala. A daily wage worker in Gujarat got paid around Rs. 265; in Tripura, it was Rs. 270; in West Bengal Rs. 329; in Uttar Pradesh Rs. 247, and in Odisha Rs. 239. The fast pace of urbanisation in Kerala and the rural-urban continuum, the ‘network effects’ in which villagers exchange ideas about opportunities in different States, increasing preference of the long-distance migrant worker by local employers, opportunities for occupational mobility, and safety of women migrant workers are the other key factors that continue to draw workers into Kerala, the study said.  Initiatives to provide social security to in-migrant workers have not been a big factor in drawing them to the State||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-wages-driving-labour-migration-to-kerala/article34340661.ece
17 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Shortage of doses may jeopardise vaccination drive in district||The ongoing COVID-19 mass vaccination drive in Ernakulam is in danger of grinding to a halt unless fresh doses of vaccines are received though there is hardly any information on when that will happen. Ernakulam, according to the authorities, topped the State in vaccination, having administered 7 lakh doses since the drive began. “While 6.10 lakh people received a single dose, the remaining 90,000 were administered both the doses,” said M.G. Sivadas, district nodal officer, COVID-19 vaccination. The district requires an estimated 16 lakh doses to administer both doses to cover all eligible people aged above 45 years. The district is pinning its hopes on the Centre honouring the State government’s demand for 50 lakh doses, which will be distributed across Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode regions. There are 190 vaccination centres in Ernakulam, of which the required number of centres are being activated depending on each day’s target. On Friday, 103 centres were active. Multiple teams made up of five members each are deployed at the centres for vaccination. Meanwhile, the authorities shot down allegations that the timing of the vaccination drive was restricted till afternoon, especially at public health facilities, thus stamping out many eligible people, including teachers on exam duty. Dr. Sivadas said the vaccination drive was being held from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. With only around 18,000 doses of the targeted 30,000 being administered on Friday, the district will be able to stretch its dwindling vaccine supply to cover sessions on Saturday as well, Dr. Sivadas said. On Friday, 103 vaccination centres were operational, including mass vaccination sites. Around 20,000 doses will be available for sessions on Saturday, and around 100 centres are expected to function, he added. On the dip in the number of doses administered on Friday, Dr. Sivadas said people might not have arrived at vaccination centres possibly anticipating that they might not be able to take the shot due to shortage of doses. Vaccine shortage has come at a time when local bodies, including the Thrikkakara municipality and the Kochi Corporation, where cases have been soaring, are planning to strengthen vaccination drives to scale up coverage. The Kochi Corporation plans on launching an awareness campaign in each division, besides administering one lakh doses in the first phase of its vaccination drive, if additional stock is made available. “At the local body level, we plan on scaling up vaccination and starting new centres when more doses of the two vaccines arrive,” said Dr. Sivadas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shortage-of-doses-may-jeopardise-vaccination-drive-in-district/article34341127.ece
17 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Kudumbashree begins massive awareness campaign||The District Kudumbashree Mission has embarked on a mass awareness campaign, especially focussed around 24 local bodies, in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. The Health Department had handed over the Mission a list of 24 particularly vulnerable local bodies for special attention. Following this, the Community Development Societies (CDS) in these local bodies convened special meetings attended by 329 members for chalking out awareness campaigns. This was followed by similar special meetings of Area Development Societies (ADS) in 189 wards and I448 Neighbourhood Groups (NHG). “We are now focussing on massive awareness campaigns driving home the need to return to the basics of ‘Break the Chain’ campaign held at the start of the pandemic. A note was issued to all 26,500 NHGs across the district on the need for organising such campaigns,” said S. Renjini, district coordinator, Kudumbashree Mission, Ernakulam. Since then groups made up of CDS members have been visiting public spaces prone to overcrowding like markets, shops, and bus stands and educating the public about the need to strictly comply with the COVID-19 protocol. They have also been dropping in at houses in their neighbourhoods where marriages are being held and trying to inculcate the need for complying with the protocol through friendly, casual chats. “Our teams have also been visiting ATM kiosks for checking whether hand sanitisers are being kept for customers and have been alerting the bank managers concerned where they were missing,” said Ms. Renjini. Bala Sabhas affiliated with the Kudumbashree Mission have also been roped in for awareness campaigns. Posters designed by them are being displayed at public places while small videos created by them are being propagated over social media. “We have also kick-started a campaign ‘Onnayi Orumichu’ for mobilising people aged above 45 years for vaccination drives,” said Ms. Renjini. Kudumbashree members have also been facilitating the vaccination of Asraya families by helping them with the registration and even with their conveyance to vaccination centres. Till last week, 230 members have got vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kudumbashree-begins-massive-awareness-campaign/article34341129.ece

17 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Renewed restrictions deal a body blow to hotel industry||Hotels in the city are beginning to feel the heat with the restrictive timings enforced by the government in the wake of the suspected second wave of COVID-19 dealing a hammer blow to an already beleaguered industry. The Kerala Hotel and Restaurants Association (KHRA) said the sign of things in store was evident in the significant drop in business city-based hotels had during Vishu. This, the association said, had been the case for the last couple of days ever since the government declared that hotels and shops should down shutters at 9 p.m. “This being the Ramzan month, a large number of hotels only open in the evening and then having to close down at 9 p.m. severely hampers their business,” said Azees Musa, Ernakulam district president, KHRA. A majority of KHRA members has a seating capacity of 25 or less, and hence operating with half the occupancy is really unfeasible. Remaining closed rather than operating is a better option in comparison, it is being pointed out. “We will fully cooperate with government restrictions in compliance with our obligations in the face of a surging pandemic. But the government should at least review the closure timing and grant an additional hour or two since people who dine out prefer to drop in at hotels much later. Anyway, not many people would be coming, as scared they are in the prevailing situation, and an extra hour or two would not significantly worsen the situation,” said Mr. Musa. He added that as per the present notification, hotels are not even allowed to operate even to cater to parcels even after the closure time unlike during the height of the pandemic the previous year. “Though we have our own platform to cater to online orders, the provision that those who are part of the GST compounding scheme are not allowed to deal in online business dampens that prospect as well,” said Mr. Musa. He said around 6,000 hotels, especially along highways and catering for tourists and travellers, who were members of KHRA had closed down under the impact of the pandemic so far. The Federation of Kerala Hotels Association said the renewed restrictions would be another blow to their members already operating with scaled down workforce. “It will be difficult for hotels to survive in a place like Ernakulam,” said Ajith C. Nair, secretary of the federation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/curbs-deal-a-body-blow-to-hotel-industry/article34340745.ece
17 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||COVID curbs hit daily wage earners hard||Life took a dark turn for 50-year-old Satheesh Kumar M.R., a visually-challenged lottery vendor, when the pandemic broke out last year. And, just when he thought things were at last looking up has come the second wave of the pandemic and the accompanying restrictions, leaving him further despondent. “Physical distancing means that people are staying away from us, badly affecting our business. In the last month alone, I suffered a loss of Rs. 10,000 on account of unsold tickets. The situation was already bad with low sales commission on account of the Goods and Services Tax,” said Mr. Kumar, a postgraduate who also doubles up as a percussion artiste. With the new set of restrictions kicking in to check the second wave, daily wage earners on hand-to-mouth existence are an anxious lot. Depleted business George Jolly, an autorickshaw driver operating from the North railway station, was already staring at depleted business and fears that it may further worsen if the number of passengers per trip is restricted to two. “People preferred own vehicles to public transport even before the new restrictions came into force. After a really hard time, things were beginning to improve when they deteriorated further,” he despaired. K.S. Prasad, secretary of the Association of Mimicry Artistes, lamented that stage artistes dependent on peak festival season had now lost four successive seasons, two each to floods and the pandemic. “Young and able artistes have moved on to other jobs. However, senior people like those who operated as programme agents are too old even for that. “The Central government is considering a financial assistance package and insurance coverage for stage artistes, but nothing is official as yet,” he said even as he fumed at the injustice of restricting public events, while politicians had free rein during electioneering. Poor returns Baiju T.A., who operates a private bus on the Kakkanad-Fort Kochi route in Ernakulam, used to don the conductor’s uniform once in a while.

17 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Children’s creative spirit gives boost to campaign||Before the new restrictions in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic kicked in, a video was uploaded on the official Facebook page of District Collector S. Suhas that has since then been viewed by over 21,000 people. The just over two-minute-long video, which sought to create awareness about the pandemic and drove home the need to comply with the COVID protocol was made by seven schoolgoing children who were members of the Kudumbashree Mission’s Bala Sabha in Asamannoor panchayat. The thought-provoking video had a kid representing the coronavirus going from house to house looking for victims to infect before training its eyes on three careless children sitting by the road without wearing mask. They are then chased by the virus and along the way, they stage a fightback by wearing mask and sanitising hands that eventually leaves the virus dropped dead. The concept was the brainchild of Sangeetha, a member of the Community Development Society of ward 8 in Asamannoor panchayat and the mother of Navaneeth S, who eventually directed the video. “The video was shot using a smartphone camera for which alone we sought outside help,” said the ninth standard student. He was assisted by Nithya Suresh and Amrutha. Though the four who acted in the video – Shabarinath, Adin, Dwidin, and Abhishek – had no previous experience, the shooting could be wrapped in a single day. Abhishek doubled up as the editor falling back on his self-taught skills. “Editing was completed in an hour using a mobile app. I have been doing small videos for WhatsApp groups,” said Abhishek, a fifth standard student. The video was posted in the CDS WhatsApp group from where it found its way to the collector’s Facebook page. “It was much appreciated and inspired more children with Bala Sabhas to undertake similar initiatives,” said S. Renjini, district coordinator, Kudumbasree Mission, Ernakulam. Since then the Mission has actively roped in Bala Sabha members in the awareness campaign against the pandemic. The team behind the video is now planning another video to promote vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/childrens-creative-spirit-gives-boost-to-campaign/article34341131.ece

The man, identified as Sajayjith, an alleged RSS activist of Vallikkunnam, is accused of stabbing to death the teenager, Abhimanyu, during a temple festival at Padayanivattom at Vallikkunam grama panchayat on Wednesday night. The accused was handed over to a police team from Aroor. He turned up at the Palarivattom police station and surrendered by around 10 a.m. Police sources said he was accompanied by a few others who remained outside the station. Shortly thereafter, the City police alerted the Vallikunnam police about the surrender. Went into hiding A police unit from Aroor under the Alappuzha police jurisdiction took custody of the accused. It is suspected that the accused was hiding somewhere in Kochi after the alleged murder. The assailants, allegedly members of the RSS, had reportedly come in search of his elder brother who is a DYFI activist, but killed the teenager, instead. The CPI(M) had alleged it to be a planned murder by the BJP and RSS. They, however, denied it and distanced themselves from the murder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/prime-accused-in-teens-murder-turns-himself-in/article34340765.ece
17 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Using red earth to fill metro medians draws flak||Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL), which claims it is striving for a carbon-neutral metro, is under fire for not addressing the negative carbon footprint left by filling of medians beneath the metro corridor with red earth and mud to landscape them. This is a stark deviation from the eco-friendly method that was being adopted to landscape a bulk of medians on the M.G. Road metro corridor. In this, the medians were filled with dried leaves, plants, coconut fronds and branches of trees that were felled. They would otherwise have been burnt in residential areas, causing air pollution, or left abandoned on the road side, obstructing road users. The metro agency had highlighted how this was a win-win situation for all stakeholders, while bringing about a carbon-neutral ecosystem in the greening drive. “Each metro pillar, the 25-km Aluva-Pettah viaduct, metro stations and allied components have left tremendous carbon footprint, in the form of tens of thousands of tonnes of aggregate and other raw materials. Filling medians beneath the viaduct with lorry loads of mud will make the mass rapid transit project further carbon negative. Lessons have not been learned from the 2018 floods and the alarming rate at which climate change is occurring due to imbalance caused by unchecked quarrying of rocks, mud, etc.,” said C.N. Manoj of Pelican Biotech, which executed the median landscaping project on M.G. Road using plant and tree debris. “We relied on almost 400 tonnes of such debris to fill medians on M.G. Road. This works out to almost the quantity of garbage that is transported from the city each day to the treatment plant at Brahmapuram. We were unable to clear plant/tree debris from residential colonies during the past many months since vacant medians have not been allotted to us to do landscaping using this method. This despite the fact that the CII entrusted us with the task of rejuvenating many median stretches in Hyderabad, including beneath the metro corridor there,” he said. Mr. Manoj spoke of how carbon footprint increased by at least 100 kg when two trucks laden with earth commute from suburban locales to the city to fill a median, consuming approximately 12 litres of diesel. “One can imagine the situation if 2,000 trips are made. This is apart from the damage caused to the locales from where red earth is mined and the fall in ground water retention.” Corpn. stance Responding to the issue, Mayor M. Anilkumar said the Kochi Corporation is all for promoting eco-friendly initiatives, including for landscaping medians. The Health Standing Committee of the corporation has been asked to probe the possibility of filling medians with treated biodegradable garbage, he said. Sources in KMRL said that a decision was taken to permit filling of medians with mud to prevent the possibility of untreated garbage being dumped in them. There were also complaints of heaped plant and tree debris falling on roads from within the medians. Moreover, the sponsor is free to decide which material to choose, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/using-red-earth-to-fill-metro-medians-draws-flak/article34341123.ece

17 April 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Boat owners seek cut in trawl ban period||The All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators Association has approached the Centre to shorten the span of the annual monsoon fishing ban that starts in Kerala in June. In a memorandum submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the association points out that imposing trawl ban for 61 days from June 1 to July 31 along the west coast region will put the fishers in extreme distress. Though the same period was notified in 2020, the Centre later issued an order limiting the uniform fishing ban to 47 days. “Last time the annual ban started immediately after the fishing ban imposed by the government to check the spread of COVID-19. The sector suffered untold miseries during the two stretches of fishing ban,” said Joseph Xavier Kalapurackal, general secretary of the association. The boat operators are viewing the second wave of the pandemic with much apprehension and they believe that a second blow will completely destroy the sector. Another concern for the sector is the dip in the catch that points to a substantial depletion of marine resources. The association points out the hike in diesel price and restrictions imposed by importing companies due to the pandemic have also hit the sector. Fish migration According to them, the water currents in the sea underwent drastic changes due to the changing climatic condition and global warming, altering the migratory nature of fish. “It can be mitigated if fishing is permitted during the monsoon when fish resources in our sea are aplenty. The southern States of India experience abundance of fish during the monsoon,” they say. Limit to 30 days The association has appealed to the Centre to reduce the days of the monsoon ban to 30 so that the sector can tide over the crisis. It also requests the Centre to conduct a study on the propagation, migration and other related issues of marine resources as they feel that the report that backs the monsoon ban has become outdated. “Monsoon season is the only period when the fishing folk can profitably fish in the sea. Extending the period of ban to 61 days will push the community to abject poverty. There is no point in keeping the ban as a routine business,” they say.  Monsoon is the only period when fishing can be done profitably||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/boat-owners-seek-cut-in-trawl-ban-period/article34340749.ece

Vijayaraghavan critical of the Nair Service Society in the party organ Deshabhimani , NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair on Friday said the author appeared clearly unaware of the fact that the NSS, right from its inception, had extended maximum possible cooperation in matters relating to economic modernisation while also ensuring no room for communal forces. Mr. Nair said the article sought to proclaim that Kerala was the first State to implement 10% reservation for forward communities. Though the constitutional amendment enabling it came into existence in January 2019, it took the government nearly two years to make the necessary changes in the Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules. Lame excuses “At the same time, they should also hold a self-evaluation on whether they have actually implemented a system to ensure that the benefit of this reservation goes to the deserving,” he added. Though the government had dismissed the NSS’ lone demand to include Mannathu Padmanabhan’s birth anniversary as a holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act by citing lame excuses, the NSS had never sought to intervene in the affairs of this administration. To the accusation that Mr. Nair’s statement on Assembly election day triggered a discussion, the NSS general secretary said his response to a query posed by the media had nothing to do with politics or religion. “In fact, it was a statement by the Chief Minister [Pinarayi Vijayan] by connecting the issue to god that gave it a religious colour,” he said.

The action comes in the wake of a disturbing spike in the number of fresh cases and test positivity rates. District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao, who invoked prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) on Friday, also asked the District Police Chiefs of Kozhikode City and Rural to take stringent action if violations were noticed. Protocol violation The COVID-19 protocol was found violated in many places in the district, leading to a serious situation. The Collector has made it clear that no relaxations will be entertained except in case of emergencies. Based on the latest order, no place of worship will be permitted to facilitate any sort of gatherings other than the conduct of daily rituals, limiting the total number of participants to five. Sectoral magistrates earlier appointed by the district administration will carry out regular inspections in public places and ensure appropriate follow-up actions. Officials said the details of containment zones and other related alerts would be updated on a regular basis on the COVID-19 Jagratha portal.

The sleuths questioned him from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. regarding the sources of income that included his house, landed property and shares in realty investments, besides the details about the immoveable and moveable property of wife, Asha Shaji. On Thursday, the VACB had served a notice on him after the agency raided his houses in Kannur and Kozhikode districts. During the raids carried out on Monday and Tuesday, the VACB had seized unaccounted money totalling Rs. 47,35,500 and about 60 sovereigns of gold ornaments from his house in Kannur and 475 gm of gold ornaments, Rs. 30,000 and foreign currencies of various countries from his house in Kozhikode. Copy produced Mr. Shaji, it is learnt, told the investigators that he had received the cash as donations via mandalam committees of the party for electioneering. He produced a copy of the minutes of the party committee that sought to contribute money for the just-concluded Assembly polls. Sources said Mr. Shaji would be summoned again for questioning in the case. He had not produced any document or receipts that corroborated to the money received from the party committees.

Though the Health Department has confirmed that there is adequate stock of vaccines to meet the emergency need for two more days, many are apprehensive about the dwindling supplies. “We understand that only 50,000 more persons will be able to get their first shot in two days in Kozhikode district. It will be hardly sufficient to meet the actual demand,” said a health worker from Kodiyathur. He said the rush for vaccines amid the rising number of fresh COVID-19 cases would add to the worries of local bodies. Coordinators of the immunisation drive in some of the local bodies said they would be forced to reduce the number of previously planned vaccination campaigns. The available shots would be reserved for the most vulnerable segments such as senior citizens and people with various illnesses, they said. 3.69 lakh people In Kozhikode district, 3.69 lakh people have already received their first shots. The number of those who received their second shot is reportedly below 50,000.

For these National Service Scheme volunteers, the mission is to collect maximum quantity of scrap materials from households and mobilise money for building their third dream home for a landslip victim at Kattippara. Financial crisis is hardly a concern for these higher secondary school students as they have been dealing with it consistently by selling tea, hand sanitisers and masks for the poor. They have already built two “homes of love” and handed them over to two families in Kattippara “With the support of benefactors, our volunteers have already completed two houses, each worth Rs. 7 lakh. The new challenge is to mobilise another Rs. 7 lakh to construct one more such house for a needy woman,” says S. Sreechith, NSS District Coordinator, Kozhikode. He hopes that the students will be able to complete the task by the end of next month. Memories of Kattippara landslip, which took place in 2018 claiming 14 lives, are still haunting the villagers. Despite voluntary contributions from various organisations, individuals and the State government, the completion of the rehabilitation process continues to be challenging. The NSS team makes its entry with an aim to reach out to the worst-affected who have been knocking at doors for support. According to Mr. Sreechith, nearly 7,400 students under 144 NSS units are now part of the door-to-door scrap collection, which was launched two weeks ago. “They are getting a huge stock of old newspapers, plastic items and steel scrap. We are sure to mobilise the required fund within a week’s time,” he adds. NSS volunteers associated with the collection drive say they have already managed to mobilise Rs. 4 lakh for the new home by selling various products and saving some amount from the previous projects. “The remaining challenge is to make Rs. 3 lakh more by collecting scrap materials and we will make it happen,” they promise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/collecting-scrap-to-build-homes-of-love/article34340675.ece
17 April 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Minor parties may upset IUML calculations||The presence of the minor Muslim political parties such as the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and the Welfare Party of India (WPI) appears to be complicating the calculations of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in the just-concluded Assembly polls. Neither the SDPI nor the WPI is aligned with the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) or the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF). However, both these parties have vowed that their main purpose would be to defeat the BJP in their strongholds. The SDPI, the political wing of the Popular Front of India (PFI), has fielded 43 candidates while the WPI of the Jamaat Islami Hind, has fielded 19 candidates. However, the IUML leaders fear that the presence of the SDPI candidates might upset the calculations of the party in some of the Assembly constituencies in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. Traditional rivals Incidentally, they point out that they have no apprehension about its traditional rivals, the Indian National League (INL), a split away faction of the party. The IUML is in direct fight with the INL in the three seats the Left parties had allotted to that party, namely Kasaragod, Kozhikode South, and Vallikunnu Assembly segments. This is apart from two legislators of the defunct National Secular Conference, now contesting as LDF-backed independents in Koduvally and Kunnamangalam. The party has been maintaining a delicate balancing act even as the SDPI and the WPI have been showing an upsurge politically and electorally in recent times. Evidently, the party is also facing a continuous erosion in its support base. Campaign Despite its spirited campaigns and projecting itself as a voice of Muslims against radicalism, the IUML has not successfully won over the loyalty of the community in Central Travancore and southern districts. Another Muslim political entity, the People’s Democratic Party, is seemingly competent in highlighting issues concerning the Muslim community. Local body polls In the local body polls held in December 2020, the IUML secured 9.06 % of the popular votes. The share of the INL (0.66 %), SDPI (0.63 %), WPI (0.15%) and PDP (0.12 %) caused minimal damage to the IUML. However, the WPI had a tacit understanding with the UDF in many places in the polls which remained a controversial topic in the run-up to the Assembly polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/minor-parties-may-upset-iuml-calculations/article34340662.ece

The five-day religious ceremony will begin on Saturday. The organisers said here on Friday that it would be the first-ever yagnam based on the Atharva Veda to be held in the State. The special yagnam was being held with the purpose of bringing universal cure for diseases, including COVID-19. Three men belonging to the Nishad clan of Prayag in Uttar Pradesh were involved in the construction of the yagnam pandal. Satheesh Kumar Nishad, Arjun Kumar Nishad and Sonu Nishad erected the main yagasala in 30 ft length and width. The homakund is in the middle of the yagasala. Priests will be sitting in the four rooms at the four corners of the yagasala. The organisers said that the Nishads had been associated with the Kumbh Mela, and that it was their first attempt in Kerala. According to Satheesh Kumar, the Atharva Veda Yagnam would be starkly different from the usual yagas. He said no iron or plastic was used for the construction of the yagasala. Instead, jute, coir, bamboo and palm leaves were used. He said that palm leaves were used to substitute grass.

17 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||With cases surging, more FLTCs to be opened||The city Corporation is set to open more COVID -19 first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) with the sharp increase over the past few days in the number of positive cases in the district as well as in the number of those requiring more than just home quarantining. At present, the civic body is operating five such centres in the city, with three of them being first-line treatment centres and two of them being secondary treatment centres, which have doctors as well as other equipment. The FLTCs which had very low occupancy for months had witnessed the entry of more people in recent weeks, with the occupancy reaching up to 50% by last week. However, on Friday, Corporation officials said the occupancy levels had crossed 80% with the positive cases in the district jumping to 800, from around 500 in the previous day. The Corporation’s FLTCs are located at the Institute of Management in Governance near PMG, shooting range at Vattiyurkavu, and a centre at Manvila. The secondary care centres are at the Homeo Hospital at Iranimuttam and at the Railway Hospital in Pettah. Across the five centres, 374 beds are available, out of which 309 were filled by Friday. Last year’s figures “The Corporation will be opening more FLTCs considering the increase in the number of positive cases in recent days. Though more people prefer to get quarantined at home, quite a few are coming from nearby panchayats too,” Thiruvananthapuram Corporation Secretary Binu Francis told The Hindu . In the initial days of COVID-19 outbreak last year, the Corporation had opened eight FLTCs and 34 institutional quarantine centres. The Corporation had also appointed its staff, including junior health inspectors, as charge officers in the FLTCs in three shifts of eight hours each. In addition, cleaning staff were also deployed at a rate of one for every 10 beds. However, with the positive cases reducing and with quarantining protocols becoming less stringent, many of these were closed down. Disinfection The Corporation has also decided to step up disinfection activities, with teams employed last year for the purposes being activated again. Another team has been formed for enforcement of COVID-19 protocols including physical distancing, wearing of masks and prevention of crowding. Public announcements will be made in wards on the importance of following all the protocols. The Corporation had also planned to support the vaccination drive with activities at 25 separate centres. However, this has been put on hold temporarily considering the non-availability of vaccines from the Union government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-cases-surging-more-fltcs-to-be-opened/article34341284.ece
17 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State may soon go past peak of first pandemic wave||The unprecedented pace of COVID-19 transmission in Kerala in the second wave might see the State going past the peak of the first epidemic curve this week itself, public health experts say. When the State hit the first peak on October 24, 2020, the active case pool had 97,417 patients. The second wave has seen the State’s case graph rise steadily since March 23, when the active case pool had 23,883 patients. On Friday, in a space of 24 days, this has increased to 69,868 cases. One of the biggest advantages the State had during the first peak was that the case levels were well within the health system’s surge capacity. However, if the current pace of disease transmission continues, the State could be looking at an extremely challenging situation of its hospitals running out of beds and ICUs for patients. Already, the number of hospitalisations and deaths have been going up and ICUs are getting filled, doctors say. TPR rises to 14.8% On Friday, the number of new cases reported touched 10,031, to take the cumulative case burden to 12,07,332. In the past 24 hours, 67,775 samples were tested and the test positivity rate has risen to 14.8%. The active case pool has 69,868 patients, with two districts having over 10,000 active cases. Kozhikode has 10,269 patients, while Ernakulam has 10,132 active cases. Kannur is close behind with 7,190 patients. With 3,792 recoveries being reported on the day, the cumulative recoveries touched 11,32,267. New hospital admissions rose to 1,611.  The addition of 21 new deaths which took place in the past few days to the official list took the State’s cumulative toll to 4,877. Ernakulam reported six deaths, Kozhikode five, Kottayam three, Thiruvananthapuram and Malappuram two each, while one death each was reported from Thrissur, Palakkad and Kannur. The number of critically ill patients who are being treated in ICUs spiralled from 699 on Thursday to 744 on Friday, according to reports. The number of patients requiring ventilator assistance has also risen to 221. Among districts, Kozhikode reported the maximum number of cases at 1,560, followed by Ernakulam 1,391, Malappuram 882, Kottayam 780, Thiruvananthapuram 750, Alappuzha 745, Thrissur 737, Kannur 673, Kasaragod 643, Palakkad 514, Kollam 454, Wayanad 348, Idukki 293 and Pathanamthitta 261.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-may-soon-go-past-peak-of-first-pandemic-wave/article34340776.ece

17 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Space festival draws to a close||‘Let’s Go,’ a 16-day space festival to mark the 60th anniversary of the first space flight by Yuri Gagarin concluded in the capital on Thursday. The event featured seminars, exhibitions, competitions, film screenings, get-together of people named Gagarin and releasing of postal stamp to commemorate the event. Former chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation and former Secretary, Department of Space, G. Madhavan Nair inaugurated the closing ceremony of the festival at Russian House. ‘Crucial for future’ Dr. Nair said the world had reached a stage where it cannot move further without depending on space science. “Our future is based on the development of space science and technology. The Soviet Union knew the advantage of space science and contributed greatly to its development,” he said. Yuri Gagarin’s space flight marked a significant footstep in space exploration. Even today, Dr. Nair said, the re-entry phase of a mission remained the biggest challenge. It is the make or break moment, the time when the satellites burn up. Despite the challenges, Yuri Gagarin agreed to fly to outer space. His mission became an inspiration for the scientific community, the former ISRO chief said. Guest of honour, Air Marshal (Rtd.) T.P. Madhusudanan, in his address, said Yuri Gagarin became the first man to see the beauty of earth from space. That moment was an achievement not only for science, but for the entire humanity. Former Deputy Director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, C.R. Thomas presented a report on the contests and seminars held as part of the festival. Honorary Consul of the Russian Federation and Director of Russian House Ratheesh C. Nair presented a report on the festival. Kavitha Nair, Assistant Director of Russian House, introduced the winners.

17 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Four arrested in Pallipuram gold heist||One week after a gang of armed assailants robbed a jewellery outlet owner of nearly 100 sovereigns of gold at Pallipuram, the Thiruvananthapuram Rural police recorded the arrest of three people allegedly involved in the attack and one person who allegedly aided them in selling the gold. The police also recovered some of the gold from them. The accused have been identified as Ansar, 28, and Nebin, 28, from Perumathura, Faisal, 24, from Andoorkonam and Perumathura-native Noufal, who helped them sell the gold.  The police recovered 13 bangles, 7 rings and 4 earrings and an amount of Rs. 73,500, from the accused. One of the cars used in the robbery was also recovered. Attingal Deputy Superintendent of Police (Dy.SP) C.S. Hari told The Hindu that the police had been scouring the CCTV visuals and mobile signals from the area in which the crime happened. This pointed to the involvement of a local gang who had a clear idea of the topography. “While verifying multiple CCTV footage from the locality, we realised that the perpetrators knew almost all the bylanes in the area, through which they plotted their escape after the crime. Only a local gang would have such an understanding of the bylanes. So, over the past few days, we have been tracking the history-sheeters in the area and questioning some of them. We noticed the absence of some of them from the area just after this incident happened. After a few rounds of questioning, we zeroed in on these three,” said Mr. Hari. Search for mastermind The police are on the lookout for the others involved in the robbery as well as the person who masterminded the crime, which the police suspect to be someone who had a clear idea of the itinerary of the jeweller. The robbery happened at Pallipuram on last Friday night, with a gang of 10 travelling in two cars waylaying the Sampath Surve, a jeweller from Maharashtra, and his driver Arun. The incident occurred when they were on their way to deliver the gold ornaments from a jewellery outlet in Neyyattinkara to another in Attingal. After breaking the windshield of their car, the gang allegedly hurled chilli powder on them before slashing Sampath’s hand using a machete and stealing the gold. Arun, who was also attacked, was dragged into a cars and later abandoned near a temple 5 km away. The case took an unexpected turn when the investigation team recovered Rs. 75 lakh in unaccounted cash from the jeweller. Mr. Sampath had apparently handed over the cash, kept in a concealed chamber in the car, to a relative in Attingal before alerting the police of the burglary. The cash was seized after the relative who figured in the complainant’s call detail record around the time of the crime was questioned.  They knew almost all the bylanes, through which they escaped after the crime. Only a local gang would have such an understanding of the topography C.S.

In their complaint, R.S. Sasikumar and M. Shajirkhan, chairman and secretary of the forum, accused the university authorities of violating the model code of conduct by issuing call letters to shortlisted candidates to appear for an online interview for the post of assistant professor at the UGC - Human Resource Development Centre. The call letters were issued at a notice of less than one week, when UGC norms mandated such intimations should be issued well in advance to provide candidates sufficient time to prepare for interviews, they alleged. MLA’s wife The organisation also alleged efforts were being made to appoint Shahala, wife of A.N. Shamseer, MLA, by subverting selection norms and overlooking meritorious candidates. Similar efforts had earlier been made by the same university as well as the University of Calicut, it claimed. Nepotism charges The complainants sought the Governor’s intervention to prevent such political interference and instances of nepotism. The selection process must also be put on hold until the lifting of the model code of conduct, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/forum-alleges-irregularities-in-varsity-appointment-process/article34340673.ece
17 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M) leader accuses NSS of jettisoning political neutrality||The CPI(M) on Friday accused Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair of abandoning the organisation's long-established line of political neutrality to embrace a brazenly anti-Left position on the crucial Assembly election day on April 6. In an op-ed page article in the party organ Deshabhimani , CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said Mr. Nair had played second fiddle to the communally divisive powers that sought votes in the name of religion. The election results on May 2 would reveal that the Nair community had rejected the NSS leader's political pitch and aligned overwhelmingly with the Left Democratic Front (LDF), Mr. Vijayaraghavan wrote. Class struggle He said the CPI(M) had never adopted a confrontational approach to caste organisations. The party viewed events through the lens of class struggle and not caste or religion. Mr. Nair should introspect on how the neo-liberal economic policies of the extreme-right BJP at the Centre would adversely impact the working class in his community. He should remember that NSS founder Mannathu Padmanabhan had fought caste oppression and medieval social practices, Mr. Vijayaraghavan said. Working class members of the Nair community were with the Left. They would correct Mr. Nair's anti-Left political line. The LDF had implemented 10% reservation for economically hard-pressed forward caste communities. It had viewed NSS demands sympathetically. The CPI(M) was not against any caste organisations. Social organisations had their unique role in society. However, they should not overstep their constitutional bounds, he said.  Working class members of the Nair community are with the LeftA.

The airline is using its 25 international departures daily from across the country for export of agri-produce. It is also chartering some of the 24 flights in its fleet as ‘cargo-only’ to ship fruits and vegetables, the most sought-after items among the Non-Resident Indians. AIE flights with 12 tonnes of cargo took off from the Cochin airport on April 15, while another one with 13 tonnes flew from the Calicut airport on Friday. On an average, three tonnes of cargo is being lifted in scheduled flights. The daily shipment of 70 to 75 tonnes is also fetching valuable foreign exchange as cargo flights of foreign carriers are yet to be given the nod by the Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to fly to Indian airports. Shipment costs, which hovered around Rs. 150 to Rs. 175 per kg when AIE intervened in April last year to ensure export of agri-produce to West Asia in cargo and passenger cabins of its repatriation flights, has dropped to Rs. 50 to Rs. 90 per kg this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/air-india-express-scales-up-daily-cargo-operations/article34340760.ece

17 April 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Flags to be hoisted for Pooram today||Amid apprehensions over the conduct of Thrissur Pooram during the second wave of the pandemic, Thiruvambadi and Paramekkavu Devaswoms, the main organisers of the Pooram, and eight other participating temples will hoist festival flags on Saturday. Kodiyettu of Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi will be held in the forenoon. Percussion ensembles and elephant parades will add colour to the flag-hoisting ceremony. As the Pooram festivities began, the district administration has strengthened the COVID-19 protocols. Testing camps More COVID-19 testing camps have opened in the district. In all 21,400 tests will be held in the next two days. As part of strengthening vigil against the spread of the pandemic, COVID sentinels have been appointed in all local bodies. As COVID-19-negative certificate has been made mandatory for visiting the venues of Pooram, the district will need more test kits. Seeks more kits The Health Department has already written to the government demanding more kits. The district administration will conduct free RT-PCR tests for 1,600 people who participate in the processions of cheru poorams (ceremonies of eight participating temples other than Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi temples). People who want to enjoy all the festivities right from sample fireworks on April 21 to end of the Pooram on April 24 might need to take two RT-PCR tests as RT-PCR tests taken just three days before the event only will be valid. Poor occupancy Meanwhile lodges and hotels in Thrissur city, which used to be full months before the Pooram event, have not filled even a week before the Pooram. Panic over the second wave of the pandemic and confusion over the conduct of the Pooram are the major reasons. Admission will be given to people who produce COVID-19-negative certificates and vaccination certificates, according to hotel managements. Some hotels have closed online bookings.  Flag hoisting of Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi temples will be held in the forenoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/flags-to-be-hoisted-for-pooram-today/article34340653.ece

While there are eight monuments in Telangana, there are 129 monuments/museums/forts or temples controlled by it in A.P. Director of Monuments N.K. Pathak, working at the ASI New Delhi office, said that a decision on reopening them will be taken on or before May 15, depending on the situation at the time, and fresh orders would be issued. With the new order coming into force, the Bugga Ramalingeswara Swamy temple and Chintala Venkataramana temple at Tadipatri in Anantapur district were closed to devotees on Friday. On a side note, the number of devotees thronging other temples, under the control of the Endowments Department, is still large. Recently, many people were seen at the Srisailam temple and Kadiri Rathotsavams with most of them reportedly giving a go-by to COVID-appropriate behaviour. 313 new cases The ditrict reported 313 new cases in the last 24 hours taking the cumulative tally to 70,728.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/all-temples-monuments-under-control-of-asi-closed-in-ap-ts/article34340437.ece

17 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chittoor leads State with 1,024 COVID cases||Chittoor district’s daily count of COVID-19 cases touched 1,024 on Friday, the highest since September last year. While Tirupati municipal corporation and surrounding areas saw 424 cases, Chittoor Corporation reported 77, Srikalahasti and Punganur municipalities 40 and 37 cases respectively. The virus prevalence, which remained limited to around a dozen mandals till the beginning of the month, has now spread to 61 out of 66 mandals in the district, with the areas bordering Karnataka and Tamil Nadu accounting for most of the new cases. The rise of COVID cases in Bengaluru and Chennai has its impact on Chittoor district as hundreds of traders and vendors keep travelling to these two busy destinations. In May last year too, the district saw an unprecedented rise when Koyambedu market in Chennai became a hotbed of new infections. District Medical and Health Officer M. Penchalaiah, alarmed over the growing incidence, said that the spread was 60% in the urban areas, followed by 40% in the rural belt. “Though we had seen the daily count of over 1,400 cases in the district in August last year, Friday’s number of 1,024 remains the highest in the second wave period since one month. Our top priority is to monitor patients under home isolation, besides tracking the primary and secondary contacts,” Dr Penchalaiah said. The second wave impact has once again led to fall in the occupancy rate not only in the APSRTC bus services, but also in the express trains passing through Chittoor district, towards Chennai, Bengaluru and Vijayawada. The share-autos, which ply in large numbers on both National Highways towards Nagari and Nagalapuram, have mostly gone off the road, with gradual cut in the number of passengers. The public transport in the western mandals towards Karnataka has also started seeing poor occupancy in buses and autorickshaws. Hundreds of passengers of the western mandals generally travel to Chintamani, Kolar and Bengaluru from Madanapalle, B.Kothakota, Kuppam and Palamaner depots. ‘Announce holidays’ Meanwhile, with a spurt in COVID-19 cases, government schools have appealed to the State government to announce holidays for students of I to VIII classes till the situation came under control. As students of all classes are attending schools, the number of classrooms has been found to be grossly insufficient to follow physical distancing. Earlier, the schools accommodated just sixteen students in a classroom, leaving the academic schedule to the respective headmasters, to be followed in tune with the prevailing local conditions. The Chittoor district unit of Andhra Pradesh Head Masters Association (APHMA) submitted a representation to Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh and Director of School Education urging the Minister to consider reopening the schools by June 12, by which time they expected the cases to see a dip. The association also requested the Minister to hand over to the local body the responsibility of sanitising the classrooms in all schools under their purview.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chittoors-new-high-of-1024-cases-sets-alarm-bells-ringing/article34341211.ece
17 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Crematoria see more arrivals in Telangana||With the COVID-19 pandemic raising its hood again through the second wave of infections, the number of deaths have also been on the rise. While the Telangana government’s latest health bulletins show not more than eight deaths per day, reports from the ground vouch that the number could be several times higher. Reliable sources informed that the death toll has reached about 20 per day at the Gandhi Hospital alone, while bodies reaching a single crematorium at ESI have risen to 12. Thankfully, there is no pile-up of bodies at one place, because the stigma associated with the cremation/burial of COVID-19 bodies has waned over time. During the first wave of the pandemic last year, residents of localities around major city graveyards vehemently objected to the bodies of COVID-deceased persons being brought there for cremation/burial. Due to this, the bodies had to be secretly sent to an undisclosed location in Sanathnagar, where several pyres were kept ready, and bodies were burnt 24x7. The government had constituted a special committee to monitor the protocol for carrying out the funerals, and hospitals, both public and private, were asked to designate liaison officers to ensure that the protocol was adhered to. GHMC officials facilitated cremation/burial of patients dying in Gandhi Hospital. Voluntary organisations and philanthropists also pitched in, ensuring that all the bodies received decent last rites. The situation this year is not so grave when it comes to availability of space. Officials informed that bodies from the government hospitals are being given funeral rites at crematoria in Amberpet, Bansilalpet, Jubilee Hills, ESI and occasionally at Punjagutta. Bodies from private hospitals are being directed to the cremation grounds at Sanathnagar. The number of bodies each day has been on the steady rise for the last one month, they say. No track is kept of the deaths in private hospitals and at homes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/crematoria-see-more-arrivals-in-telangana/article34340436.ece
17 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Dr. Reddy’s Lab runs out of Remdesivir stock||Drugmaker Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories has said that it has run out of stock of Remdesivir, the anti-viral injection used in the treatment of COVID- and whose demand has surged in the face of a deadlier second wave of the pandemic sweeping the country. “Currently we are out of stock for Remdesivir. We will regularly update the website (https://www.readytofightcovid.in/) as we get new batches of stocks,” the company tweeted on Thursday night. It followed a release on April 14 in which the company said it was “making every effort to ensure Remdesivir [which it sells] under the brand name Redyx reaches as many patients in India, as possible”. “We are ramping up production... also reduced MRP by 50% so that price is not a barrier to access,” it had said. Market situation on supplies is expected to ease in the next few weeks, said Dr.Reddy’s, which has set up the website to update real-time city-wise availability of Redyx at stockists and hospitals. Dr. Reddy’s is among the clutch of companies in India that have licensing agreements with US firm Gilead Sciences to make Remdesivir. The drug is in high demand amid a steep increase in the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks. Relatives of several patients are seeking information on social media regarding Remdesivir availability. Following a review of the situation undertaken by Union Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers Mansukh Mandaviya with Remdesivir manufacturers and other stakeholders, the Centre said it has been decided to increase production/supply and reduce prices of Remdesivir. An official release on Thursday said seven manufacturers make Remdesivir in the country and the total installed capacity is 38.80 lakh vials per month. Fast-track approval has been given for seven additional sites having the production capacity of 10 lakh vials /month to six manufacturers. Another 30 lakh vials/month production has been lined up. These measures would ramp up the production to around 78 lakh vials/month. Manufacturers have been were directed to accord priority to fulfil hospital/institutional level supplies. Enforcement authorities of State and Central governments were directed by DCGI to take immediate action on incidence of black-marketing, hoarding and overcharging of Remdesivir, the release had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dr-reddys-laboratories-runs-out-of-remdesivir-stock/article34341098.ece
17 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Feed people during Ramadan: TS HC to officer||Feed at least 20 people a day during the breaking of fast in the evening at a mosque for one week, the Telangana High Court instructed a top government officer on Friday waiving the fine imposed on him for contempt of court. Mahabubnagar district Prohibition and Excise Deputy Commissioner in-charge Syed Yasin Quereshi has to go to any mosque near his residence in Banjara Hills and feed persons breaking the fast in the evening during Ramadan month, the HC said. The order was pronounced by a Bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy in lieu of punishment of fine imposed on him by a single judge for disobeying the HC order. “We are not monitoring you….we trust you… File an affidavit of compliance of feeding people,” the CJ said adjudicating the contempt appeal filed by the officer. When the appeal was heard last time, Additional Advocate General J. Ramachandra Rao assured the court that the officer would file an additional affidavit why there was delay in releasing a vehicle despite the single judge order. Perusing the affidavit filed by Mr. Quereshi on Friday, the CJ said the officer did not tender an unconditional apology. “It is an unqualified apology for non-compliance of the single judge order,” the CJ remarked wondering why cannot the officer pay the fine if it did not affect his service record. The CJ said that Mr. Quereshi did not explain why he imposed additional condition of furnishing two sureties to release the vehicle. The officer conceded in his affidavit that no steps were taken to enforce the single judge order. Raising these points, the CJ noted that the court had reservations entertaining the contempt appeal. Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy suggested that the officer can do some social service instead of paying the fine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/feed-people-during-ramadan-hc-to-officer/article34341114.ece

17 April 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Fousiya set to renew legal battle||The Supreme Court order asking the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to look into the D.K. Jain Commission report on the Kerala Police framing space scientists in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) espionage case has rekindled hopes of justice for Fousiya Hasan, the Maldivian woman who was imprisoned in Kerala for three years in the case. “Though I had engaged a lawyer in India to file the case, it had to be put off following the pandemic,” Ms. Hasan told The Hindu from Sri Lanka. After learning about the Supreme Court order, Ms. Hasan said she would discuss the developments with her lawyer in India. She had earlier announced her decision to seek compensation from India for her illegal custody and the torture she suffered at the hands of the police. The police had picked her along with Mariam Rasheeda, another Maldivian, on charges of espionage three decades ago. “I don’t know the names of the police officers who assaulted me. I don’t remember those details now. They kicked and slapped me on my face and back. They pricked my fingers and toes. They wanted me to confess that I paid ISRO scientists Nambi Narayanan and Sasikumar money and smuggled out the secrets,” she said. “Besides assaulting me, the police destroyed my life and also that of my daughter. Her studies were disrupted. She was shocked by the police action,” she said. The 79-year-old woman does not know when justice would be delivered. “I don’t have much hope left now. It has been a long wait for nearly 30 years without any compensation. I am in another country and the case will take time to complete. It may take months and months in courts. I know the court procedures,” said Ms. Hasan about the legal hurdles that she had to clear before claiming the compensation. “I can’t walk properly and I am unable to stand for long,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fousiya-set-to-renew-legal-battle/article34340441.ece
17 April 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala HC allows women to work in the night as well||The Kerala High Court has observed that a woman who is a qualified hand for a job cannot be denied it on the grounds of her gender and that the job requires her to work at night. Justice Anu Sivaraman made the observation on Friday while allowing a petition filed by Treasa Josefine of Kollam, an engineering graduate in Safety and Fire Engineering against the notification issued by the Kerala Minerals and Metals Ltd (KMML), Kollam, stipulating that only male candidates need apply for the post of a safety officer in the company. The court found that the notification was in violation of the provisions of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India. Government duty The court observed that "it is the bounden duty of the governments and government functionaries to take all appropriate steps to see that a woman is able to carry out the duties assigned to her at all hours, safely and conveniently. If that be so, there would be no reason for denying appointment to a qualified hand only on the ground that she is a woman and because the nature of the employment would require her to work during night hours.” The court added that women had been engaged in several professions requiring round-the-clock employment and had proved themselves quite capable of facing the challenges of such engagement. KMML stand The KMML took the stand that according to Section 66(1)(b) of the Factories Act, 1948, women employees shall not be required or permitted to work except between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. The safety officer’s was a round-the-clock post and that the person engaged so would have to work even at night time. Earlier verdict The court pointed out that a Division Bench had earlier held that Section 66(1)(b) was a beneficial provision and did not provide a bar against employment of women. The court directed the KMML to consider the application submitted by the petitioner for appointment to the post of safety officer.  Notification issued by KMML, Kollam, is in violation of the provisions of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-hc-allows-women-to-work-in-the-night-as-well/article34340439.ece

An additional 500 polling stations were created to ensure that no polling station had more than 1,000 voters against 1,500 voters under normal condition, the Collector said. Polling would start at 7 a.m. after mock polling an hour before. About 23 companies of central para-military forces and three companies of APSP personnel would provide fool-proof security. “The poll timing is extended by two hours till 7 p.m. to avoid overcrowding at the polling stations at any given point of time and keeping in view the prevailing heatwave condition in the Assembly segments of Sarvepalli, Gudur, Sullurpeta and Venkatagiri in Nellore district and Srikalahasti, Satyaveedu and Tirupati in Chittoor district,” he said. In all the polling stations, video recording would be done. Webcasting would be done in 1,241 critical polling stations to ensure transparancy, he said after visiting some of the polling stations. The Collector appealed to the voters to make use of the Booth App of the Election Commission of India to download the digital voter slip and know the queue status at any given point of time to minimise their waiting time. Those above 80 years and the differently-abled could make use of the mobile polling booth facility to vote. As many as 497 service voters could vote online, he said. Special arrangements have been made for the COVID-19 patients and those with suspected symptoms to vote in the elections. They will be provided with PPE kits at the polling station. ‘ID proof must’ Maintaining that the voter slips would not be considered as ID proof, he asked the voters to come with any of the ECI recognised ID cards to exercise their franchise.

17 April 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Nine ‘murders’ in a day shock people in City of Destiny||Never in the modern history of Visakhapatnam that the City of Destiny witnessed so many deaths by murder in one single day, which it had done on Thursday. The city was jolted from its slumber, as the news spread that a 49-year-old man allegedly hacked six members of a family, including two children and three women, with a hunting scythe at Juttada village of Pendurthy mandal on the outskirts of the city, in the wee hours of Thursday. This was followed by reports streaming in that the eldest son of a four-member family had allegedly killed his parents and younger brother and has set the flat on fire, in which they were living at Midhilapuri in PM Palem area. Even the accused in this case was also found dead. “We had at least nine confirmed cases of alleged murder, only the cause of death of the accused in the Midhilapuri case is to be confirmed, whether it was a suicide or asphyxia due to smoke or any other reason. But nine alleged murders on a single day, has never happened in our city so far,” said an ACP rank officer. “The last time that we had multiple murders in the city was some time in early 1990s, when a mentally-challenged person had killed three other inmates at the Government Hospital of Mental Care,” said former Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Mahendra Patrudu, who served in the city for over three decades. “What makes the Pendurthi murder case even unique, is that it was a ‘avenge killing’. The accused Battina Apalaraju had hacked the six members of the family to avenge the alleged rape of his daughter,” said Pendurthi Inspector Ashok Kumar. Though the Forensic Department at KGH had bodies in more numbers on a single day in past, this was for the first time in the history of the department that it had received 10 bodies (at least nine murders) on a single day from the city. In past, bodies due to accidents have piled up at the mortuary, as in the case of HCPL vapour cloud explosion in 1997 that left about 60 dead, VSP Oxygen plant blast in 2012 (19 dead), LG Polymer styrene vapour leak in 2020 (12 dead), but not so many murders. The last time the mortuary received 12 civilian bodies with bullet wounds was on November 1, 1966, when they were killed in police action during the steel plant agitation. In 2008, the bodies of 38 Greyhounds commandos who were killed in the Balimela attack were shifted to the mortuary. But they were all accidents or deaths occurred during confirmed police or Naxal action. Post-mortem in a murder case is different from the rest and it needs more detailed examination, despite the case being an established one, said Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar. This has put the Forensic Department under pressure, as on one hand the department is entrusted with the conduct of the MBBS examination and on the other they had about 10 high-profile murder case post-mortems. A six-member team was deputed to work in shifts to handle it. Meanwhile across city, especially those who have been living in the city for years and have made it their home, were perturbed with the days development. Such a happening is not in tune with the peaceful fabric of the city, said Dr. Sudhakar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nine-murders-in-a-day-shock-people-in-city-of-destiny/article34340493.ece

17 April 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Announce holidays for students of classes I to VIII, govt. urged||With a spurt in COVID-19 cases, government schools have appealed to the State government to announce holidays for students of I to VIII classes till the situation came under control. As students of all classes are attending schools, the number of classrooms has been found to be grossly insufficient to follow physical distancing.  Representation submitted Earlier, the schools accommodated just sixteen students in a classroom, leaving the academic schedule to the respective headmasters, to be followed in tune with the prevailing local conditions. The Chittoor district unit of Andhra Pradesh Head Masters Association (APHMA) submitted a representation to Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh and Director of School Education urging the Minister to consider reopening the schools by June 12, by which time they expected the cases to see a dip. Plea to Minister The association also requested the Minister to hand over to the local body the responsibility of sanitising the classrooms in all schools under their purview.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/announce-holidays-for-students-of-classes-i-to-viii-govt-urged/article34341214.ece
17 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘State cannot afford another lockdown’||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said that vaccination is the only remedy for COVID-19, but the State government is facing a severe constraint in immunising the vulnerable people due to shortage of vaccine. The Central government was requested to despatch additional doses to expand the vaccination programme, while taking all possible steps to check the spread of the virus, the Chief Minister said while addressing a video-conference with the District Collectors and Superintendents of Police on COVID-19 management and vaccination on Friday. The daily production of vaccines in the country stood at seven crore, but the number of doses was about 23 lakh. “Since the Central government has control over the production and supply of vaccines, the State is asking it to replenish the stocks in order to protect the masses from the pandemic,” Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said. Positivity rate He said while the positivity rate was 6.03%, the recovery rate stood at 96.19%. The positivity rate climbed to 7.77% between December 2020 and April 2021. The recovery rate at the national level was 88.90%. Of the cumulative number of 1.55 crore tests done so far, 9.37 lakh turned out to be positive. The infection and positivity rates were alarming in Chittoor, Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Krishna, Guntur and Nellore districts, he said. The Chief Minister said the State could not afford to impose lockdown again due to its devastating impact on the economy. He called for emphasis on focussed testing (checking if the primary contacts of infected persons contracted the virus) and voluntary testing to control the pandemic. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy observed that though the positivity rate was high in cities and towns, the number of deaths was more in villages as patients either neglected their condition, or had no easy accessibility to hospitals. This should be kept in view and necessary action taken, he told the officials. ‘Ramp up bed strength’ Asking the Collectors and SPs to keep a close watch on the situation as the second wave was quite serious, the Chief Minister ordered that the number of beds in COVID-19 hospitals be increased to 50,000 so as to handle the rush of patients. He also asked them to ensure that there was no dearth of oxygen. “If there is no space for patients to be in home isolation, they should be sent to care centres,” he said. The Chief Minister also wanted that enough stocks of Remdesivir injections and other medicines be maintained in the hospitals. He also directed the officials to take action against the hospitals exploiting the patients. All the health and frontline workers should be vaccinated with top priority, he said, while cautioning the officials against wasting the vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-cannot-afford-another-lockdown/article34341224.ece
17 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kakarla Subba Rao, renowned radiologist, passes away||Renowned radiologist and former Director of Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad Dr. Kakarla Subba Rao passed away while undergoing treatment at Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Secunderabad in the wee hours of Friday. He was 96. Dr. Rao was admitted to KIMS a month ago with age-related health complications. The doctors at the hospital said he breathed his last in the early hours of Friday. Known for his efforts to transform NIMS into a super-speciality hospital, Dr. Rao was its first director between 1985 and 1990 and later between 1997 and 2004, before retiring. Dr. Rao was born on 25 January, 1925 in a middle-class agricultural family at Pedamuttevi, a small village in Krishna district. After completing his MBBS from Andhra Medical College in 1950, he did his Residency from the U.S. He was a Professor of Radiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, before returning to India in 1985-86. Responding to a call of the late Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao, he joined NIMS and strived towards its development into a highly specialised hospital. In recognition to his valuable contributions in the field of medicine, the Government of India honoured him with a Padma Shri in 2000. Dr. Rao was the founder president of Telugu Association of North America (TANA), an umbrella organisation for Telugu speaking people in the United States. Condolences pour in TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu said Dr. Rao’s demise was an “irrevocable loss”, especially to the Telugu population. Recalling Dr. Rao’s exemplary services as a radiologist and as the Director of NIMS for over five decades, Mr. Naidu said Rao’s passion to serve took him to great heights. MLA and Chairman and Managing Director of Basavatarakam Indo-American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute Nandamuri Balakrishna said Dr. Rao was an educationalist, eminent radiologist and philanthropist who touched thousands of lives with his compassion and empathy. He fondly recalled the active role played by Dr. Rao in taking the hospital and the research institute to a respectable place in the country, both in terms of access and affordability. “His demise has left a void and it is an irreplaceable loss to our institute,” he said. Dr. P. Raghu Ram, Director, KIMS-Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast Diseases, Hyderabad, said he lost a close family friend. “Dr. Rao was my role model, guide and philosopher for over 36 years from the day I joined medical school. When I was in a dilemma, over whether or not to relocate to India in 2007, he was the first person I sought an opinion from. He said people would not like it when you introduce radical changes, and that too at a young age. He advised me to withstand the pressures and stay grounded and fulfil your ambition, as there would be no place on earth sweeter than one’s motherland. From that day onwards, over the past 14 years, whenever I needed advice, he was just a phone call away, always supporting and encouraging me,” he said. “It is really sad that he has left us. He hailed from a village in Krishna district here and went on to work for the government and extended yeoman service to the country,” said K. Pattabhi Ramaiah, general surgeon, Kamineni Clinic, Vijayawada.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/noted-radiologist-kakarla-subba-rao-passes-away/article34340490.ece

Thulasi Reddy on Friday said Special Category Status (SCS) would act as a panacea for all the problems ailing the State. In a statement, he said only the Congress could achieve SCS for the State, which is why it was necessary for the party to win the Tirupati Lok Sabha by-elections. SCS row He said the BJP, in its election manifesto, had promised to implement SCS for Andhra Pradesh for 10 years if voted to power. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had given his word to the people of the State during his election meeting in Tirupati, reneged on it citing the 14th Finance Commission as an excuse. The senior Congress leader said that even during the recent elections in Puducherry, the BJP promised to grant Special Category Status to that State if the party was voted to power. The party had been resorting to ‘politics of opportunism’, said Mr. Thulasi Reddy, adding that a BJP victory in Tirupati by-polls would mean denial of SCS to A.P. He said the last seven years had proved that it was beyond the capacity of regional parties like the TDP or the YSR Congress Party to bring SCS to the State. Thus, there was a historic need for the Congress to win the Tirupati by-elections, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congress-alone-can-bring-scs-to-state/article34340491.ece

17 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Former official faults CBI for not taking into account intelligence report on Vivekananda Reddy’s murder||The former Director-General, Intelligence, A.B. Venkateswara Rao, has appealed to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to collect the intelligence report on former minister and Member of Parliament Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy’s murder case. The former MP was found in a pool of blood in his house in Pulivendula in Kadapa district on the night of March 14, 2019. Rumours spread that Mr. Reddy, brother of former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajashekara Reddy, died of cardiac arrest, and also as an accidental death (caused due to fall in bathroom). However, doctors confirmed that injuries were found on the body which caused the death. The local police registered a case and later it was transferred to Crime Investigation Department (CID) and to the Special Investigation Team (SIT). Following a writ petition filed by the victim’s family members, the case was handed over to CBI in March last year. Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter Sunitha expressed concern over the slow pace of investigation and for not booking the culprits responsible for her father’s death. In a letter to the CBI Director and the Joint Director, Mr. Venkateswara Rao said the AP Intelligence Department deployed its personnel to gather information on the same day of the crime, which was shared with the investigators. “An Intelligence head constable and a home guard visited the spot, even before the local police reached the scene of offence, to gather information on the death. But, they were not allowed inside the house by the family members, including an MP,” Mr. Venkateswara Rao said. “A few months later, I contacted the CBI officer, who is monitoring the investigation of Mr. Vivekananda Reddy’s murder case over phone and tried to share the information on the sensational case. The CBI official said he will take the information for the Intelligence sleuths, but there was no response. I contacted the officer twice, but there was no action,” Mr. Venkateswara Rao said. “It was surprising that the CBI team, which was probing the murder case, has not taken any interest when an officer of the rank of DGP, who served as DG, Intelligence, at the time of the occurrence of crime, came forward to give information to solve the sensational case, which was still unsolved,” the senior police officer said. Mr. Venkateswara Rao appealed to the CBI to collect the file from Intelligence Department on the former MP’s murder and examine the officers concerned, to solve the case at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/collect-intel-report-on-viveka-murder-case/article34340445.ece

Motorists are making no secret of their displeasure on social media. A delay of a few days to a couple of weeks in the dispatch of the DL smart cards is understandable. But it has been nearly eight months since we have been waiting for the receipt of our driving licences, say applicants. On an average, around 600 DL cards are issued by the Transport Department in Visakhapatnam district, with a major chunk of the applicants hailing from the city. A doctor from Sector-V, MVP Colony, who applied for the renewal of his driving licence (DL) several months ago, is yet to get his smart card. There are hundreds of applicants for fresh DLs and renewal, who are waiting to receive their cards. Dr. G. Hanumantha Rao had applied online for renewal of his licence about six months ago, but is yet to get it delivered. “The online status shows that my card has been sent for printing but I have no clue as to when it would be delivered,” he told The Hindu . The Regional Transport Authority (RTA), Visakhapatnam, issues around 300 new as well as renewed cards on average every day. This apart, the Transport Offices at Gajuwaka and Anakapalle together issue around 300 cards a day. Deputy Transport Commissioner G.C. Raja Ratnam said PDFs can be dowloaded from the RTA website. “The tender process for selection of a new contractor for supply of the smart cards is yet to be completed. The file is pending with the government. Motorists can download the PDF of their driving licence from the website and show it to traffic police on duty during vehicle checking,” he said. “We are receiving complaints from motorists on the undue delays in the dispatch of cards.

Ayyanna Patrudu has alleged that the State government is playing with the lives of the people by neglecting the rapid spread of COVID-19 despite the second wave surge. In a video message here on Friday, Mr. Ayyanna Patrudu said that COVID has affected 5,086 people in the last 24 hours, according to official reports, but the actual figures would be much higher. He alleged that the Chief Minister, Health Minister and officials were not responding to the situation ensuring availability of vaccine, opening COVID hospitals and adequate number of test centres to deal with the rising number of cases. He alleged that the public were worried due to the non-availability of vaccine, lack of kits at the testing centres and lack of beds for patients at the hospitals. “A private hospital at Narsipatnam has demanded a deposit of Rs. 2 lakh to admit a patient. People are calling us to find out about the availability of beds and where to go. The District Collector and DM & HO should advise the government on the issue,” he said. He sought that the identification of at least five or six hospitals, both in the rural and urban areas of the district, for treatment of patients as was done during the first wave. Similarly, the virus was spreading rapidly at schools but the government was not bothered. The DEOs and MEOs should arrange for testing of the children and the responsibility should be given to the headmasters. The State government has to provide the required equipment, he said. He alleged that both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Chief Minister were issuing false statements on availability of vaccine. The Centre had sent 60 lakh doses of the vaccine to the State last time and 30 lakh doses had to be given as the first dose and the remaining had to be used for the second dose. All the doses were exhausted and now those who were given the first dose could not be given the second dose, he alleged. Mr. Ayyanna Patrudu also appealed to parents to make enquiries with the school managements and avoid sending their children to school. The loss of an academic year was nothing compared to the loss of life, he said. Sanitisation of schools should be undertaken and an all-party committee has to be formed to monitor the sanitation, testing and vaccination programme, the TDP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-govt-neglecting-surge-in-cases-alleges-ayyanna/article34341355.ece

Karnataka reported its biggest single-day spike of 14,859 cases and 78 fatalities on Friday. Mr. Yediyurappa earlier tested positive in August 2020 and had got one dose of vaccine. He appealed on Twitter that all those who had come in contact with him recently should be observant and self-quarantine. A statement from Manipal Hospital said that he was under evaluation and being treated for respiratory symptoms. Karnataka on Friday decided to impose restrictions on gatherings and celebrations. For marriages and political events, 200 people were permitted in an open space, but religious gatherings were banned. For marriages in a closed space, the limit was 100 people, and for birthdays and other celebrations, it was 50 in open spaces and 25 in closed areas. At funerals, the limit was 50 people in an open space and 25 in a closed area.  Fresh infections soared in Tamil Nadu, with its daily count surpassing 8,000 on Friday. The State recorded 8,449 new cases of COVID-19 and 33 deaths, taking its tally to 9,71,384 and toll to 13,032.

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Composer, not writer, AR Rahman is what we need more of||Music is powerful. It is soothing, can heal and effect a change across the world. AR Rahman, the writer and composer of 99 Songs , is living proof. Unfortunately, on the evidence of 99 Songs , writer Rahman does not yet possess the nuance required to seamlessly translate that concept to the big screen.  99 Songs follows Jay (Ehan Bhat) — an aspiring musician, whose childhood we learn through montages and flashbacks as the story progresses. He grows up with a father who detests music, but the protagonist finds his calling anyway. He is in love with a mute girl, Sophia Singhania (Edilsy Vargas), the daughter of a rich industrialist. He wishes to marry Sophia but we have a stereotypical dad who doesn’t believe in Jay’s dreams of becoming a musician. When Jay stands his ground, the dad lays down a challenge — compose 100 songs before he can come around asking his daughter’s hand in marriage. And so Jay sets out on a journey that turns both his and Sophia’s worlds upside down. How the duo reunites by overcoming hardships, self-doubt and infidelity rumours form the rest of the plot. In its visual narrative, 99 Songs is a nerd fest — especially for those who work closely with musical instruments. There are fabulous shots of the music making process that can only serve the interests of a niche community. The issue which serves as the film’s undoing is the boring, old (read as: done to death) story line, and the familiar tropes. As someone who looks like a teenage version of Hrithik Roshan, Ehan Bhat looks ambitious — to play the part of Jay, but there is no way artistes can get a grip on their performance when the story just ambles, and that too towards a predictable end. The ambling affair is more pronounced in certain portions — like when we are introduced to a flashback sequence of Jay’s mom, the general feeling is, “Speed up things, please!” Films like 99 Songs need not necessarily bank heavily on a unique screenplay; it is a musical, audiences walk in seeking an experience of a different kind, and which composer Rahman does provide in abundance — the Jazz club sequences in Shillong, ‘Jwalamukhi’ track and the many piano riffs are a treat to savour. However, the success of a musical also rests on tying the viewer emotionally to the conquest of the protagonist.  99 Songs essentially being a Hindi film — the dialogues are dubbed, which does make you feel like you are watching a Jackie Chan film on Star Vijay on a Sunday (90s kids will get this) — there is little of relevance to a South Indian audience, much less a Tamil audience. The protagonists are rich people — a trope very common in Bollywood but not so much in Tamil cinema, at least in the new millennium. This presents a very interesting proposition for an audience conditioned to see their protagonists as one among the masses; so at the outset it is tough to see how Jay’s pursuits would find the emotional connect with the masses for whom the film is made. Secondly, successful musicals — for example, School of Rock , bank on an engaging screenplay. 99 Songs lacks it. Interestingly, there is VFX in this musical whose final product seems more a misplaced idea than how it seemed when it germinated in the creator’s head. However, certain sequences do land well, like when Jay has an out-of-body experience — when he is touched, literally, by the goddess of music (or his mom) — are nuanced additions to the storytelling, but beyond that there is little else to Jay or his pursuits that keeps us invested. At some point, Manisha Koirala’s character in the film remarks: “Music will be the last remaining magic in this world.” At least in the case of 99 Songs , it is true, and especially because good scripts and engaging screenplays are going extinct at a dangerous pace in Indian cinema.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/composer-not-writer-ar-rahman-is-what-we-need-more-of/article34341244.ece

17 April 2021||Bengaluru,TELANGANA||Advocates asked to avoid honorifics in court||Encouraging advocates to discontinue the colonial practice of addressing judges of the higher courts as “My Lord” or “Your Lordship”, Justice P. Krishna Bhat of the High Court of Karnataka on Friday urged them to use words like “Sir”, calling it more appropriate in the Indian circumstance. The advocates were surprised to read the instruction printed on the daily cause list of Justice Bhat’s court hall for Friday. It was also put up on the court hall’s notice board. “Learned counsel are requested to avoid addressing the court with such excessive honorifics as ‘My Lord’ or ‘Your Lordship’, but are requested to adhere to a practice consistent with the dignity and decorum of the court, which is more appropriate in the Indian circumstance, like ‘Sir’,” the note stated. While commencing the hearing of cases on the day, Justice Bhat orally told the advocates that the note was aimed at ensuring a more contemporary way of addressing the judges.   The use of phrases such as “My Lords” or “Your Lordship” is debated often in the legal fraternity, and in early 2000 the Karnataka State Bar Council (KSBC) had passed a resolution that there was no need for lawyers to use such phrases.  BCI’s dilemma In 2006, the Bar Council of India (BCI) passed a resolution exercising its power under Section 49 of the Advocates Act, 1961, stating that “My Lords” and “Your Lordship” were “relics of the colonial past”. It asked advocates to use “Your Honour” or “Honourable Court” in the Supreme Court and the High Courts. For other courts and tribunals, the BCI said that the advocates could use “Sir” or the equivalent words in local languages. Y.R. Sadashiva Reddy, senior counsel and co-chairman of the BCI, said Justice Bhat’s note exhibited his humility and served as an encouragement for lawyers to change and be practical.  ‘Disrespect’ shown The BCI had, in 2019, again allowed the use of “My Lords” and “Your Lordship” in higher judiciary following complaints about disrespect shown while addressing judges. Mr. Reddy said that senior advocates should lead the young ones by discontinuing the use of these terms and and students in law colleges should be taught against the use of colonial phrases. Since 2006, there have been instances of some judges of the apex court and the High Courts requesting advocates not to use colonial phrases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/advocates-urged-to-avoid-honorifics-like-my-lord/article34341016.ece

17 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID deaths on steady rise, crematoriums see more arrivals||With the COVID-19 pandemic raising its hood again through the second wave of infections, number of deaths have also been on the rise. While the government’s latest health bulletins show not more than 10 deaths per day, reports from the ground vouch that the number could be several times higher. Reliable sources informed that the death toll has reached about 20 per day at the Gandhi Hospital alone, while bodies reaching a single crematorium at ESI have risen to around 12. Thankfully, there is no pile-up of bodies at one place, because the stigma associated with the cremation/burial of COVID-19 bodies has waned over time. During the first wave of the pandemic last year, residents of localities around major city graveyards vehemently objected to the bodies of COVID-deceased persons being brought there for cremation/burial. Due to this, the bodies had to be secretly sent to a single facility at ESI, where several pyres were kept ready, and bodies burnt 24x7. The government had constituted a special committee to monitor the protocol for carrying out the funerals, and hospitals, both public and private, were asked to designate liaison officers to ensure that the protocol was adhered to. GHMC officials facilitated cremation/burial of patients dying in Gandhi Hospital, which was mostly done in ESI graveyard. Voluntary organisations and philanthropists also pitched in, ensuring that all the bodies received decent last rites. The situation this year is not so grave when it comes to availability of space. Officials informed that bodies from the government hospitals are being given funeral rites at crematoria in Amberpet, Bansilalpet, Jubilee Hills, ESI and occasionally at Punjagutta. The number of bodies each day has been on a steady rise for the past month, they say. From Gandhi Hospital alone, the number has grown from two to three per day a couple of months ago, to 15 now. No track is kept of the deaths in private hospitals and at homes. “Up to December last, we had conducted over 200 cremations/burials. We had stopped our last ride services since January this year, as the calls had come down starting from October-November last year. Unfortunately, we had to restart the services for the past four days during which we received a total of five calls,” informed Srinivas Bellam, from Feed The Needy, a voluntary organisation offering multi-pronged COVID services.

Funeral services agencies have also reported an increase in the sale of coffin boxes, including COVID-19 protocol caskets. With the rise in COVID deaths, some cemeteries are running short of space and reluctant to allow burials, families and those working on the issue complained. All COVID deaths reported in government hospitals and other healthcare facilities are being sent to common burial places identified by the government. But some are allowed in conventional cemeteries, if the proper documents are furnished. The caretaker of over a century-old British time cemetery in the Secunderabad Cantonment confirmed that in the past two weeks, eight COVID related burials were conducted. “On Thursday, we had a COVID-related funeral in our cemetery. The day before, there were three burials of which one was a COVID case. There is indeed a rise in COVID deaths and last rites in our cemetery that caters to a major denomination of the Protestant churches in the twin cities,” the caretaker wishing anonymity told The Hindu . Another representative of a cemetery in Narayanguda confirmed that they were getting phone calls forthe last rites of COVID patients but were being turned away to avoid any confrontation from local residents. A committee member of a cemetery in Medchal-Malkajgiri district that was developed by the government also admitted that local resistance was forcing families of the deceased COVID patients to be turned away. Goneh Solomon Raj of the Greater Hyderabad Christian Burial Grounds Action Committee said this month alone, at least 60 calls were received in his office seeking assistance in burying the deceased COVID patients belonging to the Christian faith. “With great difficulty, we got place for 16 persons while others had to make their own arrangements,” he said. John Wesley, who retired as Joint Secretary in Union HRD Ministry and now runs an evangelical ministry, flagged the serious space constraints for Christians. “It is our sincere request from the community that the government allots sufficient space for performing the last rites of the deceased persons,” he noted. However, Church of South India, Bishop in Medak Diocese Rev A.C.Solomon Raj said instructions had been given to 115 pastorates that runs 1,000-odd churches in Telangana to ensure that the kin of no COVID victim is turned away. “Pastors are performing the last rites following COVID protocol,” he pointed out. Catholic Churches representative Rev Swarna Bernard also said there was no restriction on allowing deceased COVID patients from being buried in Catholic cemeteries in the twin cities and elsewhere. COVID caskets Ivor Fernandez of Heaven Bound Funeral Services in Kanajiguda, one of the leading funeral services in the twin cities, said COVID protocol coffins and caskets were being made to order. “As the body of a COVID patient is wrapped in a plastic body bag, we have started giving coffin boxes with a glass on top of it. The agency is selling around 225 coffins and caskets a month, and has seen increase in sale in the pandemic,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/families-lament-lack-of-decent-burial-space/article34341097.ece
17 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CCMB director urges governments to halt ‘crowding activities’||There is an immediate need for the governments to control all the activities involving clustering of people into groups to control the current “dangerous” trend in the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country and across many States, assert top scientists involved in combating the SARS-CoV-2 virus on Friday. Congregations and group activities to be curtailed include political meetings, rallies, road shows, markets, religious gatherings, cinema halls, restaurants, bars, pubs and any indoor events. “People meeting in groups in any of these activities is a recipe for disaster. We have to minimise crowding because lockdowns affect the economy and livelihoods, so we have to ensure non-essential things are stopped,” said CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) director Rakesh Mishra. “If we have to keep a control on the virus, we have to wear masks all the time when we step outside the house even for walking the dog, or it is like being naked. There is no need to invite guests home for the next few months and ensure hand hygiene is practised. It may also be prudent to change clothes after an outdoor visit to be doubly cautious,” he says. While the CCMB and other sister labs had already pronounced the airborne transmission of the coronavirus in closed environments which is now being universally accepted, Dr. Mishra attests that there is every chance of the virus hanging in the air for half hour or more in a room having an infected person with less ventilation or air flow. “That is why we are saying the virus can spread in restaurants and cinema halls irrespective of occupancy ratio. A single person is enough to spread the virus when you take off the mask to eat or drink. In public toilets, the virus can hang around for two hours,” he warns. The director says the virus variants ‘will keep coming’, at any given time, there are thousands of them — while most will be of no consequence, some will be more efficient in transmission compared to others, so there is nothing to panic because “we know that the threat is already there, all we need to be careful”. “What we have to watch out for is if any of the variants are resistant to the vaccines available. So far, the reinfections are few, it means once infected, the person is protected and therefore, the vaccines are also likely to work. We are studying ‘B.1.617’, the so-called double mutation variant and will know the results in a few days,” he explains. Rapid transmission can still be prevented by avoiding person-to-person contact rather than allowing the virus the opportunity to come up with worse variants. “We have noticed that the UK variant prevalence is high in Punjab and double mutant variant is high in Maharashtra — up to 50%, but here, in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and even Kerala, it is seen in 5-10% cases only. It is clear that people have contributed to the current spread with gatherings, ignoring COVID-appropriate behaviour. Governments, too, have been tolerant. It is disappointing as this could have been easily avoided,” he laments. There is no conclusive proof of mutations escaping the RT-PCR tests as it could also be due to early stage testing, not following due protocols during sample collection or testing, faulty equipment, lacunae in training the personnel, etc. Also, this method has “70-80% chance of getting it right”, he added.  The virus can spread in restaurants and cinema halls irrespective of occupancy ratio. A single person is enough to spread the virus when you take off the mask to eat or drink.

17 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Oxygen shortage in State, admits Health Minister||Health Minister Eatala Rajender on Friday admitted that there is shortage of oxygen supplies to hospitals in the State for treatment of COVID patients but the State government was making every effort to overcome the problem. Speaking to mediapersons at Huzurabad in Karimnagar district after opening a paddy procurement centre, Mr. Rajender sounded caution that the present spell of coronavirus was spreading more vigorously than the earlier one and it was likely that the positive cases will shoot up rapidly. The number of people taking vaccine for the virus was increasing in these circumstances but there was a mismatch in demand and supply. “The vaccine is not something that the State government can purchase and give it to people. It is regulated by the Centre,” he said. The Centre will assess the requirements of each State based on positive cases, population and demand. The consignments of vaccines were accordingly despatched to States. So, the Telangana government has placed a request with the Centre to give it priority in the despatches, Mr. Rajender said. The Minister ruled out imposition of lockdown, curfew or other restrictions on movement of people in the State. He advised people not to go out unless necessary. He also said Telangana government had requested Union Health Minister Harshvardhan to allow vaccination of population above 25 years of age. Dr. Harshvardhan responded positively but gave no assurance. The State was trying to streamline supply of oxygen and Remdesivir for treatment of patients and vaccines under strict supervision, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/oxygen-shortage-in-state-admits-health-minister/article34341099.ece
17 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID burials at graveyards soaring slowly but surely||The Faqeer Mullah graveyard in Balapur, which is a designated Muslim burial space for COVID-19 bodies, is witnessing a gradual increase in the number of burials. According to those who work there, there have been at least 14 burials in the past four days. ‘16 burials in 4 days’ “In just four days, there have been 16 burials of coronavirus patients,” a worker who keeps track of the number of bodies arriving, and burials, at the graveyard said. A little over a month ago, he says, the number of bodies reaching the ground was fewer. “Lets say, more than a month ago, there used to be one or two COVID bodies per week which used to come here for burials. Most of the bodies come from corporate or private hospitals,” he says. Other like Syed Jalaluddin Zafar, from Youth Welfare Telangana, an organisation which has been burying bodies of those who succumbed to due the coronavirus since the pandemic broke out last year, much like those at Faqeer Mullah graveyard, pointed out that the number of requests for burial of bodies over a month-and-a-half has increased. “We buried nine bodies on Friday. Sometimes, the number of bodies we bury are four, or five, or six every day. Unlike now, there was a lull a few weeks ago. A vast majority of the bodies we bury are released largely from private hospitals. Nearly two months ago, the situation was not as serious. The bodies we buried were fewer. We are worried over what is happening now. People should be careful,” he said, adding that those who insist on the ghusl (final wash) make burial difficult as the ulama have also stated that given the pandemic and the risk involved, it is not mandatory. Second wave Those in the know, such as public representatives, and those working in graveyards made it clear that for the past few months, other Muslim burial spaces have permitted burials of COVID-19 patients. This was not the case in the first wave of the pandemic last year. A member of the Telangana State Waqf Board, under whose purview Muslim burial grave spaces come, and who has served several terms, said that while there has been an increase in the number of deaths, as of no, there is no great cause for concern in terms of paucity of burial spaces.“Thankfully, at the moment, there is no reason to say that the bodies are piling up, like in other states which are being shown in media reports. But one must always follow precautionary measures,” he said.  A vast majority of the bodies we bury are released largely from private hospitals. Nearly two months ago, the situation was not as serious. We are worried over what is happening now.

17 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Rise in rabi cultivation ups energy consumption||Sharp increase in yasangi (rabi) cultivation this agriculture year (2020-21) has pushed up the energy consumption significantly in the second crop season mainly the December-March period. There was an 18% spike in demand in March, the crucial stage for major rabi crops, compared to March last. The demand during the period was mainly from the farm sector as the commercial category of energy consumers, comprising tourism, hospitality, and malls did not return to normalcy completely, before the second wave of coronavirus pandemic hit the economic activity again. “The energy demand from the agriculture sector ranged between 25% and 35% of the total consumption during the four-month (rabi) period with the peak of 38% that touched in mid-March,” a senior executive of the TS-Transco explained. The maximum peak load of power till date went only up to 13,688 MW (on March 26) and the maximum consumption during the period was recorded at 281.46 million units on March 27. The highest-ever consumption for a day was, however, recorded on April 3, when it went up to 286.12 MU. As the yasangi crops were cultivated in a record extent of over 68.15 lakh acres and vegetables and other horticulture crops taken up in another 2.28 lakh acres during the second crop season, the total energy consumption for the period has been recorded at 27,745 MU, including 8,399 MU in March alone. Compared to the last rabi season (December-March), the consumption was over 6% higher this year with March recording 18% increase. “Compared to the first rabi season (2014-15) after formation of Telangana, the energy consumption has jumped by over 92%. In 2014-15 rabi, it was 4,375 MU and this time it was 8,399 MU that reflected in the fact that the extent of cultivation in 2014-15 rabi was 30.12 lakh acres and now (2020-21) it’s 70.43 lakh acres with an increase of about 134%”, the energy official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rise-in-rabi-cultivation-ups-energy-consumption/article34341113.ece

Former Minister and senior Congress leader Mohammed Ali Shabbir said at a press conference here on Friday that it looked ridiculous that the SEC had announced the poll schedule within two hours after the government announced cancellation of SSC exams and postponement of Intermediate exams in view of spiralling COVID cases. “The TRS government shuts down all schools, but permits liquor shops to operate till late in the night, and also prefers to conduct municipal elections where lakhs of people are involved, and this dual approach by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his government is quite puzzling,” he said and demanded the postponement of municipal elections. Mr. Shabbir Ali said that Mr. KCR was apparently the only CM who did not hold any review meeting on the COVID situation. “His only focus is on politics. He is least bothered whether people live or die due to coronavirus. His only concern is to win the elections at any cost,” he charged. He alleged that the State government had completely failed to deal with the virus situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-flays-sec-govt-for-announcing-civic-polls-amidst-covid/article34341119.ece

Harish Rao said that with Godavari water from Kaleshwaram flowing down from Kondapochamma reservoir, both Haldivagu and Manjeera would come to life forever and there would be no water problem from now on. Addressing a gathering after offering prayers to the Godavari at Haldivagu in Masaipet mandal along with Lok Sabha member K. Prabhakar Reddy, MLAs M Padma Devender Reddy and Madan Reddy, and MLC S. Susbhash Reddy on Friday, Mr Harish Rao said that the previous Congress governments had left Godavari water to Andhra Pradesh while the TRS diverted the route of Godavari and made the lands green. “Godavari water overflowing Haldi is one of the happiest movement in my life. The direction of Telangana has changed with Godavari water. Haldi, Pasupuleru and Manjeera will be full of water and farmers can have two crops from this season. Medak and Narsapur areas will benefit with Godavari water at Haldivagu,” said Mr. Harish Rao adding that in the past projects used to be on rivers whereas now the reservoirs like Kondapochamma, Ranganaiaksagar and Mallannasagar were being built in the hills. “We have achieved this task what previous governments could not in the last seven decades. Telangana stood first by cultivating paddy on about 53 lakh acres,” he said, adding that Manjeera water was being used locally instead of diverting it to Hyderabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/haldivagu-will-be-full-year-round/article34341264.ece

17 April 2021||Mumbai,||MVA faces Pandharpur bypoll challenge amid COVID-19 surge||The byelection in Pandharpur Assembly constituency in Solapur district on Saturday amid the COVID-19 surge in Maharashtra poses a tough test to the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The seat became vacant following the death of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Bharat Bhalke owing to COVID-19 complications in November last year. Both the MVA and the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed the upper hand in the electoral campaign, which concluded on Thursday. The result will be declared on May 2. While the NCP has fielded Bhalke’s son Bhagirath, the BJP has given its ticket to Samadhan Autade, who contested the 2019 poll as an Independent and secured 54,124 votes. In 2019, the BJP’s Sudhakar Paricharak polled 76,426 votes, and Bhalke won 89,787 votes. According to the BJP, the combined votes secured by Paricharak and Mr. Autade last time are enough to ensure the party’s win this year. The NCP, however, has dismissed such permutations. “Every election is different. Candidates were different then. The political situation has altered manifold. We are sure of retaining the seat,” NCP’s chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said. Allies extend support Top leaders from the three parties comprising the MVA have thrown their weight behind Mr. Bhagirath Bhalke. The NCP firmly believes that the late MLA’s popularity, developmental efforts, and empathy of the electorate will lead the alliance to victory. The BJP, meanwhile, is betting on Mr. Autade’s charisma and backing from the politically influential Paricharak and Mohite-Patil families. During the poll campaign, the BJP did not miss any opportunity to predict the fall of the MVA government. At a rally, Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, “Leave it to me on when the government needs to be changed. You all do not worry... People of Pandharpur have the first opportunity to show this government, involved in corrupt practices, its place. Ensure that Autade emerges victorious.” ‘Beware of defection’ NCP State president Jayant Patil was quick to counter Mr. Fadnavis’s taunt. He said the BJP should be worrying about the possibility of another bypoll in case one of its MLAs decides to defect to the ruling alliance. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said, “The one who can dislodge the government is yet to be born. While we don’t poke our noses in someone else’s business, we don’t spare those who interfere in ours.”  People of Pandharpur have the first opportunity to show this government, involved in corrupt practices, its place Devendra Fadnavis Leader of Opposition||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mva-faces-pandharpur-bypoll-challenge-amid-covid-19-surge/article34340721.ece
17 April 2021||Mumbai,||Bombay HC allows Jain temples to deliver food through volunteers||The Bombay High Court on Friday allowed Jain temples in Mumbai, Pune and Nashik to carry out through volunteers the delivery of special food consumed by the community while fasting for nine days, starting April 19. A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Gupte and Abhay Ahuja was hearing a petition filed by two Jain trusts — Shree Atma Kamal Labdhi Surishwarji Jain Gyanmandir Trust, and Sheth Motisha Religious and Charitable Trust. The plea sought special permission to “take away pious boiled cooked food from the premises of the religious trust” for the Ayambil fast. The plea also urged the court to allow the trusts to open their Jain temples while following all the standard operating procedures issued by the State government under the ‘Break The Chain’ drive on April 13 to curb the spread of COVID-19. The advocate appearing for the trusts told the court that while restaurants and bars are allowed to deliver food, religious trusts were not being allowed to do so. Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan had opposed the plea and said restaurants are allowed to carry out home delivery through online orders and no one was allowed to go to restaurants personally. The court said home deliveries could be done by a team of not more than seven volunteers and all COVID-19 safety norms should be adhered to by all those cooking and serving food. The Bench said, “Considering that the State government has permitted restaurants and other food joints to cater to the public through home delivery services, it would be clearly in the interest of justice to allow 58 Jain temples in Mumbai, and three in Pune and Nashik to deliver the pious cooked food to the homes of the devotees.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bombay-hc-allows-jain-temples-to-deliver-food-through-volunteers/article34340718.ece
17 April 2021||Mumbai,||HC extends interim orders till May 7||The Bombay High Court on Friday extended till May 7 all interim orders passed across the State owing to the “alarming rise of COVID 19 cases in Maharashtra”. A Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justices A.A. Sayed, S.S. Shinde and P.B. Varale noted that restrictions imposed by the State government under the ‘Break The Chain’ drive on April 13 have rendered it difficult to conduct judicial proceedings in the court. In a meeting of judges of the administrative committee of the court, it was resolved to regulate judicial proceedings of all the Benches and the courts/tribunals subordinate to the high court by imposing appropriate restrictions. The notice uploaded on the high court’s website read, “Since the prevailing situation in Maharashtra is alarming with exponential rise in active cases and to protect the interest of all those who have been or are disabled to access justice. The Chief Justice initiated suo motu litigation in public interest and to constitute this Special Bench for making appropriate orders considering the plight of the justice seekers.” The notice also said that in all matters where interim orders passed by the high court or the courts/tribunals subordinate to the court were “subsisting as on April 9, 12 and 15 as well as those likely to expire within April 19 or soon thereafter” shall unconditionally be extended till May 7 or until further orders of this Bench. Orders in abeyance The Bench also mentioned that “any order or decree for eviction/dispossession/demolition which might have been passed by any court/tribunal/authority subsequent to April 9 shall remain in abeyance till May 7 unless directed otherwise”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-extends-interim-orders-till-may-7/article34340724.ece

17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Migrants leaving city in hordes, but not due to lockdown fears||Despite the Delhi government announcing weekend lockdown, migrant workers in the Capital appear not to be leaving the city yet, though they’re gathering at transport hubs in hordes. Most migrant workers The Hindu spoke to at Anand Vihar ISBT said they are going home for reasons other than lockdown fear and plan to return. Some, however, were scared that the weekend lockdown might extend. Vir Singh (33) from Uttar Pradesh’s Badaun, sat with his wife, children and other family members with eight pieces of luggage and said he was scared if the lockdown will extend. However, they will come back if the lockdown is not announced, he said. He also said that the fear of lockdown is not the reason they are leaving. “Currently, we are going home to cast our vote in panchayat elections and plan to come back in 20-25 days but we haven’t forgotten last year also. Thankfully, we were back home when the lockdown was announced but my nephew was stuck in Delhi. I remember bringing him on a bike after riding all night,” he said. Mr. Singh works as a labourer and resides in Nangli Dairy. Hari Lal Gupta, a resident of Sonipat and a vegetable vendor, and his brother Hari Prasad Gupta, a labourer in Delhi, got together at Anand Vihar bus stand to go to their village in Azamgarh but not because of the lockdown fear. Other reasons “Our brother is really unwell and we have to meet him. We’ll come back in a few days. Last year during the lockdown, we got stuck here in Delhi so that scare is there but we are not leaving for good just yet,” said Mr. Gupta. Rajeev Kumar sat with his peers – all labourers in Rajasthan — at the bus stand waiting for a bus to Etah because they too wanted to cast their vote. “There is no fear of the lockdown at the moment. We are only going for a few days,” he said. Fear of the past However, there were some who had packed their luggage for more than a few days fearing a repeat of 2020. Hamid Ali and Sabeena, with their three-year-old son and elder brother, were all set to leave for Mainpuri. “I am a labourer. Work has been less in the last few days and then this weekend lockdown has been announced. This might extend. Last year also it had started with two days and then we’ll be stuck here without any transport to go home. I am leaving now. Don’t know when I’ll be back,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/migrants-leaving-city-in-hordes-but-not-due-to-lockdown-fears/article34340708.ece
17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||4 held for duping people by promising jobs||A 25-year-old man and his three associates have been arrested for allegedly duping people by promising them government jobs, police said on Friday. The main accused has been identified as Rahul Srivastava, they said. Srivastava arranged data of potential targets from employment website and social media platforms and provided them to his associates — Arjun Gill (25), Javed (24) and Manish (20), police said. The trio posed as registered recruiters from the Ministry of Labour and Employment and lured victims to make online transactions, police said. Investigations disclosed that Rs. 78.38 lakh was received via Paytm from September 2019 to October 2020. This amount was subsequently transferred (by the accused) to IDBI bank account opened in the name of “Education Planet”, police said. The matter came to light on March 23 after a woman approached the police with her complaint at Parliament Street police station in which she alleged that she had been duped. The woman told the police that she received a call in October last year from a person named Dixit Raj, who introduced himself as a registered recruiter from the Ministry of Labour and Employment, officials said. According to her complaint, the accused lured her with an offer to appear for a job interview for the post of unit administrator and assured her employment. She was duped of Rs. 3,43,626 via online transactions on the pretext of registration or other excuses, police said.

The plea has been moved by Non Resident Indian (NRI) Anisur Rehman, working in the Sultanate of Oman since 2007, seeking a commission for NRIs on the lines of the proposed migrant labour commission. The petition, filed through advocate Jose Abraham, has said, “A national level commission will help in streamlining all the NRI related welfare schemes on one platform. A NRI commission at the Centre will help in safeguarding the interest of expatriates in a much more efficacious and effective manner,” the plea said. The plea has claimed that the prevalent practice of submitting oral/written representations to consulates does not lead to speedy redressal of grievances. A robust national NRI commission with judicial powers is necessary to safeguard welfare of NRIs, it has said. “A commission along with a tribunal which redresses the grievances of the aggrieved expatriates is quintessential, especially in present times when innumerable expatriates will face job loss on arbitrary grounds and are facing discrimination of the kind never faced before,” the petition submitted. It has also said that so far only three states — Punjab, Kerala and Goa — have constituted an NRI Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/plea-in-hc-for-setting-up-national-level-panel-for-welfare-of-nris/article34340706.ece

17 April 2021||Yangon,||Opponents of Myanmar coup form shadow government||Opponents of Myanmar’s ruling junta went on the political offensive on Friday, declaring they have formed an interim national unity government with members of Aung San Suu Kyi’s ousted Cabinet and major ethnic minority groups. The move comes on the eve of a diplomatic initiative to solve Myanmar’s crisis by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which is expected to hold a summit next week. A violent crackdown by the junta has failed to stem opposition to the coup, and as the Army has spread the fight to ethnic minorities in border areas, some ASEAN members believe the crisis threatens regional stability. Opponents of the coup have been seeking an alliance with ethnic minority groups as a way of strengthening their resistance. While it was not clear if the minority political organisations had formally joined an alliance, the appointment of prominent personalities from their ranks showed a commitment to a joint struggle against the military, which is certain to boost morale to the anti-coup cause. Security forces have killed at least 726 protesters and bystanders since the February 1 military takeover, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests. The National Unity Government is nominally an upgrade from what had been called the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, which was formed shortly after the coup by elected lawmakers who were barred by the Army from taking their seats. The junta declared the CRPH an illegal organisation, and issued arrest warrants for its leading members. ‘Support us’ A video posted on Friday on social media showed veteran activist Min Ko Naing announcing the formation of the new body. He was a leader of the failed 1988 uprising against a previous military dictatorship and is one of the country’s most respected political figures aside from Ms. Suu Kyi. He went quickly underground after the coup. “Please support the National Unity Government for the future of our citizens and our younger generation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/opponents-of-myanmar-coup-form-shadow-government/article34340376.ece
17 April 2021||Moscow,||Russia bans FBI chief, other U.S. officials as tensions soar||Russia on Friday banned top officials from U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, including FBI chief Christopher Wray, from entering the country as it announced a wave of tit-for-tat sanctions and expulsions of diplomats, as tensions soar between the rivals. Moscow nonetheless said it viewed the prospect of a summit between Mr. Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin “positively”. On Thursday, Washington had announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what it says is interference by the Kremlin in U.S. elections, a massive cyberattack and other hostile activity. Moscow issued a forceful response on Friday, announcing that top U.S. officials, including Attorney-General Merrick Garland and Mr. Biden’s chief Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, would be banned from entering Russia. Earlier on Friday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia was responding to U.S. sanctions in “a tit-for-tat manner” by asking 10 U.S. diplomats in Russia to leave the country while also expelling five Polish diplomats in response to a similar move by Warsaw. ‘Serious consultations’ Mr. Lavrov also said that Mr. Putin’s top foreign policy aide, Yury Ushakov, had recommended that U.S. envoy John Sullivan leave for Washington to conduct “serious consultations”. But Russia’s Foreign Ministry insisted that it viewed Mr. Biden’s proposal to hold a summit with Mr. Putin “positively”, adding that it was “currently under consideration”. Mr. Biden’s offer earlier this week of a summit had amounted to a peace offering, as tensions between Russia and the West have escalated over the conflict in Ukraine and the new penalties levied by Washington. The U.S. penalties widened restrictions on U.S. banks trading in Russian government debt and sanctioned 32 individuals accused of meddling in the 2020 presidential vote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-bans-fbi-chief-other-us-officials-as-tensions-soar/article34340968.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Biden, Suga may announce next in-person Quad summit’||U.S. President Joe Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga at the White House on Friday — the first foreign leader visit for a presidency that began at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The two leaders are likely to announce the next in-person Quad (India, the U.S., Japan and Australia) meeting, according to a senior administration official. At their first summit level meeting, held virtually on March 12, Quad leaders had committed to meeting in person before the end of this year. Mr. Suga and Mr. Biden are also expected to discuss regional security, including North Korea, China and China-Taiwan issues. Japan is also expected to announce a $2 billion 5G network technology initiative. Mr. Suga is scheduled to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris in the morning and will hold a joint press conference with Mr. Biden following their meetings in the afternoon, where an announcement on the Quad is “likely”. The leaders are expected to review a Quad initiative to supply up to a billion doses of the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine to South East Asia and the Pacific. The plan will harness India’s vaccine manufacturing capabilities, American and Japanese finance and Australia’s distribution capacity. However, these plans could run into trouble as U.S. drug authorities paused the use of the J&J vaccine this week after a handful of the close to 7 million recipients developed blood clots. Reviewing progress “…I think the two leaders are going to review the progress to date on this [the Quad vaccine distribution plan] and underscore future plans of what we want to do — the future plans of what we want to do in the Quad going forward,” a senior administration official told reporters on a briefing call on Thursday. “So we view the Quad, even though it's an unofficial gathering, as a huge part of the architecture of the Indo-Pacific going forward,” the official said. Korea ties Some amount of time will be spent discussing the Japan-South Korea relationship, which has historically been strained since Japan’s occupation of Korea in 1910. The two leaders will also discuss China’s recent assertiveness with regard to Taiwan, with a view to sending a message to China that flying its fighters into Taiwan’s airspace is destabilising, as per the official who briefed reporters on Thursday. The U.S. and Japan would like to “calm tensions” and “discourage provocations”, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-suga-may-announce-next-in-person-quad-summit/article34340381.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. mass shooting leaves 8 dead in Indianapolis||A gunman killed at least eight people at a FedEx facility in the U.S. city of Indianapolis before turning the gun on himself in the latest in a string of mass shootings in the country, authorities said on Friday. The incident came a week after President Joe Biden branded gun violence an “epidemic” and an “international embarrassment” as he waded into the tense debate over gun control. The gunman responsible for the overnight shooting was not immediately identified and it was not known if he was an employee at the FedEx facility near the airport in the state capitol of Indiana, deputy police chief Craig McCartt told CNN. Several others were injured in the shooting, which started when the gunman opened fire in the parking lot and then went inside and kept shooting. When the police entered the plant, the gunman “immediately took his life”, Mr. McCartt said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-mass-shooting-leaves-8-dead-in-indianapolis/article34340365.ece
17 April 2021||Dubai,||Iran says it has started enriching uranium to 60%||Iran began enriching uranium on Friday to its highest level ever, edging closer to weapons-grade levels to pressure talks in Vienna aimed at restoring its nuclear deal with world powers after an attack on its main atomic site. A top official said only a few grams an hour of uranium gas would be enriched up to 60% purity — triple the level it once did but at a rate far slower than what Tehran could produce. International inspectors already said Iran planned to do so above-ground at its Natanz nuclear site, not deep within its underground halls hardened to withstand airstrikes. The move is likely to raise tensions even as Iran negotiates in Vienna over a way to allow the U.S. back into the agreement and lift the crushing economic sanctions it faces. However, its scope also provides Iran with a way to quickly de-escalate if it chose. The announcement also marks a significant escalation after the attack that damaged centrifuges at Natanz, an attack this past weekend suspected of having been carried out by Israel. While Israel has yet to claim it, it comes amid a long-running shadow war between the two West Asian rivals. ‘Any level possible’ Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, Iran’s Parliament Speaker, announced the move in a Twitter post later acknowledged by Iranian state television. “The young and God-believing Iranian scientists managed to achieve a 60 per cent enriched uranium product,” Mr. Qalibaf said. The head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the country’s civilian nuclear arm, later acknowledged the move. Ali Akbar Salehi said the centrifuges now produce 9 grams an hour, but that would drop to 5 grams an hour in the coming days. “Now, any enrichment (level) is possible if we decide it,” Mr. Salehi said.  While 60% is higher than any level Iran previously enriched uranium, it is still lower than weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran had been enriching up to 20%— even that was a short technical step to weapons grade. The deal limited Iran’s enrichment to 3.67%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-starts-enriching-uranium-to-60-its-highest-level-ever/article34340374.ece
17 April 2021||Washington,||U.S. says Russia was given Trump campaign poll data||It was one of the more tantalising, yet unresolved, questions of the investigation into possible connections between Russia and Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign: why was a business associate of campaign chairman Paul Manafort given internal polling data — and what did he do with it? A Treasury Department statement on Thursday offered a potentially significant clue, asserting that Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant, had shared sensitive campaign and polling information with Russian intelligence services. Mr. Kilimnik has long been alleged by U.S. officials to have ties to Russian intelligence. But the statement in a broader Treasury Department sanctions announcement was the first time the U.S. government had so directly drawn a connection from the Trump campaign to the Kremlin’s intelligence services. The revelation was all the more startling because it went beyond any allegation made in either special counsel Robert Mueller’s 2019 report or in an even more damning and detailed document released last year by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Both those investigations were unable to determine what Mr. Kilimnik did with the data and whether he shared it further. The issue resurfaced on Thursday because Mr. Kilimnik was one of 32 people and entities sanctioned by the U.S. government for interference in the 2020 election. Officials say Mr. Kilimnik sought to promote the bogus narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-says-russia-was-given-trump-campaign-poll-data/article34340378.ece

17 April 2021||Hong Kong,||Media tycoon among 5 jailed in Hong Kong||Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai was jailed for 14 months on Friday along with four other veteran democracy activists for their roles in protests that helped trigger a sweeping crackdown on dissent by China. Mr. Lai was given two jail terms for separate rallies in August 2019, at the peak of a democracy uprising that paralysed the financial hub for months. The jail terms were the first ever for the 73-year-old millionaire, who has spent decades using his media empire to support democracy in Hong Kong.   Among the other defendants was Martin Lee, 82, a respected barrister known as the “father of democracy” in Hong Kong, who was once chosen by Beijing to help write the city's mini-constitution. They also included Margaret Ng, a 73-year-old barrister and former opposition lawmaker. Mr. Lee and Ms. Ng were given prison terms, but their sentences were suspended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/media-tycoon-among-5-jailed-in-hong-kong/article34340371.ece

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Meth, gold and arms — a force to stop them all||Dressed in combat uniform and with AK-47 assault rifles slung over their shoulders, Jagriti, Sophie and Lucy are living their dream. The riflewomen, posted in Mizoram, are among the 200 women soldiers serving with the Assam Rifles in the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir. Training in Assam Rifles for women began in 2013 and formal induction took place in 2014. Jagriti, who hails from Aravalli district of Gujarat and is posted with 3 Assam Rifles battalion, said: “I have completed four years of service. Earlier, I was deployed in Nagaland, and Jammu and Kashmir, and took part in counter-insurgency operations. Throughout my childhood, I saw my uncle in uniform. It was my dream to join the forces. Now I feel proud.” Jagriti, the most experienced of the three, has also served in Nagaland and along the Line of Control (LoC) at Pharkian Gali in north Kashmir, known for heavy infiltration from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Similarly, Riflewomen Sophie, who hails from Serchhip in Mizoram, and Lucy, from Churachandpur in Manipur, have served in diverse roles. Lucy and Sophie are posted with 46 Assam Rifles Batallion. Lucy, selected in 2017, said, “I took to the uniform after seeing people living close to my native place joining the forces.” Sophie had earlier served at Sadhna Pass in Tangdhar sector near the LoC. “I was told that I have to go to Kashmir along with other troops. I was happy to serve the country. Our focus was to check women suspected of smuggling goods,” she said. In fact, interceptions have revealed that 60% of the conduits are women. Women soldiers are deployed for patrol duties and also at check posts. Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force, is administratively under the Ministry of Home Affairs and operationally under the Army. Riflewomen have played a stellar role in the short time since they were inducted into the force, said several officers to a group of print and television journalists from Delhi who visited Mizoram in March. Recoveries of narcotics and contraband have gone up significantly since riflewomen have been deployed, one officer said. The women perform all tasks and work equally with their male counterparts. Most importantly, they can check women carrying contraband, said the officer. But while the authorised strength is 2,000 riflewomen, Assam Rifles has only 200 riflewomen. Jagriti’s battalion has 16 women soldiers. To increase recruitment, “we need more women to apply,” said another officer. To this end, in their current deployment, Lucy and Sophie are training women who come for the pre-recruitment process, organised by the Assam Rifles. Rampant drug use The Assam Rifles faces the twin challenges of checking smuggling and preventing illegal crossings into the State which has a porous border and also a Free Movement Regime up to 16 km for residents on both sides. It also has to oversee the much-delayed and ambitious Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project, which seeks to ease India’s access to Southeast Asia and also provide an alternate route between the landlocked Northeast and the rest of India. The project is finally nearing completion. Drug use and smuggling remain the biggest challenges for Mizoram, which shares the longest border with Myanmar among the four north-eastern States that border the Southeast Asian neighbour. “Narcotics is a big challenge for us,” said Brigadier Digvijay Singh, Commander 23 Sector Assam Rifles, responsible for Mizoram.“But we are doing all that is in our hands. In the three months of 2021 alone, we have recovered narcotics worth almost Rs. 25 crore. As Mizoram is a dry State, cheap and easy availability of drugs has a wide impact on society. Mizoram has the highest percentage of drug addicts,” he said. According to data available with law enforcement agencies, in 2020, 21 kg of heroin and 130 kg of marijuana and Methamphetamine tablets worth Rs. 47 crore were found. In 2020, 190 smugglers were apprehended while over 53 were apprehended this year. India is a prime market for illicit opiates originating in Asia. Government estimates say India witnessed a 455% increase in drug hauls between 2011 and 2020. Last year, on June 26, which is observed as International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, an annual anti-drug action plan for 2020-21 for 272 districts was launched by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. In a recent survey conducted by the Social Welfare Department, 27.8% of the total drug users in the State came from Aizawl and the least from Lawngtlai (5.9%). The most alarming fact is that most of the respondents of the survey are educated — nearly 40-45% completed middle school, 35-40% up to high school, and about 10-15% are graduates. Today, more than 200 million people are estimated to be consuming illegal drugs in India. In Mizoram, 1,645 people have died due to drug abuse since 1984. In 2020 alone, 67 people died, and 268 people were arrested on drug-related charges. In India, about 0.7% of the population is affected by drugs. In terms of the percentage of population affected, Mizoram ranks the highest in the country. Ya ba tablets, produced in the Wa State of Myanmar and which are in high demand in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru, are smuggled through Mizoram, local officials said. Mizoram also acts as a conduit for transshipment of drugs to other parts of the country, Brigadier Singh said. “Assam Rifles is conducting anti-drug campaigns to create awareness about the ill-effects of drugs,” he said. Among the States bordering Myanmar, Mizoram is a peaceful State where “the insurgency ended with the stroke of a pen in 1986” as one official put it. With the other States affected by insurgency, Mizoram is the preferred route for transit, the official said. A major anti-drug drive was launched by Assam Rifles in cooperation with the State government and local NGOs. As part of the awareness campaign last year, Mizoram Home Minister Pu Lalchamliana inaugurated an anti-drug campaign named ‘Ruihhlo Do’, which means ‘a war against drugs’. It was organised along with 46 Assam Rifles in three phases. Recoveries have gone up significantly in the last two years as the anti-narcotic grid has been strengthened by the deployment of women soldiers of Assam Rifles, sniffer dogs, and X-ray machines. According to official data on recoveries in the Northeast, narcotics including Methamphetamine and Ya ba tablets worth over Rs. 368.19 crore were recovered last year. In addition, contraband such as gold, gems and teak worth Rs. 52.61 crore and other miscellaneous items including foreign currency worth Rs. 16.56 crore were recovered. Apart from being an easy substitute for alcohol, drugs are very easy to be conceal and carry, said Colonel Viplav Tripathi, Commanding Officer of 46 Assam Rifles, responsible for north Mizoram. “People are doing a lot of business as a small quantity of a drug earns them big money. A Methamphetamine tablet costs around Rs. 10-20 in the border areas. In Aizawl, it is Rs. 350-500. And once it reaches mainland India for the festival season, it costs Rs. 2,000,” he said. Apart from drugs, other major items smuggled include gold, wildlife, weapons, Indian currency and foreign cigarettes. Mizoram is one of the fastest growing hubs of gold smuggling from China, one officer at Aizawl said. More than 8 kg of gold was recovered in 2020, and about 70 kg that was recovered in other parts of country is believed to have gone through Mizoram, said the officer. Weapon recovery data show that in 2020, around 30 AK-47s, two Chinese pistols, one air rifle, around 600 rifle scopes and about 1.5 lakh detonators were recovered. Local issues Mizoram has a very high literacy rate of 91.2%, but very few employment opportunities. This is another reason why people turn to smuggling, according to observers. Speaking to the media at Zorinpui near the border where the Kaladan Project enters India from Myanmar, H. Lalmuansanga, an elected member of the Lai Autonomous District Council, said this was one of the most backward districts of the country and appealed for Central government help. “The Kaladan Project is the gateway to Southeast Asia. Before the project is completed, we need to uplift the local people. The economic condition and education status here is very poor. We need the Central government to concentrate on this area. We need to boost the health system,” he said. Joseph Lalhmingthanga, Secretary, Central Young Lai Association, echoed his views. He said that apart from more recruitment into the Assam Rifles, they also need institutions where skills development is taught and job opportunities are created for the locals. “I hope the Central government concentrates not only on international strategic policy but also on meeting local demands. Our population is very small and our needs can easily be met with a little attention,” he said. As the long convoy of vehicles meandered its way through the hilly terrain, the road from Aizawl to Lwangtlai was black-topped and good for the most part. But the real test of our spines was from Lwangtlai to Zorinpui. A common sight as we drove across the State was of people carrying cans and drums of water to their homes. Officials said water supply is a major issue across the State. An ambitious project After missing a few deadlines and crossing several hurdles, India’s ambitious infrastructure project is nearing completion. Since the February coup in which the military junta overthrew the democratically elected government and took control of Myanmar, hundreds of Myanmarese nationals including policemen crossed over into India seeking refuge. This prompted India to seal all the border points. Despite this, work was on full swing on a bridge at the border at Zorinpui, next to a bailey bridge built by the Army last year for the project. Officials dismissed any impact of the coup on the project or any threat from the Myanmar-based insurgent group, the Arakan Army. “Of late, there has been no incident where the Arakan Army has tried to hinder the progress of the Kaladan project. The project is progressing as per the timeline. It will have a huge economic impact on society as well as in the development of south Mizoram,” said Brigadier Singh. “It is supported by the local people in Myanmar as development in Rakhine State is not great. So this road will bring a lot of prosperity and business opportunities for those people,” he said. The project has three legs — a 539-km sea stretch from Kolkata to Sittwe in Myanmar, an inland waterway on the Kaladan river from Sittwe to Paletwa extending to 150 km, and the 110-km land route from Paletwa in Myanmar up to Zorinpui in Mizoram. There is also another 88-km road stretch from Zorinpui to Lawngtlai in Mizoram. The private company RDS is executing the stretch from Lawngtlai till the border at Zorinpui. There is another stretch of 109 km inside Myanmar. The Ministry of External Affairs is executing the project and appointed IRCON (Indian Railway Construction Limited) to monitor the project, explained Captain Vikas Sharma near the project site at Zorinpui. IRCON floated the project and tenders were given to EPIL and C&C, a joint venture company, Captain Sharma said. The area was named Zorinpui, which means ‘Mizoram’s greatest hope’, in 2008 when the Kaladan Project started. The place around the project site is populated by Mizo communities. The joint venture started work in 2017 but stopped in 2019 as C&C declared bankruptcy. Subsequently the joint venture subcontracted work to another joint venture, RK-RPP, to complete the work between Kaletwa and Zorinpui. “Five km of the road has been constructed though it is yet to be blacktopped. Jungles up to 20 km have been cleared for the road and 10 km of road has been surveyed,” said T.S. Negi, project coordinator. Negi said a major challenge is working in the jungles where there are a “lot of mosquitoes”. “We are trying to work with everyone,” Negi said adding they have hired labour from villages on both sides of the border as they are economically backward and this is a good opportunity to take them along. Many obstacles Over the years, the project has seen several interruptions including monsoons, local issues and red tape. “There was also a break because of the pandemic. There was also some fear because of the Arakan Army but work is now progressing smoothly,” said another project official. In early 2019, in a two-week-long coordinated operation with the Indian Army, the Myanmar Army destroyed 10-12 camps of the Arakan Army which set up camps in the Rakhine area, posing a threat to the project. In November 2019, the Arakan Army abducted five Indians from the project site, one of whom died of a heart attack while in custody. There is no longer any threat from the Arakan Army. It too is supportive of the project as it wants development in the region, a local official said. The project was first conceived in 2003 and an agreement was signed in 2008 at an estimated cost of Rs. 536 crore. The cost has since gone up to Rs. 3,200 crore and the deadline revised twice. It is expected to be completed by 2023. The project, which opens an alternative route for India’s landlocked Northeast to Kolkata through Myanmar, also opens connectivity to Southeast Asia. Kaladan can be a major push to counter China’s influence in the region, another official said. As of now, the work on Sittwe seaport as well as the dredging of Kaladan port are complete. In June 2017, India handed over six cargo vessels to Myanmar. The final stretch is now the roads. Work is being done to convert the 100-km road on National Highway to four lanes, between Zorinpui and Lawngtlai.

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The roots of a decentred international order||The International Institute for Strategic Studies puts the overall estimate of China’s military budget at $230 billion (https://bit.ly/3sofrDw). The intentions for global supremacy are apparent, chiefly to outrun the Pentagon. The primary geopolitical rivals, namely Russia and China may possibly provide the strategic and tactical counterbalance to the hegemony of America. Moreover, the international order is under threat of the rising economic power of the BRICS  nations, with China dominating in its economic and military capacity. Rising powers and an agenda Though it is a far cry from surpassing the United States in its military prowess, particularly Russia which has no ambitions of a global outreach, it is apparent that the future of global politics requires a significant programmatic agenda in the hands of the rising powers that are aggressively building a parallel economic order envisaging new centres of hegemonic power. It forebodes the final decline of American ascendency that began after the end of British imperialism in the aftermath of the Suez Crisis (1956) when a wrap on the knuckles by America led to the withdrawal of Britain and France. Pax Britannica gave way to Pax Americana. From the Renaissance period onwards, 14th-15th century Europe began its hegemonic ambitions through trade and commerce, taking almost 500 years to colonise and influence nations across the world. The tectonic shifts in the postcolonial era saw the interrogation of Eurocentrism and its biased accounts of the East, especially with the appearance of Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth and Edward Said’s Orientalism which began to propel freedom struggles against western-centric perspectives inherently inadequate and biased for the understanding of the emerging new world order. It was the Bandung Conference of 1955, a meeting of Asian and African states, most of which were newly independent, that set the schema for the rise of Asia, politically and economically. The confrontational stance was therefore the expected corollary in third world struggles to create a parallel order. Dents to American supremacy Nevertheless, in all likelihood, America will continue to play a prime role in international affairs though its image representing universal brotherhood has sharply declined under the Trump regime, particularly his foreign policy of threatening to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Furthermore, his bare-faced racist obsession and his handling of the marginalised immigrants has left the democratic world aghast. The rising tide of far-right ultra-nationalism and ethnic purity experienced in the Brexit phenomena, in Trumpism and in the promotion of the right-wing agenda in India, has set in motion the wearing down of liberal democracy. Other threats such as terrorism, ethnic conflicts and the warning of annihilation owing to climate change necessarily demand joint international action where American “exceptionalism” becomes an incongruity and an aberration. This indeed has chipped away at the American global supremacy. The world is, as a result, witness to a more decentred and pluralistic global order, a rather compelling vision of the empowerment of liberal forces standing up for an international order incentivised by long-term structural shifts in the global economy, indicating the evolving nature of power and status in international politics, especially in the context of the rising impact of Asian Regionalism on international trade and commerce. Direction by China This is the evolutionary path the developing nations are already embarking on, though the current raging novel coronavirus pandemic has retarded economic development and sent many economies such as Brazil, India, Turkey and South Africa into a downward spiral. It is hoped that in the post-pandemic period, these economies would rise to meet the American-led liberal hegemonic world order. With China spearheading Asian regionalism, a serious challenge is possible but there is deep scepticism about China’s self-enhancing economic and military greed reflecting its personal economic rise. China must strengthen the opposition to the West through the promotion of regional multilateral institutions . Its self-centered promotion of building its own stature through the recent concentration on principle of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Silk Road project has, indeed provoked an understandable clash with India and Japan. More than having individual partners or allies, China must embrace and give a push to multilateral affiliations in order to not further exacerbate regional tensions. Power rivalry in a multipolar world would remain a possibility with military conflict not ruled out. It would be overly optimistic to imagine that the threat of war is behind us, though it can be safely said that it is unlikely. Regional military activity can be seen in Russia’s assertion of power in Georgia and Ukraine, Turkey in the east of the Mediterranean, India’s disputes with Pakistan and China’s infiltration into India as well as its rivalry within its periphery. History is a witness to nations beginning to flex their muscles once economic rise is assured and recognised across the world. Indeed, the international state of affairs is rather fuzzy and frenzied. However, the capabilities of the rising economies cannot be underestimated. China and India clearly have the age-old potential to lead as, historically, they have been pioneers of some of the oldest civilisations in the world. Whereas, China’s military capabilities must not make China lose its bearings, economically it must spearhead the challenge to the established western world that has ingrained its superiority in the consciousness of the developing world for centuries. China indeed is a valuable bedfellow for the launching of a union which could be a formidable challenge to the West at a stage when multifaceted transnational threats confront the world and need the collective universal attention. The fragmentation of global governance consequently can no longer be handled solely by America. Thus, a more nuanced understanding of power in the circumstance of the declining authority of the West has to be arrived at especially when China is still far from approaching U.S. power in just about any area, particularly in its economic or military strengths, its multinationals that lead just about in every category. Its defence advantages that are unparalleled. China, on the other hand, is indisputably a serious rival to the U.S. in the South China Sea, a world leader in renewable energy, and a formidable actor on the global stage of investment and trade, penetrating India, Israel, Ethiopia and Latin America. As Tongdong Bai writes in his book Against Political Equality , China has risen in its global power by “adopting the idea of absolute sovereignty and following the nation-state model, which is in conflict with the Western ideal that human rights override sovereignty…. But it cannot continue to rise by doing what it has been doing and it must eventually follow the liberal democratic models”. China must remember that its growing power has compelled Anthony Blinken, the current U.S. Secretary of State, to encourage NATO members to join the U.S. in viewing China as an economic and security threat. Thus, a kind of dualism persists in the world order with no clear hegemony that can be bestowed on one single nation. Global power gradually extends across a wider range of countries, restoring contestation necessary for the smooth working of a balanced world order, thereby allowing multiple narratives to co-exist on the international level. This has implications for the functioning of a civilisation that is not controlled by the indomitable will of one. On sharing and treaties The emphasis, therefore, would be a move towards restructuring and advancement, as well as adopting an oppositional posture as a robust replacement of subservience to western hegemony. The challenges of the 21st century can be met head on through mutual sharing of knowledge and more ground-breaking inclusive treaties. It is feared that there could be a possibility of a multipolar world turning disordered and unstable, but it is up to the rising nations to attempt to overcome territorial aspirations and strike a forceful note of faith on cultural mediation, worldwide legitimacy, and the appeal of each society in terms of its democratic values. Interestingly, the sun is now setting on the empire and the rising nations are gradually waking up to a new experience of freedom and self-confidence.

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Vaccine diplomacy that needs specific clarifications||On March 18, V. Muraleedharan, Minister of state in the Ministry of External Affairs, while responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha on the “Distribution of Covid-19 Vaccine in Foreign Countries”, noted, “External supplies are done factoring in domestic production, requirements of national vaccination programme and requests for the ‘Made in India’ vaccines. These supplies will continue in the weeks and months ahead, in a phased manner, depending on production and needs of the national vaccination programme”. As an obligation Mr. Muraleedharan also stated that India was sending these vaccines abroad in the “form of grant, commercial sales of manufacturers GAVI’s COVAX facility (https://bit.ly/3x0J4yg)”. Eight days later, Mr. Muraleedharan made the same points while answering a question in the Lok Sabha but he also, significantly, added, “The supply to GAVI’s COVAX facility is an obligation since India is a member of this multilateral body and also a recipient of vaccines from this body (https://bit.ly/32l2gbO).” As on April 13, India had supplied over 65 million vaccines to 90 countries. Of these more than 10 million were sent as grants, almost 36 million on a commercial basis and about 19 million under the COVAX programme. These estimates are based on the Ministry of External Affairs statistics. Taken together, these supplies come to around a month of India’s current COVID-19 vaccines production. An analysis of the timing of these supplies is revealing. Vaccines were sent as grants from the third week of January through March; some small quantities have also been sent this month. Vaccines were exported on a commercial basis mainly from end January through February, with a small number in March. The COVAX despatch was made overwhelmingly in March, though some small supplies have continued in April. ‘Why’ as a crucial query Mr. Muraleedharan’s responses to the Parliamentary questions focussed on ‘how’ vaccine supplies were sent. They also mentioned that these exports were contingent on requirements of the national vaccination programme, vaccines production and the compulsion arising out of the GAVI membership. They do not however go to the basic question: ‘why’ send vaccines at all. That is certainly a crucial query for the enormous domestic need for vaccines made each dose precious; hence, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s emphasis that no vaccine should go waste. An answer to ‘why send vaccines’ was given by Mr. Modi during his address to the Raisina Dialogue on April 13 when he said “…we in India have tried to walk the talk (https://bit.ly/3gfdDKl).” Speaking at the same forum, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said, “I think equitable access (to vaccines) is critically important in this. Because we all know that no one will be safe till everyone is safe.” Clearly, India wishes to signal that it is a responsible global power which does not self-obsessively think of itself alone. Significantly, India has not been shy of comparing its record with that of advanced western countries. Last month, Mr. Jaishankar asked, “Tell me, how many vaccines have internationalist countries given? Which one of these countries have said while I do (vaccinate) my people, I will do (inoculate) other people who need it as much as we do”? A side to foreign policy This desire to be a good global citizen can be traced to the Objective Resolution moved by Jawaharlal Nehru in the Constituent Assembly on December 13, 1946. It noted, inter alia , “This ancient land attains its rightful and honoured place in the world and make its full and willing contribution to the promotion of world peace and the welfare of mankind (https://bit.ly/3ggh1or).” Mr. Modi followed this vision when he also told the Raisina Dialogue, “And we must think of the entire humanity not merely of those who are on our side of the borders. Humanity as a whole must be at the centre of our thinking and action.” The Modi government also time and again invokes the ancient phrase ‘ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam ”; Mr. Jaishankar did so at the Raisina Dialogue too. The premise of the ideal ‘ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam ’ is no different to that of the Objective Resolution. These approaches are the idealistic side of the foreign policy coin whose other face is fashioned by cold and ruthless realism and exclusive self-interest. Foreign policy makers often seek to emphasise a country’s tradition of altruism and the imperative of enlightened self-interest — in all peoples’ safety and prosperity lies our own — to justify the assistance they give to other lands. But they have to ultimately justify it to their own people on the basis of tangible short- or long-term strategic and economic interests. This is particularly so in times of shortages when the welfare of a country’s own citizenry is directly and obviously at stake. India’s vaccine supplies to foreign countries will be judged by its people on this criterion. How do they measure? Factors that mattered The implications of Mr. Muraleedharan’s responses show that the government made estimates of the vaccines that could be sent abroad on the interplay of three factors: domestic production, the demands of the national vaccine programme and requests for vaccines manufactured in India. What is not known is how these factors were collectively addressed in the decision-making process. For instance: did the health authorities come to an independent judgment of domestic demand and base the national vaccine programme on this independent judgment? If this was the case, then the foreign supplies that have been made have been only of those vaccines that the health authorities thought could be spared to be sent outside. In such a scenario, the onus for answering questions on the making of the national vaccine programme would lie squarely with the health authorities. It would obviously not be so if domestic availability of vaccines was reduced by the number that had to be sent abroad on any consideration. Mr. Muraleedharan clarified that it was obligatory to send vaccines contracted under GAVI’s COVAX facility. Experts in international law can weigh in on this assertion because sovereign states can always invoke supreme national interest to over-ride obligations. Certainly, the vaccines sent as grants were voluntary and the commercial contracts of the company concerned could always be disregarded under existing laws. Thus, all in all, vaccines sent abroad were for general foreign policy considerations for which there is some justification. But that is insufficient. Specific clarifications are needed to convince the people that these exports have not been made at the cost of their health.

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Steep climb||The three seats of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong in the Darjeeling hills of West Bengal may count for little numerically in the State Assembly of 294 members, but their political significance is a different story. The demand for a separate Gorkhaland State in the hills has singularly driven politics among the Gorkha population for more than three decades now. The agitation has been often violent. In 2017, during the last eruption of violence, the hills were in blockade for 104 days and several people were killed. The BJP’s close involvement with Gorkha politics suggests that it has certain plans for the region, which could have ripples in other parts of the country where demands for autonomy or separate States exist. It was in Darjeeling that the BJP got its foothold into West Bengal. From 2009 to 2019, the region sent a BJP member to the Lok Sabha. The BJP’s traditional position in favour of smaller States created an affinity for it, but more importantly, the fact that it had little stake in West Bengal politics in general allowed it to be experimental here. Though it never declared in clear terms its support for a separate State, by maintaining an ambiguous stance, it became acceptable to an expanding segment of the hill population. In 2014, then BJP prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi said he shared the dreams of the Gorkhas, and the BJP later on shifted to a promise of ‘permanent political solution’. Home Minister Amit Shah campaigned in the hills and reiterated the promise. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee stayed away from campaigning, avoiding the contentious question. The politics in the hills is framed in antagonistic terms with the Bengali population in the plains. Any concession to the Gorkhas, let alone a separate State, can be viewed unsympathetically by the rest of the population. The two experiments in the past of allowing autonomy to the region under the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council from 1988-2012, and the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration established in 2012, more than mitigating the grievance of the Gorkhas, splintered their politics. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha which dominated politics in the region is divided into two factions — one led by its founder Bimal Gurung and other by Binay Tamang and Anit Thapa. Ms. Banerjee’s TMC is said to be in alliance with both factions, which means little more than creating confusion. The Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), the party set up by Subhas Ghising who started the agitation, is an ally of the BJP. The experiments of alliances and self-governance led to an erosion of trust in local leaders. While Gorkha politics view Bengali leaders of all parties with suspicion, they have bought into the nationalist politics of the BJP to some extent. The BJP has emerged as a serious player in West Bengal and will remain so in the near future. Darjeeling will test its agility and vision, certainly for the State, but probably beyond its borders too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/steep-climb/article34340353.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Exiting Afghanistan||By announcing that all U.S. troops would be pulled out of Afghanistan by September 11, President Joe Biden has effectively upheld the spirit of the Trump-Taliban deal, rather than defying it. In the agreement between the Trump administration and the insurgents in February 2020, U.S. troops were scheduled to pull back by May 1, in return for the Taliban’s assurance that they would not let terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State operate on Afghan soil. When Mr. Biden ordered a review of the U.S.’s Afghan strategy, there was speculation that he would delay the pullout at least until there was a political settlement. But he chose an orderly pullout — the remaining troops (officially 2,500) will start leaving Afghanistan on May 1, with a full withdrawal by September 11. Besides the U.S. troops, the thousands of coalition troops under the NATO’s command are also expected to pull back along with the Americans. Mr. Biden’s push to revive the peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban has hit a roadblock. A U.S.-initiated, UN-led regional peace conference is scheduled to take place in Ankara, Turkey, on April 24. But the Taliban have made it clear that they will not participate in it, and have threatened to step up attacks if the U.S. did not meet the May 1 withdrawal deadline. It is not clear whether the peace conference will go through without the Taliban’s participation and what it would achieve even if it goes through without the Taliban. This leaves the already shaky Ghani government in an even more precarious situation. After September, the government will be left with itself on the battleground against the Taliban. For now, Mr. Ghani has held together the powerful sections of the state and society against the Taliban at least in the provincial capitals. But once the Americans are gone, the balance of power in the stalemated conflict could shift decisively in favour of the Taliban. In the recent past, whenever the Taliban overran cities, U.S. air power was crucial in driving them back. The country is already witnessing a series of targeted killings of journalists, activists and other civil society members opposed to the Taliban. This does not mean that the government is on the verge of collapse. The U.S. has promised that it would continue remote assistance to the government. The role of regional players such as Russia, China and India, which have a shared interest in a stable Afghanistan, will also be crucial in deciding the country’s future. But one thing is certain: the U.S., despite all its military might, has lost the war and its withdrawal, without any settlement or even a peace road map, leaves the Taliban stronger and the government weaker. That is an ominous sign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/exiting-afghanistan/article34340354.ece
17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Economy in better shape than during 2020’s COVID-19 wave’||The Indian economy is in a better shape as compared to the previous COVID-19 wave witnessed last year because of vaccines, Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) K. V. Subramanian said on Friday. “There is a second wave therefore people should be careful about it and follow all regulations,” he said, speaking at an event organised by Amazon. “But overall compared to previous episode, we are in a better shape because vaccine is out and vaccination drive is proceeding. So uncertainty is much lower,” the CEA added. Following the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, India went in for one of the strictest lockdowns, leading to a massive contraction of about 24% in GDP. Beginning March this year, the second wave started rearing its head with a sudden jump in cases, forcing many States to go for localised restrictions. India added a record 2,17,353 new coronavirus infections in a day, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday. This is the second consecutive day that the country has reported over two lakh cases. The CEA said “one key thing that stood out during this pandemic is the rollout of e-commerce and digitisation, something that India has embraced.” As many as 800 million people were provided essential supplies through the public distribution system and cash transfer through the Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile (JAM) with a click of button, while most advanced countries like the U.S. provided financial support to its citizens by issue of cheques implemented over two months, he added. “I think Indian economy is really equipped very well to usher in the significant growth that is happening in e-commerce,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/economy-in-better-shape-than-during-2020s-covid-19-wave/article34340342.ece

Mr. Sharma added that while Usha had a fairly robust presence in rural India already, faster growth in consumption in rural India had spurred accelerated spends on distribution outreach, consumer promotions and new product offerings. Currently, rural markets contribute 18-20% to the company’s overall business, and Mr. Sharma said he expected this to go up to 25% in the next 2-3 years. The firm sells products ranging from sewing machines to fans. “The demand for branded goods and services has been on the rise in rural India for the last couple of years and this saw a huge spurt in the months following the pandemic,” Mr. Sharma said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/higher-rural-demand-to-spur-growth-usha-international/article34340327.ece
17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||India badly placed to tackle infections: Fitch||Despite several healthcare reforms, India remains badly placed to tackle the current wave of COVID-19 infections sweeping the nation, Fitch Solutions said on Friday, adding that the unprecedented crisis had highlighted the need to increase investment in healthcare. After some success in curbing the virus, India’s economy had returned to functioning normally by the second half of 2020. “However, over the recent weeks, the virus has started spreading rapidly, partly due to complacency on the social distancing measures and mask-wearing policies,” Fitch said. With daily COVID-19 cases crossing the grim milestone of 2 lakh, several hospitals across the country are stretched beyond their capacities in handling the rising burden of the highly infectious disease. States such as Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Karnataka, bearing the maximum load of the pandemic, are already falling short of health infrastructure and equipment, ranging from oxygen to ventilators, Fitch said. “Despite several healthcare reforms, India remains badly placed to tackle the rapid spread of the coronavirus,” it said, adding the epidemic could be worse in India if it was not adequately contained. With 8.5 hospital beds per 10,000 population and 8 physicians per 10,000, the healthcare sector is not equipped for such a crisis. “Moreover, the significant inefficiency... and acute shortage of the healthcare delivery systems in the public sector do not match up with the growing needs of the population,” it noted. ‘Inadequate cover’ Besides, more than 80% of the population still does not have any significant health insurance coverage and approximately 68% has limited or no access to essential medicines. “The low level of public spending on health is both a cause and an exacerbating factor accounting for the poor quality, limited reach and insufficient public provisioning of healthcare. “Dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic has brought out the critical importance of the public sector in health provisioning,” the agency said. Fitch also said India’s vaccine roll-out had been slow. The country of 135 crore people has administered 8.09 crore vaccine doses until April 2021, the most after the U.S. and China. Still, India lags far behind in immunisations per capita having vaccinated only about one in 25 people, compared with almost one in two in Britain and one in three in the United States. “India’s soaring virus cases puts its position as a global supplier [of vaccines] at risk — the country has had to hold back vaccine exports in order to maintain domestic supply,” Fitch Solutions observed in the note.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-badly-placed-to-tackle-infections-fitch/article34340340.ece

17 April 2021||Buenos Aires,||Pathak primed for Tokyo action||Young goalkeeper Krishan Pathak, one of the architects of India’s superb show against Argentina, said he wants to be in top form for the Tokyo Olympics and is eyeing another superlative performance against Great Britain in the FIH Pro League games next month. The 23-year-old, who earned his 50th international cap during India’s tour of Argentina, played a big role in his side registering back-to-back victories against the reigning Olympic champion in the FIH Pro League this month. “I am very happy to have completed 50 international caps. So much has happened in such a short space of time. I have had the opportunity to play in big tournaments and learnt a lot from my seniors,” Pathak said in a release issued by Hockey India. “The coaches have always believed in my talent. I want to continue working hard and win games for India. Reaching this milestone makes me proud.” Impressive While fellow custodian P.R. Sreejesh was brilliant when the visitor won the first match in a penalty shoot-out, Pathak was equally impressive during India’s 3-0 win over the host in the second game. “I got to learn a lot from the Argentina tour. I know I have to prove my worth as a goalkeeper every time I am playing,” said Pathak. “I feel we showed a lot of fight and character there. Over the past year, we’ve had good games against the top sides in the world and I feel that gives us the right kind of boost going into a tournament like the Olympics.” India will play Great Britain in the FIH Pro League on May 8 and 9. “We have to be focused on the job at hand right now. Hope our good form continues against Great Britain,” Pathak said. For much of his career, Pathak has been Sreejesh’s understudy and thinks the competition for places has only made him better. “There’s so much one can learn from Sreejesh. He’s been playing at the highest level for so many years,” he said. “I have improved as a custodian in the last four years and that is because of what I have gathered and learnt watching people like Sreejesh and others play and train on a daily basis.”  I have had the opportunity to play in big tournaments and learnt a lot from my seniors||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pathak-primed-for-tokyo-action/article34340509.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Deepak Chahar has the ball talking in CSK’s thumping win||Deepak Chahar’s inspiring spell of swing bowling set up Chennai Super Kings’ facile win over Punjab Kings to help the three-time champion open its account in IPL-14. Thanks to Chahar’s trademark spell up front, aided by Ravindra Jadeja’s magic in the field, CSK stifled PBKS to a meagre 106 for eight at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The top-order then ensured that the team presented M.S. Dhoni — making his 200th appearance for CSK, which includes 24 in the Champions League — with a fitting gift, a dominant six-wicket victory. Chahar sealed the fate of the game in the PowerPlay itself once Dhoni elected to field. With the dew yet to set in, the swing bowler took just four balls to flummox Mayank Agarwal. The delivery started on the middle-stump but moved away after pitching to hit the top of off-stump. Had Ruturaj Gaikwad not dropped Chris Gayle at point two balls later, Chahar may have celebrated twice in the first over. In Chahar’s next over, captain K.L. Rahul took on Jadeja’s arm while attempting a sharp single and the fielder, running in from the covers, struck timber to find the batsman short. It meant Gayle had no option but to rebuild the innings along with the opening game’s hero, Deepak Hooda. But Chahar had different plans as he struck twice in his third over. He first saw Jadeja lunge forward to pouch an uppish drive by Gayle and then used the short-ball ploy effectively against Nicholas Pooran. Dhoni persisted with Chahar even after the PowerPlay and Hooda offered Faf du Plessis catching practice at mid-off in the seventh over. At 26 for five, the game was all but done and dusted. Despite M. Shahrukh Khan’s impressive innings (47, 36b, 4x4, 2x6), with little support from the other end, PBKS had to find solace in the fact that it managed to reach three figures without being bowled out. In the chase, Gaikwad and du Plessis struggled for timing against accurate pace bowling. Although Gaikwad holed out in the deep off Arshdeep Singh, Moeen Ali (46, 31b, 7x4, 1x6) continued his silken touch with the willow. While Moeen scored freely — his twin fours off Mohammed Shami, either side of the wicket, were a treat to watch — du Plessis (36 n.o.) took his time before going after leggie M. Ashwin. CSK lost Suresh Raina and Ambati Rayudu off successive Shami deliveries, but by then the writing was on the wall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/deepak-chahar-has-the-ball-talking-in-csks-thumping-win/article34340459.ece
17 April 2021||KOLKATA,||Divya clinches second Asian gold||Divya Kakran emerged as the second Indian woman to secure two gold medals in the Asian wrestling championships on Friday as women wrestlers of the country returned four gold medals in Almaty, Kazakhstan. In the continental event marred by the absence of strong countries China and Japan, three Indian women — Divya (72kg), Vinesh Phogat (53kg) and Anshu Malik (57kg) — bagged gold medals. Only Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik settled for silver in 65kg. A day after Sarita Mor became the first Indian woman to win two Asian titles, Divya, who had claimed the 68kg crown in New Delhi a year ago, took the gold in a depleted 72kg field consisting of just four wrestlers. Divya defeated Tsevegmed Enkhbayar of Mongolia 2-0 and Zhamila Bakbergenova of Kazakhstan 8-5. Divya beat Korean Sujin Park 2-0 in her last bout. Olympic-qualified wrestler Vinesh beat Otgonjargal Ganbaatar of Mongolia 11-0 and Meng Hsuan Hsieh of Chinese Taipei 12-0 in the group stage. She reached the final as her Korean opponent Hyunyoung Oh forfeited her match due to an injury. Vinesh then defeated Meng by fall to clinch her maiden title. “The main aim was to wrestle the Japan and China wrestlers, but they are not here. If there is a gold medal on the offering, I will take it,” she said. Anshu cruised against Sevara Eshmuratova of Uzbekistan 10-0, Nazira Marsbek Kyzy of Kyrgyzstan 10-0 and Battsetseg Altantseseg of Mongolia 9-1 before overcoming Korean Shinhye Lee with a 2-2 scoreline. Anshu again beat Battsetseg 3-0 in the final to claim her first Asian gold. Sakshi, who could not win the 62kg Olympic weight trials and qualified in 65kg, lost the summit clash to Bolortungalag Zorigt of Mongolia via fall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/divya-clinches-second-asian-gold/article34340350.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Proving their worth — and how!||Jaydev Unadkat began it all. He was there at the end, too. If his three wickets with the new ball ensured that Delhi Capitals would not set a target beyond Rajasthan Royals’ reach, later on in the night, he played the perfect foil to Chris Morris, whose lusty hitting swung the match decisively. Interestingly, both of them have hit the headlines for the amount of money Royals bid on them. At last year’s auction, Morris became the most expensive player in IPL history when he was snapped up for Rs. 16.25 crore. Back in 2018, Royals had spent Rs. 11.5 crore on Unadkat and Rs. 8.4 crore a year later; he has since been retained for Rs. 3 crore. Justifying the faith  While Morris has been able to prove his worth in only his second match for Royals, Unadkat must be happy that he could justify the faith the management has had in him over the last four years. “I knew it was about just one good game,” said the left-arm seamer. “I knew that my opportunity would come. I am happy to have contributed today.” About the 46-run partnership for the unbroken eighth wicket — off just 23 balls — with Morris, he said they were trying to keep things simple and be calm towards the end. “(Morris) couldn’t middle the first few balls,” he said. “I kept telling him it was just about one hit. We were confident that we were just a couple of balls away from getting this game in our pocket. It was amazing hitting by Morris.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/proving-their-worth-and-how/article34340454.ece
17 April 2021||IMOLA,||Mercedes drivers mean business||Mercedes topped both practice sessions for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix as Red Bull endured a torrid day on Friday. Red Bull was favoured heading to Imola but fortunes swung in Mercedes’ favor as the reigning championship team managed a one-two in both practices while its rival finished each session with just one driver. Valtteri Bottas was fastest in both, edging Lewis Hamilton by just .010 seconds in the second practice and .041 in the first. Pierre Gasly, who briefly separated the two Mercedes drivers, was .078 slower than Bottas in the second practice. Problems for Red Bull Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, who looks set to be Hamilton’s closest rival this season, had a problem with his car early in the second practice and his session ended abruptly 10 minutes in. Verstappen had been third-fastest in the morning, .058 behind Bottas. Verstappen’s teammate Sergio Perez failed to finish the morning practice after an incident with Esteban Ocon heading into the Villeneuve chicane. The rear left tyre of Perez’s car was ripped off and the front of Ocon’s Alpine suffered heavy damage after the pair came together.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mercedes-drivers-mean-business/article34340461.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Assured Mumbai Indians vs unsettled Sunrisers Hyderabad||Mumbai Indians will look to build on the momentum gained from a brilliant win over Kolkata Knight Riders when it takes on an unsettled Sunrisers Hyderabad at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Saturday. Exceptional bowling The reigning champion managed to defend a small total with some exceptional bowling, especially towards the end, a performance which suggested that its loss in the opener was an aberration. Even in that game, against RCB, MI did well to take the contest to the final ball. Although the five-time winner will feel it has most bases covered, it will want to improve the batting, given it did not manage to post a big total in either game. The pitch in Chennai so far has been better for the team batting first, and it will be interesting to see whether the captain winning the toss opts to set a total for the first time. After two losses, both while chasing, SRH could consider defending a score if it gets lucky with the toss again, given it has one of the best bowling attacks in the competition. The big question The team has a bit of a headache in terms of figuring out its best combination. The big question will be how it can accommodate Kane Williamson if he is match-ready. The New Zealand skipper adds stability to the batting unit, an area of concern, especially in the middle-order. SRH will also hope players such as Manish Pandey and Vijay Shankar can bat more aggressively and thus limit the reliance on David Warner and Jonny Bairstow. The 2016 champion needs to get on the board soon, and a win against a side like MI could be the booster shot it desperately seeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/assured-mi-takes-on-unsettled-srh/article34340465.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Ostapenko outlasts Ankita||Former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko overcame a fiercely determined Ankita Raina 6-2, 5-7, 7-5 to put host Latvia 1-0 ahead in the Billie Jean King Cup World Group playoff tie at the indoor arena in Jurmala on Friday. With the Indian leading 5-4 in the third set, the 23-year-old Ostapenko handled the climactic phase like a champion. However, the 28-year-old Ankita couldn’t close it out, opening the door for the Latvian. Perhaps, a better start could have helped Ankita. Not used to facing an opponent of such quality seemed to be playing on the Indian’s mind as she decided to go on an all-out attack and kept making errors. Though Ostapenko, too, struggled with her serve and strokes, Ankita was unable to capitalise on the opportunities that came her way. Precise and purposeful After shrugging off the excitement of the first set, Ankita was a lot more precise and purposeful in the second set. She jumped to a 2-0 lead and stretched it to 5-2. However, Ostapenko, who found her serving rhythm, fought back. Ankita kept her cool, ran hard during the rallies and placed the ball well to force errors from the Latvian. At 5-6, Ostapenko’s serve let her down again, taking the contest to the decider. After being treated for a hip strain, she got off to a smooth start in the third set. While the Latvian No. 2 became more confident and solid, Ankita’s accuracy failed her at a crucial juncture though she continued to put in the hard yards. Ankita played well above her ranking of 174, pushing a Grand Slam champion to the limit.  In the second singles, Anastasija Sevastova breezed past Karman Kaur Thandi 6-4, 6-0. After giving it her all in the first set, the latter ran out of steam as Sevastova made her scamper around the court. The reverse singles and doubles will be held on Saturday, and India will hope to come up with something special.  The results: Latvia leads India 2-0 (Jelena Ostapenko bt Ankita Raina 6-2, 5-7, 7-5; Anastasija Sevastova bt Karman Kaur Thandi 6-4, 6-0) .

17 April 2021||MONACO,||Rublev ends Nadal’s campaign||Stefanos Tsitsipas advanced to the semifinals of the Monte Carlo Masters on Friday when his quarterfinal opponent Alejandro Davidovich withdrew after losing the first set 7-5. Tsitsipas, the World No. 5, will play his sixth Masters 1000 semifinal on Saturday, and his first in the principality, against Englishman Dan Evans, who battled past Belgian David Goffin 5-7, 6-3, 6-4. Struggling with an injury to his left thigh, Spaniard Davidovich tried an underarm serve when facing set point. Tsitsipas pounced to hit a winning backhand return. Until he was hurt, Davidovich gave his Greek opponent problems. Thigh problems But at 3-3, Davidovich called for the doctor to treat his left thigh. He immediately managed the first break of the match, as Tsitsipas began to show signs of irritation, to the point of receiving a warning for swearing. Tsitsipas immediately broke back and as Davidovich struggled, broke again to end the set and the match.  Evans, who beat Novak Djokovic in the previous round, edged Goffin after the Belgian made 47 unforced errors, including a final forehand on match point, to win. Goffin also only converted two of the 17 break points. Evans was not very effective either, but he did win four of the nine break points. The 30-year-old Briton was playing in his first Masters 1000 quarterfinal on a clay court that is not his favourite surface. In another quarterfinal, defending champion Fabio Fognini was knocked out by Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-3.  The results:   Quarterfinals: Stefanos Tsitsipas bt Alejandro Davidovich 7-5, retd.; Dan Evans bt David Goffin 5-7, 6-3, 6-4; Casper Ruud bt Fabio Fognini 6-4, 6-3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tsitsipas-makes-the-semifinals/article34340469.ece
17 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Humpy eyes classical World crown||World rapid chess champion Koneru Humpy feels the best way to beat the pandemic, which has thrown the competitive circuit out of gear, is to work on her opening repertoire in pursuit of another dream of hers — winning the classical format World championship. Self-driven “I need to have a wider opening repertoire and am really working hard on that. I have been preparing on my own with my father-cum-coach (Koneru Ashok) being more of a mentor, giving invaluable inputs,” the 34-year-old Humpy told The Hindu . The champion from Vijayawada, who was recently adjudged Sportstar Aces Sportswoman-of-the-Decade (individual non-Olympic sports), said: “The pandemic was so unexpected, and it changed the whole world scenario. It is certainly disappointing not to be engaged in on-board chess battles. In fine form “I definitely would have loved to compete in more tournaments after winning the 2019 World rapid championship. I was in the kind of form that would have fetched a few more titles. If you remember, I won the Cairns Cup in the US after that World title,” she said. And, Humpy said, being joint-winners with Russia in the online Olympiad team gold in 2020 was one of the most memorable moments in her career. How do you look at your career now? “Basically I am not thinking about winning a tournament. I just want to enjoy the game. For many years, there were expectations that I would win the World championship. “Hence, the World champion tag is something I definitely cherish,” said the 34-year-old Humpy, who has featured in nine World championships. The biggest challenge now was remembering all the novelties she prepares before a major event, she said. “It is really demanding, which also means that I need to spend more time on preparations.” Natural skills She insisted that keeping pace with technological advances alone would not take a player far, natural skills had to be honed and improved. “There is a great future for Indian chess. But, we miss not having a chance to play in Super GM tournaments at home. The AICF’s plans of starting a League should do a world of good,” she said. “It will make players more professional,” Humpy concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/humpy-eyes-classical-world-crown/article34340729.ece
17 April 2021||Los Angeles,||Bucks’ balanced attack carries the day||Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 15 points on return from a six-game injury absence as Milwaukee Bucks used a balanced attack to beat Atlanta Hawks 120-109 on Thursday in Atlanta. Antetokounmpo finished well below his scoring average, but it didn't matter because he got plenty of help from his supporting cast as seven Bucks players finished in double figures. Hawks star Trae Young, returning from a calf injury that sidelined him for two games, also finished with 15 points. Meanwhile, Los Angeles fans took advantage of relaxed rules on attending sporting events.

17 April 2021||MUMBAI,||BCCI offers conditional support for cricket’s inclusion in LA Games||The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI’s) apex council on Friday offered conditional support for cricket’s inclusion in the 2028 Olympic Games. The marathon meeting on Friday night is understood to have decided to inform the International Cricket Council (ICC) that it will support the inclusion of men’s and women’s events in the quadrennial showpiece events only if the BCCI’s status as an autonomous sports federation is retained. The BCCI at present isn’t an affiliate of the Indian Olympic Association and is keen on participating in the Olympics without being a party to the proposed National Sports Code. While the apex council didn’t discuss the compensation package for domestic cricket stakeholders announced by the AGM last December in the wake of a curtailed domestic season, the council decided that the 2021-22 domestic season will start with the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Septmeber. It will then act an ideal curtain raiser for the T20 World Cup, to be played in India in October-November.

17 April 2021||Tokyo,||No cancellation, asserts Games chief||The head of the Tokyo Olympics on Friday was again forced to assure the world that the postponed Games would open in just over three months and not be cancelled despite surging COVID-19 cases in Japan. Organising committee president Seiko Hashimoto was asked at a news conference if there were any conditions under which the Olympics would be cancelled. Various concerns, but... “There are a variety of concerns but as the Tokyo 2020 organising committee we are not thinking about cancelling the Games," Hashimoto said. The question gained traction after the general secretary of ruling LDP, Toshihiro Nikai, on Thursday raised the possibility of cancellation of the Games. Nikai tried to backtrack later, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga issued a statement saying there was “no change to the government position to do everything to achieve safe and secure Olympics.” Hashimoto acknowledged Nikai's concern and suggested it was probably shared by the Japanese public. Polls show as many as 80% in Japan oppose holding the Olympics during the pandemic. COVID-19 cases have been rising across Japan. Despite this, the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo organisers are pressing on. The IOC, which relies on selling broadcast rights for 73% of its income, has seen its cash flow stalled by the postponement. On Thursday, the minister in charge of Japan’s vaccine rollout, Taro Kono, said even if the Olympics go on, there may be no fans at all at the venues. Fans from abroad have already been barred. No fans, however, might simplify matters. Organisers can then focus solely on the 15,400 Olympic and Paralympic athletes entering Japan, and keeping them in a bubble. Tens of thousands of judges, officials, media and broadcasters will also have to enter Japan. Daily tests Japanese Olympics Minister Tamayo Marukawa told reporters on Friday the government was considering daily virus tests on athletes during the Games as a way to guarantee safety.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-cancellation-asserts-games-chief/article34340517.ece
17 April 2021||MARGAO,||FC Goa looks to do its best||Having achieved a historic first-ever point in its previous match, FC Goa will look to put its best foot forward and hope for a victory in its second group match of the AFC Champions League against UAE’s Al Wahda here on Saturday. FC Goa became the first Indian team to earn a point in the tournament after a goalless draw against Qatar’s Al Rayyan in its opening Group E match on Wednesday. Now, Juan Ferrando’s men are expected to approach their next game differently, hoping to log three points against Al Wahda. The Abu Dhabi-based side holds the edge, having a superior continental experience with 12 previous appearances in the ACL, but FC Goa will take confidence from the fact that it could hold at bay repeated attacks from a strong Al Rayyan. Limited chances FC Goa had limited chances in front of the opposition goal in its previous match and Ferrando wants his players to be more adventurous in the attack. “We earned a point in the last match and we are obviously looking to improve and continue in the same way in our next match. It’s important to have control in the way we attack, especially in the final third,” Ferrando said ahead of Saturday’s match. “The most important aspect is to work as a unit and stay focused. “We did what was needed in the first game. I’m happy with how the team played in defence and we needed some improvements in attack.”  Key players Centre-back Gonzalez will have his task cut out while captain Edu Bedia will be the ever present force in the midfield. Jorge Ortiz and Ishan Pandita are expected to deliver the goals. Al Wahda will be coming into Saturday’s match after a 1-0 loss to Persepolis FC in its opening match on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fc-goa-looks-to-do-its-best/article34340725.ece
17 April 2021||Chennai,||Rossi has taught me everything: Morbidelli||The 2020 MotoGP season saw an exciting title fight and a new crop of winners emerge in the absence of six-time champion Marc Marquez, who missed the season due to an injury during the first round in Qatar. One such rider was Franco Morbidelli who quickly established himself as the new star on the horizon by finishing second in the championship with three wins and two podiums. The 26-year-old, groomed by legend Valentino Rossi since his junior days at the VR46 Riders Academy in Tavullia (Italy), has teamed up with his mentor at Petronas Yamaha SRT for the 2021 season. “VR 46 has taught me everything I know about professional racing. I have always been a quick rider throughout my early career, but the core of my knowledge about professional racing is made by the team at VR46,” said Morbidelli during a chat with The Hindu on Thursday. “Everything I know about being a pro rider — how to train, how to eat, how to behave — I have got it from Vale (Rossi),” he added. Now teammates, Morbidelli said he can learn more from the seven-time MotoGP champion. “Spending time in the same environment will give me a chance to learn other things. I don’t know which ones because I will know them just at that moment and imbibe them.” However, the 2021 season has not started well for the 2020 vice-champion with just four points from the first two races in Qatar. “It is tough, especially after the results I did throughout the second half of last season, to see myself struggling so much in the first two races. But this is MotoGP and if you’re not in the perfect shape, you lose many positions,” said Morbidelli. “(But) we have great trust in ourselves. We will have to regroup and face remaining races with great energy because we know what we can do.”  (MotoGP is live on Eurosport, Eurosport HD and live-streamed on Discovery+ from 3.30 p.m. on Sunday).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rossi-has-taught-me-everything-morbidelli/article34340514.ece

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Dhoni the heartbeat of CSK’||Mahendra Singh Dhoni may have joked about playing his 200th game in Chennai Super Kings’ yellow as a sign of him “getting old”, but head coach Stephen Fleming said the achievement is a testament to his commitment to the franchise. “He has been absolutely the heartbeat of CSK, there’s no doubt about it. Whether it’s performances, guidance or leadership… you run out of things to say about him,” Fleming said on Friday after CSK celebrated Dhoni’s milestone with its maiden win in IPL 2021. “His longevity also has to be mentioned and appreciated... to play 200 games and still have a desire to do well and perform well is a testament to his attitude towards the game and the franchise. I think the franchise has grown and MS has grown with it, so it’s a very good relationship and great fun.” For Punjab Kings, M. Shahrukh Khan gave a glimpse of his talent with a composed knock of 47. The Tamil Nadu youngster hopes to cash in on the wealth of knowledge shared by some of the stalwarts of the game. “Obviously I am new to the IPL. It’s different compared to domestic cricket. Getting to learn a lot of things, trying to improve my game 1% every session I go in,” Shahrukh said. “I am having conversations with Wasim Jaffer (batting coach) and Andy Flower (assistant coach), and they have been helping me with my batting.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dhoni-the-heartbeat-of-csk/article34340975.ece

After a mixed debut season last year, India’s F1 hopeful Jehan finds himself third in the Formula 2 standings after the first round in Bahrain where he finished second and fourth in the two sprint races before coming sixth in the feature race. The current season is being seen as a make or break one for the 22-year-old from Mumbai, who is aiming to become only the third Indian to reach Formula 1. Marko, who played a pivotal role in the career of four-time champion Sebastian Vettel and has produced umpteen Formula 1 drivers, said the aim for Jehan has to be to win the title and Red Bull will take it from there though there is no automatic entry to their junior team Alpha Tauri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jehan-has-to-deliver-consistently/article34341056.ece

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Songs of devotion||The Thevaram hymns are songs of devotion that are the outcome of divine inspiration and hence remain relevant to sincere devotees who wish to seek God. Among these, it is held that Siva graced and granted that the songs of the saint devotee Karaikal Ammaiyar would spread the cause of Saivism and foster Siva devotion among people, pointed out Selvi Lemuria Manickam in a discourse. From Sekkizhar’s account of her story, she emerges as a woman devotee with extraordinary viveka that makes her fully aware of the hurdles to true devotion. So she seeks a rare boon from Siva, to be granted to live as a mere skeleton without the physical frame. In this wish is subsumed the jnana that transcends the sense of pride in one’s physical appearance and inherent achievements and to aim for the ultimate goal, to be filled with the everlasting longing to be with the Lord. No wonder Sekkizhar records that the terrestrial and celestial worlds celebrate when Siva grants her wish. Living in a skeletal frame, she decides to visit the Lord in Kailasa. Not willing to climb the mountain with the feet, she walks on her head and hands all the way up. Parvati asks Siva about this strange display of love. Siva says, “She is the mother who worships us. She is going to spread the tenets of Saivism to the world.” He addresses her as ‘Ammaiye’ meaning mother. Ammaiyar is the title given exclusively to her by Siva. She falls at His feet and the boons she asks are pointers to mankind. She desires to cherish the undying bliss of devotion to Siva. She also wishes not to have any further births. In case she has to be born owing to karma she wants to never forget the love for Siva. Finally she wishes to remain at His feet and be an eternal witness to His renowned cosmic dance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/songs-of-devotion/article34340419.ece

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Light fare for warm days||One of the best potato curries I have ever eaten was at a Jain household, decades ago. The potatoes were soft but not mushy and had soaked in the flavours of the gravy. I later asked what the masalas were, assuming that there would be a long list. Nothing but hing (asafoetida) and cumin seeds, I was told. Since then, I have been a fan of Jain food, cooked without onions and garlic, and usually with just two or three spices. Last week, stuck at home and thinking wistfully about the next meal, I was struck by a yen for satvik food. I did some research and found a restaurant called Jain Annapurna Shudh Satvik Rasoi in Ramprasth Colony, just across the border from Vivek Vihar in East Delhi (Phone number: 9810836525). I was impressed by all that the menu offered: It had some nice veggie dishes served with the bread of your choice: lachcha parathas, rotis smeared with ghee, or plain rotis. We asked for the special masala puri thhali (Rs. 216), mung dal khichri in desi ghee (Rs. 152), muttar ki sabzi with tomatoes and zeera aloo with lachcha paratha (Rs. 172), and masaledar lauki tamatar ki sabzi with zeera aloo and ghee roti (Rs. 172). I started with the masala puri . A mix of spices had been kneaded into the dough. The fragrance and taste of ajwain in it gave the puri a nice punch, and I had it with the light potato curry and the muttar ki sabzi , which was mildly sweet and soft, but not soggy. The ghee-topped lachcha paratha was soft and layered, and went really well with the potato, cooked with tomatoes in a dry preparation. The lauki — bottle gourd — was pretty amazing too. The gourd had taken in the flavours of the light gravy, which had been simmered with tomatoes, cumin seeds and chillies. The rotis were soft, and made softer still with a dab of ghee. The mung dal khichri was the grand finale. It was deliciously light, though creamy and aromatic. What didn’t work was the raita , which had turned too sour. It reminded me of a dish called sannata, prepared with curd collected from different households for a village feast. This curd dish used to be so sour that it evoked total silence — or sannata ! The raita didn’t reach the sannata level but my lips stayed puckered for quite a while. I, however, enjoyed the food so much that I called up the rasoi and spoke to the lady in charge: Ritu Jain. The food was mostly cooked with hing , zeera , red chillies and desi ghee, she said. She wouldn’t tell me what the masalas in the puri were (it is a family secret, she said) but agreed that there was ajwain in it. How was the khichri so light? “Haath ka kamaal hai ( It’s all in the hand ),” she replied. I give her a big hand.

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||A picture paints a 1,000 cusswords||My publishers are demanding a decent picture for my author profile. They have rejected my attempt at passing off a 14-year-old photo as recent. That’s when my teenage niece, most generously, offers to peel herself off her phone and take me outdoors to photograph me haloed against the sunset from a nearby hilltop. So, here I am — struggling up this hill, huffing, hair soggy, kajal running ditchwater streaks down my cheeks — while she cheers me on, running ahead in her shiny pink shoes. Sweet child! She chirps, “Meanwhile, why don’t you film me running up the hill?” Five seconds later: “Just for peeps to see how I’m helping you out.” Five seconds after that: “Quick, now you’ve lost me. I’m so far ahead. Wait, I’ll run back.” She runs up and down seven times, while I stumble behind her, filming the video. “No, no, my ponytail isn’t swinging enough. Again!” I manage to get grass, pebbles, discarded chips packets, and on occasion, sky — when I go sprawling. She coos, “I love you. You’re totally saving my face.” Put like that, I have to save her face, even though it’s through filming her back. Remember how selflessly she offered to click my pic. “Oh, sorry, you need to rest. No more vids!’ says this golden-hearted child. ‘I’ll casually lean against this tree. Unposed pics are so it! Wait, does my neck look long enough?” I assure her it looks swanlike. “Eww, is it curved? Click again!” After 15 tries, she burst into tears. “This just isn’t my right profile. You have to take it from the right side.” Huh?! “My left side is my right side. Please please. I could never live down the shame if I post this.’ I give her 23 different versions of her left right side. She protests each time. “My eyes look manic, my legs are sooo fat, my smile is demented, my stomach looks like I’m having hippo babies — wait, I’ll suck in my breath, now from a 45 degree angle — didn’t you do geometry? Lean more… 1-2-3 shoot!” Finally: “Nooo! I look like I’m laying an egg! You secretly hate me, what did I ever do to you to get these awful pictures?” We do make it to the hilltop and while I collapse into a gasping, retching bundle, she clicks a pic. “Just as promised!” She trills happily. I look like an axe-murderer or worse, his victim. “No problem,” she says, “I’ll put filters. Deer eyes and rabbit whiskers. No one will even recognise you.” “It’s an author pic. I need to be recognised.” “Now!’ she shrieks. ‘The sun is setting. Capture me pushing it into the horizon. Now! Now! Eww, you missed it. I’m pushing nothing into nothing. Omg, I look mental. How will I ever go out in public again?” Not with me, for sure!

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Ascent of a woman||I remember writing some time ago, when we humans still went to cinema halls to watch movies, about the ghastly sari and jewellery ads one has to endure in Chennai theatres. Stuffed to the gills with giggling sakhis , havelis and hom kunds, the ads were extremely regressive. Now, just as OTT films are beginning to boldly suggest that Indians too might actually indulge in sex and nooky, so too are ads pushing the boundaries. The 96-year-old Kerala-based Bhima Jewellery’s latest film is quite a trailblazer even in a universe that has seen jewellery brands talk of single women, second marriage, and inter-religious weddings, although that last came in for tremendous flak from the new breed of haters that we have, umm, bred. Crafted as carefully as a movie, the Bhima ad traces the journey of a transwoman from childhood to marriage, each of her life’s milestones marked, of course, by pieces of jewellery — but gently and sensitively marked. The slow transformation of the brooding, unshaven young man with sad and unsure eyes into a beautiful, confident, laughing young woman takes just about 100 seconds to unravel but packs in a lifetime of hope and fulfilment. It’s a journey with one important facet — accepting parents. Instead of the usual horror and rejection that greet those who discover that their gender is different from their birth-assigned one, what greets the transwoman here is a very quiet but strong underpinning of love and support. From the ladies bicycle parked in the bedroom to the golden anklets gifted by the father to the mother waiting patiently while her son/daughter gets her ears pierced, each little thing moves towards the transformation. The film works also because it understates. There is no melodrama, no tears, no preaching. Each fleeting frame is packed with significance but subtly so. From the pink of the ice-cream stand to the rainbow hues of the bubbles she blows on the beach to the thoughtful stroking of the beard in the first scenes, everything is mined for meaning by the director, Bharat Sikka, but he does it so quietly it merges with the scenery. Most importantly, the transwoman emerges with dignity intact, both in her previous and present avatars. Avoiding the usual scenes of humiliation and transphobia might seem idealistic, and it probably is, but it achieves a crucial goal — it allows for a normalising and wholesome depiction of the trans body, making it as routine as a hetero body. More important, it presents an alternative way of responding to a trans person. When this comes wrapped in the consumerist glitter of jewellery, it carries the power to become more palatable than when delivered in the brown-paper packing of homilies. I have written before of an important role that advertising plays — that of iconography for the religion of consumerism. And while its end goal is indubitably to make people buy more, its collateral fallout in making people think differently has always been significant. There is a great deal of subconscious messaging going on through those 100 seconds — the grandmother braiding the protagonist’s hair indicates an older generation’s acceptance; the family’s lunch in a simple eatery signals that the parents aren’t ashamed to be seen with their son-now-become-daughter, a transformation that would after all have been wrought very publicly. There is an early scene where the protagonist sits alone in the kitchen, peering out at the street, at the larger world that she seems excluded from, but towards the end, the film suggests that internal acceptance — by one’s own self and by one’s near and dear ones — has brought the external world closer. That world, of course, includes the audience in its ambit. That’s the advantage advertising enjoys — it is able to inject conversations around enormously momentous and divisive issues right into drawing rooms and kitchens, disguised as just another jewellery ad. Chances are this film too, like the Tanishq one showing a Muslim mother-in-law and Hindu daughter-in-law, might be greeted with outrage. But chances also are that brands will keep making such films. Apparently, the idea came from Navya Suhas, a fourth-gen scion of the Bhima Bhattar family. Perhaps we are on the cusp of a generational change, where the millennials and Gen Zs are bored with the plethora of prejudices they are expected to carry. Perhaps they will be happier to just be and not judge. Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/ascent-of-a-woman/article34340902.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The squire from Tikli Bottom||There is nothing more poignant in a faraway land than stumbling across a remnant of your native culture, marooned thousands of miles away. I first encountered this sensation as a budding young travel writer one foggy Christmas outside Delhi. Turning up the drive, lined with Traveller Palms and pecking Guinea Fowl, a rose-pink bungalow came into view. Under the pillared portico, stood a tall Englishman with a polka-dot cravat and twinkling eyes. My host, Martin Howard, was an exuberant, Kipling-quoting, salty-humored old India hand, who, with his elegant wife, Annie, lived here, at the delightfully-named Tikli Bottom. Preparations were in full swing for a Christmas party. Annie, breezy in turquoise block print and beaming welcome, thrust some tinsel into my hand with the request, ‘Do decorate the camel’. The real joy of Tikli Bottom, in many ways an English estate with tropical fronds, was the community that the Howards created around them. The bungalow’s interiors were airy and serene, thanks to Annie’s eye, but they were also open to the much-loved local children, who bounced on the sofas and jumped in the swimming pool, like flocks of starlings. The couple had opened Tikli to paying guests and visitors came from New York, Edinburgh and Mumbai, including at least one member of the British Royal Family — all fascinated by this unique swansong of the Raj on the rural fringes of Gurgaon. Martin, who was 84 when he passed away last month, was born into a farming family on the East Coast of England. After a successful career as a naval engineer, he came to Delhi and landed a coveted role as Naval Advisor to the British High Commission. Martin had married Annie, as his second wife, on a snowy day in December 1979. The couple took to life among the Delhiwallahsand expats with aplomb. A directorship at the Delhi outpost of Rolls Royce kept them in India after Martin’s retirement from the British Navy and the subcontinent became their permanent home. Farmer at heart Their friendship with Anne Wright, of Kipling Camp fame, led to the Howards buying land near the Haryana village of Teekli and enabled Martin’s dream of returning to his farming roots. They built what Martin liked to call ‘a four-bedroom house with a courtyard — for the breezes’, in fact a Lutyens-inspired throwback to a more considered, languid age. Celebrated for their spirit, the couple became known for their own Anglo-Indian lifestyle, as British as cucumber sandwiches, and yet deeply rooted in their adopted culture. Martin was a squire, a plantsman, a storyteller and a buffalo farmer all at once. Diplomats, backpackers and retired prime ministers enjoyed sitting al fresco at his table, as he strewed bon mots and great chunks ofIfby Kipling. Education for all Martin was concerned about India’s growing population time bomb. He felt education to be key to progress, so in 2000 he founded a school, the first ever for the village. Now operating under an Indian-registered charity, the Baas Education Trust, it is an astonishing success story. “These children need to be told that the sky’s the limit,” he loved to say. “He recognised the importance of faith, but did not want religion to play a central role in his school,” Tom Homfray, the very first volunteer, told me. “He knew that it had the potential to sow division, when he was trying to achieve inclusivity... and unity.” An MBE honour was conferred on Martin by Prince Charles on the final afternoon of his 2017 India Tour. It was a moment of huge pride and recognition, although underplayed by the retired naval captain with characteristic modesty. He leaves behind three daughters, Joanna, Samantha and Tabatha. Perhaps this inspiring life is best summed up in the murmured epitaph of his widow Annie to me, spoken with all the simplicity of a long-held intimacy, “My boy did well.”  Cosmo Brockway is a travel and interiors author and his book,Glorious Hotels of India , is available at bookstores nationwide.   www.tiklibottom.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-squire-from-tikli-bottom/article34340901.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Horn and a hydrogen- fuelled future||Isolation, social distancing… terms we’ve become intimately familiar with now have been part of Mike Horn’s lexicon for almost 25 years. The South Africa-born Swiss adventurer is renowned for pitting himself against the most challenging of endeavours (often alone), be it swimming the Amazon River or climbing 8,000+ metres of the Gasherbrum 1 and 2 peaks sans supplementary oxygen. And all this with sustainability at its heart (bringing attention to melting ice caps and deforestation). It may be far-fetched to draw parallels between what Horn has been doing and what we dealt with during the pandemic, but 2020 did bring sustainability into sharp focus. “I think the pandemic has given us time to take a step back and think about where we are headed,” Horn says. “We can make big changes in the 30,000-32,000 days that we live. All seven billion people on the planet have to decide that we want our world to change.” Edited excerpts from an interview. How involved is Panerai in giving shape to your vision of exploration? Let me tell you a story. When I sailed to the Philippines, I had to change the axe of my radar. The piece of metal had taken me 27 times around the world, helped me cross Antarctica, the North Pole, sail to the Amazon, to the Sundarbans… and I thought, ‘Let’s make a watch out of it’. I gave the problem to Panerai [with whom he’s been associated since 2001], saying, ‘You make amazing timepieces but the metal has no story to tell. This piece has planted five million trees, cleaned beaches, taken plastic out of the ocean. It has taken me on explorations and has always brought me back alive.” Jean-Marc Pontroue [CEO] loved the idea. That’s how the five-piece Submersible EcoPangaea Tourbillon GMT 50mm Mike Horn edition was born. That also started the move towards building a watch that is 100% recycled. At last month’s Monaco Ocean Week, you spoke about hydrogen as the energy for the future.  Hydrogen moves the planets, so it can help us conserve ours. Carbon emission is our problem. Why not look at what we have all around us? Last year, when I participated in the Dakar car rally, I was criticised because, after crossing the North Pole [where I brought attention to the melting ice caps], I jumped into a diesel-powered car and drove across the desert. But I was there to see how we could change rally vehicles [Horn’s project, Gen-Z, aims to enter a competitive hydrogen-powered car in the 2023 rally]. When I first launched the research programme, everybody said it’s impossible. Then I approached the CEA [French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission] last year and, three months later, they came up with a solution. Now we are building 300 kilowatt hydrogen fuel cells that can generate 400 horse power. I think this is the future of mobility. Is aiming for carbon neutrality in the transport sector by 2050 a realistic target?  I think we need to invest now. We know that electric isn’t the solution; there is not enough lithium. Hydrogen was wrongly communicated as a dangerous substance to travel with; now it has been proven to be safe. It is the power source that can give us the distance we need. The new raid rally vehicle we are developing can give us 600 km from 30 kg of hydrogen and that is as much a combustion engine would do. Now the infrastructure should follow. How did you get interested in high latitude sailing?  It is the feeling of going somewhere that nobody else has been! In 2019, my custom-made boat, Pangaea [which uses a combination of solar and hydrogen fuel cell power], became the first to get to the highest point in the polar ocean. The tough part of high latitude sailing is that you are never sure of coming back alive. We need to have all the information to make decisions, so as to ensure the safety of the vessel and the lives of the crew. Last year, you sailed to Greenland and Svalbard.  It was the first time we went back to the polar region after the pandemic broke. The purpose was to research the impact of lockdown on the lives of whales [as they were not being hunted during the pandemic]. We recorded whale songs and had the opportunity to decode many patterns related to their behaviour and to compare them [before and after Covid-19].||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/horn-and-a-hydrogen-fuelled-future/article34340914.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Art 2021: Gallerists think small||Delhi Contemporary Art Week (DCAW), which concluded two days ago at Bikaner House, saw art lovers getting back to some of the old ways of enjoying the physicality of art — albeit just for a few hours and socially-distanced at that. What was interesting, however, was that of the sales clocked, many were first timers. “In the last few days alone, I sold around 10 works and only oneof the buyers was known to me,” says gallerist Bhavna Kakar of Latitude 28, explaining, “DCAW showcases younger, contemporary artists, and the idea is to engage new collectors. So the price is usually between Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 5 lakh.” The gentler price points meant someone in their 20s picked up Anupama Alias’ work, a young couple in their 30s, who’s renovating their home, bought a Prajwal Choudhury, and another couple from Kolkata acquired a Diptej Vernekar via Instagram. “The idea is not to be a shop and cater to the same buyers or do the same old tried and tested shows,” adds Kakar, who, two decades on, is experimenting more.  Themes for the win  Thanks to the pandemic, the art market had ground to a halt for months. Though galleries swung into action in the third quarter, taking art online and creating new ways for collectors to interact with the works on sale (through digital viewing rooms and walk-throughs), it was also a time to tap a new tribe of buyer — the young, digitally-savvy one. For many gallerists, this meant coming full circle, curating shows with accessible themes and affordable price tags, much like they had years ago when they were starting out. “In unprecedented times, art has been all about finding a way to go forward. Today, at Apparao Galleries we have doubled the number of shows we are doing because they are all virtual. And of them, three-quarters are by emerging artists and most are small format [targeting a young crowd that surfs the net],” says Sharan Apparao, Chennai-based gallerist and curator. Themed shows — like her latest group exhibition, Believing the Unbelievable: The Metaphor of The Ark, which takes off from the Biblical tale of Noah’s ark — not only help focus viewers’ attention, but also make it more interesting to build a narrative. Incidentally, it has done exceptionally well; aside from new buyers, several of her regulars picked up pieces too. “We want to do shows with younger artists to support them, since I find their works exciting and they don’t have visibility,” says Apparao, who set aside a few works for herself — canvases from Avani Aggarwal’s Utopia series (vibrant, multi-hued ‘clouds’ painted with archival inks) and Dushyant Patel’s art that interprets Noah’s story through an Indian lens (lots of elephants here). Going forward, she plans to have at least one themed exhibition a month with none of the artworks going beyond the Rs. 25,000 tag.  Talking print  A less conservative approach to acquiring art is also helping invigorate the market. If seasoned collectors pick up art as investment or because they have caught “the bug”, as Prateek Raja, co-founder of Kolkata’s premier art gallery, Experimenter, puts it, “most young collectors buy it to live with it. These are interesting conversations because you are involved not just with the aesthetic idea of art, but also the living idea of it”. And what they want to live with needn’t always be the big names. “I’d been seeing a new breed of people who are interested in art, music and culture coming to our shows in the last couple of years, but not able to get entry point art. They didn’t care much for the name; they wanted something interesting, cool,” says Kakar. Then, when she curated Matter in Matrix , a 2020 show dedicated to printmaking — with prices starting as low as Rs. 10,000 — young buyers came in droves. She recalls how even students wanted to buy artworks. “We realised this is the way to go about it. You have to pick the right work by the right artist and position it in such a manner that the younger crowd feel interested in buying it.” The ongoing exhibition, Pratibimb : Stories in Print , at Gallery1000A (Lado Sarai, Delhi), featuring women artists, including Anjolie Ela Menon, Kanchan Chander, and Durga Kainthola, underscores the point — it’s had a great run with multiple sales. “Printmaking such as etching, woodcut and silkscreen, is a democratic art form, since it’s not only affordable [between Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 2 lakh] but, because of their many editions, they also have greater reach,” says curator Rajan Shripad Fulari, a printmaker himself. The gallery has several more themed shows planned, including one in July by artists from the South.  Art on EMI  But what does one do when even the most affordable artwork is still beyond one’s budget? Many galleries now offer long term payment plans. Like the Experimenter. Known for their work with artists through projects like Experimenter Labs — its Generator Co-operative Art Production Fund encourages supporters to anonymously donate funds to artists — they also pride themselves in nurturing an organic relationship with collectors. “A lot of youngsters are buying art now because of the new spaces they’ve moved into, be it their homes or offices. But they don’t [always] have the bandwidth to acquire expensive works of art,” says Raja. Like a young fashion professional who wanted to buy a particular piece by photographer Sohrab Hura, known for his vivid, surreal frames. “He couldn’t afford it, but he couldn’t let go of it either. So, after he confirmed [the purchase] last June, he’s been paying a monthly amount, which will end in May.” This practice isn’t as uncommon in the art world today as it used to be, thanks to the needs of a newer audience. As Kakar puts it, “That’s how I started my collection 22 years ago, so why not offer the same now.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/art-2021-gallerists-think-small/article34340950.ece

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Should you go high or low?||With the relentless rise in urban population there is pressure on land, and vertical growth is the only option available to developers. Most housing projects that are currently in the pipeline in cities like Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru are high-rises. In fact, with more than 53 skyscrapers (buildings >150 m tall), Mumbai has the maximum number of high-rises in India. It is ranked 22nd on the list along with Miami which also has the same number of skyscrapers. Following the high-rise culture of its immediate neighbour Mumbai, Pune’s high-rise trend started in the city’s prime areas and gradually moved to the suburbs, providing aspirational home buyers a hitherto unavailable option. According to property consultant JLL, some of the prominent areas in Pune where high-rises either already exist or are coming up include Kharadi, Hadapsar, Kalyani Nagar in East Pune and Hinjewadi as well as areas in and close to Wakad and Pimple Nilakh in West Pune. The eastern corridor has taken the lead in such developments, but the western corridor is also fast catching up. What matters There is a certain aspirational factor involved in living on higher floors. Developers are aware of this and typically charge a ‘floor-rise premium’ on higher-floor flats. Floor rise premium varies from city to city. It may surprise you to know that it is usually based on the prevailing climatic conditions. For instance, in Delhi NCR, due to the intense heat in summer, home buyers usually have to pay a premium for flats on the lower floors. In cities like Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru, the trend is reversed — higher floors cost more. Preferential location charges may range anywhere between Rs. 25 and Rs. 100 per sq. ft. or more and are added to the total cost of the apartment. Opting for a higher floor? Despite the better views and reduced road noise and pollution, are higher floors always more desirable? Regardless of whether one is looking to buy or rent an apartment, here are some factors to consider while choosing the floor:  Window view: Most buyers considering flats in skyscrapers are attracted by the superior views that higher floors provide. For apartments located near the sea, golf green or some other scenic area, the view is definitely a major factor.  Privacy: Lower floors generally do not offer much privacy especially if the building is located near a main road or busy area. If the housing complex is in a congested location, a higher floor is likely to be more peaceful. Whether or not people on lower floors have less privacy than those on the higher floors depends on the area and building plan. For example, modern integrated townships are planned in such a manner that every home offers sufficient privacy.  Noise and air pollution: In the case of high-rises in congested urban areas, lower floors are closer to roads. This can significantly impact both serenity and air quality. If one is considering a lower-floor flat in such an area, it is wise to visit it during high traffic hours to establish if this is a problem.  Security and fire safety: Most buyers feel that the ground and second floors are not as safe as higher floors. If one chooses a lower floor, the housing complex must offer exceptionally good security arrangements. Nevertheless, residents on lower floors have a distinct advantage when it comes to emergency fire evacuation or elevator breakdowns. Again, much depends on whether the housing complex offers state-of-the-art safety facilities.  Elevators : To ensure safety for all on the higher floors of skyscrapers, the developer will need to provide multiple lifts backed by fail-safe emergency power backup. Buyers considering a flat on a higher floor must establish whether the tower has at least two elevators. This is especially significant if there are elders and children in the resident’s family.  Light and ventilation: While it is generally true that flats on higher floors tend to enjoy superior natural lighting and air circulation, much also depends on the nature and exact location of the building. For instance, in a modern integrated township, there are usually sufficient open green spaces to ensure that natural light and fresh air reach all floors. However, this is certainly not true with all high-rises, especially if they are in the middle or an urban concrete heat island.  Cellular coverage: In many older high-rises, flats on very high floors may not have decent cellular signal reception. In the case of modern buildings, builders often install boosters and repeaters to ensure uniform coverage on all floors. Again, this is something one needs to check first-hand before making a decision.  Power consumption and maintenance: In the past, people living on lower floors tended to get a lower electricity bill because these floors require less cooling. Again, much depends on what the climatic conditions in a particular city are. Another important factor is how modern the building is — at least in the latest ultra-modern towers, developers use new construction designs and technologies which effectively eliminate this concern.  Rent generation potential: In some cities, rental returns may depend on whether the flat is on a lower or higher floor. This is usually a function of the city’s climate. For investors, this is an important aspect to consider. Tenants in most cities prefer flats on higher floors, but the scenario changes in other cities — for example, lower floors are usually the preferred choice for home seekers in Chennai and Delhi-NCR. So, should you choose a higher or lower floor in a high-rise apartment project? The answer to this question will change according to the city, exact location, nature of the project, and the capabilities of its builder. In modern integrated townships which are located in more spacious open environments, it is usually just a matter of personal preference. However, it is a very pertinent question to ask if the flat being considered is in a congested city centre area.

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||PE inflows up by 19%||Against all expectations, Indian real estate has recorded its highest-ever PE investments since FY16. Anarock Capital’s report titled Flux – FY20-21 Market Monitor for Capital Flows highlights that despite COVID-19, more than $6.27 billion was pumped into the sector in FY21, as against $5.8 billion in FY20 — an increase of 19% in one year. Unlike earlier, FY21 saw private equity investors focus primarily on portfolio deals across multiple cities and assets, rather than specific projects or cities. Such portfolio deals constituted 73% of the overall share, with approx. $4,583 million invested via portfolio deals in multiple cities. The average ticket size of PE deals rose by 62% in the fiscal year — from $110 million in FY20 to $178 million in FY21. Both structured debt and equity witnessed strong growth during the year at 84% and 15% respectively. Structured debt was largely towards portfolio deals instead of project-level assets. Covid impact Though FY21 was an unprecedented year due to the pandemic, foreign PE funds showed much optimism for India. As much as 93% of the total PE investments pumped into Indian real estate were by foreign investors. In actual terms, investments by foreign PE funds almost doubled from $3 billion to $5.8 billion in FY21. In contrast, domestic PE funds invested merely $300 million compared to $420 million in FY20. Shobhit Agarwal, MD & CEO at Anarock Capital says, “Foreign funds are evidently very upbeat about India. High-grade rental-generating assets have attracted foreign investors in a big way during the year. Moreover, India has a strong underlying demand for office space with quality workforce and average rentals available at less than a dollar per sq. ft. per month.” Alongside, successful REIT listings have provided a good monetising option for PE investors, he says, adding that they have led to a stronger demand for good quality rental earning office and retail assets. “Good entry valuation coupled with the option to accumulate a healthy mix of portfolio assets have also driven this surge in foreign PE investments. During the year, PE funds like Blackstone and Brookfield have added a lot of assets to their existing portfolios, while others have takeover loan portfolios of NBFCs.” Asset-wise Among other significant trends, the share of asset classes like commercial, retail and hotel has been very good. While the asset class-wise bifurcation shows lower percentage, when considered along with portfolio deals (where bifurcation is not available), the share of these asset classes is strong. Nearly 66% of the total inflows ($ 6.27 billion) in FY21 were across portfolio deals in multiple asset classes. In contrast, in FY20, out of the total $5.28 billion total inflows, just 8% of the total comprised portfolio deals. Now trending Among the foreign PE investors, who remained major contributors for overall PE inflows in India, Canada and US-based investors pumped in more than 50% of the total foreign PE investments in FY21.  REITs enjoyed wider acceptance in the country; healthy fundraising continued in public market, REIT sizes — $608 million Mindspace and $514 million Brookfield India REIT.  The industrial and logistics sector had strong investor support. Key emerging trends in this sector — rise of automation, urban multi-level warehousing, de-centralisation, increasing business consolidation, and high demand for Grade A assets.  Data centres are becoming the new sunrise sector, gaining more attention from PE investors and strategic investors.  Last-mile funding gaining momentum — SWAMIH fund and various foreign funds actively evaluating various options.  Stressed asset resolution started seeing traction; NCLT cases started to move towards conclusion.

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s time to brunch||Brunches were born — supposedly in Europe — to provide a repast for late-night party revellers. Since then, they’ve become a part and parcel of every society. Let’s face it; they’re wonderful to host since they let you start late in the day (by noon), allow you to spend the afternoon with family or friends eating, drinking coffee/your choice of tipple, and leave you with your evenings free. Brunches are terrific for any occasion — Sunday is a good day as is any holiday. The day after, be it the day after a festival or birthday party, is also ideal. The best part about brunch is that you can do as you please – brunches can range from casual to formal, and you can serve up any kind of food. How do you host the best brunch?  First things first. Don’t try and do everything. Let other people help put in simple ways — someone may want to bring in a couple of bottles of wine, another may want to put together the dessert. Don’t refuse offers of help!  Stunning cocktails. Put together some fresh-squeezed orange juice and set up a mimosa bar. Set out pretty pitchers of juice and chilled bottles of champagne, and let people make their own mimosas. Or else, you can try Bloody Marys or Bellinis! Letting people make their own drinks and nibble on some light starters — nuts, olives or crostini — leaves you free to add the finishing touches to your meal and greet your guests.  Keep it simple, yet memorable. Offer a main course and plenty of sides. So maybe a pasta dish with a salad, quiches and garlic bread. Or parathas with a salad and raita, followed by a couple of Indian desserts. Other options include combinations with scrambled eggs, frittatas, quiches, pies, roasted hash browns, sandwiches, French toast, fruit, and muffins (or other baked goodies). An ideal brunch menu should include a main course (can go for both sweet and savoury), a meat/egg item, salad, fruit, breads, drinks and hot beverages. Prep ahead as much as you can. Cakes, muffins and early prep dishes (like French toast) are good options.     Plate things right. If we’ve learnt one thing from watching all those episodes of Masterchef Australia , it’s that plating is as important as the cooking! Consider the tablescape when setting out the food: tableware, linen, decorations and food must be parts that form a unified, fun whole.  Consider setting up pre-sliced items. That does away with the problem of struggling to get a slice of pizza. Guests can taste small bits instead of taking (and sometimes wasting) huge portion sizes.  End things with a wonderful cup of coffee. A coffee maker is great if you have it, but let’s face it, even powdered coffee doesn’t taste bad. Or else, serve up mugs of steaming hot chocolate — with a dollop of liqueur — to round things off in style. Party favours.Let there be a takeaway, a party favour, for every guest! How about DIY a week ahead? Personalised wine glasses, monogrammed napkins, scented candles, and spas in jars are bye-bye gifts that will have your guests hankering to return to another brunch.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/its-time-to-brunch/article34340956.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||PE investments in numbers||As per property consultancy Knight Frank India’s latest research report titled Investments in Real Estate - Trends in PE Investment (Q1 2021 update) , Indian real estate attracted private equity (debt + equity) investments of $3,241 million across 19 deals in Q1 2021 (January – March) period. In the first quarter of 2021, the investment in the sector has grown by 16 times compared to USD 199 million in Q1 2020. Report highlights The investments in Q1 2021 in value terms were ~80% of that witnessed in full year 2020 and ~48% of full year 2019. The strong momentum in Q1 2021 was predominantly driven by two major factors: a spill over of certain deals from 2020 and the rise in investor confidence due to the drop in COVID-19 infections during early parts of Q1 2021, which had created some ripples of positivity in the economy. The sustainability of this momentum in investors’ sentiments will therefore depend on how soon the second wave of infection subsides and also the pace of vaccination. Of the total PE investments in real estate, the office segment attracted 71% share, followed by retail at 15%, residential and warehousing with 7% each respectively. Explaining the investment trend in the real estate industry, Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director, Knight Frank India says, “The deal street market of Indian real estate witnessed an impressive surge in both value and volume of private equity investments in the first quarter of 2021, when compared to the entire year of 2020. Office assets continue to be the preferred segment attracting over 70% of PE investments Q1 2021 as the segment moves towards maturity which includes sustained demand, stability in rental income and change in ownership profile over long -term. Investors are expecting demand to recuperate faster as the pace of vaccination increases.” While Q1 2021 has been an encouraging quarter for PE investments, however, the upward trajectory can be impacted by the rising second wave of COVID-19 infections in India which started in the month of April 2021. “The sustainability of revival in investor sentiments will therefore depend on how soon the second wave of infection subsides and the pace of vaccination,” he added. Trends in PE (equity only) in office assets The office market remained the preferred segment for investors due to the strong fundamentals (availability of large English speaking STEM talent, relatively low rentals, established knowledge outsourcing ecosystem) of the Indian office market. Since 2011, the segment has garnered $18,361 million of equity investments. In Q1 2021, the segment transacted seven deals amounting to $2,148 million. Around 31.5 million sq.ft. of the office assets were transacted in Q1 2021. 25% of the PE (equity) investments in office segments since 2011 have pumped into new development and under-construction projects. The primary reason for this is the paucity of mature transactable assets in the Indian office market. In the latest period — Q1 2021, the trend accentuated further, with 55% of PE investments in new development and under-construction projects. In 2016, ~86% of the investments were into ready assets and only ~14% were into new development and under-construction projects. Trends in PE (Debt + Equity) in residential assets In Q1 2021, the residential sector witnessed seven deals worth $234 million, which was 64% of the total investments that were witnessed during the entire 2020 and 38% of that in 2019. In volume terms (number of deals), the investment activity touched 100% of 2020 levels and 39% of 2019 levels. With government interventions and other measures, post the lockdown was lifted between Q2 and Q3 2020, All-India residential sales grew by 5% YoY in Q4 2020 and by 44% YoY in Q1 2021.   In Q1 2021, Mumbai took the largest quantum of residential investment (equity + debt) worth $144 million, followed by the NCR with $55 million and Chennai by $24 million.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/pe-investments-in-numbers/article34340960.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Redefining our urban spaces||Indian cities are not only known for their density but their complex hybrid structure. Ceaseless migration has forced urban spaces to alter in order to accommodate the multiple needs and aspirations of its residents.I Therefore, it is not surprising to see multiple layers of infrastructure and civic developments taking over our urban spaces, and in the process, a loss of local identity and history. This development not only takes away from a city’s heterogeneous nature but also raises concerns about the ecology, sustainability, marginalisation and more specifically the quality of its public spaces. Recognising the need to engage the public in a conversation on the evolving urban scene and its public spaces, the Indian Urban Designers Institute, Karnataka Chapter (IUDI-Karnataka), proposed to initiate a dialogue on urban issues with people from various segments. The two-day programme, titled ‘City Futures’, was held last month at the Bangalore International Centre. The event also had a panel discussion on ‘Envisioning Bengaluru’, that involved stakeholders from governing bodies and citizen forums. A presentation on ‘City Narratives’ showcased changemakers who are working towards transforming the city, and it elaborated on their individual work. The programme also had an exhibition of curated urban design works titled ‘City Futures: Bengaluru Speaks’. This exhibition will subsequently be taken to tier-II cities, including Belagavi, Hubballi, Mysuru, and Mangalore, to engage the public. Transforming cities “Tier-II cities are growing rapidly and it is important to address the direction of their growth before they deteriorate,” says architect U. Seema Maiya, Media Coordinator, IUDI-Karnataka. According to her, everyone raises issues, with some offering solutions, “but we need to look beyond the solutions as the subtle things that go beyond the design have their strong impact”. The objective of starting the dialogue was to bring together people with varied visions and backgrounds, and start the collaboration on a larger forum where the agendas attended to go beyond specific projects. This not only forges partnerships but also creates mutual responsibility and accountability, she adds. “Communities have to connect and carry forward what is initiated, and what can be done at a larger policy level needs to be looked into.” Since every urban space comes with its own unique history, it is also important to identify what should be conserved. “All spaces can be repurposed and hence the question would be which ones and how should they be,” states Maiya. When there is clarity on how the future of the urban space is to be envisioned and the community takes ownership to build and maintain, the ensuing transformation would be one that is comfortable, friendly and sustainable, she sums up. Urban experience Be it looking at the neighbourhood park as a thickset of trees akin to a natural forest, reclaiming the fast disappearing historic fabric of the neighbourhood, or rejuvenating the almost non-existent water body in the locality, the discussion aims to focus on the expected quality as well as the experience that an urban space should offer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/redefining-our-urban-spaces/article34340964.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||PE inflows up by 19%||Against all expectations, Indian real estate has recorded its highest-ever PE investments since FY16. Anarock Capital’s report titled Flux – FY20-21 Market Monitor for Capital Flows highlights that despite COVID-19, more than $6.27 billion was pumped into the sector in FY21, as against $5.8 billion in FY20 — an increase of 19% in one year. Unlike earlier, FY21 saw private equity investors focus primarily on portfolio deals across multiple cities and assets, rather than specific projects or cities. Such portfolio deals constituted 73% of the overall share, with approx. $4,583 million invested via portfolio deals in multiple cities. The average ticket size of PE deals rose by 62% in the fiscal year — from $110 million in FY20 to $178 million in FY21. Both structured debt and equity witnessed strong growth during the year at 84% and 15% respectively. Structured debt was largely towards portfolio deals instead of project-level assets. Covid impact Though FY21 was an unprecedented year due to the pandemic, foreign PE funds showed much optimism for India. As much as 93% of the total PE investments pumped into Indian real estate were by foreign investors. In actual terms, investments by foreign PE funds almost doubled from $3 billion to $5.8 billion in FY21. In contrast, domestic PE funds invested merely $300 million compared to $420 million in FY20. Shobhit Agarwal, MD & CEO at Anarock Capital says, “Foreign funds are evidently very upbeat about India. High-grade rental-generating assets have attracted foreign investors in a big way during the year. Moreover, India has a strong underlying demand for office space with quality workforce and average rentals available at less than a dollar per sq. ft. per month.” Alongside, successful REIT listings have provided a good monetising option for PE investors, he says, adding that they have led to a stronger demand for good quality rental earning office and retail assets. “Good entry valuation coupled with the option to accumulate a healthy mix of portfolio assets have also driven this surge in foreign PE investments. During the year, PE funds like Blackstone and Brookfield have added a lot of assets to their existing portfolios, while others have takeover loan portfolios of NBFCs.” Asset-wise Among other significant trends, the share of asset classes like commercial, retail and hotel has been very good. While the asset class-wise bifurcation shows lower percentage, when considered along with portfolio deals (where bifurcation is not available), the share of these asset classes is strong. Nearly 66% of the total inflows ($ 6.27 billion) in FY21 were across portfolio deals in multiple asset classes. In contrast, in FY20, out of the total $5.28 billion total inflows, just 8% of the total comprised portfolio deals. Now trending Among the foreign PE investors, who remained major contributors for overall PE inflows in India, Canada and US-based investors pumped in more than 50% of the total foreign PE investments in FY21.  REITs enjoyed wider acceptance in the country; healthy fundraising continued in public market, REIT sizes — $608 million Mindspace and $514 million Brookfield India REIT.  The industrial and logistics sector had strong investor support. Key emerging trends in this sector — rise of automation, urban multi-level warehousing, de-centralisation, increasing business consolidation, and high demand for Grade A assets.  Data centres are becoming the new sunrise sector, gaining more attention from PE investors and strategic investors.  Last-mile funding gaining momentum — SWAMIH fund and various foreign funds actively evaluating various options.  Stressed asset resolution started seeing traction; NCLT cases started to move towards conclusion.  Anarock Property Consultants   Nearly 66% of the total inflows ($ 6.27 billion) in FY21 were across portfolio deals in multiple asset classes. In FY20, out of the total $5.28 billion total inflows, just 8% of the total comprised portfolio deals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/pe-inflows-up-by-19/article34340967.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||A picture paints a 1,000 cusswords||My publishers are demanding a decent picture for my author profile. They have rejected my attempt at passing off a 14-year-old photo as recent. That’s when my teenage niece, most generously, offers to peel herself off her phone and take me outdoors to photograph me haloed against the sunset from a nearby hilltop. So, here I am — struggling up this hill, huffing, hair soggy, kajal running ditchwater streaks down my cheeks — while she cheers me on, running ahead in her shiny pink shoes. Sweet child! She chirps, “Meanwhile, why don’t you film me running up the hill?” Five seconds later: “Just for peeps to see how I’m helping you out.” Five seconds after that: “Quick, now you’ve lost me. I’m so far ahead. Wait, I’ll run back.” She runs up and down seven times, while I stumble behind her, filming the video. “No, no, my ponytail isn’t swinging enough. Again!” I manage to get grass, pebbles, discarded chips packets, and on occasion, sky — when I go sprawling. She coos, “I love you. You’re totally saving my face.” Put like that, I have to save her face, even though it’s through filming her back. Remember how selflessly she offered to click my pic. “Oh, sorry, you need to rest. No more vids!’ says this golden-hearted child. ‘I’ll casually lean against this tree. Unposed pics are so it! Wait, does my neck look long enough?” I assure her it looks swanlike. “Eww, is it curved? Click again!” After 15 tries, she burst into tears. “This just isn’t my right profile. You have to take it from the right side.” Huh?! “My left side is my right side. Please please. I could never live down the shame if I post this.’ I give her 23 different versions of her left right side. She protests each time. “My eyes look manic, my legs are sooo fat, my smile is demented, my stomach looks like I’m having hippo babies — wait, I’ll suck in my breath, now from a 45 degree angle — didn’t you do geometry? Lean more… 1-2-3 shoot!” Finally: “Nooo! I look like I’m laying an egg! You secretly hate me, what did I ever do to you to get these awful pictures?” We do make it to the hilltop and while I collapse into a gasping, retching bundle, she clicks a pic. “Just as promised!” She trills happily. I look like an axe-murderer or worse, his victim. “No problem,” she says, “I’ll put filters. Deer eyes and rabbit whiskers. No one will even recognise you.” “It’s an author pic. I need to be recognised.” “Now!’ she shrieks. ‘The sun is setting. Capture me pushing it into the horizon. Now! Now! Eww, you missed it. I’m pushing nothing into nothing. Omg, I look mental. How will I ever go out in public again?” Not with me, for sure! Where Jane De Suza, author of Flyaway Boy, pokes her nose into our perfect lives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/a-picture-paints-a-1000-cusswords/article34341188.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Ajeeb Daastaans & the four shorts formula||In the past year, several anthologies, such as Unpaused and Paava Kadhaigal, have made it to OTT platforms, following the tried-and-tested formula of four short films under one umbrella loosely tied together by a common theme. In the latest anthology, Ajeeb Daastaans , four stories are built around fractured relationships — and unusual ways of navigating them. In Shashank Khaitan’s Majnu , Jaideep Alhawat and Fatima Sana Shaikh find themselves in a knotty love triangle at a brooding haveli . In Neeraj Ghaywan’s Geeli Pucchi (Sloppy Kisses), the strongest film in the anthology, two women (Konkona Sensharma and Aditi Rao Hydari) who work in a factory are drawn to each other as they grapple with their widely diverse identities. In Raj Mehta’s dark drama Khilauna (Toy), actors Nushrratt Bharuccha, Abhishek Banerjee and child actor Inayat Verma stumble through toxic alleys of elite apathy as their days living in a shanty take a bizarre turn. In Kayoze Irani’s quietly poetic Ankahi , Shefali Shah and Manav Kaul strike a special connection that unfolds in unexpected ways. The films travel a full arc, with biting twists in the tales. Some are subtle, others startling. Produced by Karan Johar’s Dharmatic Entertainment, the contrasting stories are located in a variety of lived-in spaces as the characters work through strands of dysfunctional love, jealousy, prejudice, oppression, loneliness, and revenge. Exploring patriarchy Where did the ideas come from? For Ghaywan, the film was a track that was on his mind when he was writing his first film, Masaan , many years ago. “But it was too ajeeb [strange] for Masaan , so I thought here is an opportunity for me to make something different and I jumped at it,” says the director over a Zoom interview. Hydari, who appreciated the sensitivity of Ghaywan’s first film, adds, “Saying yes to the film was a no-brainer. It was a world and a working style that was very different and I wanted to experience a film like this.” The film, says Ghaywan, gave him the chance to talk about the largely unexplored intersection of caste, class, gender, and sexuality in India. “For example, Koko [Konkona] and Aditi’s characters come from different backgrounds, yet their experience of patriarchy is the same,” he says. One of the ajeeb elements he wove into the film was playing with the classic idea of a manic pixie dream girl through Hydari’s character. “I feel it’s such a male gaze and is so prevalent and I wanted to subvert it,” he says. Preparation involved several discussions on the history of politics and caste to let it seep into the actors. Sensharma was spotted on set reading Yashica Dutt’s Coming Out as a Dalit , but Ghaywan also relied heavily on the raw energy of the actors, both of whom he said have a different process. “Koko wants to understand every bit of it and Aditi’s process is more being in the moment.” Across the divide In Khilauna , which also explores the dynamics of class divide, the title runs as a telling metaphor through the story. What attracted Raj Mehta of Good Newwz to the film is that it could be interpreted in many ways. “Sumit [Saxena], the writer, built the story around a real incident. It’s about different kinds of people trying to survive…. They have common traits and that blurs the differences between them,” he says, adding that it was a tricky subject to navigate, especially with a child at the centre. His lead actor, Bharuccha, was taken in by the ending. “I did not see it coming. It’s a very bold, brave move and we did it without toning it down,” she says. Prepping for her role of a domestic worker meant she had to shoot herself mopping the floor at home and send it to Mehta to prove she could do it. “I like doing a role I haven’t done before. It was different and challenging. The method to my madness is just to have fun with it,” says the Pyaar Ka Punchnama actor. Shifting sensibilities Coming off the back of a tremendous amount of global content released on OTT platforms during the pandemic, Ajeeb Daastaans caters to an audience whose tastes have shifted. Mehta believes it’s time to raise the bar. “Writers are going to change the game and directors have to take it forward. The audience has definitely evolved and you can’t just give them the old, dated stuff,” he says. Bharuccha adds that “it’s a great time to be an actor”, with a lot more possibilities and experimentation in the works. The pandemic has also shifted sensibilities.“The way I look at the world has changed a bit. My sensitivity towards urban apathy, one of my favourite subjects that I keep exploring, has changed. I got to see it first hand,” says Ghaywan. Has it then become easier to tell stories that push the boundaries of Hindi cinema? “That Karan Johar and Netflix have come together to make a film like this is a healthy sign of changing times and how there is freedom to make these kinds of films,” says Ghaywan. The anthology, he says, shows that “there is no black or white. There are shades of everything in our lives”.

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Ascent of a woman||I remember writing some time ago, when we humans still went to cinema halls to watch movies, about the ghastly sari and jewellery ads one has to endure in Chennai theatres. Stuffed to the gills with giggling sakhis , havelis and hom kunds, the ads were extremely regressive. Now, just as OTT films are beginning to boldly suggest that Indians too might indulge in sex and nooky, so too are ads pushing the boundaries. The 96-year-old Kerala-based Bhima Jewellery’s latest film is quite a trailblazer even in a universe that has seen jewellery brands talk of single women, second marriage, and inter-religious weddings, although that last came in for tremendous flak from the new breed of haters that we have, umm, bred. Crafted as carefully as a movie, the Bhima ad traces the journey of a transwoman from childhood to marriage, each of her life’s milestones marked, of course, by pieces of jewellery — but gently and sensitively marked. The slow transformation of the brooding, unshaven young man with sad and unsure eyes into a beautiful, confident, laughing young woman takes just about 100 seconds to unravel but packs in a lifetime of hope and fulfilment. It’s a journey with one important facet — accepting parents. Instead of the usual horror and rejection that greet those who discover that their gender is different from their birth-assigned one, what greets the transwoman here is a very quiet but strong underpinning of love and support. From the ladies bicycle parked in the bedroom to the golden anklets gifted by the father to the mother waiting patiently while her son/daughter gets her ears pierced, each little thing moves towards the transformation. The film works also because it understates. There is no melodrama, no tears, no preaching. Each fleeting frame is packed with significance but subtly so. From the pink of the ice-cream stand to the rainbow hues of the bubbles she blows on the beach to the thoughtful stroking of the beard in the first scenes, everything is mined for meaning by the director, Bharat Sikka, but he does it so quietly it merges with the scenery. Most importantly, the transwoman emerges with dignity intact, both in her previous and present avatars. Avoiding the usual scenes of humiliation and transphobia might seem idealistic, and it probably is, but it achieves a crucial goal — it allows for a normalising and wholesome depiction of the trans body, making it as routine as a hetero body. More important, it presents an alternative way of responding to a trans person. When this comes wrapped in the consumerist glitter of jewellery, it carries the power to become more palatable than when delivered in the brown-paper packing of homilies. I have written before of an important role that advertising plays — that of iconography for the religion of consumerism. And while its end goal is indubitably to make people buy more, its collateral fallout in making people think differently has always been significant. There is a great deal of subconscious messaging going on through those 100 seconds — the grandmother braiding the protagonist’s hair indicates an older generation’s acceptance; the family’s lunch in a simple eatery signals that the parents aren’t ashamed to be seen with their son-now-become-daughter, a transformation that would after all have been wrought very publicly. There is an early scene where the protagonist sits alone in the kitchen, peering out at the street, at the larger world that she seems excluded from, but towards the end, the film suggests that internal acceptance — by one’s own self and by one’s near and dear ones — has brought the external world closer. That world, of course, includes the audience in its ambit. That’s the advantage advertising enjoys — it is able to inject conversations around enormously momentous and divisive issues right into drawing rooms and kitchens, disguised as just another jewellery ad. Chances are this film too, like the Tanishq one showing a Muslim mother-in-law and Hindu daughter-in-law, might be greeted with outrage. But chances also are that brands will keep making such films. Apparently, the idea came from Navya Suhas, a fourth-gen scion of the Bhima Bhattar family. Perhaps we are on the cusp of a generational change, where the millennials and Gen Zs are bored with the plethora of prejudices they are expected to carry. Perhaps they will be happier to just be and not judge.

17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The squire from Tikli Bottom||There is nothing more poignant in a faraway land than stumbling across a remnant of your native culture, marooned thousands of miles away. I first encountered this sensation as a budding young travel writer one foggy Christmas outside Delhi. Turning up the drive, lined with Traveller Palms and pecking Guinea Fowl, a rose-pink bungalow came into view. Under the pillared portico, stood a tall Englishman with a polka-dot cravat and twinkling eyes. My host, Martin Howard, was an exuberant, Kipling-quoting, salty-humored old India hand, who, with his elegant wife, Annie, lived here, at the delightfully-named Tikli Bottom. Preparations were in full swing for a Christmas party. Annie, breezy in turquoise block print and beaming welcome, thrust some tinsel into my hand with the request, ‘Do decorate the camel’. The real joy of Tikli Bottom, in many ways an English estate with tropical fronds, was the community that the Howards created around them. The bungalow’s interiors were airy and serene, thanks to Annie’s eye, but they were also open to the much-loved local children, who bounced on the sofas and jumped in the swimming pool, like flocks of starlings. The couple had opened Tikli to paying guests and visitors came from New York, Edinburgh and Mumbai, including at least one member of the British Royal Family — all fascinated by this unique swansong of the Raj on the rural fringes of Gurugram. Martin, who was 84 when he passed away last month, was born into a farming family on the East Coast of England. After a successful career as a naval engineer, he came to Delhi and landed a coveted role as Naval Advisor to the British High Commission. Martin had married Annie, as his second wife, on a snowy day in December 1979. The couple took to life among the Delhiwallahsand expats with aplomb. A directorship at the Delhi outpost of Rolls Royce kept them in India after Martin’s retirement from the British Navy and the subcontinent became their permanent home. Farmer at heart Their friendship with Anne Wright, of Kipling Camp fame, led to the Howards buying land near the Haryana village of Teekli and enabled Martin’s dream of returning to his farming roots. They built what Martin liked to call ‘a four-bedroom house with a courtyard — for the breezes’, in fact a Lutyens-inspired throwback to a more considered, languid age. Celebrated for their spirit, the couple became known for their own Anglo-Indian lifestyle, as British as cucumber sandwiches, and yet deeply rooted in their adopted culture. Martin was a squire, a plantsman, a storyteller and a buffalo farmer all at once. Diplomats, backpackers and retired prime ministers enjoyed sitting al fresco at his table, as he strewed bon mots and great chunks ofIfby Kipling. Education for all Martin was concerned about India’s growing population time bomb. He felt education to be key to progress, so in 2000 he founded a school, the first ever for the village. Now operating under an Indian-registered charity, the Baas Education Trust, it is an astonishing success story. “These children need to be told that the sky’s the limit,” he loved to say. “He recognised the importance of faith, but did not want religion to play a central role in his school,” Tom Homfray, the very first volunteer, told me. “He knew that it had the potential to sow division, when he was trying to achieve inclusivity... and unity.” An MBE honour was conferred on Martin by Prince Charles on the final afternoon of his 2017 India Tour. It was a moment of huge pride and recognition, although underplayed by the retired naval captain with characteristic modesty. He leaves behind three daughters, Joanna, Samantha and Tabatha. Perhaps this inspiring life is best summed up in the murmured epitaph of his widow Annie to me, spoken with all the simplicity of a long-held intimacy, “My boy did well.”  Cosmo Brockway is a travel and interiors author and his book,Glorious Hotels of India , is available at bookstores nationwide.   www.tiklibottom.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-squire-from-tikli-bottom/article34340687.ece
17 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Over 19K new cases, 141 deaths: Capital scales new COVID peak||The Capital reported 19,486 fresh COVID-19 cases and 141 deaths on Friday — the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the pandemic. The health bulletin issued by the Delhi government said 98,957 tests were conducted in 24 hours with a positivity rate of 19.69%. Out of the total tests conducted, 64,939 were RT-PCR. The city has 61,005 active cases with 29,705 patients under home isolation. On November 19, the city recorded its previous highest single-day fatality count with 131 deaths. The COVID-19 patient management system shows that out of the 15,680 beds available in hospitals for COVID-19 patients, 4,412 are vacant. At dedicated COVID Care Centres that have a capacity of 5,525 beds, 5,049 are vacant. According to the Delhi Corona app of the Delhi government, of the total of 1,269 COVID-19 ICU beds with ventilator, 183 were vacant and out of those without ventilator, 300 were vacant. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who has been appointed the nodal Minister for COVID-19 management in the Capital, and will be responsible for inter-ministerial coordination visited GTB hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Hospital and LNJP hospital in the city to review the situation on the ground. “Visited GTB hospital and reviewed its patient admission system. Met some of the patients and also interacted with the doctors. I would like to thank the medical staff who have been working round-the-clock,” Mr. Sisodia tweeted after the visit. He also met the HODs of LNJP Hospital. 10 IAS officers appointed The Delhi government also appointed 10 IAS officers as “nodal officers” for COVID-19 hospitals run by it and asked them to work from the healthcare facility they have been assigned. “The officers will be overall in-charge of the COVID-19 hospital assigned to them and will exercise general superintendence, directions and control over the functioning of the hospital,” an order issued by the health department read. Since the pandemic began, 8,03,623 positive cases have been reported with 11,793 deaths. There are at present, 9,929 containment zones in the city and in the past 24-hours, 2,279 calls were dispatched to ambulances for the control room. The health bulletin said 76,646 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the past 24-hours out of which 59,493 got their first dose and 17,149 got their second dose.

17 April 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Chandigarh imposes weekend lockdown amid surge in virus cases||Amid surge in COVID-19 cases, Chandigarh has announced imposition of ‘weekend lockdown’ from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., effective Friday. The decision regarding the weekend lockdown in the Union Territory, among other restrictions, was taken at a meeting held here, presided over by Governor of Punjab and Chandigarh’s administrator V.P. Singh Badnore. A government order said there will be a weekend lockdown starting from 10 p.m. on April 16 till 5 a.m. on April 19. Residents must stay indoor during the lockdown period and only essential activities will be allowed. During the weekend lockdown, home delivery of food will be allowed, it said. “The order shall come into force with effect from 10 p.m. on April 16, and shall remain in force till April 30,” read the order issued by State Disaster Management Authority, Chandigarh. Apart from this, other restrictions were also announced till April 30, including shutting of all gymnasium and spa; running of cinema halls with 50% capacity; functioning of all government offices with 50% of staffers; and a ban on social, cultural, political, religious events. Notably, the samples of the latest findings of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), sent to National Centre for Diseases Control, have revealed that 70% of the samples had UK variant of COVID 19 while 20% had 681 H mutant of COVID-19. Dr. Jagat Ram, Director of PGIMER said that the PGIMER’s department of Virology had sent 60 positive samples of COVID-19 to the National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC), New Delhi, in March 2021. “It was found that 70% of the samples had UK variants of COVID-19, one sample was found to have double mutation and 681H mutant of COVID-19 was observed in 20% of the samples. Majority of the samples were from Chandigarh,” said Dr. Ram. “Considering the high transmission and faster spread of COVID-19 by the U.K. variant, it is suggested that everyone should follow COVID-appropriate behaviour by wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and using hand sanitisers frequently.” ‘Breaking the chain’ Stressing on the need of vaccination for priority groups, Dr. Ram said, “The priority groups of population should get vaccinated against COVID-19 disease, which will help in protection against this disease and reduce the intensity-severity of the disease that will further help in breaking the chain of the COVID-19 transmission.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/chandigarh-imposes-weekend-lockdown-amid-surge-in-virus-cases/article34340500.ece
17 April 2021||April 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Horn and a hydrogen- fuelled future||Isolation, social distancing… terms we’ve become intimately familiar with now have been part of Mike Horn’s lexicon for almost 25 years. The South Africa-born Swiss adventurer is renowned for pitting himself against the most challenging of endeavours (often alone), be it swimming the Amazon River or climbing 8,000+ metres of the Gasherbrum 1 and 2 peaks sans supplementary oxygen. All this with sustainability at its heart (bringing attention to melting ice caps and deforestation). It may be far-fetched to draw parallels between what Horn has been doing and what we dealt with during the pandemic. “I think the pandemic has given us time to take a step back and think about where we are headed,” Horn says. “We can make big changes in the 30,000-32,000 days that we live. All seven billion people on the planet have to decide that we want our world to change.” Edited excerpts from an interview. How involved is Panerai in giving shape to your vision of exploration? Let me tell you a story. When I sailed to the Philippines, I had to change the axe of my radar. The piece of metal had taken me 27 times around the world, helped me cross Antarctica, the North Pole, sail to the Amazon, to the Sundarbans… and I thought, ‘Let’s make a watch out of it’. I gave the problem to Panerai [with whom he’s been associated since 2001], saying, ‘You make amazing timepieces but the metal has no story to tell. This piece has planted five million trees, cleaned beaches, taken plastic out of the ocean. It has taken me on explorations and has always brought me back alive.” Jean-Marc Pontroue [CEO] loved the idea. That’s how the five-piece Submersible EcoPangaea Tourbillon GMT 50mm Mike Horn edition was born. That also started the move towards building a watch that is 100% recycled. At last month’s Monaco Ocean Week, you spoke about hydrogen as the energy for the future.  Hydrogen moves the planets, so it can help us conserve ours. Carbon emission is our problem. Why not look at what we have all around us? Last year, when I participated in the Dakar car rally, I was criticised because, after crossing the North Pole [where I brought attention to the melting ice caps], I jumped into a diesel-powered car and drove across the desert. But I was there to see how we could change rally vehicles [Horn’s project, Gen-Z, aims to enter a competitive hydrogen-powered car in the 2023 rally]. When I first launched the research programme, everybody said it’s impossible. Then I approached the CEA [French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission] last year and, three months later, they came up with a solution. Now we are building 300 kilowatt hydrogen fuel cells that can generate 400 horse power. I think this is the future of mobility. Is aiming for carbon neutrality in the transport sector by 2050 a realistic target?  I think we need to invest now. We know that electric isn’t the solution; there is not enough lithium. Hydrogen was wrongly communicated as a dangerous substance to travel with; now it has been proven to be safe. It is the power source that can give us the distance we need. The new raid rally vehicle we are developing can give us 600 km from 30 kg of hydrogen and that is as much a combustion engine would do. Now the infrastructure should follow. How did you get interested in high latitude sailing?  It is the feeling of going somewhere that nobody else has been! In 2019, my custom-made boat, Pangaea [which uses a combination of solar and hydrogen fuel cell power], became the first to get to the highest point in the polar ocean. The tough part of high latitude sailing is that you are never sure of coming back alive. We need to have all the information to make decisions, so as to ensure the safety of the vessel and the lives of the crew. Last year, you sailed to Greenland and Svalbard.  It was the first time we went back to the polar region after the pandemic broke. The purpose was to research the impact of lockdown on the lives of whales [as they were not being hunted during the pandemic]. We recorded whale songs and had the opportunity to decode many patterns related to their behaviour and to compare them [before and after Covid-19].||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/horn-and-a-hydrogen-fuelled-future/article34341187.ece

Shrivastava on Friday said the weekend lockdown restrictions imposed by the Delhi government will be enforced strictly by the force. CP to district DCPs The Commissioner held a videoconference meeting on Friday with district Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCP) to review the preparedness and plan of action to follow on the ground for strict enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions and DDMA order. He asked the officers to prosecute those flouting rules without a valid ground or exemption. Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal said the CP asked district DCPs to make extensive arrangements of pickets, patrolling and police presence on the ground. “If anyone is found moving without a valid emergency or movement pass for essential services or goods, they would be stopped, and case will be registered against them and they may face arrest too. Medical services, food materials, fruits and vegetable supply need to go on as usual for normal life,” he said. “These will operate normally, and our personnel will facilitate it. But no one under the garb of these activities can undertake undue movement to violate the restriction orders,” the CP said. They also said doctors and journalistswill be allowed to travel freely with a valid identity card. The DCPs were asked to ensure that policemen are careful — wear masks, follow social distancing and hand hygiene. Hours before weekend lockdown came into force, Delhi Police launched a COVID helpline number — 01123469900 — to facilitate movement pass.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/prosecute-weekend-curfew-violators-cp/article34341075.ece

Anil Kumar on Friday said a majority of people in the city live in one or two-room flats where home isolation is not possible. He said the Delhi government could have chosen community centres and schools for providing isolation facilities and taking some of the load off hospitals. He alleged that the situation on the ground is very different from the availability of beds shown on the Corona App of the Delhi government and claimed that the data was incorrect. Mr. Kumar said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has not consulted Opposition parties and experts to come up with a strategy to be adopted to control the virus. He said Congress had suggested him to call an all-party meeting for the same. Hits out at civic bodies The Delhi Congress also lashed out at the BJP-ruled municipal corporations of Delhi for doing nothing to keep the pandemic under control. “Civic body hospitals could have been readied to accommodate some of the COVID-19 patients, providing some breather to the over-stressed private and government hospitals,” Mr. Kumar said. Commenting on the weekend curfew, Mr. Kumar said the government had decided not to close liquor shops where crowding happens over the weekend. He added that people providing essential services are struggling to get passes to commute during the curfew.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/home-isolation-not-possible-for-majority-in-city-congress/article34341076.ece

But it requested the government to help in the delivery segment “We request the government to allow round-the-clock home delivery of food in line with what Mumbai has done and to smoothen the process of e-passes and issue clear directions to the law enforcing agencies so that our workers, who are also front-line warriors, are not subjected to any undue harassment by these law enforcing authorities,” the NRAI said.

The arrests come two days after the State government urgently procured 25,000 vials of the drug from Gujarat due to the rise in number of cases and demand for the drug. In Kanpur, the U.P. Special Task Force, said they recovered 265 vials of Covifor injection (Remdesivir) which the accused persons were smuggling at a higher rate. The action came after intelligence inputs, stating that since there was a shortage of Remdesivir in local markets, “drug smugglers” were selling it at a much higher price, the UP STF, which carried out the operation, said. The recovered injections, which cost around Rs. 5,400 each did not have any batch number or other details, the STF said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nsa-against-three-for-selling-covid-drug-at-higher-rates/article34340499.ece
