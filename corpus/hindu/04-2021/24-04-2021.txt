The tragedy comes less than a month after a fire in a hospital at Bhandup in Mumbai led to the death of nine COVID-19 patients. Palghar district officials said 17 patients were in the ICU on the second floor of the four-storey hospital when the fire broke out around 3 a.m. Three fire tenders reached the spot immediately, and the fire was doused by 5.20 a.m. “While 15 patients died in this tragedy, the remaining patients have been moved to other hospitals,” an official said. Some were sent to the Dahisar COVID Centre, run by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, and others to hospitals in Virar. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said Mr. Thackeray had ordered a detailed investigation to ascertain if the hospital had followed all safety norms. Amid the ongoing surge in COVID-19 cases, Maharashtra has witnessed a series of hospital accidents this year. Two days ago, 24 COVID-19 patients on life support died after a leak in a medical oxygen tank disrupted the supply of the gas at Dr. Zakir Hussain Hospital in Nashik. In January, 10 infants died in a fire at the Bhandara District Hospital in Vidarbha. PM condoles incident Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved an ex gratia of Rs. 2 lakh. “The fire at a COVID-19 hospital in Virar is tragic. Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon,” Mr. Modi tweeted. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced an ex gratia of Rs. 5 lakh for the next of kin of the victims and Rs. 1 lakh to those injured in the Virar incident. Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis questioned the State government on its preparedness and successive announcements of conducting fire audits. After every incident, it is said that a fire audit will be conducted across the State. At a time when hospitals are running under pressure, the government seems to be avoiding its responsibility,” he said. He demanded a time-bound fire audit of all the hospitals in the State. Maharashtra Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde announced a financial assistance of Rs. 5 lakh to the kin of the deceased residing in the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation limits. He held a meeting with the Palghar District Collector, the Municipal Commissioner and other senior officials, directing them to conduct fire and electric audits of all hospitals within the municipal area. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray asked whether the State administration had learnt lessons from the past incidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/15-covid-19-patients-die-as-fire-engulfs-icu-of-virar-hospital/article34397538.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy announced here on Friday. This was one of the major decisions taken during an extensive meeting the Chief Minister held on the COVID-19 vaccination. Another major decision taken was to impose night curfew in the State between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy further instructed the officials to decentralise the markets as was done during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. The Chief Minister also made it clear that the SSC, Intermediate, degree and engineering examinations would be conducted as per schedule. Strict vigil on drugs “Ensure that the essential drugs are not sold in the black market. Also ensure a tight vigil on the supply of Remdesivir and evolve an SOP on the distribution of vital injections. If you find any racket of sorts, crackdown on it. Also, increase sample testing and take stringent action against the hospitals that are collecting excessive fees for treating COVID-19 patients,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. He also asked the officials to ensure that the ‘104’ service functioned properly and reaches the needy in time. The Chief Minister asked the officials to increase the number of transport vehicles bringing oxygen, and said that 284 tonnes of oxygen was being used daily in the hospitals across the State. In 208 COVID hospitals, 21,581 beds were available, out of which 11,789 were occupied, he added. Ministers Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas, Botcha Satyanarayana and M. Sucharitha, DGP Gautam Sawang, Special CS (Health) Anil Kumar Singhal, Secretary (Transport) M.T. Krishna Babu, Secretary (School Education) B. Rajasekhar, and Commissioner of Health K.

24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||As oxygen supply dips, 25 die in Delhi hospital||The shortage of medical oxygen in the national capital region came to a head with one of the largest hospitals, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, reporting on Friday morning that 25 severely ill patients had died in the past 24 hours and 60 other patients were at risk. Several other hospitals also reported dwindling supplies even as the number of COVID-19 patients mounted. Artemis Hospital in Gurugram sent out at least two public calls for oxygen, while Max Healthcare, with six hospitals and 1,000 beds in the capital region, said at one point that it had less than one hour’s oxygen supply in two major hospitals. Ventilators stop “[Twenty-five] 25 sickest patients have died in last 24 hours at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Oxygen will last another two hours. Ventilators and BiPAP not working effectively. Resorting to manual ventilation in ICUs and ED. Major crisis likely. Lives of another 60 sickest patients in peril. Need oxygen to be airlifted urgently. Governments please help,” the hospital said in a distress statement. The Delhi High Court, meanwhile, asked hospitals and nursing homes to first contact the nodal officer of the AAP government to meet medical oxygen needs to treat seriously ill COVID-19 patients. “We would expect all hospitals in the NCT of Delhi to approach the nodal officer Mr. Udit Prakash and such other officers... in the first instance for the purpose of meeting their requirement of oxygen,” the court said. A Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli was hearing petitions by Batra and Bram Health Care hospitals, seeking immediate supply of oxygen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/as-oxygen-supply-dips-25-die-in-delhi-hospital/article34397534.ece
24 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Lockdown-like curbs for 48 hours||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday said the government would impose lockdown-like curbs on civic life in the State on April 24 and 25. On Monday, an all-party meeting would deliberate on the kind of restrictions the State required to press on with to retard the surge in COVID-19 cases. The government would hold higher secondary examinations as per schedule on Saturday. No stopping students Parents should drop students at examination centres and disperse immediately. The police would not impede the travel of students, parents and teachers to examination centres. However, they should produce hall tickets and identity cards if required by law enforcers. Mr. Vijayan said the government would curb non-essential travel. Optimally, people should sequester themselves at home for 48 hours. The emphasis is on remaining indoors. Citizens should put off visiting friends and avoid socialising in closed spaces. Ideally, employees should resume working from home. Citizens should avoid long-distance travel on the weekend. However, they could visit ailing “close relatives,” attend funerals in the immediate family, participate in weddings, and venture out to procure medicines or victuals. Travellers should furnish a sworn statement detailing their respective reason for travel. Those driving to attend weddings should carry the invitation card with them. Wedding halls should not admit more than 75 persons. The police would not allow more than 150 persons for open-air weddings. The government has restricted the number of attendees at funerals to fewer than 50. Air and rail passengers should furnish boarding passes or tickets if challenged by the police. Hotels could deliver food home. The government has banned indoor dining. Citizens could, in extreme cases, venture out to buy food as takeaways from restaurants. Exempted services The administration has exempted mediapersons, newspaper agents, telecom, IT and hospital employees from the lockdown. The government has spared milk distribution, meat stalls, water and power supply, and Internet services from the shutdown. Markets, shops, malls, bars and liquor outlets would remain closed. Fish vendors could deliver the day’s catch directly to homes. The State has cancelled sporting activities and shut down walking circuits, stadium, gymnasium, beaches, parks and weekend destinations till Monday.  The government will conduct higher secondary examinations as per schedule today.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lockdown-like-curbs-for-48-hours/article34397687.ece
24 April 2021||New Delhi,||Centre allots 5 kg of grains free to poor||The Union government on Friday announced that 5 kg of foodgrains would be provided to 80 crore beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) in May and June as many States were undergoing curfews and the high rates of COVID-19 infections had led to a slowdown in economic activity. The announcement came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with the Chief Ministers, especially of the States with a high case burden. The outlay for the free grain programme has been pegged at Rs. 26,000 crore. Mr. Modi assured the States that all resources, including those of the Railways and the Indian Air Force, were being deployed to reach oxygen to different corners of the country. He asked the States to strictly crack down on hoarding and black marketing of essential drugs and injections. He added that the Centre would be providing COVID-19 vaccines acquired by it to the States free, as earlier. Coordination teams The meeting with the Chief Ministers, followed by Mr. Modi’s meeting with oxygen manufacturers, the fourth such review of oxygen availability in the past week, assumes significance with daily new  cases nearing the 3.5 lakh mark. According to a statement released after the meeting with the Chief Ministers, Mr. Modi called for a unified approach in dealing with resource scarcities, which he said were being addressed. He stated that it was through such an approach that India could tackle the first wave of COVID-19. The Prime Minister said the IAF was flying in empty tankers for oxygen to reduce turnaround time on supplies. The Railways had been roped in to run Oxygen Express trains. He urged the States fighting for scarce oxygen to set up coordination teams to allow free movement of tankers across the State borders. Tier 2 and tier 3 cities, which are now facing a rapid rise in cases, were highlighted as an area of concern. Mr. Modi also expressed grief at the accidents that had taken place in hospitals, adding that the staff had to be more aware of safety protocols. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, going head-to-head with the BJP in the Assembly election, did not attend the meeting. Same rates for jabs Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel made a strong demand that vaccines be provided at the same rates for both the Centre and the States. The Serum Institute of India has announced that it would be providing the Covishield vaccine, which it currently sells at Rs. 150-Rs. 200 a dose to the Centre, at Rs. 400 per dose to the State governments and Rs. 600 a dose to private entities. “Please provide an action plan for vaccine availability to the States for running vaccination drive for those above 18 years of age from May 1,” Mr. Baghel said at the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-to-give-5-kg-foodgrains-free-to-poor/article34397523.ece
24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rising prevalence of U.K. strain in Delhi||The proportion of the U.K. variant (B.1.1.7) in genome samples sequenced from COVID-19 cases in Delhi has risen from 28% in the second week of March to 50% last week, Sujeet Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control, said at a webinar on Friday. The U.K. variant has a mutation N501Y that is reported to increase the transmission of the virus, leading to more numbers and a knock-on consequence of increasing disease severity and mortality. Speaking at the webinar, organised by the Department of Biotechnology, Dr. Singh said there was also a rise in the Indian variant (B.1.617), which has two mutations associated with increased efficacy and decreasing the potency of vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rising-prevalence-of-uk-strain-in-delhi/article34398205.ece
24 April 2021||BENGALURU,||Several healthcare centres may have to be shut if oxygen supply is not increased: CM||Flagging the severe shortage of oxygen in the State, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Friday appealed to the Centre to allocate more oxygen and Remdesivir to Karnataka as the number of COVID-19 cases here has seen an exponential increase. He expressed concern that several healthcare centres would have to be shut if there was no increase in oxygen supply. Providing a glimpse of the COVID-19 situation in the State to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a virtual meeting of Chief Ministers, Mr. Yediyurappa said the current positivity rate stood at 16% in Karnataka, and urban centres such as Bengaluru, Mysuru, Tumakuru, Ballari, Hassan, and Kalaburagi were among the worst-affected. While 500 tonnes of oxygen was consumed across the State on Thursday, the Chief Minister pointed out that 1,142 tonnes was estimated to be the demand by April 25, and the quantum is likely to go up to 1,471 tonnes by April 30. “However, the Centre has allocated only 300 tonnes of oxygen to Karnataka. If the same situation continues, several healthcare centres have to be closed down,” he told the Prime Minister. A note from the Chief Minister’s Office said that he urged Mr. Modi to allocate 1,471 tonnes of oxygen daily to Karnataka. Mr. Yediyurappa also appealed to Mr. Modi to provide two lakh doses of Remdesivir over the next 10 days to ensure there is no shortage of the drug in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Mr. Yediyurappa also informed the Prime Minister about the measures implemented in the State to contain the spread of the virus by ensuring that economic activities are also not hampered. He said that the ramping up of infrastructure in the past six months had become handy now. He also said there was a proposal to start step-down hospitals using hotel rooms in the vicinity of the hospitals.  On the efforts made in Bengaluru, the Chief Minister said that the efforts in containment of the virus in eight zones in Bengaluru were being coordinated by eight Ministers and senior IAS officers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/several-healthcare-centres-may-have-to-be-shut-if-oxygen-supply-is-not-increased-cm/article34397663.ece
24 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||State reports 38 deaths, 11,766 new cases||The pandemic curve hit a new peak in the State with the daily tally of COVID-19 infections reaching 11,766 in the 24 hours ending Friday morning. During the period, 38 deaths were reported. The last peak of 10,830 new cases was reported on August 26, 2020, which was 168 days after confirmation of the first-ever infection in the State. The new peak was reached in 68 days after the first wave flattened in mid-February this year. The cumulative tally crossed 10 lakh in 408 days and stood at 10,09,228. Despite 4,441 patients recovering in the last one day, the recovery rate came down to 91.89%. The number of recoveries reached 9,27,418, which left 74,231 cases active. The death toll reached 7,579 and the mortality rate stood at 0.75%. The last one lakh infections were reported in 18 days (from April 6) and only 6.41 lakh samples were tested to detect them. The positivity rate of these tests was 15.06%. The silver lining was that only 335 of them died. Of the last one lakh cases, over 40% were from three districts – Chittoor (15,917), Guntur (13,391) and Srikakulam (10,900). Of the 38 deaths, Nellore reported six and Chittoor five. The toll in other districts was: Srikakulam, Kurnool, East Godavari, Krishna and Prakasam (4 each), Visakhapatnam (3) and Guntur and Vizianagaram (2 each). There were no deaths in three districts. Chittoor once again reported the highest single-day tally of 1,885 cases. It was followed by Guntur (1,593), Anantapur (1,201), Kurnool (1,180), Srikakulam (1,052), Nellore (949), Visakhapatnam (910), Krishna (831), East Godavari (796), Vizianagaram (448), Prakasam (370), Kadapa (361) and West Godavari (190). East Godavari, Chittoor, West Godavari, Guntur and Anantapur accounted for 50% of the 10 lakh infections reported so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-registers-38-deaths-and-11766-new-infections/article34397530.ece
24 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Two aircraft to airlift oxygen from Odisha||The Telangana government has pressed two military aircraft (C-17) into service to bring oxygen tankers from Odisha to ensure there is no shortage of medical oxygen in the State as part of COVID treatment. The decision to bring medical oxygen by air has been taken, irrespective of the expenditure incurred on it, to avoid delays in getting it by road from Rourkela steel plant,Odisha. It was taking more than three days time to get the oxygen tankers by road from Rourkela to Telangana now. Airlifting of oxygen tankers would save precious time. Acting on the directions of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, Health Minister Eatala Rajender and Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar spoke to the authorities in the Central government and arranged two C-17 aircraft used to transport cargo by the Armed forces. Each aircraft would carry nine oxygen tankers and together they would airlift 150 tonnes of medical oxygen from Rourkela to the State. Mr. Rajender, Mr. Somesh Kumar and other authorities of the Health Department went to Begumpet airport on Friday morning to oversee the load of empty oxygen tankers into the two aircraft. They would reach Rourkela on Friday itself and after getting filled with oxygen at the steel plant there, the two military aircraft would return to Hyderabad by April 27. The State government is peeved at the Centre’s decision to allotting the Rourkela steel plant, located at about 1,300 km from Hyderabad, for supply of medical oxygen to Telangana instead of nearby steel plants located at Bellary in Karnataka and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. The Centre had allotted about 55 tonnes of oxygen to Telangana from two places in Tamil Nadu but their government had refused to spare it now, Mr. Rajender said. Officials of the Health department stated that airlifting the medical oxygen in bulk quantity was being attempted for the first time by a State government (Telangana) to meet the demand in time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-aircraft-to-airlift-oxygen-from-odisha/article34398221.ece

24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Genome sampling shows rising prevalence of U.K. strain in Delhi||The proportion of the U.K. variant (B.1.1.7) in genome samples sequenced from COVID-19 cases in Delhi has risen from 28% in the second week of March to 50% last week, Sujeet Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control, said in a webinar on Friday. The U.K. variant has a mutation N501Y that is reported to increase the transmission of the virus, leading to more numbers and a knock-on consequence of increasing disease severity and mortality. Speaking at the webinar organised by the Department of Biotechnology, Dr. Singh said there was also a rise in the Indian variant (B.1.617), which has two mutations associated with increased efficacy and decreasing the potency of vaccines. However, while the relative proportion of known variants of concern, or VoC, (the U.K., South Africa, Brazil variants) is around 11%, investigations were still on to determine to what extent they were responsible for the severity of disease. Delhi is undergoing an unprecedented surge in its fourth wave, with a rise in instances of people with breathlessness and a demand for oxygen cylinders and beds that has led to health systems being overwhelmed. Of the 438 sequences of the VOCs analysed in Delhi, 415 exhibited the U.K. strain and 23 the South Africa strain. Delhi was among the States, along with Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat, where instances of the U.K. strain in the wider community far outnumbered those detected among international travellers and their contacts. For instance, in Delhi, there were 324 instances of the UK strain in the “community” as opposed to 91 among travellers and their contacts (T&C). In Gujarat, it was 18 in T&C and 42 in the community and in Chhattisgarh there was only 1 case in the T&C as opposed to 14 in the community. Such numbers weren’t yet present for the Brazilian and South African strains. The comparative data was presented by Dr. Singh. Several of these states are showing unprecedented spikes. So far about 15,000 genomes had been sequenced, which is about 1% of India's coronavirus caseload. Dr Anurag Agrawal, Director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said the concern with the Indian variants was that they possessed two mutations — E484K and L245R — that together would increase the likelihood of a wider range of antibodies being unable to counter the virus. “However immunity also includes a cellular level response that can generate cross reactivity and so we can still expect, a good antibody response which is why all vaccines, despite the variant, will be fairly protective (against disease),” he said. Dr Priya Abraham, Director, ICMR-National Institute of Virology said the virus would continue to mutate and the best defence would be to continue following ‘COVID appropriate behaviour' and vaccinate at the earliest. She said that 90% of the RT-PCR tests being deployed were accurate. However, there were challenges in testing with several trained staff too testing positive and affecting the quality of testing and analysis, she added. Virologist Shahid Jameel, and head of the advisory group to INSACOG, who was moderating the webinar, said there was “preliminary” information that both Covaxin and Covishield appeared to be effective against the Indian variant. He was referring to a report by the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad. “Science is a process that calls for evidence based policy making and not policy based evidence making. Three 'T's are needed: Truth, Transparency and Trust. Truth leads to transparency leads to trust,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rising-prevalence-of-uk-strain-in-delhi/article34397536.ece

24 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||85th worker of closed Assam paper mills dies||The 85th employee of two paper mills of Hindustan Paper Corporation in Assam, awaiting the much-promised revival since their closure in 2017, died on Friday. The Joint Action Committee of Recognised Unions (JACRU), representing the employees of the two mills, said Amrit Lal Deb died of a liver disease without timely treatment due to non-payment of salary and other dues for 52 months. Before Deb’s death, 84 employees had either taken their lives because of penury or died of hunger or inability to afford treatment for diseases. The Nagaon Paper Mill, about 70 km east of Guwahati, and the Cachar Paper Mill, about 30 km from Barak Valley’s main town Silchar, were two of Asia’s largest paper plants. They were also the fulcrums around which two towns – Jagiroad in Morigaon district and Panchgram in Hailakandi district – grew and prospered. But the graph of the two mills began heading south three decades after they were established to showcase an “industrialised Assam”. About 2,400 employees have gone without pay since the Cachar mill closed down in January 2017 and the Nagaon mill two months later. “Deb and his family had been struggling to survive after he retired in December 2018. He did not die, he was killed because of the government’s draconian policy of starving once-viable industries and their employees to death,” JACRU president Manobendra Chakraborty toldThe Hindu. 4 lakh affected JACRU leader Ananda Bordoli said the closure of the two mills affected over 4 lakh people who were directly and indirectly dependent on them. “We would like to remind Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal of their promises to revive the paper mills prior to the 2016 Assembly elections. This was not all; Mr. Modi had addressed a huge rally near Cachar Paper Mill on March 27, 2016, and said he was committed to reviving 32,000 closed industries in Assam,” said Mr. Chakraborty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/85th-worker-of-closed-assam-paper-mills-dies/article34398204.ece
24 April 2021||MANGALURU,||Senior officials on the ground enforcing restrictions||With the government tweaking directives on the fortnight-long curfew ordering closure of commercial establishments of non-essential nature, administrative officials in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts hit the streets closing such establishments even as entrepreneurs looked astonished over the development on Friday. Mangaluru Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar and Udupi Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha were among those who were on the ground in Mangaluru and Udupi booking cases against establishments that were open to ensure compliance with the health protocol. Mr. Kumar led a team of police officers who went around the Central Market area from noon and concluded the drive by 1 p.m. at Kankanady Market. Red roses were offered to people who wore face masks and complied with social distancing norms while on roads and on city buses. The team found establishments dealing with non-essential goods, including a couple of major jewellery and diamond outlets, open in Hampankatta and Falnir. “These outlets know they cannot operate when restrictions are in place between April 21 and May 4. But still they continue to operate. We are booking cases for cognisable offences under the Epidemic Diseases Act against such establishments,” he said. Mr. Kumar and Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar took managers of two retail outlets in a mall in Kankanady to task for keeping their outlets open. They also found several outlets operating, though they had downed their shutters. Some lowered their shutters after seeing the police team coming. Several teams of COVID-19 Marshals led by Mangaluru City Corporation personnel went around the city to close down non-essential commercial activities. In Udupi, Mr. Jagadeesha led a team of officials to inspect arrangements at the new shandy opened at Gandhi Maidan in Byndoor. The shandy was operating near the Shaneshwara temple and was relocated to Gandhi Maidan to ensure social distancing. Mr. Jagadeesha interacted with the traders and visitors to the shandy and emphasised the need for people to comply with the restrictions put in place by the State government to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Several teams of officials led by Bantwal Tahsildar Rashmi and personnel from Bantwal Town Municipal Council went around places, including Kalladka, Melkar, BC Road and Bantwal town, to enforce wearing of masks. They also got shops dealing with non-essential goods closed. The Bantwal Rural Police registered a case against fish sellers for not maintaining social distancing while carrying out their business in Farangipet. Similar action was taken by revenue, police and Puttur Town Municipal Council personnel in Puttur town and other places of Puttur taluk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/senior-officials-on-the-ground-enforcing-restrictions/article34398304.ece

The three-judge Bench led by the CJI was visibly exasperated when senior advocate Colin Gonsalves informed the court how the Tamil Nadu Advocate-General had stated in the Madras High Court on April 22 that “we are an oxygen-surplus State”.  The Chief Justice of India thundered at the State, saying, “People in the country are in need of oxygen, and Tamil Nadu says it has surplus... This is not the way... You can’t say you are in surplus, so you need not produce oxygen. The country is in bad need of oxygen. It should not be that every State produces and uses up its own oxygen.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cji-pushes-tn-to-let-sterlite-plant-reopen/article34398206.ece

24 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Situation in Bengaluru is scary: HC||In an unprecedented and ‘scary’ moment, the number of beds available for COVID-19 patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) in city hospitals under government quota touched ‘zero’ around 5 p.m. on Friday when the High Court of Karnataka was inquiring about availability of beds, oxygen and other facilities. Around 4.50 p.m., the counsel for the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) was informing the court about the number of beds available under government quota in the categories of High Dependency Units (HDU), ICU and ICU with ventilator. At that point, six beds in ICU, 10 beds in ICU with ventilator and 32 beds in HDU were available as per the online bed availability portal of the BBMP. Based on these figures, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar asked the counsel of the Karnataka government whether this was an alarming situation. Counsel for BBMP intervened and told the bench that, at that moment, no beds in ICU for COVID-19 patients were available under the government quota managed by the BBMP. The counsel said that BBMP’s bed status portal was showing ‘zero’ ICU bed availability. It was also pointed out to the court, at that moment, only 11 ICU beds with ventilator were available apart from beds in HDU category. However, the Chief Health Officer, who was present along with the counsel, told the bench that bed position is dynamic, and more beds would be available when private hospitals discharge non-COVID-19 patients depending on their health status. Teams of officials are visiting every private hospital to make provision for beds in terms of the government’s directive for COVID-19 patients, he said Recording this situation, the bench termed the COVID-19 situation in the city as ‘shocking and appears to be scary’ while directing the State government to immediately step in to identify ICU beds in hospitals in neighbouring districts. The bench also directed the government to set up help desks outside every designated COVID-19 hospital to assist and guide patients and their relatives on availability of beds and Remdesivir injection. The government has also been directed to submit data on requirement and supply of oxygen in Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/situation-in-bengaluru-is-scary-hc/article34397795.ece

24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||CJI pushes T.N. to let Sterlite plant reopen||Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde on Friday voiced anguish at Tamil Nadu’s objection to reopening Vedanta’s Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi to produce medical oxygen, asking the State to “say something concrete as people are dying due to lack of oxygen”. The three-judge Bench led by the CJI was visibly exasperated when senior advocate Colin Gonsalves informed the court how the Tamil Nadu Advocate-General had made a statement in the Madras High Court on April 22 that “we are an oxygen-surplus State”. The CJI thundered at the State, saying, “People in the country are in need of oxygen, and Tamil Nadu says it has surplus... This is not the way... You can’t say you are in surplus, so you need not produce oxygen. The country is in bad need of oxygen. It should not be that every State produces and uses up its own oxygen.” “We don’t care if it is you, Vedanta, Centre, A, B, C who runs the plant, but oxygen must be produced from a place capable of producing it...,” he told Tamil Nadu. “The Constitution demands that material resources should be equally distributed all over the country,” he said. Tamil Nadu counsel, senior advocate C.S. Vaidyanathan, agreed that either the State or the Centre could run the plant to produce medical oxygen. Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan also represented Tamil Nadu. “The State cannot say we will not run it (plant). What is your problem? Just because you have a problem with Vedanta, you will not use their plant and deprive people of oxygen? What is this,” Chief Justice Bobde asked Tamil Nadu point-blank. “The country is in dire need of oxygen. Different States need it. For example, Orissa can come to Rajasthan for oxygen. Law and order issues cannot be an excuse. “Why should not we use the capacity when every MT of oxygen matters?” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for Centre, agreed. The hearing was based on plea by Vedanta to reopen its plant to produce medical oxygen. The plant was shut by the State in 2018 due to environmental pollution. The debate began to heat up after Mr. Vaidyanathan raised apprehensions that reopening the plant would create law and order problem. But the CJI shot back at the State, saying it had not mentioned any law and order problem on April 22 when the court had first heard the proposal to use the plant for producing medical oxygen. The court listed the case on Monday for further hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cji-pushes-tn-to-let-sterlite-plant-reopen-for-making-oxygen/article34397525.ece

24 April 2021||New Delhi,||High demand for oxygen trains||Facing a severe shortage of medical oxygen, the State governments, including the Delhi government, are turning to the Railways to run ‘Oxygen Express’ trains for movement of liquid medical oxygen tankers. “We have received demand from States like Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and also Delhi for movement of liquid oxygen by railways. We are closely coordinating with the States,” Railway Board Chairman and CEO Suneet Sharma said on Friday. Mr. Sharma noted that two such trains were deployed to Maharashtra from Visakhapatnam and to Uttar Pradesh from Bokaro, Jharkhand. On the demand from Delhi, Mr. Sharma said the supply would likely be brought from Rourkela in Odisha and the details were being worked out. “We have told them to keep their tankers ready, we have kept our wagons ready. Our ramps are ready at different locations in Delhi NCR. We expect this movement will shortly take place,” he said. He said there was a demand from Andhra Pradesh to run a service between Vijayawada and Angul, Odisha, and from Uttar Pradesh for transportation of oxygen from the Reliance refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat. “The Railways is transporting not only passengers, but also goods and other important items that are required to be transported quickly. As you are already aware, there are challenges, especially in transporting oxygen. We have been given a very, very challenging task to move liquid oxygen from one place to the other. It’s a very big challenge,” Mr. Sharma said. On the use of train coaches as isolation facility, Mr. Sharma said about 3,816 coaches are available, and will be provided to States as per demand. Currently, 21 coaches (378 beds) have been provided to Maharashtra in Nandubar where 32 patients have been admitted. Delhi has also been provided 50 coaches (800 beds) at Shakurbasti and 25 coaches (400 beds) at Anand Vihar.

24 April 2021||Kolkata,||West Bengal yearning for a positive change, says Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday addressed the electorate in West Bengal virtually and said that people are yearning for a positive change. “From different corners of the State wherever I have campaigned I have seen a yearning for a change in the State,” Mr. Modi said, addressing the virtual rally. The Prime Minister was scheduled to address four rallies in Malda, Murshidabad, Suri and south Kolkata during the day but the rallies were cancelled because of his engagements at Delhi. The Election Commission of India had banned roadshows and motorbike rallies and capped the number of people attending public rallies at 500. In his 30-minute address that was video-streamed at the four venues, the Prime Minister made repeated references to ‘Ashol Paribartan’ and ‘Sonar Bangla’, the two phrases that have been used by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) extensively during their campaign. “The people of West Bengal want dignity of labour, ease of living and ease of doing business and the BJP has taken a pledge to fulfil these dreams,” Mr. Modi said. The Prime Minister, unlike in the earlier public rallies, made no direct attacks on the Trinamool Congress and avoided any mention of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. But in a veiled attack on the party, Mr. Modi said, “Illegal immigration, syndicates, and extortion are hurdles to West Bengal’s development.” The Prime Minister said that after nearly four decades, the people of West Bengal had a chance to strengthen democracy in the State and appreciated the high turnout in the first six phase of elections in the State. Pointing out that this was the last election meeting before the State went to the polls for the seventh and eight phases, he urged the people of the State to vote in large numbers. “You have to come out on the polling day and maintain all safety protocols related to COVID,” he said. The seventh phase of polling for 36 seats in the State will be held on April 26 and the last phase of polling on 35 seats on April 29. During the speech the Prime Minister, who quoted Rabindranath Tagore at least twice, spoke about development of infrastructure in Kolkata, the benefits of PM Kisan scheme to about 70 lakh farmers in the State and the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. “This election is not only about change of government in West Bengal. I can see a rise of aspirations. People of West Bengal yearn for peace, security and development,” he said. The Prime Minister promised that the BJP government would use technology to transform Kolkata “to the city of the future”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/west-bengal-yearning-for-a-positive-change-says-modi/article34397447.ece
24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||AFMS to procure 23 oxygen plants||Amid reports of oxygen shortage during the second wave of COVID-19, the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) has decided to import mobile oxygen generation plants and containers from Germany, the Defence Ministry said on Friday. The Ministry also decided to give an extension to Short Service Commissioned Doctors in AFMS till December 31, 2021. “This will augment the strength of AFMS by 238 more doctors,” Defence Minister Rajnath Sigh said on Twitter. “Twenty-three mobile oxygen generation plants are being airlifted from Germany. These will be deployed in AFMS hospitals catering to COVID-19 patients,” said Defence Ministry spokesperson A. Bharat Bhushan Babu. He said each plant had a capacity to produce 40 litres of oxygen per minute and 2,400 litres an hour, at which rate it could cater to 20-25 patients round the clock.   Separately, the Indian Air Force pressed into service transport aircraft and helicopters for carrying out sorties from various parts of the country to airlift oxygen containers, cylinders, essential medicines and equipment.   To speed up procurements in dealing with the surge in cases, Mr. Singh has also approved delegation of emergency financial powers to AFMS. As per the orders issued on Friday, the Director-General (DG) Medical Services (MS) of three Services have financial powers of up to Rs. 5 crore, Major General and equivalent up to Rs. 3 crore and Brigadier and equivalent up to Rs. 2 crore. Emergency powers to the lower Competent Financial Authorities have been delegated up to September 30, 2021, with a provision for revision or extension, the Ministry stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/afms-to-procure-oxygen-plants-from-germany/article34397458.ece

The High Court had directed on Thursday that oxygen be supplied to Delhi from all plants as per the allocation order of April 21. Fresh letter Reiterating the court’s order, the Union Home Ministry’s fresh letter on Friday to the States said that “supplies from all the oxygen producing plants is made, as per the allocation order dated 21.04.2021, and transportation takes place without any hindrance”. On his return from a political campaign in West Bengal, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday reviewed the COVID-19 situation and oxygen shortage in various States. He directed the States to compile a list of oxygen plants in districts along with the installed capacity, and take action to revive plants that were shut. A press release from the Ministry said that the Centre had prohibited supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, exempting a few essential sectors, through an April 18 order. “This has resulted in significant augmentation of supply of medical oxygen. Steps are being taken to further reduce consumption of industrial oxygen by industries, which will augment the supply for medical purpose,” it said. Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to the States to set up exclusive corridors for transportation of oxygen and to treat such vehicles as ambulances. Mr. Bhalla’s letter said that keeping in view the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, the allocation of oxygen to States needs to be rationalised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amit-shah-reviews-status-of-oxygen-supply/article34397476.ece
24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi raps Kejriwal for live-streaming CMs’ meet||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal got into a minor fracas during the Union government’s videoconference with the Chief Ministers of States with a high COVID-19 burden, after Mr. Kejriwal live-streamed his interventions at the meeting. Mr .Kejriwal, while calling for help from the Centre for fulfilling the rising oxygen requirements of hospitals in Delhi, live-streamed his remarks, which Mr. Modi objected to as it was happening, saying it went against the protocol of such closed-door meetings. At this, Mr. Kejriwal said that he would not make such a mistake again. Sources in the government alleged that Mr. Kejriwal’s actions were aimed at politicising the meeting to give the impression that the Centre was being heavy-handed with the States. “Arvind Kejriwal did much of this for political effect. He spoke of airlifting oxygen tankers, which is already being done, spoke of the Railways providing ‘Oxygen Express’ trains, which, as the Railway Ministry said, the Delhi government hadn’t got in touch with them about, and he basically did not give a single constructive solution, unlike other Chief Ministers who did,” alleged a source in the government. Mr. Kejriwal’s office, however, provided a statement explaining his version of events. “Today, the Chief Minister’s address was shared live because there has never been any instruction, written or verbal, from the Central government that the said interaction could not be shared live. There have been multiple occasions of similar interactions where matters of public importance which had no confidential information were shared live. However, if any inconvenience was caused, we highly regret it,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-raps-kejriwal-for-live-streaming-cms-meet/article34397441.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||‘China tore up the modus vivendi in 2020, the LAC is now live’||Shivshankar Menon , former National Security Adviser (NSA), Foreign Secretary and Ambassador to China, traces the evolution of India’s foreign policy and place in the world in his new book, India and Asian Geopolitics: The Past, Present . The world, he says, is now facing a hinge moment, which will require India to be clear-eyed in its vision of what it seeks in the international order, and particularly in crafting a new modus vivendi with China after last year’s crisis. Excerpts from an interview:  The very first sentence of your book tells us that the Indian subcontinent is the only subcontinent in the world. Do you see an inherent tension between our sense of uniqueness and our place in the world? There is. In fact, that is precisely why I start the book with that, because it seems to me that because we are the only subcontinent, we are part of a larger continent and we’re aware of that. But we also have a strong sense of our own exceptionalism, of our uniqueness, of how different we are. Therefore, there’s always a tendency to draw down the shutters, withdraw to our own home. That’s the main point of the book actually, because that worries me — the fact that I think we have something of that withdrawing going on right now. When things get tough outside, it’s easy to say, “forget the world”. Self-reliance can tend to become autarky, and that’s where I think there is danger. The book is actually a plea for engagement with the world. Going back to the early years after 1947, your book reminds us how difficult the situation was at home even as our leaders were thinking through our place in the world. For me, it is quite amazing what they did in those first few years, against so many odds stacked up against them, that initial generation of leaders. Not that they agreed on everything or they all thought alike ... But they had an awareness of being engaged in something much bigger. And they weren’t playing day-to-day politics with these big issues, which is why many of the things they did have lasted, and why we’ve gone back to that in various forms. You might say, “well, we are no longer non-aligned.” But when we say strategic autonomy, we mean exactly much the same, that we keep the power of decision-making in our own hands on big issues. So, for me, that’s actually a very important formative period. Are there lessons that we can draw from that period in how middle powers navigated the world? History never repeats itself exactly. It’s not as though we are suddenly now in a bipolar world where China and the U.S. have replaced the Soviet Union and the U.S. China and the U.S. are co-dependent economically. Secondly, your interests have grown tremendously. Today, we are much more connected to the world than we were [in the past]. Almost half of our GDP depends on the external sector. Maritime security across the whole Indo-Pacific today really matters to you, when 38% of your trade goes through the South China Sea. So, freedom of navigation in the South China Sea matters to you. Today we couldn’t make the economic choices we made in the 1950s and 1960s. We are part of the world, we are dependent on the world, for energy, for raw materials, for technology, for a whole host of things. So, we need to get out there and engage. My fear is that we might be going in the wrong direction. We walked out of the RCEP [the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade agreement] and we are the only major economy that is not part of any regional trading arrangement. We have raised tariffs steadily for the last four years. By doing all this, we are saying that we don’t think we’ll be competitive for the next 20 years, because 20 years was the adjustment period under the RCEP. That’s not a good message to send either to your own people or to the rest of the world. We’re not part of global supply or value chains. We need to actually make ourselves more competitive rather than less, and more engaged rather than less, at a time like this. On the current situation with China, does the post-1988 model not hold anymore? Some of us have been arguing for a little more than a decade in fact, that the old modus vivendi no longer works. Those signs of stress were clear. You saw it in the difference between what the Chinese did at the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in 2008 and what they did when we went for NSG membership in 2015. Most of all, you saw a huge increase in the Chinese commitment to Pakistan. If you look at CPEC [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor], it represents a Chinese stake in the continued Pakistani hold of Indian territory in Kashmir, because now they have assets there to protect. In 2020, of course, the Chinese tore up the modus vivendi because the basis on which it was done was to maintain the status quo and keep the peace. The border had stayed much the same until then, without fundamental changes. But in 2020, they tried to change the status quo across the line in the western sector. And clearly, that whole LAC [Line of Actual Control] is now live. The relationship needs a reset now. Whether it’s done consciously or whether it just happens and evolves as a new normal depends on both governments. They’re both saying different things. The Chinese seem to be saying, “Let’s just go back to the old days.” In other words, “We have done what we wanted to do, we have changed what we had to.” And then, they say, “Now let’s meet us halfway!” That won’t work. We are still in the middle of a negotiation of a crisis, because the crisis is nowhere near over until Depsang, Gogra [are resolved], there is a whole series of points. In any case, since the understanding has been torn up by Chinese behaviour, we have to actually see whether we can rebuild the relationship on a new basis ... I’m not very optimistic, but I think the attempt has to be made. Are the PLA’s interests now taking precedence? I think power in China shifted in favour of the PLA some time ago and we are maybe one of the later ones to feel it. The Japanese, I think, felt it first when they had a deal on joint exploration in the East China Sea, and how to deal with the oil that was under the sea, which was torn up by the PLA. You see this increasing role of the PLA across the board. In the South China Sea, for instance, Xi Jinping as President promises no militarisation, but what do you see? You’ve seen a militarisation of Chinese policy everywhere. My fear is that if you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. In your final chapter, on India’s destiny, you say we face two roads. One is of fear and polarisation, the other is of self-confidence and ambition. Which way do you think we are heading? It is very hard to say where we’re actually going. As somebody once said, pessimists are always right. But the optimists ultimately win. It is clear from the book which road I think we should take, and what I think we should do in order to be true to ourselves and to our own people, and that is because that is our primary responsibility. I only hope the optimists win.

24 April 2021||Chennai,||3.46 lakh fresh infections and 2,624 fatalities reported||India registered a new single-day high of 3,45,799 COVID-19 cases as of 11.15 p.m. on Friday, the third consecutive day with over 3 lakh recorded cases. As many as 2,624 deaths were also recorded on the day. The country has so far reported a total of 1,66,03,126 cases and 1,89,553 deaths. The figures do not include cases and deaths from Ladakh. The data are sourced from covid19india.org, an independent aggregator of daily figures. For the first time, the number of samples tested in the country crossed the 17 lakh mark, with over 17.4 lakh tests conducted on Thursday (results of which were made available on Friday). For three consecutive days, the number of daily tests has crossed the 16 lakh mark. Maharashtra reported 66,836 infections, accounting for 19% of the new cases, followed by Uttar Pradesh (37,238) and Kerala (28,447). Maharashtra also recorded 773 casualties, followed by Delhi (348) and Chhattisgarh (219). As many as 2,19,412 new recoveries were recorded in the country as of 11.15 p.m., taking the total to 1,38,61,149. Nearly 31.47 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Friday. It is about 9.36 lakh doses higher than what was recorded in the previous 24 hours. Also, it is over 4.17 lakh doses more than what was recorded in the same period one week before. The daily vaccination rate has been on a declining trend in the past week. Between April 9-15, India administered an average of 32.69 lakh doses every day. However, as on April 22, the average daily doses given fell to 26.07 lakh. A daily rate of over 68 lakh doses a day is required to vaccinate all adults in India by the end of 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/295-lakh-fresh-infections-and-1981-fatalities-reported/article34397473.ece
24 April 2021||Chennai,||Covishield protects against double mutant: study||Preliminary studies show that people who have been vaccinated with Covishield have protection against the double mutant variant (B.1.617) first found in India. Researchers at the Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) found that protection against the double mutant variant was also seen both when convalescent plasma from people who have been infected and have already recovered was tested in the lab. “Both Covishield vaccinated sera and convalescent sera were found to offer protection against the double mutant variant (B.1.167),” said Dr. Rakesh Mishra, Director, CCMB. “This is only a preliminary study involving four-five people for each group, and was carried out among young people who have recovered from prior infection and another group who received Covishield vaccine.” Dr. Mishra said that in about 10 days, studies involving more people from both groups will be done. Also, the study will involve older people to understand the level of protection. “The study, though preliminary, does show that vaccination with Covishield offers protection against the double mutant variant. So people should go ahead and get vaccinated quickly,” said Dr. Mishra. “The preliminary study also suggests that convalescent plasma may offer protection against reinfection with the double mutant variant. Studies using plasma from more recovered and vaccinated people of different age groups are needed for confirmation,” he said. The institute is carrying out similar studies using plasma from people vaccinated with Covaxin. The B.1.617 variant has two mutations — E484Q and L425R — of concern. According to Dr. Vinod Scaria, a senior scientist at the Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), the two mutations have individually been found to make the virus more infectious and evade antibodies. But their combined effect when found together has not been determined. Lab studies found that convalescent plasma from recovered people neutralised the double mutant variant almost completely even when the plasma was diluted 20-fold. The relative viral load seen when plasma was diluted 40- and 80-fold was about 2-3%. It was nearly 65% when the plasma was diluted 320-fold.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covishield-protects-against-double-mutant-study/article34397481.ece
24 April 2021||Mumbai,||French firm files offer for supply of equipment for JNPP||The French government-owned energy company EDF has filed a binding techno-commercial offer to supply engineering studies and equipment to build six, third-generation EPR reactors in Jaitapur in Maharashtra. The company also clarified that it is neither in charge of construction of nuclear power plant nor an investor and the said responsibility stands with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL). The proposed 9900 MW Jaitapur Nuclear Power Plant (JNPP), billed as the biggest in the country, is planned in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra for which land acquisition process was completed more than seven years back. The project was initially planned with another French government owned company Areva, but was handed to EDF after the latter acquired it in 2017. The project has met with stiff resistance from locals, environmental groups and human rights organisations. It went into dormant mode after land acquisition due to non-agreement on several techno-commercial issues between the two companies responsible. The process moved forward after a meeting between heads of both countries in 2018 in Delhi. The offer, submitted by EDF and its partners to NPCIL on Thursday, includes the detailed technical configuration of the reactors, taking into account the information provided by NPCIL on the Jaitapur site conditions and the joint comprehensive work performed by them and the associated comprehensive commercial terms and conditions for the supply of engineering studies and equipment for six EPR reactors. It has clarified that NPCIL is responsible for the construction and the commissioning of each of the six units of the JNPP, as well as for obtaining all necessary permits and consents in India, including the certification of the EPR technology by the Indian safety regulator, as the owner and future operator of the plant. “During the construction phase, NPCIL may benefit from EDF and its partners’ assistance, notably regarding the sharing of other EPR project-related lessons learned,” it said. Meanwhile, the Jana Hakka Samiti, an umbrella organisation of numerous groups opposing the project, said that the French company was running away from liability law. “Initial agreements were of construction with total investment. How will India raise funds to such a huge project at this point? We have been constantly raising the question on cost of electricity that will be generated through this project. There is no clarity on it yet,” said Satyajit Chavan, convener of JHS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/french-firm-files-offer-for-supply-of-equipment-for-jnpp/article34398344.ece
24 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Emergency use nod for Virafin||The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) on Friday granted emergency use approval for pharma major Zydus Cadila’s antiviral drug ‘Virafin’ to treat moderate COVID-19 disease in adults, company press release said. “A single dose subcutaneous regimen of the antiviral Virafin [a pegylated interferon alpha-2b (PegIFN)] will make the treatment more convenient for the patients. When administered early on during COVID, Virafin will help patients recover faster and avoid much of the complications. Virafin will be available on the prescription of a medical specialist for use in hospital/institutional setup,” the release added. Safety profile The drug’s safety profile is already well known as it is used in treating people with chronic hepatitis B and C. The drug has been repurposed for treating moderate COVID-19 disease. According to Dr. Sharvil Patel, Managing Director, Cadila Healthcare Limited, the therapy “significantly reduces viral load when given early on and can help in better disease management”. In a multi-centre trial in 20-25 centres across India, the company found the drug reduced the need for supplemental oxygen. This clearly “indicates that the antiviral was able to control respiratory distress and failure which has been one of the major challenges in treating COVID-19”, the company said. In the phase-3 trials, the drug was able to achieve “better clinical improvement in the patients suffering from COVID-19”. A “higher proportion (91.15%) of patients administered the drug were RT-PCR negative by day seven as it ensures faster viral clearance”. According to an April 5 company press release, the drug reduced the duration for supplemental oxygen to 56 hours from 84 hours in moderate COVID-19 patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/emergency-use-nod-for-virafin/article34397475.ece
24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||CJI Bobde’s tenure draws to a close||The 47th Chief Justice of India, Sharad A. Bobde, on Friday completed his last working day in office after steering the Supreme Court through unprecedented months of the COVID-19 pandemic. “I did my best,” he told the assembled advocates and law officers. The baton of the top judge will pass to Justice N.V. Ramana, the senior-most judge of the court, who would take his oath of office at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Saturday. Chief Justice Bobde was joined, as is the custom, on the ceremonial Bench by Justice Ramana.  Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal said every CJI should have a minimum tenure of three years. Chief Justice Bobde leaves behind a mixed legacy. The CJI, in his 18-month tenure, made sure that virtual hearings were started early. Though he staunchly believed that virtual hearings did amount to physical hearings, many lawyers disagreed vehemently. In late February 2020, a nine-judge Bench led by CJI Bobde upheld a decision of the Sabarimala Review Bench to refer to a larger Bench questions on the ambit and scope religious freedom practised by multiple faiths across the country. Chief Justice Bobde, in an interview to The Hindu , before he was sworn in as CJI on November 18, 2019, had talked about social media’s irreverence towards institutions like the judiciary. He went on to become the focus of one too many social media posts. Among them was a Twitter post by advocate Prashant Bhushan, which was stretched into a contempt of court action. Mr. Bhushan was fined Rs. 1 for “scandalising the court”. However, the CJI paid close attention to environmental causes. He formed a panel to find ways to stop indiscriminate felling of trees on roads and highways.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cji-bobdes-tenure-draws-to-a-close/article34397445.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Calls grow for U.S. to help India with spare vaccines||As a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic rages in India, calls are growing in the United States to send spare vaccine doses to New Delhi. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Indian and U.S. officials were in touch about possible U.S. help to India at this time, but did not comment on whether the U.S. would send vaccines from its stockpiles. “Let me first say that the United States offers our deepest sympathy to the people of India who are clearly suffering during this global pandemic and we are working closely with Indian officials at both political and experts level to identify ways to help address the crisis,” Ms. Psaki said on Friday in response to a question on whether there are plans for the U.S. to send vaccines, such as from its AstraZeneca stockpile, to India. “So there are ongoing discussions. I don’t have anything more to preview but we are in touch with at a range of levels about how we can help them get through this period of time,” Ms. Psaki said. On the question of whether the U.S. was helping India with its oxygen shortage, Ms. Psaki said the U.S. had provided a “huge, significant” amount of health funding to India over time towards a range of supplies. “…But I will check if oxygen is specifically a part of how we can help at this point of time. There are ongoing discussions so maybe that’s part of the discussions now,” she said. Several lawmakers and health experts remarked on the current wave of the pandemic in India, asking for the U.S. to donate spare vaccines. “India is reporting the world’s highest ever single-day COVID case rise. Earth Day is about the health of the planet and everyone and everything on it. The U.S. has more than enough vaccine for every American, but we are denying countries like India desperately needed support,” U.S. Senator Ed Markey from Massachusetts tweeted on Thursday. In March, the U.S. announced plans to release 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Canada and Mexico. A group Senators, including former Democratic primary progressive candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have written to President Joe Biden, asking the U.S. to support a request by India and South Africa for a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights at the World Trade Organization to facilitate the production of vaccines and therapeutics globally. On Thursday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price referred questions on export controls to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). “You asked about intellectual property and certain controls. That was — is within the purview of USTR. What I will say broadly is that the United States first and foremost is engaged in an ambitious and effective and, so far, successful effort to vaccinate the American people,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/calls-grow-for-us-to-help-india-with-spare-vaccines/article34398135.ece
24 April 2021||Pune,||Vaccine supply very slow, Uddhav tells PM||The supply of vaccines from the Centre to Maharashtra was “very slow”, said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday, reiterating the State’s demand for increased vaccine doses. Mr. Thackeray, speaking during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with Chief Ministers of the worst-hit pandemic States, cited the example of countries such as Israel and the United Kingdom which had succeeded in controlling the virus with their large-scale vaccination drives. Gunning for increased supplies of vaccines and medicines, Mr. Thackeray further said that while the value of Remdesivir in absolutely curing COVID-19 patients might be questionable, Maharashtra would nevertheless need to have adequate stocks at all times as the anti-viral drug would at least help in reducing the duration of the patient’s time inside the hospital He said that while Mr. Modi had urged the imposition of a lockdown as a last resort to rein in the pandemic, Maharashtra had no option but to impose stringent restrictions given its dire situation. “I had a positive discussion with the Prime Minister and expressed my confidence that Maharashtra would win the fight against COVID-19. I also informed him that we have deployed many retired doctors, nurses and medical students to combat the crisis and emphasis is being laid on telemedicine and tele-ICUs,” said Mr. Thackeray, in a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO). Worst affected The State, which has been witnessing a daily average spike of more than 60,000 cases a day, is the worst affected in the country with its active case tally crossing seven lakhs. Observing that the population in Maharashtra between the ages 18-44 was more than five crore, Mr. Thackeray expressed worry that indigenous vaccine manufacturers might not be able to supply doses in large numbers in such a short period of time. “More clarity is needed as to which State will be supplied by the Centre in what quantities of vaccine. If the State asks permission to import vaccines, it should be granted,” Mr. Thackeray suggested during the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-supply-very-slow-uddhav-tells-pm/article34398345.ece
24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC raps lawyers for ‘imputing motives’||A Special Bench of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde on Friday objected to senior lawyers “imputing motives” on the top court for attempting to “stall” proceedings in various High Courts concerning acute oxygen shortage and COVID-19 essentials for patients as deaths rise. The Bench was reacting to various media reports in which several senior lawyers voiced their perceptions on the Bench’s sudden intervention on Thursday, taking suo motu cognisance of the issue. According to them, the top court should have neither disturbed the High Court proceedings nor attempted to transfer the cases to itself midway. In Thursday’s order, the Bench had asked the Centre for a ‘national plan’ to facilitate a uniform supply of COVID-19 essentials. It had issued formal notices to the Centre and States, the Union Territories, and parties who went to various High Courts. The Bench had asked them why the top court should not go ahead and pass “uniform orders” on the supply of oxygen, essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination and declaration of lockdown. This order on Thursday had triggered anticipation among the legal fraternity and the public that the sudden intervention of the top court would delay much-needed relief from High Courts or derail their ongoing monitoring of oxygen supply by the States and the Centre. Lacklustre responses from authorities had been met with proactive judicial orders and sharp remarks from the High Courts of Delhi, Bombay, Sikkim, M.P., Calcutta, Allahabad and Gujarat. But Thursday’s order had somehow presumed that the HCs’ orders were only reaching out to a few and did not give uniform relief. ‘Even-handed approach’ “ Prima facie , we are inclined to take the view that the distribution of these essential services and supplies must be done in an even-handed manner according to the advice of the health authorities,” Thursday’s order said. On Friday, however, the Bench accused senior advocates such as Vikas Singh and Dushyant Dave, who were vocal against Thursday’s order, of “putting pressure on the court”. “We never stalled the HCs from passing orders. Mr. Dave, you imputed motives on us without seeing the order... You have to protect this institution,” Justice L. Nageswara Rao said.  Meanwhile, the court-appointed amicus curiae Harish Salve, recused from the case, saying that his decision was in view of the imputations made that he and the CJI were school friends. He said he did not want important issues in the case to side-tracked by malignant imputations in the media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-raps-lawyers-for-imputing-motives/article34397464.ece
24 April 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. attacks govt. over handling of pandemic||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday said the Centre was responsible for people dying due to shortage of oxygen and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Separately, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram targeted the Centre over differential pricing policy for COVID-19 vaccines and suggested that the State governments come together to ensure uniform pricing. “Corona can cause a fall in oxygen level but it’s #OxygenShortage & lack of ICU beds which is causing many deaths. GOI, this is on you,” tweeted Mr. Gandhi, who himself tested positive and is in home isolation. The Congress leader and his party have been critical of the Narendra Modi government’s handling of the pandemic that has seen a massive shortage of oxygen, hospital beds with ICU facilities and life-saving anti-viral drugs such as Remdesivir and vaccines. the Congress has been advocating aggressive vaccination of all adult age groups but criticised the new vaccine policy that allows differential pricing. The Central government’s decision to allow multiple prices for vaccines is discriminatory and regressive. States must unanimously reject the decision. The best way forward is for the State governments to jointly form a Price Negotiation Committee and offer to negotiate a uniform price with the two vaccine manufacturers,” Mr. Chidamabaram said in a series of tweets. On Wednesday, the Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures Covishield, had announced three slabs: Rs. 150 for the Central government, Rs. 400 for State governments and Rs. 600 for private hospitals per dose. “The joint purchasing power of the State governments will force the manufacturers to agree to a uniform priceThe Central government has abdicated its responsibility and surrendered to corporate profiteering,” the former Finance Minister added. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh slammed Centre for going ahead with the Central Vista project in the midst of a public health emergency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-attacks-govt-over-handling-of-pandemic/article34397455.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||CJI pushes T.N. to let Sterlite reopen plant||Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde on Friday voiced anguish at Tamil Nadu’s objection to reopening Vedanta’s Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi to produce medical oxygen, asking the State to “say something concrete as people are dying due to lack of oxygen”. The three-judge Bench led by the CJI was visibly exasperated when senior advocate Colin Gonsalves informed the court how the Tamil Nadu Advocate-General had stated in the Madras High Court on April 22 that “we are an oxygen-surplus State”. The CJI thundered at the State, saying, “People in the country are in need of oxygen, and Tamil Nadu says it has surplus... This is not the way... You can’t say you are in surplus, so you need not produce oxygen. The country is in bad need of oxygen. It should not be that every State produces and uses up its own oxygen.” “We don’t care if it is you, Vedanta, Centre, A, B, C who runs the plant, but oxygen must be produced from a place capable of producing it...The Constitution demands that material resources should be equally distributed all over the country,” he told Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu counsel, senior advocate C.S. Vaidyanathan, agreed that either the State or the Centre could run the plant to produce medical oxygen. Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan also represented Tamil Nadu. “The State cannot say we will not run it (plant). What is your problem? Just because you have a problem with Vedanta, you will not use their plant and deprive people of oxygen? What is this,” Chief Justice Bobde asked Tamil Nadu point-blank. “The country is in dire need of oxygen. Different States need it. For example, Orissa can come to Rajasthan for oxygen. Law and order issues cannot be an excuse. Why should not we use the capacity when every MT of oxygen matters?” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for Centre, agreed. The hearing was based on plea by Vedanta to reopen its plant to produce medical oxygen. The plant was shut due to environmental pollution. The debate began to heat up after Mr. Vaidyanathan raised apprehensions that reopening the plant would create law and order problem. The case was listed for Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cji-pushes-tn-to-let-sterlite-reopen-plant/article34397442.ece
24 April 2021||Kolkata,||‘Centre’s negligence has led to COVID-19 crisis’||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday addressed a public meeting virtually in Paschim Bardhaman and said that it was because of the “negligence of the Centre” that the COVID-19 situation in the country had assumed alarming proportions. She also alleged that oxygen meant for health facilities in West Bengal was being diverted to other States. The Trinamool Congress chairperson said that no experts had been consulted; oxygen and medicines had not been stocked for the second wave of COVID-19; and Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had said on March 7 that the coronavirus was on its way out. “The crisis has taken on such a scale because of the negligence of the Centre. The BJP wanted to win Bengal at any cost. From all across the country they [BJP leaders] came to West Bengal, putting the entire country and West Bengal in such a critical situation. This is so unfortunate,” she said.   While the Chief Minister maintained that West Bengal had not been invited for the meeting on COVID-19 chaired by the Prime Minister, she also alleged that oxygen supply meant for West Bengal had been diverted to Uttar Pradesh. “There is no oxygen available in the market. Steel Authority of India Limited was meeting our oxygen demands for West Bengal, but that oxygen has been diverted to Uttar Pradesh,” Ms. Banerjee said. She said that all industrial units had been asked to divert their supply for health care.

Around the same time, two other hospitals in the city, Max Smart Hospital and Max Hospital Saket, too, said that they had less than an hour's oxygen supply. “Less than an hour’s Oxygen supplies at Max Smart Hospital & Max Hospital Saket. Awaiting promised fresh supplies from INOX since 1 a.m. Over 700 patients admitted, need immediate assistance,” the hospital said in a statement. Later, the Max Healthcare group said it had stopped new admissions in all its hospitals in Delhi-NCR due to low oxygen stocks. “We regret to inform that we are suspending any new patient admissions in all our hospitals in Delhi NCR till oxygen supplies stabilise,” Max Healthcare said in a tweet. The group has at least six hospitals in the region and a total of over 1,000 beds. Other hospitals also announced that they were not taking new admissions due to the oxygen shortage. Around 12 noon, an official from the Holy Family Hospital in Delhi, which had 385 COVID-19 patients,said they had oxygen stock only for a “few hours” and the situation was “precarious”. Around 2 p.m., Dr. Pankaj Solanki, Medical Superintendent of Dharamveer Solanki Hospital, which has 16 COVID-19 patients, said they had oxygen stock for just two hours. “We have been told by someone from govt. that oxygen will be given first to large hospitals and then to small hospitals. “We have also admitted patients and the cost of life cannot be determined by whether the hospital is large or small,” the hospital, which has 50 beds, said in a tweet in Hindi. Blame game In a statement late in the evening, a spokesperson for Sir Ganga Ram Hospital again said: “We have 30 to 45 minutes of oxygen left.” Hospitals in Delhi have been facing an oxygen shortage for the past six days. The Delhi government has been blaming Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments for not allowing smooth supply of oxygen from private oxygen plants in the States to Delhi.

Delhi was among the States, along with Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat, where instances of the U.K. strain in the wider community far outnumbered those detected among international travellers and their contacts. For instance, in Delhi, there were 324 instances of the UK strain in the “community” as opposed to 91 among travellers and their contacts (T&C). In Gujarat, it was 18 in T&C and 42 in the community and in Chhattisgarh there was only 1 case in the T&C as opposed to 14 in the community. Such numbers weren’t yet present for the Brazilian and South African strains. Several of these States are showing unprecedented spikes. The comparative data was presented by Dr. Singh. So far about 15,000 genomes had been sequenced, which is about 1% of India’s coronavirus case load. Dr. Anurag Agrawal, Director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, said the concern with the Indian variants was that they possessed two mutations — E484K and L245R — that together would increase the likelihood of a wider range of antibodies being unable to counter the virus. “However immunity also includes a cellular level response that can generate cross reactivity and so we can still expect, a good antibody response which is why all vaccines, despite the variant, will be fairly protective (against disease),” he said. Dr. Priya Abraham, Director, ICMR-National Institute of Virology, said the virus would continue to mutate and the best defence would be to continue following ‘COVID appropriate behaviour' . She said that 90% of the RT-PCR tests being deployed were accurate. However, there were challenges in testing with several trained staff too testing positive and affecting the quality of testing and analysis, she added. Virologist Shahid Jameel, and head of the advisory group to INSACOG, who was moderating the webinar, said there was “preliminary” information that both Covaxin and Covishield appeared to be effective against the Indian variant. He was referring to a report by the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad. “Science is a process that calls for evidence based policy making and not policy based evidence making. Three 'T's are needed: Truth, Transparency and Trust. Truth leads to transparency leads to trust,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rising-prevalence-of-uk-strain-in-delhi/article34397451.ece
24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre sets up control room to ease supplies||With lockdowns in different forms imposed in several States in the face of the second wave of COVID-19 infections, the Centre has set up a control room to help facilitate movement of essential goods across the country. The control room will be helmed by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and will monitor the status of transportation and delivery of goods, manufacturing, delivery of essential commodities to people and the difficulties being faced by various stakeholders due to the current restrictions. Issues reported by various stakeholders, including trade and industry bodies, to the control room shall be taken up by the Centre with the State governments concerned. Industry’s demand It is not clear at this point if the industry’s demand that the distinction between delivery of essential goods, which is permissible, and non-essential goods be done away with will be taken up with individual States. “A control room is being set up to monitor the issues of internal trade, manufacturing, delivery and logistics of essential commodities during Covid pandemic. In the event of any manufacturing, transportation, distribution, wholesale or e-commerce companies facing difficulties in transportation and distribution of goods or mobilization of resources, information can be given at the following telephone number/email: (011) 23062383, 23062975, dpiit-controlroom@gov.in,” the department said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-opens-control-room-for-supplies/article34397462.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Lord Siva’s will||Thirumoolar in his Thirumandiram pays obeisance to Uma Devi, whose penance was blessed in Thiruvavaduturai. Thirumoolar stayed in Thiruvavaduturai, and he says that he had been reciting the many names of Lord Siva. Sitting under a peepul tree there, he acquired Siva jnana, he says. He calls the tree ‘Siva bodhi.’ Steeped in meditation, he did not notice the passage of time, said R. Narayanan in a discourse. Thirumoolar then poses a question. If one has not done good in one’s previous births, how can one attain good in subsequent births? Considering that he has been blessed enough to praise Lord Siva in Tamil, he says it is obvious that he must have done good in his previous birth. Here, by previous birth, Thirumoolar means his life before he entered the body of the cowherd Moolan. Thirumoolar was originally called Sundaranatha, and he came to the earth to meet sage Agastya. Chancing upon a dead cowherd, and his agitated cows, Sundaranatha entered the body of the cowherd, who was called Moolan. Sundaranatha could accomplish this because of his powers. He had the power of the eight siddhis. His idea was to take the cows to their shelter and return to re-enter his body. But when he returned, he found that his body was missing. And so he stayed on in Moolan’s body, and came to be called Thirumoolar. It is these events that he is referring to here. It was Lord Siva’s will that he should continue to live on in this world for many years, so that he could write the Saiva Agamas in Tamil. He is referring to his life as Sundaranatha as his previous birth and his present life as Thirumoolar as his next birth. He was chosen by Lord Siva to propagate the Saiva Agamas, which are as sacred as the Vedas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lord-sivas-will/article34397465.ece

Efforts were under way to determine the location of the possible event. Through a tweet, the Chamoli Police urged social media users to refrain from spreading rumours. The police, however, said the Border Road Organisation (BRO) Commander concerned had informed them that reports of such an incident had been received and teams were being sent to the area. Due to heavy snowfall, communication lines in the area were disrupted and, therefore, the incident could not be confirmed. The Uttarakhand DIG (Law and Order) Nilesh Anand Bharne said details were also being cross-checked with the ITBP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bro-reports-glacier-break-in-uttarakhand/article34398133.ece
24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC intervention is wrong, says Congress||The Supreme Court’s intervention in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic is “wrong”, “uncalled for” and may have the “unintended effect of legitimation of the utter failure of the Central Government” in handling the crisis, the Congress said on Friday. Addressing a virtual press conference, senior advocate and Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said various High Courts were upholding the citizens’ right to life and were providing relief to the common people. “The Supreme Court’s intervention on April 22, 2021 is totally uncalled for. Unfortunately, it is wrong, wrong and wrong. It is wrong because it is not suo motu ameliorative but a reaction to palliative High Court orders. It is wrong because decentralisation, not over-centralisation — judicial, administrative and societal — is the need of the hour,” Mr. Singhvi said, reading out from a strongly worded statement. “It is wrong because it may have the unintended effect of legitimation of the utter failure of the Central government on all fronts in its anti-Covid policies and actions ... It is wrong because it, in fact, enhances the closed and incestuous circle of the Central government or connected/ affiliated persona and seeks to find a solution from amongst those responsible for the crisis in the first place,” he added.  The party’s response follows criticism from several lawyers and jurists who had questioned the SC’s intervention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/scs-move-on-covid-19-cases-is-wrong-cong/article34397459.ece

24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Koyambedu merchants demand exemption for trucks during curfew||Association of Koyambedu merchants and sand lorry owners in the city want trucks transporting goods to be allowed to operate during the total lockdown on Sunday. Members of the Federation of All Associations of Koyambedu Periyar Vegetable Market said on average, the market received about 5,000 tonnes of vegetables from various States and other parts of Tamil Nadu, such as Theni, Hosur, Mettupalayam and Perambalur. Although the wholesale and semi-wholesale markets would be closed on Sunday, any hassles in operation of vegetable-laden vehicles would affect the supply chain on Monday. Federation president G.D. Rajasekaran said farmers from other districts and neighbouring districts would load the produce early on Sunday and the lorries would start transporting around noon to reach the market at night for trade on Monday. The Federation has made a representation to the Agricultural Production Commissioner and Principal Secretary Gagandeep Singh Bedi seeking to allow vehicles to ply on Sunday to ensure smooth functioning of the market. The prices of most vegetables remained normal at Koyambedu though the number of retailers visiting the market dipped by nearly 40%. This affected wholesale business. P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants’ Association, said retailers from areas as far as Tiruttani, Arakkonam, Tindivanam and even up to Nellore purchased from Koyambedu. However, some of the retailers were avoiding visits for various reasons, including restrictions. Many vegetables such as carrots, onions and tomatoes sold for Rs. 20-Rs. 22 a kg in the wholesale market. Officials of the Koyambedu Market Management Committee said the number of visitors remained almost the same. Public announcements were made through speakers in five languages on COVID-19 safety measures. On average, a minimum of Rs. 25,000 was collected as fines daily from those not following safety protocols. Lorry owners’ plea Similarly, the Tamil Nadu State Sand Lorry Owners Federation represented to the Chief Secretary, seeking exemption for vehicles carrying goods to the city from the total lockdown on Sunday. Federation president S. Yuvaraj said the government should allow plying of lorries at night to help supply material for construction work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/exempt-trucks-from-curfew-demand-koyambedu-merchants/article34398176.ece
24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vendors protest move to install smart carts on Marina||Tension prevailed for some time on Marina beach on Friday after vendors opposed the move of the Greater Chennai Corporation to install stainless steel carts and remove those belonging to them. Corporation staff, accompanied by the police, tried to remove the carts of the vendors, saying the Madras High Court had permitted only 900 of the 1,500 shops on the sands. The vendors, who opposed the move, sought to know why the Corporation was showing undue haste in removing the shops when the matter was pending before the court. They added that the shops on the Marina were closed due to the pandemic. Sheela, a woman vendor, said the shops were their source of livelihood, and the civic body was trying to bring in outsiders to occupy their space. “The vendors are all well-behaved and always keep an eye on the visitors. There have even been innumerable instances of vendors having saved people from committing suicide,” said Ko. Su. Mani, a fishing community leader. Shanthi, another vendor, said more than 2,000 vendors depend on these outlets. “Families have sent their children to school and paid rent thanks to the income they get mostly during the weekend. There are so many widows and destitute women who depend on this for their survival. What will happen to them?” she asked. A section of the protesting vendors was arrested by the police as a preventive measure and later let off. Meanwhile, a senior official of the Corporation said the officials had started installing the 900 smart carts on Marina beach, based on the directions of the Madras High Court. “We have done the lottery and readied the smart carts for vendors. They probably wanted more carts. We have not received any representation from them. We will inform the High Court. We will continue the work. The installation of all smart carts will be completed shortly,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vendors-protest-move-to-install-smart-carts-on-marina/article34398182.ece
24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Legwork by leader brings basic amenities to an Irula hamlet||An entire village and its leader fought for very basic requirements — water and road — and secured them years after Independence. The fruits of their labour, however, make all that they underwent worth it, they say. Residents of Kulathumedu, an Irula hamlet near the Pulicat lake in Tiruvallur district, now have good drinking water and proper road access — the bare necessities that they did not have till a few decades ago. “Every day after we sold fish in the market, we used to buy provisions and walk through over 3 feet of brackish water, keep the things at home and collect our pots and wade again across the lake to fetch drinking water. We would walk either to Pazhaverkadu or Edaimanikuppam, a kilometre away,” recalled K. Padmavathy, the wife of the former panchayat president, who was responsible for getting water supply to the village. She remembered how during the 1990s, when Jayalalithaa was the Chief Minister, she would leave her baby girl at home to go to the Collector’s office by bus as part of a group. “It was in Kancheepuram. It took us several visits to get drinking water supply. We used to collect Rs. 1 from residents who could afford to pay towards incidental expenses. There were many who couldn’t afford to pay as well, but we managed with what was collected,” she said, adding that they were encouraged by the International Fund for Agricultural Development to go and meet government officials and get things done. It is this organisation that also trained them in mud crab fattening. The women feed fish to the crabs, which fetch them a good income. Road connectivity It was through Ms. Padmavathy’s efforts that the village also got road connectivity, said Suman, a resident of Pulicat. “She would tell us how she ran behind the convoy of a Minister and stopped the vehicles and told them of the misery of having to wade in water at all times if they had to get out of the village. The Minister is said to have sanctioned the road on the spot,” he said. Ms. Padmavathy said she told them how it was inconvenient, especially for the women to lift up their clothes and walk in the water. She is now working with the women of the village in mud crab fattening, a vocation the village is now known for. “We have a ‘balwadi’ to meet the nutritional needs of mothers and children properly. Our next requirement is ‘patta’ for our homes. We have submitted petitions to the government, and are awaiting its response. In any such request to the government, a constant follow-up is necessary, and if our children are happy today, it is mainly because of the follow-ups that we have done over the years,” she said.

Palaniswami on Friday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the supply of about 20 lakh doses of vaccines and for easy accessibility to Remdesivir, a life-saving drug for COVID-19 patients. In a letter, a copy of which was released to the media, he requested an assured supply of about 20 lakh doses to ensure unhindered vaccination and the administration of the second dose to those on the date and the site they reported. Prioritising supplies Referring to reports on national and State regulators prioritising supplies to certain States and restricting the sale of Remdesivir to the State where the drug is produced, Mr. Palaniswami said, “This would be very damaging to the availability of such valuable life-saving drugs at places of need.” At this stage, any restrictive order by the States should be barred to ensure easy accessibility to Remdesivir, he said, urging the Centre to take up the issue with these States where the drug is made. Mr. Palaniswami also highlighted that the Integrated Vaccine Complex at Chengalpattu, a Union government project of national importance, was awaiting commissioning and validation. “I am informed that this will be possible if some pending works are fast-tracked. I would appeal to you to bring this facility to the working condition at the earliest so as to augment COVID-19 vaccine production,” he said. Tamil Nadu has so far administered 47.31 lakh doses of vaccines. It is expected to administer at least 2 lakh doses a day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-requests-pm-for-supply-of-vaccines-and-remdesivir/article34397598.ece
24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Work with caution to prevent another lockdown: DMK chief||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Friday said everyone should work with caution to prevent another lockdown like last year. Mr. Stalin said the lockdown last year had led to job losses and economic distress for a large number of people who still had not recovered fully from it. “Many are still facing mental distress,” he said, asking people and DMK cadre to follow the COVID-19 restrictions in force and act with caution. While the Centre had announced that everyone aged over 18 would be eligible for vaccination against COVID-19 from May 1, he said in reality there was a shortage of vaccines. “There are many reports of people who went to get their first dose of vaccination being turned away and even those whose second dose is due being told that there is a shortage of vaccines,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the Central government’s directive that the States could purchase vaccines directly from the manufacturer meant that rates announced by the manufacturers would put severe financial burden on the State governments. This would also affect the general public, he said. “During a disaster, those in power need to take decisions that will enhance the people’s trust. Instead, the information coming out about vaccine shortage, high pricing and shortage of drugs for those under COVID-19 treatment is only creating confusion among the people. This will only increase their fear and lead to unnecessary stress and tension, leading to even more distress than about the actual disease itself,” he said. “This is the time when the Central and State governments should work on a war footing to address the issues,” he said. Earlier in the day, Mr. Stalin distributed COVID-19 relief kits among residents of Egmore, Tiru.Vi.Ka. Nagar, Villivakkam and Kolathur.

24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||New variant affecting more youth: Minister||The new variant in the second wave of COVID-19 is affecting more youngsters who are turning up at hospitals with lung involvement, making it challenging for the doctors to treat, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said on Friday. Expressing serious concern that the youth were getting exposed to vulnerabilities and often ignoring classic symptoms, such as fatigue, body pain, vomiting and diarrhoea, he told The Hindu that early intervention was not only the key to expeditious recovery and saving lives but also prevented spreading of the virus to others with whom the person might have come in contact. Dr. Vijayabaskar said the new variant was progressing rapidly among the youngsters and affecting their lungs. In the first wave, the virus progressed by showing various stages of illness like tiredness, fever, cough and throat infection. But now it was progressing much faster. “I appeal to the public, particularly the youth, to rush to the nearest hospital if they have gastrointestinal disorder symptoms and get tested for COVID-19. The more they delay, the more the lungs may get affected. Doctors are saying that many youngsters are coming to hospitals with breathing difficulties, requiring oxygen support,” he said. He appealed to the youngsters not to step out of their houses unless the situation warranted it. “Even if people have to go out due to inevitable reasons, they should ensure compliance with safety guidelines like wearing a mask, keeping physical distance and frequent washing of hands using sanitisers. You have to be 100% careful, not 99%... any silly negligence can be dangerous,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-variant-affecting-more-youth-minister/article34397608.ece

Railway cuts staff attendance to less than 50%||To minimise the spread of COVID-19, Southern Railway has decided to work with less than 50% of the staff at its zonal headquarters here. With cases increasing and deaths occurring at railway hospitals, the General Manager authorised the heads of departments to operate with less than 50% of the staff and encourage the others to work from home, sources said on Friday. A circular issued on Friday authorised the Divisional Railway Managers of Chennai, Madurai, Salem, Tiruchi, Palghat and Thiruvananthapuram to decide on staff attendance on the basis of local conditions. The norm would apply to the workshops, too. Last week, Southern Railway advised a minimum of 50% attendance. However, to check the the spread of the infection, it decided to bring the number further down, the sources said. Asking all employees, particularly those aged 45 and above, to get vaccinated, the circular urged for compliance with the latest safety guidelines prescribed by the Department of Personnel and Training.  Staggered timings The Department’s advisory said the officers and staff members should follow staggered timings to avoid overcrowding at offices. Officials who did not report for duty would have to make themselves available on the phone and through other electronic means of communication at all times from their residence, or they should work from home. It said persons with disabilities and pregnant women might be exempted from office attendance and allowed to work from home until further orders. The entry of visitors should be curtailed and biometric attendance would remain suspended, and paper attendance registers should be maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/southern-railway-cuts-staff-attendance-to-less-than-50/article34398184.ece

Prakash, Commissioner of the Greater Chennai Corporation. Mr. Prakash told presspersons that residents with mild symptoms had been advised not to visit government tertiary care hospitals to prevent crowding. Instead, they should visit the 12 screening centres of the Corporation. Over 85% of the patients had mild symptoms and were being advised home isolation or admitted to COVID-19 care centres, Mr. Prakash said. “Our aim is to prevent an exponential growth of cases. We are taking steps to prevent cases from increasing to more than 15,000 or 20,000 a day. At present, the cases have crossed 3,800 per day. We expect the peak by the end of May,” he said. Priority for serious cases The daily tally of cases had been on the upward trend for the past 35 days. Keeping this in view, the civic body was taking steps to reduce crowding at the four major government hospitals. Only serious cases would receive priority at these hospitals. “Residents who test positive with mild symptoms will be taken by Corporation employees to the screening centres at 12 locations,” said Mr. Prakash. Pointing to the State government’s direction to allocate 50% of the beds to COVID-19 patients at all hospitals, he said only severe cases should be admitted there. “Doctors may not be able to give quality care to serious cases in the event of crowding of patients with mild symptoms. The increase in the number of patients dying of COVID-19 is because of such issues,” the Commissioner said. Vaccine stock Stressing the need for giving priority to the second vaccine dose, Mr. Prakash said the city had a stock of 10,658 doses of Covaxin and 75,000 doses of Covishield. “Three days ago, we had three lakh doses. We have covered 60% of the targeted population. Today, we received 2 to 3 lakh doses of vaccine. We have demanded 50% of the stock received by the State for Chennai as the population density is high. Some pockets have a population density of more than 60,000 per sq km,” he said. Urging residents to wear masks, the Corporation Commissioner said the number of cases would reduce in one week if the mask discipline improved to more than 90%. “We will launch an app for COVID in a few days. Our telecounselling facility receives 2,178 calls a day,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-corpn-expects-tally-to-touch-5000/article34397619.ece
24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||46.8 kg of khat leaves worth Rs. 1.17 cr. seized in Chennai||The Customs officials at the airport seized 46.8 kg of khat leaves brought in parcels and arrested a 27-year-old aeronautical engineer working in a city-based IT company. Based on information that narcotics were likely to be smuggled through postal parcels arriving from Africa, five parcels, which arrived from Nairobi, Kenya, were seized at the Foreign Post Office, Chennai. The first parcel was declared to contain “flower vases”.  11 vases found Upon opening, 11 wooden vases wrapped in white foam sheet were found. On close examination, each vase was found to be sealed. On opening the top, a pink polybag was found inside, in which khat leaves were concealed. The tops of all the 11 vases were cut open and khat leaves recovered. The other four parcels were declared to contain ‘rosemary’ and ‘dried spices’. Upon opening the parcels, a silver opaque polybag was found inside, in which five pink polybags containing dried leaves suspected to be khat leaves were concealed. In total, 46.8 kg of khat leaves worth Rs. 1.17 crore were recovered and seized under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. A press release from the Commissioner of Customs said khat (C atha edulis ), also known as mraa, is a stimulant drug and is prohibited under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Khat is an evergreen shrub mainly cultivated in East Africa and South Yemen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/khat-leaves-worth-rs-117-cr-seized/article34398177.ece
24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Vaccine wastage across Tamil Nadu has been brought down to 5%’||COVID-19 vaccine wastage across Tamil Nadu was reduced to 5% between April 1 and April 20, and steps are being taken to cut it further to 3%, the State government said on Thursday. In a statement after meetings with senior officials and Collectors, Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan said that with the Centre allowing vaccination of those aged above 18 from May 1, wastage would be avoided totally. Reasons cited As for the reasons for the wastage, he said 20 persons would be administered vaccine from one vial of Covaxin and 10 persons from one vial of Covishield. “In the beginning, when the general mood was to avoid vaccines and five to six persons showed up at vaccination centres in the evenings just before the drive was to end for the day, shots were administered with the high objective not to disappoint those who came for vaccination,” he said. Hence, doses that would have been given to four or five persons went waste. Moreover, a vial had to be used up within four hours. The national vaccination programme allows wastage of up to 10%. “Due to the above reasons, wastage was reported between January 16 and March 31,” the statement said. A senior official told The Hindu : “During the meetings, the government instructed officials to focus on contact-tracing, intensify vaccination in hotspot districts and monitor health infrastructure...” As for the allegation that the RT-PCR test kits were being imported at higher rates from Brazil, the government said they were being imported “at the lowest cost in the country” from South Korea and the United States. At present, of the 54,417 beds available at COVID-19 hospitals, 32,942 are fitted with oxygen supply. Steps are being taken to increase the number of ventilators and high-flow nasal cannulas. Oxygen storage has been increased from 395 metric tonnes last year to 888 metrics tonnes this year. “A total of 1,167 metric tonnes of oxygen storage is at government and private hospitals,” the statement said. Stocks in reserve Medicines such as Tocilizumab inj 400 mg, Remdesivir inj 100 mg and Enoxaparin inj 40 mg were being supplied to all taluk hospitals across the State, Mr. Ranjan said. “Tamil Nadu is the only State where Remdesivir is available at all government hospitals in all districts,” he said. Stocks required for 20 days are in reserve and orders have been placed for 2 lakh vials. “Based on need, this [Remdesivir] is being given to private hospitals too.” In the first phase, Rs. 61 crore was sanctioned for opening COVID-19 Care Centres in all districts. A total of 5,43,518 violations of the Public Health Act, 1939, were reported and fine of Rs. 11.5 crore was imposed. Adviser to the government and former Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam, Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy and senior officials were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccine-wastage-across-tamil-nadu-has-been-brought-down-to-5/article34398466.ece
24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination drive may cost State exchequer Rs. 1,536 cr.||The Tamil Nadu government’s proposal for free vaccination of people aged 18-45 against COVID-19 may cost the exchequer about Rs. 1,536 crore, if 60% of this age group is covered. About 3.2 crore people are in this age group. A vaccine dose costs Rs. 400. The estimate is based on the fact that each person has to be administered the vaccine twice. Senior officials are conscious of the additional burden, but they say that besides preventing a super-spreader event, the drive will ensure that the economy does not suffer because people aged 18-45 are the most productive. Migrant workers, employed in a number of sectors, such as construction and services, will be among the beneficiaries. One of the factors that compelled the government to take the decision on the procurement is to gain the ‘first mover advantage’. The officials are aware that Karnataka has already initiated steps to have the vaccine procured. Dual pricing As for the dual pricing policy, the State would have heaved a sigh of relief had the vaccine been priced at Rs. 150 a dose, the rate at which the Centre got the vaccine. At the same time, the government knows it has few options. As the drive will be a priority for a new government, the authorities will be left with no alternative to cutting down the expenditure. However, what is adding to the anxiety of the officials is the potential supply constraint, “which we do not want to have once the order is placed and the vaccination plan is rolled out,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-drive-may-cost-state-exchequer-rs-1536-cr/article34397603.ece
24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Vaccines prevent severe illnesses’||While some of the COVID-19 vaccines have reported reduced efficacy against new variants of the SARS CoV-2 virus, they continue to remain effective in preventing severe illness, said Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist, World Health Organization. Delivering the 23rd Dr. S. Rangarajan Memorial Lecture, organised by Sundaram Medical Foundation through video conferencing on Friday, she said that vaccination must be continued to prevent severe illness, hospitalisation and death regardless of the variants. Pointing out that 11 vaccines were used across the world against COVID-19, Dr. Soumya said that some of them had reported reduced efficacy against the new variants. “However, clinical studies have shown that the majority of these vaccines are quite effective in at least preventing severe disease,” she said. Faster transmission She said that new variants result in faster transmission and explosive growth in cases. However, she said this did not mean that the virus had become more virulent. “People do not die because the virus is more virulent. But because the health systems cannot cope. People may not get the care they need and therefore they may die,” she said. She spoke on the importance of keeping in mind equitable access right from the beginning of the development of vaccines. ‘Use of antibiotics’ Dr. Soumya cautioned against rampant and unnecessary use of antibiotics for COVID-19 patients. Highlighting that medications, such as Favipiravir and Ivermectin, were being prescribed, she said that antibiotics must be used only in case of certain kinds of pneumonia. She stressed on the need for continuous monitoring and proper clinical management instead of such avoidable medication, which she said may lull people into believing that they were getting better. About Remdesivir, she said it had not proven to do anything for mortality, severity or reduction of hospitalisation. “In some cases, it has shown to reduce the disease by two days that too in situations where the patients were not too early or too late in the disease,” she said. ‘Incredible progress’ Comparing steps against tuberculosis and the COVID-19 pandemic, she highlighted the incredible scientific progress towards vaccines and diagnostics made in the last one year for COVID-19, unlike other infectious diseases for which it might take several years for such advancements. She said that while technologies such as genomic sequencing had greatly helped the fight against the pandemic, COVID-19 reiterated the need for strengthening conventional mechanisms to fight infectious diseases, such as having strong surveillance, primary healthcare systems and trained public health professionals. She highlighted the importance of global solidarity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccines-prevent-severe-illnesses/article34397643.ece
24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Two conservancy staff rewarded for their honesty||Two conservancy workers who handed over gold jewellery which they found while on duty to the police were felicitated on Friday. M. Mohanasundaram, 55, of Royapuram, a conservancy worker, collected garbage from the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board quarters in Rangarajapuram, Korukkupet, and carried it to Ekappan Street for segregation. During segregation, he found a bag containing gold jewellery. He immediately went to the Korukkupet police station and handed over the jewellery to the police. By then, M. Muniyamma, 47, a resident of the quarters, came to the police station and said 10 sovereigns of gold jewellery kept in a bag for her daughter’s marriage had gone missing from her house. Inspector Thavamani verified the claim of Ms. Muniyamma and handed over to her the bag given by Mr. Mohanasundaram. During inquiry, the woman told the police that she had cleaned the house and may have dropped the bag containing the jewellery by mistake when Mr. Mohanasundaram came for garbage collection. In another case, Rani, 37, spotted a gold chain in a pile of garbage while cleaning Fourth Street in Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, Perungudi. She went around asking people in the vicinity if the chain belonged to them. Since no one claimed ownership of the chain, she reported the matter to her supervisor. Acting upon the advice of her colleagues and superiors, she handed over the gold chain to the Thoraipakkam police station. Commissioner of Police Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal felicitated the two for their honesty and announced a reward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-conservancy-staff-rewarded-for-their-honesty/article34398180.ece

24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Withdraw letter about counting of postal ballots, DMK urges EC||DMK organisation secretary R.S. Bharathi has written to the Chief Election Commissioner, seeking the immediate withdrawal of a letter issued by the Chief Electoral Officer in Tamil Nadu on March 16 regarding the counting of postal ballots. He said the DMK had apprehensions that if the counting of EVM ballots was allowed to be completed before the counting of postal ballots was finished, it would lead to malpractice. Mr. Bharathi, in his letter, said the CEO’s letter, which said that more time was required to count postal ballots, was based on no real evidence and was an unfounded apprehension. “As such, any such apprehension cannot overrule the statutory instructions and guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India,” he said. He added, “It is also trite that the number of postal ballots will be greater due to the inclusion of absentee voters, and as such, it is likely that there are going to be a higher number of elections where the victory margin will be closer to the number of postal ballot votes.” The DMK leader said it was therefore only fair for the postal ballots to necessarily be counted before the penultimate round of EVM counting, as was the case before the letter issued by the CEO. The DMK said if EVM counting was allowed to be completed without the completion of the counting of postal ballots, it would pave the way for malpractice and there was a danger of postal ballots being rejected or accepted illegally to suit one person’s electoral victory or defeat. “Only to avoid those malpractices, the rule [says] that the penultimate round shall not be counted, unless the postal ballots are counted. By citing delay as a reason, this noble cause shall not be lost,” the DMK leader said. He requested the CEC to issue a clarification letter, informing all District Election Officers and returning officers that the procedure, as stated in the different handbooks, should continue.  It is trite that the number of postal ballots will be greater due to the inclusion of absentee voters R.S. Bharathi DMK organisation secretary||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/withdraw-letter-about-counting-of-postal-ballots-dmk-urges-ec/article34398186.ece
24 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||GI tag sought for Vilachery clay toys||The Kulala Handicraft Artisan Welfare Association has applied for the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for the famous clay toys made at Vilachery in Thiruparankundram, Madurai. The MSME Intellectual Property Facilitation Centre and NABARD’s Madurai Agri Business Incubation Forum were the facilitators for this application filed by P. Sanjai Gandhi, advocate, High Court and IPR attorney. Officials of the Geographical Indication Registry in Chennai confirmed the filing of the application. “The toys are made of clay from the Vilachery tank and nearby places. All the artisans here make dolls by using mould and paint them by hand,” said Mr. Gandhi. These artisans live around the villages of Vilachery, Melamathur, Keelamathur, Melakuyilkudi, Keelakuyilkudi, Thuvariman, Sambakudi, Karadipatti, Tattanur and Vadivelkarai of Madurai West taluk.  Historical details According to the historical details given in the application, the artisans of Vilachery worshipped at a Karuppannaswamy temple, which was 300 years old. The statue of the main deity of the temple was made of burned clay. The temple was developed and administered by Vilachery villagers. Inside the temple, one can see colourful mud horses of various sizes, which are donated by potters during the annual festival celebrated in the Tamil month of ‘Purattasi’. “Every year, new horses replace the older ones, which are dissolved in the pond. These are the evidence that people from Vilachery have been making clay dolls for long,” Mr. Gandhi said. P. Sivakumar, CEO of NABARD-Madurai Agri Business Incubation Forum, said the filing of the application was supported by NABARD, the MSME Intellectual Property Facilitation Centre and Madurai District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association (MADITSSIA). The current business volume of these toys is around Rs. 15 crore, and it can be increased to Rs. 50 crore with new marketing strategies. “There are over 550 families and 250 manufacturers involved in this business.” These products are exported to the United States, Germany, Malaysia, Singapore and the West Asian countries through merchants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gi-tag-sought-for-vilachery-clay-toys/article34398187.ece

Ramadoss on Friday said it can’t be denied that the Assembly election in Tamil Nadu was one of the reasons for the spread of the second wave ofCOVID-19. However, he blamed the people not following the protocols as the main reason for the spread. If people had followed the protocols, such as wearing masks and not stepping out unnecessarily, the spread could have been contained within 15 days, he said in a statement. Dr. Ramadoss made this remark while urging the Tamil Nadu government to adopt a new strategy for containing the spread ofCOVID-19. “The next three weeks are crucial and if the spread is not contained, things will become worse. The State government should focus on increasing the number of tests, improving the infrastructure for treating those who are infected and increasing the vaccination coverage, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poll-one-of-the-reasons-for-second-wave-ramadoss/article34397611.ece

With the photo of the board widely circulated in social media, which also came to the attention of the district authorities and senior officials with the Health Department, the hospital was allotted vaccine doses on Friday. Sources said that senior officials chided those who placed the board at the hospital and told them that they could have personally informed people who came to receive vaccine jabs. On Friday, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar tweeted a photo of the board, which was updated, informing that Covishield and Covaxin were available at the hospital. On Thursday evening, Collector S. Nagarajan had told The Hindu the district had adequate stock of vaccine including doses of Covaxin. However, a Health Department official said the district received 19,000 doses of Covishield alone on Thursday and was awaiting fresh stock of Covaxin doses. Sources with many hospitals in the district said they had minimal stock of the COVID-19 vaccine and the majority of them had doses of Covishiled alone. People who had already taken their first dose of Covaxin were told by many hospitals that they were out of stock of the vaccine when they came for the second shot. “I took the first dose of Covaxin from Mettupalayam GH on March 24. I was asked to come for the second shot on Thursday. I was told that Covaxin was out of stock when I enquired with the vaccine centre at the hospital on Wednesday. The reply was the same when I checked again on Thursday and Friday morning,” said a journalist attached to a Tamil news channel from Mettupalayam. A spokesperson attached to a private hospital in Coimbatore said it had not had stock of Covaxin for the last three-four days. “It is the Health Department that allots us vaccines as of now - Covaxin or Covishield. We can only offer to people what is supplied by the Department,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dearth-of-vaccine-becomes-evident-in-coimbatore-district/article34398201.ece

The husband of a school teacher working in a private school in Peelamedu told The Hindu on Friday his wife was allegedly asked to work from the school since the first week of April and that she had recently tested positive for COVID-19. “She was taken to the COVID-19 care centre at CODISSIA Trade Fair Complex,” he said. According to T. Arulanandam, a Coimbatore-based school teacher and State auditor of Tamil Nadu High Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association, many instances of school teachers testing positive and even dying due to complications have been occurring across the district of late. “These are not being highlighted separately,” he alleged. With Class 12 completing their practical examinations on Friday, they were no longer required to come to the schools till the public examination. However, there were no such instructions for teachers and they were anxious of travelling every day amid the rising COVID-19 cases to reach their respective schools, Mr. Arulanandam said. “Last year, they allowed us to work from home. The school work can be done from home by the teachers,” he said. When contacted, Coimbatore Chief Educational Officer M. Ramakrishnan said he had instructed the headmasters and other heads of schools to coordinate with the Health Department if any teachers or staff members tested positive for COVID-19 in their respective schools. The directions from the State government regarding teachers working from schools were awaited, he said, adding that all the schools had been instructed to adhere to the COVID-19 standard operating procedures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-anxious-to-work-from-schools-amid-second-wave/article34397639.ece
24 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corporation asks apartments to come forward for group vaccination||Coimbatore Corporation on Friday started vaccinating employees of the State-owned Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac). As of Friday afternoon, the Corporation had vaccinated 125 of the 375 employees at the special camp organised at the Tasmac warehouse in Peelamedu. This camp was the latest in the series of exclusive camps that the civic body had organised for employees of the various State Public Sector Undertakings and departments, said sources. The Corporation had so far vaccinated Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, Public Works Department, Coimbatore Collectorate and a few other employees’ organisations. The civic body had also asked apartments to come forward for group vaccination. Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian said the Corporation was ready with its mobile medical units to vaccinate residents of apartment complexes. The apartment associations should identify the number of persons who were yet to get COVID-19 vaccination and if they had a sizeable number, they should contact the Corporation.  The apartments could contact the control room in the Corporation main office on 0422-2302323 or North Zone office on 0422-2243133, South Zone on 0422-2252705, East Zone 0422-2595950, West Zone 0422-2551800, Central Zone 0422-2215618 or on mobile 97505-54321. Given the surge in COVID-19 cases, the Corporation allowed asymptomatic COVID-19 positive persons to remain in home isolation. But they should periodically check their blood oxygen level using pulse oximeter and reach out to the Corporation if they suspected of having symptoms. In a related development, the Corporation sources said it was becoming increasingly difficult for field staff to trace the secondary contacts of those turned COVID-19 positive. While identifying and testing the family or immediate kin or colleagues was easy, it was not so in the case of tracing secondary contacts. This was proving to be difficult this time as there was no complete lockdown, and almost all economic activity was in full swing and people’s movement was not restricted. Nevertheless, the Corporation was doing its best to trace them as well, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-asks-apartments-to-come-forward-for-group-vaccination/article34398188.ece
24 April 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||TNSTC sees sharp fall in revenue||The Coimbatore Division of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) has seen a sharp decrease in revenue for Coimbatore district amid the COVID-19 restrictions, a comparison of parameters revealed. TNSTC sources said the parameters for April 22, 2021, was compared with April 22, 2019, for Coimbatore district as the buses were not operated on this date in 2020 due to the nationwide lockdown. As per the comparison, the single-day revenue in 2019 was Rs. 1.87 crore, which came down to only Rs. 69.24 lakh in 2021. The per-kilometre revenue was Rs. 34.84 on April 22, 2019, but it fell to Rs. 20.60 on April 22, 2021.

24 April 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Project to modernise LBP main canal halted till May 5||Following stiff opposition from farmers to carrying out works to renovate and modernise the Lower Bhavani Project (LBP) main canal at Rs. 709.60 crore, the district administration has halted the commencement of works till May 5. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Coimbatore on February 25 laid the foundation stone for the extension, renovation and modernisation of LBP irrigation system at a total cost of Rs. 933.10 crore. While package I to IV covers LBP main canal, package V covers Kalingarayan Canal and package VI covers Thadappalli and Arakkankottai Canals. The canal helps in irrigating 2.07 lakh acres in the districts of Erode, Tiruppur and Karur. But farmers’ associations were divided over concrete-lining of the main canal. They said that it will affect recharge of groundwater. On Thursday, attempts were made by the Public Works Department and the contractor to begin preliminary works near Chennimalai. But, due to opposition works could not be commenced. Meeting held Erode Revenue Divisional Officer C. Saifudeen chaired a meeting on Thursday in which C. Nallasamy, president, Keel Bhavani Vivasayigal Nala Sangam, Thulasimani, vice-president, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, and representatives of various other associations took part. Farmers said that the LBP project was designed in such a way that its seepage helps in recharging the wells and providing water to the trees. They said that if the project is executed, water carrying capacity would be reduced from the present 2,300 cusecs to 1,800 cusecs affecting the crops. “Due to stiff opposition, the then Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa dropped the project. Let the new State government decide on the project”, they said. Based on the request from farmers, Mr. Saifudeen assured that works will not be carried out until May 5 and added that the issue would be taken up with the new government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/project-to-modernise-lbp-main-canal-halted-till-may-5/article34397644.ece

24 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Do away with discriminatory pricing of vaccine: Madurai MP||Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has questioned the rationale behind “discriminatory” pricing of Covishield vaccine while the Centre has always been talking about “One Nation, one ration card; one election; one tax”. Pointing out the three rates for the vaccine when the whole nation is in the grip of fear about unabated rise of COVID cases, he said that it would be a great blow to leave the poor and middle class people at the mercy of the market. In a letter addressed to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, Mr. Venkatesan pointed out Serum Institute of India announcing its vaccine price as Rs. 150 per dose for Central government, Rs. 400 for State governments and Rs. 600 for private hospitals. “I doubt whether your decision (to have different rates for Centre and States) would be in consonance with constitutionality while our nation is "Union of States", he said. Stating that there will be a steep demand for vaccine after the Centre opened up vaccine for all above 18 years of age, he said it would create a lot of hurdles in supply chain as every State and region would rush to get it. As the State governments are already reeling under severe financial crisis and debt burdens, the new pricing policy will put an additional burden on their back. Mr. Venkatesan cautioned the Centre that private hospitals may flood the market with their resources which would affect the availability of vaccines to ordinary people who depend upon the State-run medical facilities. “We have already experienced loot by certain corporate hospitals by inflicting exorbitant charges on the Covid patients and the same should not be the case with the vaccines too,” the Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP said. He wanted the Centre to foot the whole bill for vaccine by resorting to additional revenue generation by increasing Corporate tax, introduction of inheritance tax, wealth taxes, taxes on super rich suggested by renowned economists. “The poor deserved better care from the government since they are bearing 66% of tax revenues in the form of indirect taxes,” he added. Mr. Venkatesan said that supply of vaccine should be ensured by scaling up production by involving all State-owned medical institutions, including Hindustan Bio tech at Chengalpattu, and BCG Vaccine Lab in Chennai. Besides, exports of vaccine should be regulated as India itself was facing a short supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-away-with-discriminatory-pricing-of-vaccine-madurai-mp/article34398299.ece
24 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Beds fill up fast at private hospitals||The day-to-day rise in fresh coronavirus infection in the district has resulted in beds filling up fast in major private hospitals, and a significant number of patients required oxygen support. Data obtained from the Public Health department shows that at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) – the hospital with the highest number of beds for COVID-19 patients in the district – nearly 56% of the 1,561 beds are filled. In the six COVID-19 Health Centres in the district, nearly 36.20% of the beds are filled. These centres include Tirumangalam, Melur, Vadipatti, Peraiyur and Tirupparankundram Government Hospitals and the Railway Hospital. The data shows that a large proportion of the beds has filled up at major private hospitals as of 8 a.m. on Friday. There are 44 private hospitals treating COVID-19 patients. These hospitals have 1,388 beds for COVID-19 patients. At Apollo Hospital, all the 77 beds earmarked for COVID-19 patients have been occupied. At Meenakshi Mission Hospital, nearly 88% of 154 beds for COVID-19 patients have been occupied. At Vadamalayan Hospital, nearly 90% of the 65 beds for COVID-19 patients have been filled up. Velammal Medical College Hospital, the private hospital with the highest number of beds for COVID-19 patients (200), reports 55% occupancy. Satish Devadoss, Medical Director of Devadoss Hospital, said the requirement of beds for COVID-19 patients had risen this year. They could see that in more number of positive patients, there was lung involvement. “As a result, the need for oxygen support has increased significantly,” Dr. Satish Devadoss said, adding this time, more number of younger patients were admitted to the hospital and they too required oxygen support. J. Adel, General Manager, Operations, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre, said more number of patients from the neighbouring districts also got admitted to hospitals in Madurai. The requirement of oxygen support had increased drastically. “Patients with lung involvement required around 50 to 60 litres of oxygen support for each hour,” he added. V. Karthik, management representative of Vadamalayan Hospital, said since the beds were occupied, the hospital created a waiting list so that those patients could occupy the beds following discharges. A source from the Health department said in a recent meeting presided over by the Collector, it was decided to admit asymptomatic patients from rural areas only to COVID-19 Care Centres. “The department is approving new private hospitals that can treat COVID-19 patients as beds are quickly filling up in the existing hospitals. But, nearly 50% of beds are available at the GRH, which has the best facilities,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/beds-fill-up-fast-at-private-hospitals/article34397615.ece

24 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||MP warns of worsening situation||Cautioning the Madurai district administration of soon facing shortage of beds given the increased rate of positivity of COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has sought conduct of increased number of fever camps and swab testing to 25,000 a day. In a statement, he said that the positivity rate has increased from 6.34% to 7.17%. "If this higher rate of positivity is not controlled immediately, the district will face shortage of beds," he said. He wanted the district administration to increase the number of fever camps from 240 to 400. The camps should focus on areas that are highly-infected with COVID-19. "Similar efforts taken last year by doubling the number of fever camps helped a lot during the first wave of infection," he said. Contending that Madurai was most thickly populated district next to Chennai, he said that if the speed of infection was not contained, the situation will worsen and go beyond control. Though increasing daily dosage of vaccination will be of great help, it was not under the control of the district administration. However, the administration should ensure that the available stock of vaccination was immediately administered to the people without causing any wastage. Mr. Venkatesan also appealed to the people to strictly follow mask rule and to avoid unnecessary crowding. "The next week will be very important and our activities will determine whether we are going to control the situation or worsen it," he said. The Assembly election model code of conduct in force has curtailed the elected representatives from reviewing the situation and interfering in the COVID-19 preventive measures being taken, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-warns-of-worsening-situation/article34398297.ece

24 April 2021||SIVAGANGA,TAMIL NADU||Oxygen position comfortable, says Collector||Oxygen availability in the Government Headquarters Hospital here is adequate and patients need not panic, said Collector P. Madhusudan Reddy here on Friday. The Collector inspected the GH and held discussions with Dean Rathinavel and a team of doctors about the care given to COVID-19 patients, fever clinics being conducted and took stock of the vaccine stock position. Speaking to reporters, he said beds were available for COVID-19 patients in the headquarters hospital and additional beds had been provided at hospitals in Karaikudi, Devakottai, Amaravathipudur and at Tirupattur. Doctors and para medical teams were readily available at the hospitals. If required, COVID Care Centres would also be opened, he said. He said 120 urban and rural locations have been identified as containment zones, while 200 stretches in rural parts of the district were declared as containment area. Wherever, the number of positive patients were more than three, the area was identified as containment. If all the COVID-19 prevention norms were followed, people could come out of the the COVID-19 unscathed, he said. 9,000 vials available The Collector said 9,000 vials of COVID-19 vaccines were available and they were sufficient for the next two days. Another consignment of 12,000 vials would arrive shortly and they would be distributed to the designated vaccine centres. He said Rs. 45.80 lakh had been collected as fine from people for violations of COVID-19 guidelines. During the first wave last year, many frontline workers tested positive. After the launch of the vaccine, they were administered the dose first. Now, in the second wave, many public tested positive but not the frontline workers. So, one could infer that vaccine did work and herd immunity would help tackle the crisis. Till date, of the 7,945 people who tested positive in Sivaganga district, 7,345 had been discharged, Mr. Madhusudan Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/oxygen-position-comfortable-says-sivaganga-collector/article34397632.ece

24 April 2021||Theni,TAMIL NADU||Elephant, calf reunited in Megamalai||An elephant calf was reunited with its mother by forest officials of the Megamalai Wildlife Division on Friday. Earlier in the day, both the calf and the mother were rescued from a well near Arasaradi in the Varushanadu forest range. At about 6 a.m, the forest officials received information from the villagers that an elephant and its calf had fallen into the well. A rescue team was deployed to rescue the mother and the calf. The calf was first pulled out of the well by using a rope. In order to bring the mother elephant out of the well, the protective wall around the well was demolished. The elephant did manage to come out of the well but on seeing the huge crowd that had gathered to witness the rescue operation, it was frightened and ran into the forest. The forest officials, after dispersing the crowd, examined the calf. Based on the advice of the veterinarians, they traced the footprints of the mother elephant and took the calf along with them into the interiors of the forest and reunited the calf with its mother which was in a herd, according to Wildlife Warden Sumesh Soman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elephant-calf-reunited-in-meghamalai/article34397617.ece

24 April 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Residents oppose plan for oxygen production at Sterlite plant in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi||At a hurriedly convened closed-door public hearing in Thoothukudi on April 23, a cross-section of residents opposed any move to allowVedanta’s sealed Sterlite Copper plantto resume operations to produce oxygen to meet the pressing medical need in many parts of the country following the COVID-19 outbreak. Those opposing the revival of operations heckled and chased away some of those who supported Vedanta. The copper smelter unit at the SIPCOT Industrial Complex has remained idle since it was closed in May 2018 after13 anti-Sterlite protesters were killedin police firing. Sterlite Copper chief executive officer Pankaj Kumar had submitted an appeal to the State government, seeking permission to operate its oxygen plant alone at the copper smelter complex to supply 1,050 tonnes of oxygen per day to hospitals, which are facing a shortage of the gas. Thecompany also moved the Supreme Courtwith its offer. On April 22, the Central government supported the company, while Tamil Nadu opposed it. The State government had asked the Thoothukudi administration to conduct a public hearing on the issue and send its report on April 23 to enable it to submit an affidavit before the Supreme Court. The district administration had invited select people — both in favour of and against the move to resume operations for oxygen production — for the public hearing at the Collectorate. As people protested against restricting the number of invitees, eventually about 50 were allowed to attend the public hearing chaired by Collector K. Senthil Raj. Journalists were asked to leave within minutes of the commencement of the hearing that ended within 30 minutes. The Collector did not brief journalists as he rushed to prepare the report to be sent to the State government. Heated arguments It is learnt that there were heated arguments between two groups of participants at the public hearing. The Collector and Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar pacified them. A majority of the participants opposed Sterlite’s plea for resumption of operations. They told journalists that there was no dearth of medical oxygen in Tamil Nadu, and that the plant must remain closed. They feared that allowing operations could eventually lead to full-scale resumption of activities at Sterlite Copper in the future. Earlier, outside the Collectorate, those opposing the company verbally abused a group of supporters of the copper smelter unit. Some of them chased the plant’s supporters away, hurling stones at them. However, no one was injured. After the meeting, when a woman supporter of the plant was taking her two-wheeler out of the parking lot, two women associated with the protest group abused her and one of them slapped her. A few men also abused her as she left hurriedly. Stones were hurled at the vehicles of those in favour of Sterlite.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-oppose-plan-for-oxygen-production-at-sterlite-plant-in-tamil-nadus-thoothukudi/article34397610.ece
24 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Migrant labourers return to their States||Good occupancy was witnessed in the Tiruchi - Howrah special train which left from here on Friday. Many north Indian labourers headed back to their native State amid spike in COVID-19 cases in Tiruchi and elsewhere in the State and in the wake of the restrictions imposed to check the spread of the virus. No overcrowding Railway officials said there was no overcrowding at the Tiruchi Junction for this bi-weekly inter-State special as the occupancy was well within the capacity of the train which passes via three states before reaching Howrah. All passengers who had boarded from Tiruchi Junction had booked their tickets in advance as only reserved passengers were being allowed to travel. It was ensured at Tiruchi Junction that departing passengers wore masks and their temperature monitored by automatic thermal cameras installed at the station. The officials said the Tiruchi - Howrah special always had good occupancy being a inter-state train as many labourers from the north and north-eastern states prefer this train to reach different districts in the State and head back home during the pandemic. They said they were keeping a watch on overcrowding if any in stations in Tiruchi Division in view of the spike in COVID-19 cases. Unlike last year when the Southern Railway operated several Shramik Special trains from Tiruchi Division and from other railway divisions to enable migrant labourers working in different parts of Tamil Nadu to reach their respective native state after viral infection began to spread, the request for operating such special trains to exclusively to take back migrant labourers was yet to come from the State authorities till now, said the officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/migrant-labourers-return-to-their-states/article34397588.ece
24 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Light and sound show on Teppakulam soon||The corporation has begun work on introducing a light and sound show on the Teppakulam of Rockfort Thayumanaswamy Temple. The tender for the project was floated nearly a year ago at an estimated cost of Rs. 8.8 crores under the Smart Cities Mission project. The project is being implemented under the Design, Build, Operate and Transfer (DBOT) basis which means that operation and maintenance of the show for three years is included in the project estimate. A Pune-based company acquired the tender and has begun the work. The show is an attempt to improve tourist footfall and celebrate the history and culture of Tiruchi, a senior official of the Tiruchi Corporation said. The show would be projected on a four-dimensional screen floating on the water, customized by the contractor, especially for the Teppakulam. Pre-recorded videos would be screened at fixed timings about the historical importance of the Rockfort, the various rulers who ruled the lands, and other places of historical importance in Tiruchi. ‘The plan is based on Brindavan Gardens, Mysore light and sound show with dancing fountains and music, but we have taken it one step further,’ a representative of the contractor said. Along with the video projections, underground pipelines will be laid for a fountain show along with colourful lights and music. ‘The projections would be made from a custom-projector which would be floating in the water. A gallery will be arranged at the steps of the Teppakulam, from where tourists can witness the show,’ he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/light-and-sound-show-on-teppakulam-soon/article34397579.ece
24 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Private primary schools find themselves in a fix||The over 200 nursery and primary schools in the district that had to helplessly watch a chunk of students shifting to panchayat union schools due to the lockdown have their fingers crossed against the backdrop of strong indications that the 2021-22 session may not begin with in-person classes. While matriculation schools could manage to survive by paying less salaries to teachers citing the low collection of fee, the private nursery and primary schools where parents in rural parts used to send their children for English-medium education find themselves stranded. The slowdown in economy had caused parents in rural parts who were mostly farm labourers and construction workers to shift their wards from nursery schools to panchayat union primary schools due to their inability to pay the fee, a Block Education Officer (BEO) said. Barring the students admitted under Right to Education Act, other students in the nursery and primary schools are not entitled to freebies of the government. “As per records, the schools are functional, but most of the schools have not been able to have any interface with the students for an entire year,” the BEO said. According to a senior official in the School Education Department, there was no cause for serious concern among the parents since their wards will be promoted to the next level in any case due to the policy of the government to assign 'all-pass' results to all students till VIII standard. As per official records, there are as many as 226 nursery and primary schools with classes from LKG to V standard in the district spread over Anthanallur, Mannachanallur, Musiri, Marungapuri, Lalgudi, Manapparai, Thottiyam, Vaiyampatti, Uppiliapuram, Tiruchi West, Tiruchi Urban, Tiruverumbur, Thuraiyur, Thathaiyengarpettai, Pullambadi, and Manikandam blocks. Not many nursery and primary schools pay decent salaries to teachers, and the instances of these schools having well-qualified and experienced teachers are rare. “Even matriculation schools pay teachers salaries only in the range of 50 percent citing low fee collection. This being the case, the teachers of nursery schools have been pushed into a situation of suffering in silence for another year,” a functionary of a teacher' association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-primary-schools-find-themselves-in-a-fix/article34397583.ece
24 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Inefficient garbage collection mechanism fuels burning of waste on streets||Indiscriminate burning of waste on streets has raised health concern among the residents of Karumandapam and Dheeran Nagar in the city. Thanks to rapid urbanisation in recent years, a number of residential colonies have sprung up on both sides of Karumandapam from National College to Dheeran Nagar. Karumandapam has become one of the major residential localities in the city with hundreds of houses in Sakthi Nagar, Jaya Nagar, R.M.S. Colony, Kalyanasundaram Nagar and Thiru Nagar. Similarly, a large number of commercial establishments including restaurants, roadside eateries, grocery shops and meat stalls have also come up in the recent past. Though the workers employed by Tiruchi Corporation visit various residential colonies in Karumandapam for door-to-door waste collection, there are complaints that collection of waste is not regular and garbage collectors refuse to collect non-recyclable discards, dried up leaves and broken branches of trees. Due to inefficient garbage collection mechanism and absence of garbage bins on streets, residents dump waste on roads, vacant plots and abandoned buildings. The traders too clandestinely dump waste on roads at their will. A section of them invariably dumps waste generated from their shops on the bunds of the Koraiyaru river. It is alleged that meat traders have literally converted the bunds of the Koraiyaur river into a dump yard. What is worrying the residents is the burning of waste on the bunds. Unthinking of the pollution, it is alleged that some traders set fire to the garbage such as plastic bottles, plastic carry bags, chicken waste and food waste at night. Local residents say that it has become a perennial practice. “The bunds of the Koraiyarur river have become a convenient location for indiscriminate dumping of waste and burning the same. We undergo testing time due to air pollution caused by the burning of waste,”says G. Jayakumar, a resident of Sagkthi Nagar. E. Mohammed Ali, a resident of Thiru Nagar, said the question of burning of waste would not arise if garbage collection mechanism was effective. “If garbage piles up for three to four days without being collected by sanitary workers, the residents have no other way but to dump the waste on the streets. The Corporation should take serious note of the issue so as to improve the system,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/inefficient-garbage-collection-mechanism-fuels-burning-of-waste-on-streets/article34398459.ece
24 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Central region records over 1,000 cases||The central region reported 1,216 fresh cases of COVID-19 on Friday. Six of the eight districts in the region reported more than 100 fresh cases, while two districts - Thanjavur and Tiruchi - reported over 300 fresh cases each. Three deaths were reported in the region - two in Thanjavur and one in Tiruchi. Two men aged 38 and 55, both hailing from Thanjavur with no pre-existing ailments, succumbed to the viral infection. An 81-year-old woman with a history of diabetes also died of COVID-19 in Tiruchi. Thanjavur district reported double the number of cases than on the previous days with 333 fresh cases. Tiruchi came a close second with 320 fresh cases. Tiruchi Collector S. Divyadharshini convened a meeting with staff and management of private nursing colleges and sought their participation in joining hands to combat the second wave of COVID-19. She asked willing institutes to permit 30 final-year nursing students to be deputed on COVID duty at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital on eight-hour shifts on rotation basis. She also convened a meeting with district and block-level health officials. Six COVID Care Centres have been readied across the district. Along with the Bharathidasan University, Khajamalai Campus, with 150 beds and the Government Engineering College Sethurapatti with 600 beds, Nehru Memorial College in Thuraiyur with 150 beds, SRM Medical College Hospital with 160 beds, Bishop Heber College with 500 beds, Kurinji College of Engineering and Technology in Manapparai with 150 beds have been readied. Health officials have been instructed to ensure hot water facilities, and clean and disinfect the rooms including replacing bedsheets and other materials once a patient is discharged. Nutritious food and daily yoga camps have been arranged. Nagapattinam reported 170 fresh cases while Tiruvarur reported 128, Karur 105, and Pudukottai 104.

24 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Need to expedite road over bridge repair||With the road over bridge (ROB) on Salai Road remaining closed for traffic to facilitate repair on its approach road, a portion of which caved in during heavy rain in July last year, motorists in the city are hoping for the expeditious completion of the work. The closure of the bridge has resulted in heavy traffic congestion on arterial roads in the vicinity including Karur By-pass Road, Madurai Road, West Boulevard Road and the Thennur road over bridge. After a portion of the approach road to the ROB caved in, the civic body reinforced the damaged portion with sand bags and barred heavy vehicle traffic on the ROB. The bridge was closed for light vehicles since last month and over the past few days two wheelers are not allowed. Motorists complain that they have to take a detour. “It used to take just less than five minutes to reach Thillai Nagar from Mainguard Gate. Now it takes more than 15 to 20 minutes as one has to go around the Chathram Bus Stand/Karur Bypass Road or Madurai Road/Thennur High Road. Given the searing summer heat and the heavy congestion on West Boulevard Road, Madurai Road, Karur Bypass Road and Thennur ROB, it is horrendous ride,” says Gopal, a regular commuter. Though the corporation initially prepared an estimate to build a new bridge replacing the old ROB, it was subsequently asked to leave the work to the Highways Department. A senior official of the civic body said that the bridge has since been handed over to the Highways Department, which in turn is said to have forwarded a proposal for construction of a bridge for approval. However, since it would take over a year for the department to prepare the detailed project report and get the necessary clearances, the corporation has decided to carry out temporary repair work at a cost of nearly Rs. 3 crore from the Smart City Mission funds. The work was supposed to be completed in about a month. But not many are happy with the corporation decision to spend a huge sum on repairing a weak bridge. “Ideally, a new and wider bridge should be built on the road to replace the more than a century old narrow ROB. But now that the temporary work has been taken up it should be completed expeditiously,” observed M.Sekaran, a consumer activist and member of the District Road Safety Council.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/need-to-expedite-road-over-bridge-repair/article34397593.ece
24 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Success rate in GATE dismal in central region||Though thousands of students from Tiruchi-Thanjavur region appear for the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) every year, the success rate has been rather low and the trend has been static, according to trainers. The trend, they say, has got much to do with the students’ primary focus on scoring high marks in the university examinations rather than having a strong grasp of the concepts. Students from affiliated colleges of Anna University do attempt the exam, but without adequate preparation. Unlike in Chennai and Coimbatore regions, the level of awareness among students about GATE - that the exam primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of various undergraduate subjects in engineering and science for admission into the Masters Programme and landing jobs in Public Sector Companies - is still low, S. Sivakumar, Director of Gate Forum - Tiruchi, and Chief Executive Officer of Trichy Plus, said. The score is valid for three years, but Public Sector Undertakings consider the marks obtained in the particular year. The PSUs that recruit engineers based on the GATE score include Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Gas Authority of India Limited, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Indian Oil Corporation Limited, National Thermal Power Corporation, Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Power Grid Corporation of India Without going through the rigour of a drawn-out training encompassing test series, the possibility for scoring well in GATE is bleak, Mr. Sivakumar said. Students joining post-graduate programmes in IITs and NITs based on GATE score are entitled to stipend of the Union Ministry of Education and other government agencies. Till the pandemic lockdown took effect, students at the University College of Engineering Bharathidasan Institute of Technology Campus, Anna University, Tiruchi, used to receive orientation on GATE exam every weekend, T. Senthilkumar. Professor and Dean, said, acknowledging that only less number of students aspire to write the exam of their own volition. Increasing awareness on GATE has been a felt need. The Institution of Engineers (India) Tiruchi Local Centre, was looking forward to organising awareness programmes on the exam, its Chairman N. Kumaresan said.  Students focus more on scoring high marks in the examinations than getting a strong grasp of the concepts.

24 April 2021||Tirunelvel,TAMIL NADU||Murdered temple priest’s body handed over to relatives||Relatives of murdered Sudalai Maadasamy Temple priest Chidambaram of Seevalaperi near here accepted the body after the district administration agreed to recommend to the State Government compensation and government job to the family of the deceased. Moreover, it has been decided to survey the land belonging to Sudalai Maadasamy Temple to protect it from being encroached upon and to set-up a police outpost near the shrine to prevent any unlawful incident in future. Tension prevailed in Seevalaperi and its surroundings after Chidambaram, who belongs to the Yadhava community, was murdered last Sunday by an armed gang belonging to a different community following long-standing disputes over setting up shops around the temple during festivals and enjoying the revenue. Though the Yadhava community people, especially the youth, had planned to take out a rally from Azhagumuthu Kone statue in Palayamkottai to the Collectorate, the police persuaded them to give-up the plan. Instead, their community leaders from major political parties participated in the talks held with Collector V. Vishnu. Compensation sought Besides giving employment to the wife of the murdered priest, the State Government should give compensation of Rs. 20 lakh to the bereaved family, consisting of two girl children studying in class 9 and 7, they said. Mr. Vishnu also said a police outpost with a head-constable and four constables would be established at the shrine so as to prevent any untoward incident in future. Eleven persons have been arrested so far while S. Lakshmanan, 48, from Seevalaperi had surrendered before a court in Nanguneri on Friday. The Collector has also recommended to the State Government for giving compensation from the Chief Minister’s General Relief Fund to the family of the priest and employment to his wife. Accepting it, the relatives of Chidambaram received the body at 3.45 p.m. Stone throwing Even as the body was being taken to Seevalaperi for funeral, miscreants hurled stone on a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus in which the windscreen of the bus was damaged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/priests-body-handed-over-to-relatives/article34397626.ece
24 April 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Register case against prison authorities: kin of murdered youth||Relatives and members of various Dalit outfits blocked the road in front of Palayamkottai Central Prison on Friday protesting the killing of a remand prisoner on the jail premises on Thursday by a few inmates and demanding registration of a murder case against prison authorities for failing to save him. When P. Muthu Mano of Vagaikulam near Moontradaippu in the district, who was arrested on April 8 along with three of his associates for an attempt to murder two brothers from another community near Kalakkad, was brought to Palayamkottai Central Prison along with his accomplices from Srivaikundam sub-jail, he was attacked by a group of inmates. As Muthu Mano sustained grievous head injury, he was rushed to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, where he died. Perumalpuram police registered a case against Jacob, Ramamurthy and Maharajan of Thazhaiyoothu, Madasamy and Kumar of Pallikottai and Kannan and Arunkumar of Velloor near Srivaikundam for allegedly murdering Muthu Mano, against whom a few cases are pending. Judicial Magistrate I. Babu visited Palayamkottai Central Prison for an investigation. Demanding registration of murder case against the prison authorities, relatives of the deceased and members of various Dalit outfits staged a demonstration in front of the prison. They also demanded Rs. 1 crore compensation to the victim’s family. Even though Tirunelveli Superintendent of Police N. Manivanan, Tenkasi SP Suguna Singh and Tirunelveli Sub-Collector Siva Krishnamurthy held talks with the agitators, they insisted on the Collector’s presence. Collector V. Vishnu came to the spot in the afternoon. The protesters said the State should give employment to a family member of the deceased. They also demanded that post-mortem of the body be conducted in the presence of an advocate who was nominated by the affected family and a family member. They further demanded a special probe to investigate murders with caste overtones that had taken place in the past eight years. Mr. Vishnu, while agreeing to recommend to the government for job and compensation, said registration of case against prison officials would be possible only after the probe by the Judicial Magistrate was over. The protest was withdrawn in the evening. However, they did not receive the body, saying they would form a coordination committee to decide on the future course of action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/file-case-against-prison-authorities-kin-of-murdered-youth/article34397618.ece

With the entry of tourists banned since Tuesday, most shops operating at popular tourist locations across the Nilgiris have been closed down. In the Ooty Lake and Boat House, where around 30 shops operate every day, only three remained open on Friday. One of the shopkeepers, Masoom Rahmani, who has been selling soft drinks and snacks for the last 10 years, said that he had had no business at the shop for the last three days. “I have kept my store opened only out of habit. Usually, on a good day, I can make somewhere between Rs. 500-600. But due to the restrictions, there is no business for most shopkeepers who depend on the tourism sector,” he said. Despite the hardships that they are facing, many of the shopkeepers are actually in full support of the district administration and the government’s decision to close the district to tourists. H. Basheer Ahmed, a member of the roadside vendors’ association, said that he was relieved that the restrictions were brought in. “After witnessing the impact of COVID-19 on television in other parts of the country, it is indeed a relief that such strict restrictions have been brought it. While other bigger businesses and hotels have opposed them, we street hawkers and roadside vendors are fully in support of the government and its decision,” he said, adding that the street vendors would submit a petition to the Collector in the coming days asking for financial support. “We hope the collector will help us through these difficult times,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/roadside-vendors-in-the-nilgiris-support-restrictions-but-seek-financial-aid/article34398192.ece

24 April 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Transfer of woman on maternity leave, in violation of G.O. flayed||Tamil Nadu Government Employees’ Association has taken strong exception to the officials of Labour Department here transferring a woman employee who has gone on maternity leave in violation of a Government Order pertaining to maternity leave. The association president, S. Tamil Selvi, led a protest here on Friday flaying the attitude of officials of Labour Department for putting the woman employee on maternity leave to untold mental agony. The steno-typist, A. Premavathi, working in the office of Assistant Commissioner of Labour in Virudhunagar had gone on maternity leave in February. “Within a few days, the woman was transferred and another employee from Chennai posted here. Consequently, her maternity leave salary for the month of March was denied,” said C.E. Kannan of the association. Ms. Tamil Selvi said that while the G.O. of 1990 stipulated that a woman going on maternity leave should be retained in the same post till she rejoined duty, the very Labour Department that needed to implement the welfare of employees itself was violating the Government order. The association had taken up the issue with Virudhunagar Collector and Commissioner of Labour. However, only after the issue was taken with State Commission for Women, the Department on Friday issued an order to make the payment to Ms. Premavathi. Similar incidents are coming up in other departments too. When the process of salary bill was made manually, salary for two persons in the same post could be given by considering one post as on deputation. “But, under the Integrated Financial and Human Resources Management System (IFHRMS), it is not possible. The women employees are made to suffer,” she said. “While the government has increased the number of days of maternity leave from 90 days to nine months, the officials are denying the benefit to the workers,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transfer-of-woman-on-maternity-leave-in-violation-of-go-flayed/article34397629.ece

24 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Local grain in PDS: Ragi in, jowar to wait||The State has started providing ragi to poor families under the Public Distribution System (PDS) after cutting the quantum of rice. This is according to the assurance of Umesh Katti, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, that local foodgrains would be supplied to BPL ration card-holders, rather than the staple of rice and wheat. Now, the 13 districts of Old Mysore region are getting 3 kg of ragi and 2 kg of rice instead of the 5 kg of rice given per unit earlier. Mr. Katti had announced in the Legislative Assembly that the State government would distribute locally favoured foodgrains other than rice and wheat from April 1. The distribution of ragi has started, but jowar is yet to be included in the scheme. The department has procured around five lakh tonnes of ragi, but has been able tobuy only around 50,000 tonnes of jowar. “With this procurement, we can distribute ragi to 13 districts for 10 months. But the jowar collected can last only one month. That is why we are yet to start distributing jowar,” Mr. Katti told The Hindu . “Our motto is to give people the grains that they normally eat. We have changed the eating habits of almost the whole State because of the distribution of rice and wheat, which are not the staple of either north or south Karnataka. The 13 districts of the north eat jowar and the southern districts eat ragi. Residents of the remaining four districts eat parboiled rice or red rice. We want to introduce local grains for all the regions, slowly,” he said. “I’ve written to the Centre to increase the cost of procurement of jowar and fix separate prices for the Mal Dandi native variety, hybrid variety, and Kaniki or split grain. I have met the Union Food Minister and V.P. Sharma, chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and explained the problem. He has agreed to consider our demand,” the Minister said. “We have asked the Centre to divert some of the jowar collected from Maharashtra.” Officials said the primary issue was pricing. “Foodgrains are procured with the funds pooled by the Centre and the State. The Centre contributes around 90% of the cost and the States pay around 10%. We have little say in the procurement. When the Centre allows us to buy local foodgrains using Central funds, we are supposed to distribute it within the State. There is a big difference between the prices that we offer through the Food Corporation of India and the market prices. While jowar growers sell for between Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 5,000 per quintal, we offer only Rs. 2,600 to Rs. 3,200. Jowar growers will sell only if we pay attractive prices. Otherwise, it will remain an empty promise,” said a senior official. The official said the Centre gives around 28 lakh tonnes of rice every year. “That is more than we can consume. We only need around 18 lakh tonnes. If the Centre can reduce this quantity and instead allow us to buy jowar, red rice, and parboiled rice for the rest of the amount, we would be very happy. This request has been communicated to the Food Ministry.” Opposition The decision has not gone down well with all, especially in districts such as Shivamogga where rice rather than ragi is the staple. The government’s decision to replace rice with ragi has been opposed by many ration-card holders in the district. Nagaraj, of Salukodu in Sagar taluk, said rice was a common food in his family. “Already, the government has reduced the quantity of rice from 7 kg to 5 kg. A further decrease in quantity will affect us. We don’t want ragi. The government should continue with rice and increase the quantity,” he said. His family of four used to get 20 kg of rice a month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/local-grain-in-pds-ragi-in-jowar-to-wait/article34397808.ece

24 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP eyes private medical colleges||The ferocious spread of COVID-19 in Bengaluru – 16,662 new cases and 124 deaths on Friday alone –has civic officials on edge. With the day-on-day rise in the number of reported cases straining the limits of the existing medical infrastructure, the BBMP has proposed to the Karnataka government to take over the 12 private medical colleges in the city and convert them into dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. A senior health official told The Hindu that the increase in caseload was more than anticipated. “The numbers are beyond what even the expert committee predicted. We have around 8,000 beds and are working towards increasing the number to 11,000. However, given the rate of spread, we may need more beds,” the official said. It is in the backdrop of this desperate and volatile situation that senior health officials have proposed to take over the 12 private medical colleges. “This way, we will have at least 12,000 beds available. We can synchronise all our resources, improve triaging and have better coordination,” said another official.. He added that this had been discussed during many review meetings with the Karnataka government. However, the government is yet to make a decision. 1,055 beds vacant The BBMP has established 10 COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs) with two more likely to be set up by the weekend. With this, a total of 1,601 beds have been added to the Central Hospital Bed Management System. In a statement, the BBMP said of the total 1,601 beds in the 10 CCCs, 546 are occupied. Once the two other facilities are established at Government Arts College and Sai Kalyan Mantap in East zone, an additional 350 beds will be available. The government has also approved setting up of step-down hospitals by private medical facilities and hotels, and has fixed a ceiling on tariff depending on the category of hotel. According to an order issued on Thursday, the per day ceiling for such a facility in budget hotels is Rs. 8,000, Rs. 10,000 in three star hotels, and Rs. 12,000 in a five star.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-eyes-private-medical-colleges/article34398149.ece
24 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Positivity rate hits 6-month high||As Karnataka continues to post new records in COVID-19 positive cases in the second wave of the pandemic, Bengaluru has been reporting staggering numbers. The positivity rate in April hit a six-month high of 9.78% on Thursday. According to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s war room bulletin, the 9.78% positivity rate is against 16.48 lakh tests up to April 22. In March, the positivity rate was 2.31% against 13.78 lakh tests. When the number of cases had tapered off in January and February, it was below 1%. The number of tests too, though, were lower in those two months. The last time the positivity rate was higher than it is now was in September 2020 at 12.21% against 8.52 lakh tests. This, however, was far lower than the peak pandemic period in July when it was a whopping 23.84% against 2.19 lakh tests. Bengaluru’s case fatality rate was 0.51% on Thursday, which is not a huge jump compared to last month’s 0.46%. But the number of deaths so far in April is far higher – 820 compared to 147 in March, 88 in February and 66 in January. In July 2020, the number of deaths was 962 when the total number of cases was 52,406. In comparison, the number of cases in April is over 1.32 lakh – the highest for a month so far, with many days left. So far, Bengaluru has seen over 59 lakh positive cases and 5,450 deaths (as on April 22) since the pandemic struck. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 Task Force, said the ongoing wave is 10 times worse than the July peak. “The virus has gone deep into the community as the decline in cases since November saw a lot of movement of people and a go-by being given for COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Young people in the age group of 20 to 35 had a casual approach, and there’s also a a complacency factor. A lot of marriages, village festivals, protests took place. In addition, a lot of people from Bengaluru are travelling to and fro daily to neighbouring places,” he said, explaining the reasons for the spike. But the present set of restrictions will help limit further spread, he added. “It is virtually a lockdown. Once people’s movement comes down, further spread will be limited, and will give breathing time for the healthcare system to recover. The system was dealing with big numbers in a short period,” Dr. Manjunath said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/positivity-rate-hits-6-month-high/article34398162.ece
24 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ex-CM writes to Cong. legislators asking them to help the needy||Terming the deaths owing to COVID-19 “murders due to political irresponsibility” by the ruling BJP, the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday urged Congress legislators to be with the people in this time of crisis to ensure hospital beds, ambulance services, medicines, and availability of oxygen for the common man in their constituencies. In a letter to the legislators, he appealed to them to ensure supply of food to the needy, on the lines of the efforts made during the lockdown last year. He alleged that both the Centre and State, ruled by the BJP, had ignored the warnings of experts who predicted a second wave of COVID-19 in the months of February and March. “BJP leaders thrashed these suggestions and by November they started claiming that the battle against COVID -19 was over. Testing was reduced and test results delayed,” he said. He said the situation has become so distressing now that even the last rites of victims cannot be done honourably and livelihoods of small businessmen were being snatched away without warning because of the imposition of curfew. Despite the crisis, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the government has reduced PDS rice distribution to BPL families by 2 kg and increased the cost of fertilisers. Meanwhile, criticising the government for imposing a lockdown-like curfew with the closure of non-essentialbusinesses, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar on Friday told presspersons that the curfew was condemnable. “The government has failed, but we are cooperating with it by being humane. Despite our promise to cooperate, forcible closure is not acceptable. The government has to work. We will fight the government politically,” he said. He added that the supply of oxygen had not stabilised and medicines were still be sold in the black market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ex-cm-writes-to-cong-legislators-asking-them-to-help-the-needy/article34397815.ece
24 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Private hospitals to come out with portal on real-time bed availability||After rejecting Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar’s statement directing private hospitals to increase their COVID-19 bed allocation for government referred patients from 50% to 80%, the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) on Friday announced that it will come out with a portal on real-time bed availability. Currently, the government’s Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST) portal shows availability of government quota beds (both in government and private hospitals). Patients, who are unable to get beds through the SAST portal and those being asked to shift from a particular hospital due to shortage of oxygen, are scrambling for private beds. In the absence of information regarding availability, patients are losing precious time while visiting multiple hospitals in search of a bed. “We are coming out with a portal where patients can search for bed availability (non-SAST beds). This is an initiative by PHANA in association with an NGO to avoid hassles and inconvenience to patients who are looking for beds in private facilities,” PHANA president H.M. Prasanna told The Hindu on Friday. “We are ready with the portal and a backend team is working on networking all the 600 private hospitals registered under the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments (KPME) Act. I have written to the hospitals that they have to mandatorily update every private admission and discharge on the portal. Training sessions for the reception staff of all hospitals will be done,” he said. Dr. Prasanna has appealed to the Health Minister to issue a direction in this regard to all private hospitals. “All private hospitals, except speciality facilities such as ophthalmology, maternity and cancer, will be involved. Through this, we will be able to mobilise around 6,000 beds of which 10% will be ICU and high dependency unit (HDU) beds for private patients,” he explained. “Through the same initiative, a helpline for facilitating Remdesivir, oxygen and any such need will also be set up. We are waiting to meet the Health Minister before launching this,” Dr. Prasanna said. Appealing to member hospitals to strictly follow all government circulars and keep treatment charges reasonable, he said, “Do not overcharge and strictly adhere to the tariff stipulated by the government. Maintain transparency in bed distribution. The data entry from hospitals is very minimal – only admission and discharge should be recorded.” In a letter to member hospitals, the PHANA president said: “Those of the hospitals who have been unable to release beds for government referred patients till date due to non-COVID-19 related care, should at the earliest take all necessary measures to comply with COVID-19 bed allocation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/private-hospitals-to-come-out-with-portal-on-real-time-bed-availability/article34398153.ece
24 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Open temporary cremation grounds, says Kumaraswamy||Slamming the Karnataka government for not ensuring proper arrangements for conducting last rites of those who died due to COVID-19, the former Chief Minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy, has suggested opening temporary cremation grounds. “It is really height of inhuman behaviour by the government which has failed to ensure proper arrangements for conducting the last rites of patients who died due to non-availability of proper medical care. I urge the government to take measures on a warfooting to conduct the last rites of at least 25 bodies on a daily basis in each segment [of the total eight] of the deemed forest surrounding Bengaluru in all its eight directions,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said on Twitter. Request of former CM The former Chief Minister, who is recuperating in a hospital here after testing positive for COVID-19, said: “Bengaluru is surrounded in all eight directions by forest land that lacks any tree cover. The government should make arrangements here on a daily basis to conduct last rites of those succumbing to the pandemic.

I beg the government with folded hands and pain in my heart to at least make arrangements now to conduct the last rites of victims in a dignified manner.” Further, he said: “The government which utterly failed in providing proper medical facilities to the COVID infected persons should not delay the process of arranging for proper place to conduct their last rites. Otherwise, have no doubts that people will curse the government. It is really heart wrenching to see the hardships being faced by the kin of COVID infected persons.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/open-temporary-cremation-grounds-says-kumaraswamy/article34398171.ece
24 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Hailstones, heavy rain in city||For the second consecutive day, rain lashed parts of the city on Friday, bringing huge relief from the sweltering summer heat. What surprised residents in some parts of the city was the accompanying hail. Shanmugam, who works in Bommasandra Industrial Area, said in his 10 years of working there, he had never seen hailstones. “It started raining at 5 p.m. and we were surprised to see hailstones,” he said. India Meteorological Department, Bengaluru’s C.S. Patil said hail was reported in Vishweshwariah Layout as well. “These can be categorised as pre-monsoon rain. Hailstones are not uncommon during the pre-monsoon and the monsoon showers. A trough formation in interior Karnataka is leading to the rainfall,” he explained. Rain is expected to continue for four more days at least. Yellow alert — heavy rainfall and thunderstorm — has been issued for Saturday for many parts of south-interior Karnataka, including Bengaluru Urban and Rural, Hassan, Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru, Kolar, Shivamogga, Mysuru, and Mandya. “Parts of the State will continue to receive rains for four more days, especially parts of south-interior Karnataka,” Mr. Patil added. Power cuts Friday’s rain, accompanied by strong winds, also meant that some areas suffered power cuts, a major problem for those working from home. “A bit of rain in Bangalore and there’s Power cut! Sigh,” said one Bengalurean, venting his ire on Twitter. Another wrote: “...It’s so funny that #Bengaluru sky goes a little dark and @NammaBESCOM immediately be like- let’s cut the power...”. A resident of Indiranagar said, “The pathetic power situation in Indiranagar II stage. No power from 6 pm today and Bescom does not respond to power complaints. With 1912 going to COVID helpline, it is always engaged”. Others people equated the overcast skies and blinding sheets of rain to the mood in a city reeling under COVID-19 on social media. “Exactly the moods and feelings these days,” said one Twitter user. Friday’s rain caused traffic jams on Bellary Road. Due to slow moving traffic near Cauvery Theatre, Mekhri Circle, and other areas, ambulances drivers had a tough time negotiating the traffic. Manholes at several roads were seen overflowing thereby causing inconvenience to motorists near Majestic area. Two-wheeler riders were seen under the flyover or underpass waiting for the rain to subside.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hailstones-heavy-rain-in-city/article34398169.ece

24 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC notice on plea for priority vaccination for disabled||The High Court of Karnataka on Friday directed the State government to respond to a PIL seeking a special drive to administer COVID-19 vaccine to all persons with benchmark disabilities and their caregivers in every district from May 1. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, passed the order on the petition by the Karnataka Rajya Vikalachethanara Rakshana Samiti, Bengaluru. Pointing out that there is no mention of priority to be given for persons with disabilities in the third stage of vaccination beginning from May 1, the petitioner has said that Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 gives right of priority in attendance and treatment for persons with disabilities in the State’s healthcare facilities. “Persons with disabilities and their caregivers require vaccination at a priority level as they may be unable to follow social distancing, wearing of masks, or avoid contact due to their disabilities,” it was pointed out. The only way to ensure that persons with disabilities are saved from COVID-19 is to ensure that they are vaccinated along with their caregivers based on their ID cards or certificates of disability, the petitioner stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-on-plea-for-priority-vaccination-for-disabled/article34398164.ece
24 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Release Rs. 5 crore for treating children with LSD: Court||The High Court of Karnataka on Friday directed the Central and the State governments to jointly release Rs. 5 crore to the Indira Gandhi Institute for Child Health, Bengaluru for meeting the expenses towards the treatment of 45 children suffering from Lysosomal Storage Disorder (LSD), a rare disease, for a period up to August 31, 2021. While directing the governments to release Rs. 3 crore and Rs. 2 crore respectively, the court directed both the governments to release 50% of this sum by May 10 as the IGICH, at present, has only Rs. 2.5 crore as against the requirement of around Rs. 6 crore till July 31, 2021. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, issued the directions while hearing petitions by the LSD Society of India, New Delhi, through which the court is monitoring free treatment provided to children suffering from the rare disease. The Bench also said that the Centre can adjust the amount if any fund is given to the IGICH from the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds through the Ministry of Corporate Affairs as per the proposal. The court in February 2020 refused to accept that contention of the Centre that “health” being a State subject, it is the obligation only of the State government to ensure the fundamental right of children to treatment. However, the court had directed the State to release money to the IGICH and later seek some portion from the Centre, which did not release any fund to State in the guise of framing a policy for rare diseases. The court, from the National Policy on Rare Diseases-2021 announced on April 1, 2021, found that no fund is being provided for treating patients suffering from LSD, and hence found it necessary to issue the direction, as was directed by the High Courts of Madras, Delhi, and Kerala a few years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/release-rs-5-crore-for-treating-children-with-lsd-court/article34398163.ece
24 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||High Court declines to interfere with polls||The High Court of Karnataka on Friday declined to interfere with the decision of the State Election Commission (SEC) to hold elections to several local bodies on April 27 across the State. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj said it was for the SEC to take a decision on whether there was any need to postponement of elections in view of the COVID-19 second wave. The Bench passed the order while declining a plea by Prithvi Chintapalli Reddy, State convener of the AAP. The petitioner said the conduct of elections to several local bodies, including Ballari City Corporation, as per the schedule, would result in further spread of COVID-19. However, the Bench pointed out that elections to several State Assemblies and bypolls in Karnataka were held recently. It also noted that apart from the polling, all other processes for conducting the elections were completed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-court-declines-to-interfere-with-polls/article34397809.ece

24 April 2021||Bengaluru/ Hubballi,KARNATAKA||People from Bengaluru scouting for beds in other cities||Reeling under severe shortage of ICU beds, oxygen beds and ventilators, families of COVID-19 positive patients from Bengaluru are travelling to ensure their kin get proper medical care in the time of acute distress. Residents are now occupying a good chunk of these beds in faraway places like Hubballi and Mysuru where the situation is still under control. What has caused anxiety in the Health Department is a possible acute shortage of facilities in these Tier 2 cities that are also progressively reporting increasing number of COVID-19 patients. For example, Mysuru has a high COVID-19 positive ratio in respect to the population. If the beds are occupied by outsiders and a need arises for the local patients, the crisis may blow out of proportion, Health Department sources said. When Health Minister K. Sudhakar visited Mysuru on Thursday, it was informed that nearly 10% of the ICU beds were taken by people from Bengaluru. “This is a huge number. People with connections and money are travelling far for beds. Mysuru has a case fatality rate of 4%, whereas the CFR for State is 0.7%. Since no law prevents residents of Bengaluru from getting admitted elsewhere, nothing can be done,” sources said. One of the reasons for the high CFR rate in Mysuru is late arrival of patients in the hospital, sources said. Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Hubballi, the premier medical institution and hospital in North Karnataka, has been receiving more patients from other cities, including Bengaluru. KIMS Director Ramalingappa Antaratani confirmed the development and said that the hospital had been treating patients from outstations particularly those with friends and relatives in and around Hubballi-Dharwad. “In fact, during the first wave nearly 35% to 40% of the patients were outsiders. Of late we have been receiving patients from Bengaluru. Most of these are originally from here. We know they are not localities, but it is our responsibility to treat everyone,” he said. In Dharwad district too of the 17 hospitals where 50% of the beds had been earmarked, some hospitals reported patients from Bengaluru and surrounding areas getting admitted. In Davangere, though there have been reports of Bengaluru residents taking hospital beds, the district administration clarified that they have not seen any such development. “But we are anticipating such a development and are prepared for it. We have also sought clarification on accommodating such patients with endorsement from health officials from respective districts as it was done earlier,” Deputy Commissioner of Davanagere Mahanthesh Bilagi told The Hindu. Inadequate government facility in Bengaluru One of the reasons for such long distance travel for treatment, government sources said was availability of infrastructure in Tier 2 places. Sources pointed out that while government hospitals in Bengaluru have about 151 ICU beds out of about 3,190 in Karnataka. Similarly, Bengaluru has about 254 ICU with ventilator beds of the total 2,034 ICU with ventilator beds in State. While Karnataka has about 18,503 oxygenated beds, Bengaluru is estimated to have about 2,900 beds only. “More than 90% of government facilities in Bengaluru are already occupied. This is because, of the total cases in the State, 60% are from Bengaluru while the city has less than 20% of the total government capacity in health services. Beds are still available outside Bengaluru and cases are relatively low there.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/people-from-bengaluru-scouting-for-beds-in-other-cities/article34397680.ece
24 April 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||These women see no help in sight||Indiramma was waiting for customers at the entrance of the newly-opened Prerana Khanavali, an eatery, near Hasanamba Temple in Hassan on Friday. It was opened a month ago and is run by women who have faced many hardships in their lives. While business was improving, COVID-19 restrictions hit them hard. As per new guidelines, eateries cannot serve customers on the premises. They can only take orders and give parcels. Daily customers “A majority of our customers are small-time businessmen, workers and shoppers from rural areas, who walk in for breakfast or lunch. Every day we use to make a business of about Rs. 2,000. But now it is only a couple of hundred rupees,” said Indiramma. The eatery was set up with the support of many people including writer and activist Rupa Hassan to help women earn when government schemes did not come to their aid. “Now they are making efforts to earn by selling quality food. But the lockdown-like situation has hit business. We are making efforts to encourage more people to order parcels,” said Ms. Hassan. Summer months Eateries in Hassan expect good business in April, May and October when children get holidays and people travel. Last year, they did not do any business during the summer due to the lockdown. “There are hundreds of hotels in Bengaluru and other places, which could not restart after they were shut during the lockdown last year. Those hotels opened have already recovered from the loss. Now, once again a lockdown has been declared,” said G.R. Praveen, proprietor of Hotel Sanman, one of the old hotels in Hassan. He has around 25 workers in the hotel. “I cannot send workers back. It will be difficult to restart the hotel if the workers do not return. I have to pay them a salary and provide them with food, despite no business,” he maintained. Prakash, who ran an eatery on M.G. Road in Hassan, closed his firm during the lockdown and later sold it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/these-women-see-no-help-in-sight/article34397678.ece

Eyewitnesses said that nearly 500 people had lunch during the event to mark the annual lunch before closure of Civil Courts for the summer holidays; also to celebrate the marriage of advocate Vishwanath Shetty and to extend farewell to a few judicial officers who have been transferred. Udupi Bar Association president Divakar M. Shetty, however, denied having organised a mega lunch. He told The Hindu that it was an annual convention among all bar associations to extend lunch on the eve of the summer holidays. Not more than 50 people participated in the programme as everyone dreaded the pandemic, he said. Municipal Commissioner of Udupi Municipality Uday Shetty said that on receiving information, he immediately sent a team of officials to the spot at around 1.30 p.m. as he was busy enforcing COVID-19 guidelines at Malpe. Officials reported to him that there were very few people and they had, in fact, stopped the programme. When he personally visited the court complex at around 3.30 p.m., there was nothing happening there, Mr. Shetty said. Udupi Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha told The Hindu that he was awaiting response from the Municipal Commissioner to the show-cause notice issued to him. “I have appointed 18 nodal officers to oversee COVID-19 guidelines across the district and the Municipal Commissioner is one among them. Upon his response, I would take further action,” he said. Asked whether photographic and video evidence were not enough to initiate immediate action, Mr. Jagadeesha said that they were not clear.

24 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||37 pvt. hospitals set aside 1,597 beds||Amidst the boom in COVID-19 infections in Mysuru and the big jump in demand for beds for patients, the district administration had asked private hospitals to set aside 50 percent of their beds for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, 37 hospitals, including large, medium and smaller-sized hospitals, in the city have allotted 50 per cent beds each in their facilities, giving details to the district administration on the type of beds they had reserved based on the nature of treatment of patients. The private hospitals’ move has brought a little relief to the district authorities with a sudden spike in demand for beds and the beds occupied in the district hospital by COVID-19 patients exceeding the bed strength. As on Thursday, the active case tally stood at 4,988. However, not many ICU beds are available since the total number of beds available with 37 hospitals was less than 200. Among the allocated 94 beds, only 68 ICU beds are left vacant (as on Thursday). The administration of the State-run K.R. Hospital in Mysuru is busy arranging more number of beds as Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar, on observing the worrying situation in Mysuru, told the hospital to get 1,000 beds ready by next week. The private hospitals have set aside 1,597 beds which is 50 per cent of their bed strength, for COVID-19 treatment, according to details made available by the administration. It has to be seen how long the existing ICU beds in private hospitals last going by the surging daily count. Out of 176 ICU beds, the private hospitals have reserved 94 beds for COVID-19 patients and the rest for non-COVID-19 patients. The total number of beds in 37 identified private hospitals and nursing homes was 3,106, including 1,778 normal beds, 122 high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) beds, 936 oxygenated beds, 129 ventilator beds and 176 ICU beds. Among the available beds, 1,597 beds had been reserved for COVID-19 treatment and this includes 930 normal beds, 62 HFNO beds, 453 oxygenated beds, 58 ventilator beds and 94 ICU beds. As per the bed availability details provided on Thursday evening, 1,461 beds are vacant which includes 50 HFNO beds, 453 oxygenated beds, 46 ventilator beds, 68 ICU beds and 844 normal beds. However, in the media bulletin issued by the Health Department, 1,762 patients are isolated in dedicated private COVID-19 hospitals, and 1,298 patients isolated in dedicated private COVID-19 Healthcare Centres. As many as 1,154 are under home isolation. The vacant bed details in private hospitals and the details on patients currently admitted in these hospitals doesn’t match. The administration has to clarify on the total beds’ accessibility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/37-pvt-hospitals-set-aside-1597-beds/article34397799.ece

These two activities and medical services will continue without any hurdles during the curfew hours, she clarified. “There is no restriction to health-related activities on both the days. Mysuru city has achieved 44 per cent progress in vaccination and the need of the hour is that each vaccination centre has to immunise at least 300 people daily,” Ms. Sindhuri told a meeting of officials ahead of the weekend curfew. In the guidelines issued by the government, vaccination has been allowed and the people can take it during curfew if they wish. If needed, those wishing to take the shots can take the help of attendants to reach hospitals for the inoculation. MCC Commissioner Shilpa Nag, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj and others were present during the meeting. Mysuru is expected to come to a complete halt during weekend curfew. The curfew will be in force from 9 p.m. on Friday till 6 a.m. on Monday.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||‘No shortage of COVID-19 testing kits’||When C. Gopal went to the Urban Primary Health Centre at K. Narayanapura on Friday morning, he was surprised to see a board announcing that RT-PCR tests would not be conducted owing to lack of stock. “I visited other PHCs in the neighbouring areas and found that there was no stock of even RAT (rapid antigen test) kits. PHC staff claimed there was a shortage of test kits in the entire Mahadevapura zone,” he said. With the number of COVID-19 positive cases increasing by the day, a lot of emphasis is being given to testing. The Karnataka government had given the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) a target of testing 1 lakh citizens per day. “If there are no test kits, how will they detect positive cases, isolate them, trace the contacts?” said Mr. Gopal. BBMP’s health officials, however, claimed that there is no shortage of testing kits. The civic body has been conducting upwards of 80,000 tests a day, they added. According to BBMP Special Commissioner (Health) P. Rajendra Cholan, the kits are given once in three days to the PHCs where RAT and RT-PCR tests are performed. “There is ample stock of testing kits. We received 2 lakh testing kits from the State government on Thursday and distributed them to the PHCs on Friday. We also have a reserve of 1 lakh testing kits,” he said. He added that zonal commissioners have been authorised to procure testing kits from the market in case of any shortage. The expenditure will be reimbursed to the various zones from the COVID-19 funds. BBMP has shifted its focus to targeted testing. “Priority is given to testing primary and secondary contacts, those with symptoms and ILI (influenza like illness) or SARI (severe acute respiratory infection),” Mr. Cholan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-shortage-of-covid-19-testing-kits/article34398160.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Makeshift hospitals to be set up||The State government will set up makeshift or modular hospitals to create 2,000 ICU beds with about 1,000 ventilators within 15 days while Karnataka has sought permission from the Centre to import Remdesivir directly, Health Minister K. Sudhakar said on Friday. Acknowledging shortage of oxygen beds, ICU beds and ventilators, especially in Bengaluru, the Health Minister said these makeshift hospitals of about 300 beds each will come up in the premises of tertiary hospitals, such as Victoria, Bowring, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Jayadeva, Kidwai and Nimhans. “Each makeshift hospital will have about 100 ventilator beds.” The Health Minister said that Karnataka has sought the Centre’s permission to import 2 lakh vials of Remdesivir directly. “We are awaiting permission. I have spoken to Union Fertiliser Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda. We can airlift the entire 2 lakh vials at a time. This will be sufficient for 20 days, and besides we will get central allocation.” The current allocation of Remdesivir to the State is not sufficient, he added. The Minister said that the State has been receiving 10,000 to 15,000 vials daily over the last three days. Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw has also assured supply of about 50,000 vials by the end of April, and that she has already supplied 10,000 vials in the last two days, he said. Dr. Sudhakar said that the health infrastructure is under tremendous pressure with people not requiring hospitalisation getting admitted. “90 % of the patients do not need hospitalisation. There is anxiety among people. The Prime Minister has also asked us to strengthen the home isolation strategy. We have been told that production of oxygen and Remdesivir has been increased.” The Minister said that the State has requested the Centre to supply 1,500 tonnes of oxygen daily from May 1 and 1,000 tonnes daily till April 30. “The State government is also proposing to purchase Oxygen Concentrators, Oxygen Generators, portable oxygen equipment. The State will also strengthen tele-medicine facilities. We are making efforts on a war footing.” There are shortcomings, the Minister acknowledged, and said that the second wave had hit the country suddenly. “Even countries such as the U.S., which spends 20% of GDP on health sector, were affected by the pandemic.” Regarding criticism on harsh curfew conditions, Dr. Sudhakar said several countries that faced more than one wave have had imposed lockdown for one to one-and-a-half months. “Is it possible to control the pandemic without lockdown? This is not a time for politicising the issue. It is a collective war. There is a health emergency in the country.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/makeshift-hospitals-to-be-set-up/article34398151.ece

The initiative was facilitated by Centre for Rural Education, Development and Innovative Technologies of India (Credit i) which teamed up with the Maharani Women’s College for Arts. M.P. Varsha, Managing Trustee and CEO of Credit i, said that such collaboration will continue and help bring more number of people in the qualifying age group to get vaccinated. There was reluctance among a section of the population and Credit i volunteers with local residents launched a campaign to dispel any fears. This enabled people from Gouri Shankar Nagar, Datta Nagar, and Gundu Rao Nagar to avail themselves of the vaccination. There was also a tendency among people to postpone their visit to the nearest primary health centre or hospital as they are not in the vicinity. “So we decided to bring the vaccinating team to the people and used the Gouri Shankar Nagar school as the site’’, Dr. Varsha said. More camps sought The MCC deployed its team complete with doctors and nurses for the “vaccination festival’’ as it was called. Dr. Varsha said residents of other areas including Srirampura, Kuvempunagar, and Vidyaranyapuram were in contact with him to conduct similar camps and the MCC has promised to take such mass vaccination drives forward.

But this is subject to the availability of a minimum of 100 eligible persons to be covered at a time and a request by the local resident welfare associations or citizens’ groups. Mysuru City Corporation Commissioner Shilpa Nag said that the vaccination drive was making brisk progress in the city and almost 50 per cent of the nearly 3 lakh plus population over 45 years of age, has been covered so far. The target is to cover the remaining 50 per cent or nearly 1.5 lakh people in the eligible age group before the end of the month. Hence if there is a group of 100 or more people in an area or an apartment complex then the welfare association could contact the MCC which will send the mobile vaccinating teams complete with doctors and other staff. Ms. Nag said other groups like pensioners association or senior citizens group too could contact the MCC in case they have 100 or more members to be inoculated. For smaller groups, the MCC will arrange for their transportation to the nearest centre. Earlier, vaccination was given only at the stipulated sites. The timeline to complete the vaccination for people over 45 years before April 30 is to focus on the 18 plus population group who will become eligible for receiving the vaccination from May 1. The ongoing drive is also accompanied by the second wave of the pandemic and a massive surge in the COVID-19 positive cases being reported in the city as elsewhere in the State. The district had 4,998 active cases with 818 cases reported on Thursday evening with a majority of them from the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccination-coverage-over-50-per-cent-in-mysuru-city/article34397800.ece

A COVID-19 test should be mandated only in case of any invasive procedure after admission. This direction has been issued following complaints that some private hospitals are demanding COVID-19 negative certificates for admission of non-COVID-19 patients thereby causing delay in treatment, stated a circular issued on Friday. Separate queues Further, all COVID-19 testing laboratories and swab collection points have been directed to maintain separate queues for senior citizens and pregnant women. The laboratories should also ensure that physical distancing is maintained by marking on the floor and leaving alternate chairs vacant. Apart from compulsorily wearing masks, hand washing and sanitiser facilities should be provided for patients while waiting to get tested. Hospitals and laboratories who do not comply with these directions will be liable for strict action under provisions of Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (KPME) Act and Epidemic Diseases Act 2020, according to the circular. Back-up teams in labs To ensure that RT-PCR testing services in any COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory in medical colleges are not hampered in the event of any of their microbiologists, laboratory technicians or data entry operators getting infected, the Medical Education Department has directed the dean/directors of colleges to form backup teams. These back-up teams should be set up in consultation with the nodal officer of the laboratory. They should get trained well in advance in their respective COVID-19 RT-PCR laboratories. The teams should work in the RT-PCR laboratory until the infected personnel resume work, stated another circular.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/plaints-of-delay-in-care-for-non-covid-19-ailments/article34398152.ece

24 April 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||A game changer for Alappuzha||The Lokame Tharavadu contemporary art show, along with the Alappuzha Heritage Project, has the potential to transform the dynamics of cultural tourism, according to tourism planners and stakeholders. “For a variety of reasons this project is a game changer as it extends the footprint of Alappuzha as a destination,” said V. Venu, Additional Chief Secretary, Cultural Affairs, Planning and Economic Affairs. Mr. Venu said that the art show spotlighted the destination in an entirely different perspective, which would be beneficial for the tourism industry. “For the tourists, Alappuzha is always a boarding point, a backwater destination, houseboat destination and most importantly an excursion destination. A large portion of our visitors get into a boat, cruise around and have a meal or two and exit. This event makes a very compelling pitch to use Alappuzha as a destination not merely for a houseboat cruise, but to stay back to spend a night or two at the destination, absorbing its culture and history,” said Mr. Venu. The event also puts the spotlight on the built heritage of the town, on its bylanes and many bridges and the quaint precincts where the event is being held, revealing the many layers of Alappuzha’s history and its rich cultural interface. Rebranding itself “I believe that the event would become a catalyst through which we will see Alappuzha rebranding itself and repositioning itself as a destination worth more than a cruise. From a cultural point of view, this is a great example of adaptive reuse. We are only starting to do this,” he said. Conservation architect Benny Kuriakose said they embarked on the ambitious project to conserve the built heritage of Alappuzha for the future generations. “We also thought there is great educational value in these spaces which served as coir factories and warehouses. These are nothing but attempts to tell stories from our past and the linkages of the place with the maritime trade,” he said. Tomy Pulickattil, managing director of Pulickattil Houseboats and a stakeholder in the tourism industry, said it was not just the tourism industry that was looking at the show with great hopes. “The people here also have great aspirations regarding the project. The benefits brought in by the biennale in Kochi are known to everyone and I am certain that this would lift Alappuzha as a destination and provide it a new orientation,” Mr. Pulickattilsaid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-game-changer-for-alappuzha/article34397767.ece

24 April 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Snake gourd turns bitter deal for Marayur||The tribespeople of Marayur forest settlements are faced with a crisis of finding a market for kattupadavalam (snake gourd), which they have cultivated extensively under the initiative of the Vana Samrakshana Samithi (VSS), providing them a key source of livelihood.  Kattupadavalam , a variety of Trichosanthes cucumerina ,  had earlier enjoyed good demand from Ayurvedic pharmaceutical companies that purchased the herb in large quantities. It is harvested from January to April and farmers collect the entire plant, including the roots, leaves, vine and seeds, which are dried before being sold. The vegetable used to fetch above Rs. 200 per kg. However, last year, many companies had informed the VSS of their inability to buy kattupadavalam in the following season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the notification, many farmers had gone ahead with the cultivation. According to the VSS, about 10 tonnes of kattupadavalam harvested is seeking market now. No animal attacks The cultivation had been carried out in nearly 10 tribal settlements in the Marayur sandalwood division. A Forest Department official said a major attraction for farmers in cultivating kattupadavalam was that it is generally free of attack from wild animals due to its bitter taste. Earlier, the farmers collected the herb from the forests and sold to middlemen at a paltry sum of Rs. 25 a kg. Later, the intervention of the Forest Department led to the pharmaceutical companies directly procuring it. The main tribal settlements where snake gourd is cultivated include Karpoorakudy, Kuthukallukudy, Nellipettykudy, Kavakudy and Vengaparakudy. Deemed a key ingredient in Ayurveda medicines, the variety grown in Marayur is considered to be of superior quality. Now, almost five tonnes of it has been sold at Rs. 195 per kg. VSS sources pointed out that since the herb enjoys demand only from pharmaceutical companies, finding another market for the produce is not so easy. K.V. Binoji, facilitator of the Marayur sandalwood division, said that only Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala had placed orders for its procurement this season.

24 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Healthcare system under severe stress as cases continue to soar||While a majority of people recovering from COVID-19 remain at home in the district, a safety net is in place in case of emergencies, though the system is struggling to catch up with the surge in cases. Excluding those who tested positive on Friday, 23,210 people are recovering at home, which is more than 90% of the active caseload of over 25,000 as on Thursday. The test positivity rate (TPR) for the district on Friday was 27.95%, up from 26.33% on Thursday. A centralised system is in place for patient transport and bed allocation through the Coronasafe network, the software that monitors bed availability, patient details, and transport network in real time and facilitates shifting of patients based on requirements. “Local bodies had arranged for vehicles to transport patients to hospitals during the earlier surge in cases. But when the numbers began to fall, they dismantled their systems and are now facing a shortage of vehicles. We are trying to get a decentralised patient transport system running again,” said a health official who maintained that a centralised bed allocation system that allots facilities based on need and the patient’s condition is the only way to prevent the entire healthcare system from collapsing as cases continue to surge. A telemedicine unit with eight to 10 doctors, mostly specialists associated with the National Health Mission, Indian Medical Association, and the Health Department, is functioning for teleconsultation services round the clock. Calls from patients recovering at home to the telemedicine service are routed through a junior public health nurse (JPHN) or ASHA worker. Sreeja, a JPHN at Palluruthy where 84 patients are recovering at home, said she contacts people who test positive and makes sure that they have her number. Monitoring people daily is not an option, since JPHNs have other duties, including at COVID test centres, she added. If a person recovering at home requires medical attention, they are first put in touch with the doctor at the nearest primary health centre. If further care is required, a video consultation is arranged with specialists at the telemedicine unit. ‘Stabilisation centres’ are in place at taluk hospitals to attend to emergencies in the case of those recovering at home. They are equipped with oxygen supply and medication. There is, however, no regular outpatient system at any hospital for COVID patients recovering at home. “We were in the process of setting up outpatient services at six government hospitals for check-ups or blood tests and scans, when the second surge hit. A shortage of staff now, particularly nurses, means that it is difficult to provide such services,” an official said. Dr. George Tukalan, IMA treasurer, who is helping out with shifting and telemedicine teams, said people recovering at home are advised to monitor oxygen saturation levels every two to three hours and are usually asked to report a fall below 95.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/healthcare-system-under-severe-stress-as-cases-continue-to-soar/article34398259.ece
24 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||PCB notices to over 50 polluting units||The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) has served notices on over 50 polluting units located close to Chitrapuzha and Kadambrayar. The process of serving notices began in March, and follow-up action, including issue of show-cause notices and closure, if required, will be taken on the basis of the response of the said units. The polluting sources include apartments, industrial units, service stations, hospitals, hotels, and restaurants, according to senior board officials here. The action is part of steps being taken for the rejuvenation of Chitrapuzha and Kadambrayar, which figure among the 21 critically-polluted water stretches identified by the Central Pollution Control Board in the State. Chitrapuzha flows through the Ambalamedu area and joins Kadambrayar near Brahmapuram. It then flows southwards and joins the Vembanad lake at Thevara ferry. Five drains were identified as joining the polluted stretch in the action plan. They include the drain joining Chitrapuzha near the Brahmapuram yard, drain from the Kochi Refinery area, Athikkayi branch, drain joining Chitrapuzha from the Cochin Special Economic Zone, and Vettuvelikkadavu (Konothupuzha joining Chitrapuzha). Inspections by the PCB revealed that waste was being dumped into the water streams in violation of norms. The board had also found that waste water from the Chambakkara market was being discharged into Chitrapuzha. Some establishments were found discharging untreated / partially treated effluents into the drain leading to the river. Domestic effluent outlets were found along the banks. The sewage treatment plants installed at some erring units were either partially operational or defunct. A few units like hotels, which should have set up effluent treatment plants, had failed to do so. The action plan proposed includes ensuring that effluent discharges from residential / commercial buildings into stormwater drains must conform to the prescribed standards. Such units will be brought under the consent regime of the board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-notices-to-over-50-polluting-units/article34398255.ece

While the accused has allegedly confessed to murdering his daughter, he has not said anything yet in that regard. The police team engaged in collecting evidence with the accused is now in Goa after having covered Salem and Bengaluru on Thursday. “The team will take him to the casino there where he is said to have splurged the money,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). The accused allegedly has a cheating case registered against him as part of the business he had run in Pune some years ago. Notwithstanding the seemingly contradictory statements that the accused had given, the police now feel that his version about the incident at the apartment could be true. He had confessed that he had smothered the teenager and the post mortem and DNA examination have proved that. What left the police confused was his statement that he had smothered the teenager by putting his hand around her neck in which case there should have been multiple breakages in the cartilage, which was not the case. So, the police re-enacted the scene which proved that he had applied pressure on her jaw that ultimately affected her lungs and left her unconscious besides leading to her bleeding. The investigation team is expected back only by Tuesday after collecting evidence from Kollur, Murudeshwar, and Karwar in Karnataka. Meanwhile, it is learned that the police have collected evidence from the car belonging to the accused that was used by him to flee the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-police-team-probing-death-of-teenager-reaches-goa/article34398256.ece

The committee in its report submitted to the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had said that the pollution of waterbodies was closely related to waste management systems available in the local bodies concerned. All local bodies along waterbodies have to ensure 100% compliance with door-to-door collection of segregated waste and ensure its safe and proper disposal. Source-level treatment of wet solid waste has to be promoted as far as possible under the supervision of the Suchitwa Mission, Haritha Keralam Mission, and the PCB. Major commercial establishments, if possible, can establish their own plastic shredding units to check littering of plastics on the road. Local bodies should install surveillance cameras at major points of waste disposal.

The associations have requested the District Police Chief (Kozhikode City) to maintain 50% of the total staff at a time for duty and manage law and order responsibilities. They pointed out that a similar strategy adopted during the first wave of the pandemic had been a success. “Though a majority of our members have got preventive vaccines, the rising number of cases among them is a serious concern. At least the senior members in various police stations should be exempted from outdoor duty,” said a functionary of the Kerala Police Association. He said the stress of intensified enforcement activities and continuous patrol duties was taking a toll on many police officers within city limits. Intensified vigil Meanwhile, senior police officers in charge of enforcement activities pointed out that an immediate work rearrangement would be difficult, considering the worsening COVID-19 situation. According to them, the intensified enforcement activities and field-level surveillance measures by the police would be crucial in managing the situation. “We are now in the initial phase of action that demands more energy and effort on the part of the existing force. Though the request for work rearrangement is genuine in many cases, we are helpless to consider it now,” said a senior officer with the city police. He said the shortage of staff on duty in some stations due to COVID-19 infection would be managed by deploying the required personnel from nearby stations. As a temporary solution to control the rush at police stations, filing of online petitions would be encouraged. To ensure the safety of police personnel, the entry of visitors to stations without prior permission would be restricted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/as-cases-rise-police-officers-seek-rearrangement-of-work/article34397697.ece

24 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Screening intensified at Beypore port||Following the recent cancellation of a Lakshadweep vessel after some of its crew members tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the authorities have resumed stringent passenger screening measures at the Beypore port. Only those who carry a negative RT-PCR test certificate will be allowed to board ships. Those suffering from suspected COVID-19 symptoms will not be allowed to enter the port premises. More officials have been posted to supervise the implementation of the health protocol and screening activities using thermal scanners. Only one weekly passenger service to Lakshadweep is being facilitated by the Beypore port at present. According to port officials, stringent screening measures will be in place for three more weeks. Monsoon-related restrictions on passenger ships between the mainland and Lakshadweep will come into effect on May 15. In case of a threat of COVID-19 spread and difficulty in operating a particular schedule, arrangements are in place to operate smaller vessels. According to officials, two such smaller vessels were operated to support stranded passengers. The number of officials on duty at the port has been reduced to comply with the latest safety norms issued by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/screening-intensified-at-beypore-port/article34397690.ece

24 April 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||Curbs at religious places evoke protests||An order by District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan banning gathering of more than five persons in all religious places in Malappuram district evoked sharp criticism from different Muslim groups on Friday. Following protests, Mr. Gopalakrishnan clarified that the ban on gathering in religious places would be in force in areas where prohibitory orders were clamped under Section 144 of CrPC. He also said that an all-party meeting to be convened by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan would take a final decision on the matter on Monday. Ban orders Prohibitory orders were clamped in Kondotty Municipality and the grama panchayats of Porur, Mangalam, Morayur, Pulikkal, Pallikkal, Cherukavu and Cheekode from Wednesday night. Ban orders were passed for 16 more panchayats from Friday. They are Oorakam, Othukkungal, Peruvallur, Chelembra, Vettom, Alankode, Veliyamkode, Pulpatta, Nannambra, Thanalur, Pothukal, Thirunavaya, Vazhayur, Muthuvallur, Nannamukku and Wandoor. Mr. Gopalakrishnan said that curfew had to be imposed in the 23 panchayats and one municipality as the test positivity rate in those local bodies had crossed 30 per cent. However, the Collector’s order restricting the number of people in religious places kicked up a controversy with major Muslim organisations questioning it. They alleged that the Collector had taken a unilateral decision without consulting with them. However, Mr. Gopalakrishnan said that he had consulted a few religious leaders. Opposing a blanket ban on prayer gatherings in religious places, Muslim leaders said that all mosques in the district were following COVID-19 guidelines. They said it would be double-standards by closing religious places even while allowing public transport, cinema halls, bars, shops and malls to function. Protests from various groups flooded the Collector’s official Facebook page. The Kerala Muslim Jamat demanded that at least 40 persons should be allowed in mosques. Indian Union Muslim League State general secretary K.P.A. Majeed said restrictions that did not apply for shops and auditoriums should not be imposed on places of religious worship. Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama president Sayed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal and general secretary K. Alikutty Musliar denied Mr. Goplakrishnan’s claim that he had consulted religious leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/curbs-at-religious-places-evoke-protests/article34397708.ece

24 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M) to rally people against Central policy||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] has sought to rouse civic society to donate liberally to the State government's bid to supply COVID-19 vaccines free of cost to the population. CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said here on Friday that the scheme would cost the public exchequer an estimated Rs. 1,300 crore. The pandemic had cratered the State's public finances. The plague situation demanded more public spending on COVID-19 management. Hence, the CPI(M) had asked party workers, service organisations, trade unions, mass organisations, leftists, humanists and philanthropists to contribute to the Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund.  ‘Constitutional duty’ The "vaccine challenge" donation campaign would spotlight the Centre's "abandonment of States" in a time of dire need. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre had no value for human life. It had allowed vaccine manufacturers to sell 50% of their production to the highest bidder in the open market. The State governments had to outbid powerful players in the private health sector to get vaccine doses for their respective citizens. The Centre had forsaken its constitutional obligation to States, he said. On April 28, people would stand in front of their houses from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. with placards protesting against the Centre’s vaccine policy and refusal to come to the State’s aid, he said. He said the Centre had abandoned the country to the vagaries of the pandemic. The Centre had dismally failed to build health infrastructure or stock up on medical oxygen and life-saving drugs despite warnings of a more aggressive second COVID wave. It had lost precious time. Instead, the BJP allowed corporates to benefit from the crisis. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan had callously reacted to the State’s vaccine requirement by saying the government should tap the open market, Mr. Vijayaraghavan alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-to-rally-people-against-central-policy/article34397786.ece

With the extension of validity of the Environmental Clearance (EC) till January 2, 2024, Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Ltd, the multi-port operator, will have time till December 2023 to complete the project’s Phase I, which missed the target of December 3, 2019. In January 2014, the Ministry granted clearance to the project as per the Environment Impact Assessment notification 2006 and the CRZ notification 2011 and its subsequent amendments, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions. Five tranches The EC is given in tranches of five, two, and three. An automatic two-year EC was received in 2019. Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd \, the government entity overseeing the project, had to undergo the process to get EC for the next three years. Managing Director and CEO of the VISL Jayakumar had to make presentations before an expert appraisal committee. The State had demanded extension on the following four counts. It was pointed out that the initial two years were lost for the global bid process to select the concessionaire after the issuance of the EC; delay in sourcing rock by the AVPPL, the concessionaire, for the construction of the 3.1-km breakwater; work of dredging and reclamation, berth and container yard of the seaport can be completed only with the advancement of the breakwater; and the outbreak of COVID-19.

24 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Onus on Centre to help State: CM||Kerala will have to find additional resources of Rs. 1,300 crore to provide COVID-19 vaccines free of cost to everyone if the Centre does not make sufficient vaccine stocks available to the State, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Friday. The estimate of Rs. 1,300 crore is the financial commitment that will be required of the State, going by the open market rate of Rs. 400 per vaccine dose, which has been disclosed by the Serum Institute of India. Mr. Vijayan said, during a videoconference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, he explained that finding such huge resources would put a severe burden on the State which had already been spending crores on preparing the health system to fight COVID-19. The State reiterated its requirement of 50 lakh doses of vaccine immediately to cover the 45-plus age group. Kerala welcomed the Centre’s policy of opening up COVID-19 vaccination for all above 18 years from May 1. However, leaving the States to fend for themselves as far as vaccines were concerned would be difficult. “Vaccines are the only tool available with the humanity now to fight the pandemic but the Centre’s vaccine policy will not only add to the State’s financial burden but also will lead to unhealthy competition between States to secure vaccine from the open market in sufficient quantities.” The State was awaiting the Centre’s response to its demand for free vaccine supply. But meanwhile, it was forced to open negotiations with vaccine manufacturers because it could not afford to wait till it was too late to procure it from the open market. Kerala had so far delivered 55.9 lakh first doses. Another 8.37 lakh people were covered with two vaccine doses. It had to cover a population of 1.13 crore above 45 years of age and, hence, the State’s demand for 50 lakh doses was only fair. The State’s remaining stock of just 4 lakh doses would be just enough for two days, he said. Crushing the curve Kerala was adopting a three-pronged strategy to crush the epidemic curve, which involved mass testing to pick up as many infectious people from the community, preparing adequate facilities for patient care, stringent regulations on civic life to check disease transmission, and vaccinating as many people as possible to move towards herd immunity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/onus-on-centre-to-help-state-cm/article34397790.ece
24 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||It’s near-normal at vaccine camps||After two days of mayhem and utter panic, the scene was near-normal at most vaccination sites in the State on Friday after the government insisted that COVID vaccine can only be administered only to those who had a prior online registration. The fact that State’s vaccine supplies were in a precarious position had driven thousands to the vaccination sites these past three days in panic. On Friday, the government’s direction that vaccine may be distributed in a streamlined manner by allowing only those with prior online registration to queue up at vaccination centres seemed to have finally sunk in. No crowding was witnessed at vaccination sites. Those who came with prior registration still had to take a token and wait their turn. Vaccination was done at 1,247 sites across the State on Friday and 1,19,379 doses were delivered. The vaccine stock position continues to be precarious across the State and while mass camps would no longer be possible, small consignments of vaccine are expected at short intervals. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said Kerala would have to find additional resources of Rs. 1,300 crore to provide vaccines free of cost to everyone if the Centre did not make sufficient vaccine stocks available to the State. The estimate of Rs. 1,300 crore is the financial commitment that will be required of the State, going by the open market rate of Rs. 400 per vaccine dose, which has been disclosed by the Serum Institute of India.

She appealed to the people to cooperate with the measures. People should leave their homes over the weekend only if absolutely necessary. Shops selling essential commodities, vegetables, fruits, milk, fish and meat will function. Home delivery of goods will be encouraged to reduce crowding. Hotels and restaurants can open only for take-away and parcel services. Training for counting on People engaged in essential services are exempted from the restrictions. This includes revenue, election, health, other institutions engaged in COVID control measures, and the media. Students travelling to attend examinations are exempt from the restrictions. The COVID-19 guidelines should be strictly observed at all times, the Collector said. Training sessions of officials assigned for the counting of votes on May 2 will be held as per schedule. They will be exempt from the restrictions, but should carry their posting order and official identification cards with them for the sessions. Museums, zoo closed Beaches, parks, museums and the zoo will remain closed on both days. Industrial units and companies which handle emergency requirements and need to function 24 hours can operate. The staff should carry their ID cards with them. IT firms should deploy minimal staff in offices. Long-distance bus services, trains and flights will operate. Public and private transport to the airports, railway stations and bus stands also are permitted. Travellers should produce valid travel documents and tickets.

24 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||District gets 65,000 doses, vaccination picks up||The COVID-19 inoculation drive in the district appeared to have returned to normalcy on Friday, thanks to the arrival of an additional vaccine batch and reforms to streamline the public following days of commotion and chaos at the vaccination centres. A day after the district received 65,000 of vaccine doses, over a hundred health-care institutions received vaccine-seekers after a hiatus of few days. The government’s decision to abandon spot registrations paid off as hospitals witnessed an orderly flow of those who registered online for the jabs. While several people who had been given tokens at the Jimmy George indoor stadium a few days ago returned with the hope of getting registered on the spot, they were turned back and advised to register on the Co-WIN portal. Despite the many merits, the arrangement was not without teething troubles on the first day. People who had received specific time slots while booking online were made to collect tokens that effectively rendered the time allotted to them on Co-WIN useless. Priority was decided on the basis of the tokens that were issued at the vaccination centres. ‘Avoid parallel bookings’ P.B. Thomas, a retired bank manager, was one among several people who had to wait until 1 p.m. for their injections at the General Hospital, despite having booked in the 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. slot. While lauding the officials in doing away with spot registrations, the 71-year old Kaithamukku resident urged health authorities to avoid a parallel booking system that would create confusion and defeat the goal of minimising crowding. Besides, while a separate facility was reserved at Jimmy George indoor stadium for fast-tracking the vaccination procedure for those requiring palliative care, the same was not seen elsewhere. This left several senior citizens with no option but to wait for long hours outdoor in the searing heat for their turn, thereby exposing themselves to the threat of contracting the infection. ‘Adhere to time slots’ District Medical Officer K.S. Shinu said the system of multiple tokens will be eased out within a few days. However, such a move would hinge on the public adhering to the time slots allotted to them. The daily vaccine coverage rose to 14,432 from 2,931 a day ago. As many as 13,905 people received Covishield, while the others were administered Covaxin. Vaccination will be undertaken in 74 centres including 50 public health institutions on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/district-gets-65000-doses-vaccination-picks-up/article34398420.ece

The Chief Secretary should send a circular to all government departments to prevent individuals or organisations from misusing the name of the commission and intervening for various matters in government departments. Complaints  The commission had got complaints that some people have been using display boards of SHRC to create an impression that it is an official vehicle, while some others have been buying stuff for free from some shops claiming to be officials of the commission. Some even went to the extent of holding sittings similar to the one held by the commission by issuing notice to people. Commission chairperson Antony Dominic said the heads of institutions should demand identity cards from those claiming to be officials of the SHRC. The names of those who fail to produce their identity cards should be informed to the police station. The registration department should ensure that newly registered organisations do not have names similar to that of the commission.   The Motor Vehicle Department and the police should take action against those who display Kerala State boards on vehicles, claiming to be official vehicles of the SHRC. The chairperson said that strict action needed to be taken against such people who bring disrepute to the SHRC’s name.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/misuse-of-panels-name-irks-shrc/article34397692.ece
24 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Power sector puts curbs in place||With Kerala grappling with the second wave of COVID-19, the State’s power sector has introduced a slew of measures for guaranteeing 24x7 power supply without putting the lives of the employees at risk. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), which employs 33,000 people, has directed the staff to keep physical contact with the public to a minimum and strictly adhere to COVID-19 guidelines. Field offices have been advised to accept applications for general services such as new electricity connections via the online mode. They have also been told to regulate consumer footfall and encourage electricity consumers to pay their bills online. Robust defence The KSEB, which has 1.3 crore consumers, is attempting to put up a robust defence against the virus as the bulk of its 33,000 staff—sub engineers, cashiers, overseers, linemen, meter readers and electricity workers—are people who come into contact with the public on a daily basis. ‘Out centres’ As part of the precautionary measures, the State-run power utility has revived the electrical section ‘out-centres’/extended offices to cut down staff presence in the field offices and ensure prompt response to power outages. Under this decentralised system, a small group of KSEB staff, notably those tasked with repairs, will be stationed in temporary offices opened in schools, anganwadis or buildings owned by residents’ associations. They need not report for duty at the main office every day. This will help to keep contact among the KSEB staff to a minimum, KSEB chairman and managing director N. S. Pillai says. “We had successfully experimented with the system during the initial outbreak last year. We have revived it given the surge in COVID-19 cases,” he says. Billing activities If billing activities in the containment/micro containment zones are hit, the consumers can snap a photo of the reading in the meter and submit it. Bills will be prepared on the basis of this information, an April 22 notification issued by the KSEB says. In section offices with two cashiers, one cash counter will be open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The second cashier will contact consumers over phone and help them with instructions for paying their bills online. The KSEB offices have also been directed to appoint a COVID Protocol Officer who will be responsible for ensuring an adequate supply of sanitiser, soap, masks, and face shields for the staff and consumers visiting the offices.

On Friday, when the test results of 1,30,617 samples came in, the case graph went up by 28,447 new cases, the highest single-day spike in the State. The test positivity rate, which, less than three weeks ago was around 3%, now stands at 21.78%. More results of the augmented testing drive are expected in the following days. Except for two districts, all others have over a thousand new cases each, while Ernakulam and Kozhikode have over 4,000 new cases each. ICU admissions are soaring by the day and as on Friday 1,218 critically ill patients are being cared for in ICUs, with 347 requiring ventilator assistance. The cumulative case burden now stands at 13,50,501 cases. The active case pool of the State is 1,78,983. However, among these, the actual number of hospitalised patients is 16,999, with 3,609 persons newly admitted on Friday. A total of 3,74, 464 persons are in home or institutional isolation. On Friday, 5,663 persons were reported to have recovered from COVID. The total recoveries now number 11,66,135. 27 deaths The State’s case fatality graph is rising proportionate to the rise in new cases and on Friday 27 deaths were added to the official list, taking the toll to 5,055.

24 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Second wave presses pause button on summer camps||One of the casualties of the COVID-19 second wave has been children’s summer vacation camps. With classes going online last year and limited peer interaction, children’s mental and physical health suffered. With COVID-19 cases seemingly under control once, children had hoped to get away from the restricted environs at home, meet others of their age, and have fun, at least for a few hours a day. But now, as pandemic restrictions have been tightened, summer camps seem a distant possibility. The Lakshmibai National College of Physical Education (LNCPE)at Karyavattom, which used to organise one of the biggest summer camps in the city with hundreds of children in attendance, said the COVID-19 protocols prevent it from organising such an event this year. However, there are plans to organise virtually some events for school and college students such as one on yoga that will not only educate them but also benefit them physically, says LNCPE Principal G. Kishore. Creativity may be hit D. Reghoothaman, co-founder of the Abhinaya Theatre Research Centre that conducts children’s theatre camps, says he has not been able to give a thought to a camp for children owing to the second wave. He is not comfortable with the idea of an online camp, saying shooting and sharing a session on social media changes the grammar of theatre. Theory classes could be held online, but children would not be very keen. Creativity would be affected if practical sessions were to be held online, he says. Mampazhakalam, Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan’s annual summer camp, too will not be held this year. The Samskrithi Bhavan has been organising two cultural programmes a month, online, for the public in the wake of the pandemic. Other than that, no events are planned. Any decision on an online programme for children will depend on how the COVID-19 situation evolves, says Culture Director T.R. Sadasivan Nair. Meanwhile, the Kerala State Jawahar Balbhavan’s summer camp has moved online. The camp, for children in the 4-16 age group, will be held till May-end, says institute principal S. Malini. Six live sessions a week are offered in three disciplines, and 500-odd children have registered. Used to online mode Theatre director Prasanth Narayanan plans to start a camp for children on May 10. If possible, it will be held offline. Else, it will be organised online with all technical aspects in place. A live class through on online platform is what he has in mind. With children used to online classes now and availability of devices not a hurdle for most, the online mode should not be much of a hassle, he says. The Institution of Engineers (India) that began a 25-day vacation class for students has put it on hold after six days. A review will be held on May 3 when a decision will be taken.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/second-wave-presses-pause-button-on-summer-camps/article34398415.ece

The incident occurred at Pirappancode around 9 a.m. when the lorry that was heading towards Venjaramoodu from Vembayam rammed the bus that was going in the opposite direction, towards Thiruvananthapuram. As many as 21 passengers, including the lorry driver and cleaner, sustained injuries and were admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital. The condition of no one is serious. To avert collision, the bus driver had stopped the vehicle on the left side on the road. However, the attempt proved futile. The lorry driver is suspected to have dozed off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/21-injured-in-bus-lorry-collision-near-vembayam/article34398416.ece
24 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Corpn. vaccine camps face uncertainty||The Thiruvananthapuram city Corporation's decentralised COVID-19 vaccination camps now face uncertainty as no spot registration can be allowed as per the new inoculation protocols. Those who want to get vaccinated are required to get appointments to their nearest hospitals or centralised vaccination facility through CoWin application, the nodal site for coordinating the vaccine drive. The civic body has been running its vaccination camps in a decentralised manner in different sets of wards each day, with registration carried out on the spot. Though this arrangement had worked well for the Corporation, it had led to issues regarding crowd control in some other places, leading the government to take a shift towards the prior registration process. Since the camps are held in different locations each day, the inclusion of the centres in the CoWin application is not practical. Though a consignment of 2.5 lakh doses has been allocated for the Thiruvananthapuram region consisting of four districts on Thursday, it was not clear until late on Friday night whether the Corporation would be getting a share. The confusion regarding the spot registration process has also led to an uncertainty regarding the camps. Considering the current situation, the Corporation was unlikely to organise any decentralised camp this weekend. The Corporation had till Wednesday organised decentralised vaccination camps in around 40 wards over two weeks. The civic body had opened decentralised camps in wards to reduce the rush at the centralised vaccination venues such as the Jimmy George stadium. With camps set up in an auditorium or a Corporation building in each ward, people could get vaccinated without travelling far. There is a demand from councillors and the public from various wards to organise camps in their locality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corporations-vaccine-camps-face-uncertainty/article34397765.ece

24 April 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Pooram misses its carnivalesque mood||There were all the usual rituals and events. There were caparisoned elephants, though in limited numbers. Sought-after maestros led the percussion ensembles too. But without the hysteric crowd, revelry, and street vendors, Thrissur Pooram missed its carnivalesque mood. With their hearts in Thekkinkadu Maidan, pooram lovers on Friday sat at home glued to television screens. This year’s pooram created history by conducting the celebrations without people. COVID-19 spoiled the pooram last year too; there were no festivities or events then. Police in strength The city looked deserted. Traffic on Swaraj Round and adjacent roads had been banned for two days. The police erected barricades on roads leading to Swaraj Round. The personnel almost outnumbered people at events, including Madathil Varavu, Ilanjithara Melam, and Kudamattam. While 50 persons each from the 10 participating temples were allowed at the venues, including percussion artists, more than 2,000 police personnel were deployed in the city. Even the percussionists were disappointed. “The cheering crowd is our energy. Without them, there was no mood to play,” said percussion artist Machad Kannan after the Madathil Varavu melam. Rituals as usual Thrissur Pooram is the meeting of deities of 10 temples in the region. The festivities on Friday began with the arrival of Kanimangalam Sastha by 7.30 a.m. The procession was minimalistic with just one elephant and 50 people. It was followed by processions from the Panamukkumpally Sastha, Karamukku Bhagavathy, Lalur Bhagavathy, Naithilakkavu Bhagavathy, Choorakkatukavu Bhagavathy, Ayyanthole Bhagavathy, and Chembukkavu Karthyayani temples. Madathil Varavu, in which the idol of Thiruvambadi Bhagavathy is taken from the Thiruvambadi temple to Naduvil Madam at Pazhayanadakkavu, is one of the main events of the pooram. Panchavadyam led by percussion maestro Kongad Madhu during Madathil Varavu is one of the highlights. However, in view of the pandemic, the number of artists was limited to 34. The Thiruvambadi Devaswom paraded only one elephant. However, the Paramekkavu Devasawom conducted the pooram without limiting its glamour by parading 15 elephants. Procession of Pramekkavu Bhagavathy started around 12.30 p.m. The Ilanjithra melam of Paramekkavu, led by percussion maestro Peruvanam Kuttan Marar, began at 2.30 p.m. under the Ilanji tree of Sree Vadakkunnathan Temple. Around 250 instrumentalists performed the ensemble in harmony. Sparse crowd The Thekkinkadu Maidan witnessed an impoverished crowd, mostly consisting of the police, for the Kudamattom ceremony. The Thiruvambadi Devaswom did not participate in the event. Paramekkavu displayed its set of umbrellas atop the caparisonsed elephants, while Thiruvambadi paraded only one elephant. The fireworks, however, will be displayed in full swing on Saturday morning. But without crowd.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pooram-misses-its-carnivalesque-mood/article34397785.ece

The move came into implementation even before the State government took a decision to impose curfew or lockdown. The members of the traders’ association went from one shop to the other on Friday morning seeking their support to contain the spread of the virus and urged everyone not to allow customers to enter their shops without wearing a mask. Meanwhile, the police personnel kept a stringent watch on the people going to shops and crowding at the tea and coffee kiosks and ensured that social distance was maintained. They also educated people on the benefits of wearing mask. In the new town area of Anantapur, not many traders came forward to shut down the shutters, but the members of the association made rounds of all the shops and pleaded with them to close shops at 6 p.m. However, resistance came from the hotel and restaurant owners as they did brisk business in the evening and in the absence of any official memo on this, they were not willing to lose money.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/traders-down-shutters-voluntarily-in-anantapur/article34397544.ece
24 April 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Delay in results, fake certificates mar COVID testing in Anantapur||The sample testing for coronavirus has gone for a toss with a number of discrepancies creeping into the process, resulting in inordinate delay in getting the results. Allegations are also being made that false certificates are being generated without collecting the samples.  The Hindu accessed one such certificate with its sample ID: 20253647, in which the collection of swab time was mentioned as 7.42 a.m. on April 22 and test result was generated at 7.05 p.m. It has turned out that the person did not submit any sample on that day, but approached a middleman who arranged the certificate for Rs. 600. The person needed to produce a COVID-negative RTPCR certificate for some purpose. ‘Wrong data’ The person claimed that he had submitted a sample at the GGH, Anantapur on April 18 and was given a sample ID 20077819. However, he said, wrong age and place of the collection were mentioned in the data. “I did not receive the result either on my phone or on enquiring at the GGH counter till April 22. As I needed the certificate, I approached the middleman as suggested by the people working at the sample collection centre there,” said the person, on the condition of anonymity. This is not the single such case. A journalist from Dharmavaram working with a vernacular daily submitted a sample some eight days ago after he had symptoms of fever, cold, and cough. He did not get the result till April 22. On Friday, he was informed that he tested positive . In Anantapur too, a majority of the people The Hindu contacted, had got their results 48 hours after submission of samples. Many of them claimed that their personal details were mentioned wrongly. Show-cause notices “After The Hindu published a report on the delay in COVID19 sample data entry at the GGH, some employees have been served show-cause notices and additional staff have been deployed,” said Joint Collector A. Siri. When this issue was brought to the notice of Collector Gandham Chandrudu on Friday evening, he said that the administration was in the process of streamlining the testing process and was recruiting additional trained staff. “We will probe into these specific complaints and take appropriate action,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/delay-in-results-fake-certificates-mar-covid-testing-in-anantapur/article34398357.ece
24 April 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Open temporary cremation grounds, says Kumaraswamy||Slamming the Karnataka government for not ensuring proper arrangements for conducting last rites of those who died of COVID-19, the former Chief Minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy, has suggested opening temporary cremation grounds on forest land around Bengaluru. “It is really the height of inhuman behaviour by the government which has failed to ensure proper arrangements for conducting the last rites of patients who died due to non-availability of proper medical care,” he said on Twitter. The JD(S) leader, who is recuperating in a hospital here after testing positive for COVID-19, said: “Bengaluru is surrounded in all eight directions by forest land that lacks any tree cover. The government should make arrangements here on a daily basis to conduct last rites of those succumbing to the pandemic. The government did not give beds, oxygen, ventilator and life-saving drugs to COVID-19 patients... at least, make arrangements now to conduct the last rites of victims in a dignified manner.” Further, he said: “The government which utterly failed in providing proper medical facilities to the COVID infected persons should not delay the process of arranging for proper place to conduct their last rites. Otherwise, have no doubts that people will curse the government. It is really heart wrenching to see the hardships being faced by the kin of COVID infected persons.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/open-temporary-cremation-grounds-says-kumaraswamy/article34397488.ece
24 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Graduates ward off ‘evil eye’ for a living as pandemic robs them of jobs||Kiran, a B.Tech graduate from a forest-fringe village in Narayanavanam mandal in Chittoor district, was happy after getting a job at a supermarket in Bengaluru. Being the sole bread winner of his family, this job meant everything to him. The nation-wide lockdown induced by the coronavirus pandemic last year dashed his hopes as he lost his job. However, he resumed his job after the situation eased. But he lost it again after Bengaluru emerged a COVID hotspot during the second wave of pandemic and he had to return to his native village. Not left with any option, he joined Ravi, his friend at village and a school dropout as an assistant. The new job is ‘trainee dishti remover’ and the salary Rs. 2,000 per week. The ‘dishti removal’ ritual is high in demand on Fridays, Sundays and Amavasyas in his locality. “I can try for some other job. But it is a long process with no guarantee and I have to run my family. It is my prime responsibility is to support my parents, and two unmarried sisters,” says Mr. Kiran. The partial lockdowns and night curfews elsewhere in metropolitan cities continue to throw many youth out of jobs and they return to their native places with nothing in their hands. Post-lockdown, many families and shops in both urban and semi-urban areas are eager to get the ‘dishti’ (evil eye) removed from their premises and this is one of the best opportunities the likes of Mr. Kiran have as of now. As against the accessibility of a dozen men to perform ‘dishti removal’ in the limits of municipal corporations such as Tirupati or Chittoor and buzzing towns like Madanapalle, Puttur, Nagari or Srikalahasti, the COVID predicament is prompted the prople from Satyavedu to Kuppam, along the Chittoor-Tamil Nadu border, to perform the ritual. “Several small businesses have been closed due to pandemic. Getting job at new firms is far cry. My friend has initiated me into dishti removal,” says Venkat (21), who completed his Intermediate from Satyavedu mandal. Many graduates are becoming assistants for the rituals in the rural side of Chittoor district, after losing hope of migrating to Chennai or Bengaluru.   ‘Stop-gap arrangement’ “More people want to perform the ritual as the pandemic is rearing its ugly head. It is better to do this than sitting at home idle. Of course, it is a stop-gap arrangement. I will start look for jobs as the COVID impact subsides a little,” says Narasimha (26), a B.Com graduate from K.V.B. Puram mandal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/graduates-ward-off-evil-eye-for-a-living-as-pandemic-robs-them-of-jobs/article34398367.ece

With the new cases, the active cases shot up to 1,1356. The District Police are gearing up to clamp night curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. from Saturday. The police officials at Satyavedu, Nagari, Karveti Nagaram, Chittoor, Palamaner and Kuppam circles, which share borders with Tamil Nadu, and the circles of Madanapalle and Punganur bordering Karnataka have intensified surveillance on public transport on the inter-State routes. Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar said that a top priority would be given to make the people travelling in public transport system wear masks, failing which fine would be imposed. Random inspection The SP appealed to the senior citizens and those with co-morbid conditions to avoid travel unless it was an emergency. “Random inspections will be done at public places to check the adherence to the COVID protocols which will be enforced strictly at shopping malls, supermarkets and cinema halls to prevent congestion and violation of social distancing norms,” Mr. Senthil Kumar said. Meanwhile, the COVID Task Force officials who visited public places deplored that despite awareness being created on wearing mask, the COVID norms such as social distancing were being grossly violated at weekly shandies in the rural and semi-urban areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chittoor-sees-5-deaths-1885-cases-in-a-day/article34397546.ece
24 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||ACB arrests former Telugu Desam MLA and Sangam Dairy chief Dhulipalla||Former TDP MLA from Ponnur and chairman of Sangam Dairy Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar was arrested on Friday by a team of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) police at his native Chintalapudi village of Ponnur mandal. A strong posse of about 100 police personnel, who included the local police, took him into custody in early hours after serving a notice on him under Section 50 (2) of the CrPC. Earlier, the ACB had registered cases under Sections 13 (1), C and D of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and IPC Sections 408, 409, 418, 420, 465, 471 and 120-B read with 34 against Mr. Narendra, the then chairman of Guntur District Milk Producers’ Cooperative Union Limited, P. Gopala Krishnan, former MD, and M. Gurunadham, former District Cooperative Officer. “An inquiry initiated into the functioning of Sangam Dairy showed various financial and administrative irregularities under the chairmanship of Mr. Narendra in connivance with others. The allegations against Mr. Narendra are serious and the material available prima facie indicated abuse of official position, misappropriation of government assets for personal use, and various other offences,” said a press release by the ACB. The dairy had been established as a Mutually Aided Cooperative Society in 1977 and was a success story with a string of innovations. The dairy had farmers from Guntur, Prakasam and Krishna districts as its shareholders. In 2013, the management’s decision to bring the dairy under the Companies Act tuned controversial with with many party leaders too objecting to it. However, Mr. Narendra stuck to his stand. Soon after the YSRCP came to power in 2019, a section of ruling party had begun alleging several irregularities in the dairy. The ruling party leaders also alleged that the farmers were not being given bonus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/acb-arrests-former-telugu-desam-mla-and-sangam-dairy-chief-dhulipalla/article34398372.ece
24 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rs. 1,109 cr. given to SHG women under YSR Sunna Vaddi||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday said women empowerment was possible only when they improved their capacities. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was speaking after crediting Rs. 1,109 crore directly into the accounts of 1.02 crore women belonging to the self-help groups as interest reimbursement under the ‘YSR Sunna Vaddi’ scheme. The government was committed to empowering women, and had rolled out schemes such as Sunna Vaddi, Aasara, Cheyutha, and Jeva Kranthi to strengthen women in all aspects, he said. This year too the government paid the interest amount to women who had taken loans from banks, he added. He said the SHG women had been burdened with over Rs. 3,000 crore penal interest. The previous previous government had not waived off their loans as promised during the 2014 elections, he alleged. Unlike the previous government, the YSRCP government had credited Rs. 1,400 crore under the ‘YSR Sunna Vaddi’ scheme in the first year of forming the government benefiting over 87 lakh women, the Chief Minister said. The number of SHGs under the scheme increased to 9.34 lakh from 8.71 lakh, he added. Nominated posts The Chief Minister said that registration of houses was also done in the name of women. Similarly, a law was enacted allotting 50% of the nominated posts to women. The government had allotted over 60% posts in the recent municipal elections to women, he said. To ensure the safety of women, 18 Disha police stations had been set up across the State, he said. Under the YSR Cheyutha scheme, a financial assistance of Rs. 18,750 was being given annually to women aged above 45 and belonging to the BC, SC, ST and minority communities at an expenditure of Rs. 4,604 crore, the Chief Minister said. Also, Rs. 6,792 crore had been spent on the YSR Aasara scheme. Besides, the government had entered into agreements with the multinational companies such as ITC, P&G, and Amul for providing business opportunities to women, he added.

24 April 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Many priests go virtual to perform funeral rites||In strict adherence to social distancing norms due to the spread of COVID, priests are performing Antyesti (last sacrifice) or funeral rites and 13th day rituals of the departed virtually. The priests are now staying away from cremation grounds, and also the houses of the deceased, and instead taking to video calling to perform the rituals. Some elderly priests, however, are going to the crematoria on condition that they complete the formalities only if there were a few people, not more than 15. Some are asking the ‘yajaman’ (who leads the ceremonies on instructions from priests) to carry out the rituals on the river bank or at functional halls. “The young priests are telling the family members of the dead that they would command the instructions on voice or video call, while some hapless, not-so-tech savvy elderly people are visiting in person and performing the Karma Kanda and other rituals by sitting in a far corner,” Telangana Archaka Samakhya working president Gangu Upendra Sharma said. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Sharma said that there was a huge demand for purohits amid the rising number of COVID-19 deaths in Telangana. Due to lack of demand for pujas in the ongoing Mudhami days (inauspicious days), purohits are unable to find any other work either, he said. There are over 6.40 lakh purohits in Telangana. Of them, only 50,000 perform Karma Kandas, while the rest practice auspicious pujas. With purohitam being the only source of income for many, they are left with no option but to attend the Karma Kandas during the pandemic as well, he said. “Or else, how will they run the house, pay for their children’s education and meet the family expenditure. This is their only life skill through which they can earn money,” he said. He demanded the State government to support the priests as majority of them are from lower-middle class background and unable to meet the daily needs. “For the past one year, our lives have become miserable. With hardly any source of income, some are unable to eat a single meal in a day, while many are risking their lives for a couple of thousands, and ending up paying lakhs in the hospitals,” the working president said. Raghunath Sharma, a pandit from Ramanthapur, said that in the last couple of days, he performed more than six funeral rites with a fear of contracting the deadly virus. “Being the sole bread-winner in the family, I’m helpless but to go out and make money,” he said. “My grandfather passed away a few weeks ago due to COVID-19, and the priest gave puja instructions to my father and uncle over the phone and performed the rituals,” a 23-year-old man from ECIL said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/many-priests-go-virtual/article34398138.ece

24 April 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||UNDP to probe ‘destruction’ of Kakinada mangrove cover||Following allegations of non-compliance with its Social and Environmental Standards, the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) Social and Environmental Compliance Unit (SECU) has intensified its investigation into the destruction of the mangrove cover on the Kakinada coast. GCF project The Democratic Traditional Fishers Workers’ Forum and the Fridays for Future Andhra Pradesh had registered their petitions with the UNDP, which admitted the case (No. SECU 0014) in the context of its Rs. 298-crore Green Climate Fund (GCF) project. During the summer of 2020, the State government authorities had allegedly destroyed the mangrove cover that was spread over nearly 100 acres for providing housing for the poor under the ‘Pedalandariki Illu’ scheme. The GCF project, Enhancing Climate Resilience of India’s Coastal Communities (2019-25) aimed at conserving and restoring the mangrove ecosystem by offering livelihood for the vulnerable communities. The Godavari estuary was one of the 25 targeted ecosystems spread over Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Maharashtra under the project that would soon be launched in the State. The documents of the case accessed by The Hindu state that the “aim of the compliance review is to make recommendations to bring the UNDP-supported activity into compliance with the Social and Environmental Standards and other relevant policies and procedures, mitigate any harm that results from the breach of UNDP’s social and environmental commitments, and help identify avenues to prevent similar compliance concerns in the future.” The timeline of the investigation mandates a field mission by the end of this year under which visits would be made to Kakinada, Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary, and other locations to survey the physical site, conduct meetings with the complainants and other stakeholders, and gather relevant evidence. The UN body has set a target of completing the investigation by early next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/undp-to-probe-destruction-of-kakinada-mangrove-cover/article34397542.ece

The alleged ill-treatment of the man at the hands of Coast Guard officials came to light when the accused in the drug haul case were produced before K. Biju Menon, Additional Sessions Judge 1, Thiruvananthapuram, on Friday. The burns victim, identified as L.Y. Nandana, 46, of Nakulugamuwa, Sri Lanka, complained to the court that the officials made him lie in a supine position on a heated iron plate used for cooking in the patrolling vessel of the Coast Guard. Arms too seized The court, in its order, noted that the accused had suffered severe burns on his back and was not in a position to even wear a shirt. Nandana was among the six arrested by the officials in a case related to the seizure of a commercial quantity of heroin along with AK-47 rifles and ammunition from a Sri Lankan fishing vessel off the coast of Vizhinjam in Thiruvananthapuram, a few days ago. The accused were originally produced before the court through videoconferencing.

The company, in its petition, pointed out that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had investigated the case relating to the contracts executed between the company and the Kerala government for the renovation and modernisation of the three hydroelectric projects of Pallivasal, Sengulam and Panniar and filed a chargesheet in 2009. In fact, all the allegations against the company related to the period prior to January 17, 2003, that is, before the commencement of the PMLA. Therefore, the transactions that took place during the period did not come under the purview of the PMLA. The petition said the company had no role whatsoever to play with the contracts and the transactions that took place between 1995 and 1998. In fact, these transactions were directly handled by the company from Canada.

24 April 2021||PALAKKAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||CBI team records statements of Walayar victims’ parents||A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team investigating the mysterious deaths of two minor sisters of Walayar reached the children’s home at Attappalam, near here, on Friday and recorded the statements of their parents. The team led by Dy.SP T.P. Ananthakrishnan examined the house where the girls were found hanging on different dates four years ago. The team had already collected the statements of the police officers who had originally investigated the case. The CBI team also collected all available records from a special investigation team set up by the State government. The CBI took over the sensational case following a directive by the High Court. The State government and the victims’ mother had approached the High Court demanding an inquiry by the CBI after a POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act) court here set free all the accused for want of evidence in October 2019. The exoneration of the accused by the POCSO court had kicked up a furore, questioning the honesty of the police officers who investigated the case as well as the efficiency of the prosecution in getting conviction for the accused. The case, in which rape and murder were alleged, had sparked an outrage. The government in January this year formed a special investigation team led by Superintendent of Police (Railways) R. Nishanthini to reinvestigate the case. Amidst continuing protests by the victims’ mother under the banner of the Walayar Action Forum, the High Court on March 19 asked the CBI to take over the case. Ms. Nishanthini’s special investigation team handed over the case files to the CBI on March 26. The CBI formally took over the case on April 1 by registering two separate cases before the POCSO court here. When the elder sister was found hanging in her house on January 13, 2017, the younger one was found hanging in the same manner on March 4, 2017. Pradeep Kumar M., one of the five accused in the case, committed suicide on November 4 last year. He was found hanging in his house at Cherthala.  The team examines the house where the girls were found hanging four years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cbi-team-records-statements-of-walayar-victims-parents/article34397499.ece

24 April 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Drug shortage hits patients||As the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic spikes, shortage of drugs in the market, is hitting the patients, especially those who getting themselves treated at home, hard. While shortage of drugs such as Remdesivir is a known fact and government is regulating it to see that it is not sold in the black-market, what surprises people is the shortage of even common drugs. “I had to go to at least 10 shops to buy a pack of Deksel syrup and Zincovit tablets,” said Srinivasa Rao, who stays in MVP Colony. Similarly, there is a shortage of other common drugs that are used for treatment of COVID such as Fabiflu and Docycycline.According to the owner of a medical shop in Seethammadhara area, the drugs that are prescribed for COVID treatment are similar and is being circulated in the social media. “Since the cases are on the rise, there is a panic buying of drugs,” he said. ‘More virulent’ The second wave is in full blown stage and according to the health officials, the surge will continue to rise till the end of May. “We may peak by May-end and it is expected that we may surpass the last year’s tally of July-August,” said District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar. The health officials confirm that the double mutant virus is more virulent and its propensity to infect people is much faster. “We have noticed that even a minor interaction with a positive person can infect the other. The strain may be a bit weaker when it comes to causing harm, but it is definitely more infectious,” said Dr. Sudhakar.Another aspect that has been noticed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the district health officials, is that the impact of the virus on people who have been administered the first or both the doses of vaccines, is generally mild or weak. “This proves that taking the jab and following the COVID appropriate behaviour is the only way to beat the virus,” said District Collector V. Vinay Chand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/drug-shortage-hits-patients/article34398475.ece

Except for two Kerala districts, all others had over a thousand new cases each, while Ernakulam and Kozhikode added 4,000 cases each.

24 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Donations pour in for free vaccination drive||The sense of solidarity of Keralites in times of crises was on display on Friday as the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) witnessed a spike in donations from the public on Friday with celebrities too joining the cause to fund the State’s free COVID-19 vaccination efforts by displaying certificates of their donation in social media. At 10.45 p.m on Friday, fuelled by #vaccinechallenge, the single day’s donations to the CMDRF stood at Rs. 2.04 crore from 9,166 individuals or groups, with the numbers shooting up every minute. On Thursday, the contributions stood at Rs. 51.9 lakh. No govt. call The CMDRF became a major platform of public expression of solidarity during the floods of 2018 and 2019. After the outbreak of the pandemic too, contributions happened in a big way. But, compared to the organic, people-generated campaign now, the previous ones were initiated after calls from the government. Earlier in the day, filmmaker Aashiq Abu posted a certificate of his donation on his Facebook page, leading to responses from his fans, who posted certificates of their own donations. In another Facebook post, music composer Gopi Sundar posted his certificate and wrote, “This is not a show-off by any means, rather it’s an inspiration to help the needy people. ... I hope that at least few of you will be inspired by my action and contribute generously to the CM’s relief fund. Nothing is impossible when we are willing to stand for everyone”.  Making his contribution, actor Santhosh Keezhattoor wrote, “If we don’t stand together now, when would we? ... Let us put aside all political differences and stand with the country. My mother and father have taken the vaccine. There are thousands of suffering people who also need to get the vaccine”. A call for donations from vlogger Vinod Narayanan, who runs the popular page Ballatha Pahayan, also got a lot of response. #vaccinechallenge was initiated organically by social media users in Kerala on Wednesday with many of them posting certificates of their contributions on the respective pages. Protest against Centre Quite a few of them marked it as their protest against the vaccine policy of the Centre, which left the State governments, already in dire financial straits because of the pandemic, to shoulder the burden of vaccine costs, while some others said their contribution is a mark of appreciation to the State government for reiterating that the vaccine will be provided free of cost to all citizens. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan acknowledged the fresh contributions coming in from the public without any official call from the government during his press conference on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/donations-pour-in-for-free-vaccination-drive/article34397490.ece
24 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Hospitals plead helplessness as COVID patients gasp for oxygen||Fifty-three-year-old Krishna Rao (name changed), a resident of Ramavarappadu here in Andhra Pradesh, tested positive for COVID-19 three days ago. He went into home quarantine. He reached out to the doctors when he started experiencing shortness. But they pleaded helplessness, and suggested that he make his own arrangements for oxygen, while promising paramedical support. His is not an isolated case. Hospitals in the city continue to grapple with oxygen shortage, leading to anxiety among patients and their relatives. The demand for oxygen has gone up phenomenally in both government and private hospitals. It used to be 2 to 3 KL per day at the Government General Hospital (GGH) in Vijayawada. The supplier would do the refill once in four days. “Now, 20-30 KL of oxygen is being used every day,” said a senior doctor at the hospital on condition of anonymity. Indian Medical Association (IMA) State general secretary Garlapati Nanda Kishore said they had asked the IMA members and the medical fraternity to postpone all elective or planned surgeries. Noted cardiologist and IMA, Vijayawada chapter, secretary Karthik Tummala says there was a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand. “There are many industries that use oxygen on a large scale. The government can divert that oxygen to save lives,” he said.  While this is so, the price of medical oxygen has gone through the roof. A 50 KL cylinder normally costs Rs. 450. Its price had touched Rs. 750 during the first wave. It is now priced at Rs. 1,350, excluding transportation cost. Even if the hospital is willing to pay, there are no supplies. The patients’ bill on oxygen alone is in the range of Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 7,000 per day. The Telangana government has pressed two military aircraft (C-17) into service to bring oxygen tankers from Odisha. Each aircraft will carry nine tankers and together they will airlift 150 tonnes of medical oxygen from Rourkela to the State. Threat of closure Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Friday appealed to the Centre to allocate more oxygen and Remidesivir to the State, as the number of COVID-19 cases has seen an exponential increase. Briefing Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a virtual meeting of Chief Ministers on Friday, Mr. Yediyurappa said the current positivity rate in the State was 16%. While 500 tonnes of oxygen had been consumed across the State on Thursday, 1,142 tonnes was estimated to be the demand by April 25 and this was likely to go up to 1,471 tonnes by April 30. “However, the Centre has allocated only 300 tonnes to Karnataka. If the same situation continues, several healthcare centres will have to be closed down,” he told the Prime Minister, according to a note from the Chief Minister’s office. He also wanted two lakh doses of Remdesivir over the next 10 days.

24 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Hospitality industry left reeling by second wave of pandemic||The hospitality industry, which had a sigh of relief four to five months ago as the business started resuming after the lockdown induced by coronavirus pandemic, is a worried lot again over second wave. The rapid surge in infection has already started showing impact on the occupancy in the hotels in the city. Hoteliers say that the guests are cancelling the advance bookings at a rapid speed, leaving no scope for the them to make alternative plans. Some star hotels are witnessing a huge fall in the occupancy, and the bookings are not even 10% of their respective total capacities. In some cases, with a great difficulty, the occupancy was close to 50%. Now, the occupancy has come down by 25% of the existing bookings. For instance, not even 15 rooms out of every 40 are being booked. Vijayawada Hotel Owners’ Association president Ravi Kumar Parvataneni says that the overnight stays at hotels has also come down. Private transportation With the spurt in infection, people are preferring to travel in private transportation and avoid hotel stay as far as possible. The hotels have slashed the tariffs too. Though, the hotels are not making breakeven, the industry is expecting that the occupancy might increase in the days to come. “For the last three to four days, the cancellations have been on the rise. It indicates that people are shelving their travel plans. We are clueless,” he says. On the other hand, Mr. Parvataneni says, the overheads such as power, salaries and etc remain same even as the occupancy has gone down. The restaurants attached to the hotels are not working with full capacity as the dining out concept has come down during the second wave. “People are not visiting restaurants. The industry is bleeding. A hotelier, on an average, incurs a loss of Rs. 10 lakh to Rs. 15 lakh per month due to poor occupancy,” says a hotelier, who did not want to be named. ‘Dual challenge’ Mr. Ravi Kumar says that the hospitality industry is facing a dual challenge—impact of poor occupancy and protecting the staff from infection. Accommodation for staff “As most of the staff are below the age of 45 years, getting them vaccinated is also not possible. Invariably, there will be interaction between the COVID positive people and the staff. To minimise the spread of the virus, the hotels are providing the staff accommodation and other facilities,” Mr. Ravi Kumar says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hospitality-industry-left-reeling-by-second-wave-of-pandemic/article34397540.ece
24 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||APSCHE plans ways to instil reading habit among students||Reading is a sure way of boosting creativity and imagination, and it also helps to improve memory, vocabulary and the desire to achieve one’s goals, besides lowering stress levels, said K. Hemachandra Reddy, Chairperson of the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE), here on Friday. Speaking after the launch of an innovative practice of ‘Talk the Book’ by the Council on the occasion of World Book Day, in online mode, he said it was unfortunate that a large chunk of the present generation had not been relishing the joys of reading. He said as part of ‘Talk the Book’, reviews of good books would be done on YouTube. “The idea is to inspire the younger generation to read the particular book after listening to the review, thereby inculcating in them a reading habit,” Mr. Hemachandra Reddy said. Mr. Reddy said prominent academicians and non-academicians would be invited to review books every Friday from 11 a.m. to 12 noon. Managements of all higher educational institutions would be asked to ensure that their students listen to the book review. Both Telugu and English books would be taken up for review, he said. First teacher Director of School Education Vadrevu Chinaveerabhadrudu reviewed Toli Upadhyayudu , translated from The First Teacher, a Russian book written by Chingiz Aitmatov. The book speaks about the significant role played by the first teacher in every individual’s life. Mr. Chinaveerabhadrudu said a good teacher should identify the needs of a student and become his/her role model.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/apsche-plans-ways-to-instil-reading-habit-among-students/article34397551.ece

With the focus on ‘remote learning’, he said efforts were being made to provide computers and laptops to 130 crore people in the State. Education Minister A. Suresh said universities should align their teaching and processes with technological advancements in order to prepare future graduates for work. He said the collaboration with Microsoft will help the State build a skilled workforce that could meet the needs of the jobs in high demand.

24 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu sees a conspiracy||TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu has condemned the arrest of former MLA and Sangam Dairy chairman Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar. “The arrest is illegal. It is a part of the larger conspiracy to destroy Sangam Dairy,” Mr. Naidu alleged in a statement on Friday. Mr. Naidu also alleged that the former MLA was arrested without giving prior notice. “It is clear that the State government is determined to hand over Sangam Dairy to the Gujarat-based Amul. The local dairies are being crippled deliberately in order to benefit Amul,” the TDP president alleged. “Mr. Narendra has been rendering valuable services to Sangam Dairy as its chairman. The local farmers are shareholders in the dairy. There is a systematic attack on all the companies and dairies in the State ever since Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy became the Chief Minister,” he alleged. Mr. Naidu demanded the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Narendra and also withdrawal of the “false cases” against him. “The government should set aside its political agenda and protect Sangam Dairy and the interests of thousands of farmers dependent on it,” he demanded. “There is zero development in the last two years. Suppression of the opposition leaders is continuing unabated. The illegal arrests of the TDP leaders are just a part of the YSRCP tactics to divert the attention of the people from the corruption in the government. Party leaders K. Atchannaidu and Kollu Ravindra were wrongfully arrested ,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-sees-a-conspiracy/article34398373.ece

As part of the key decisions taken by the Group of Ministers appointed by the government to control the spread of the virus, the Minister cleared the way for appointment of additional staff on contract basis for a period of six months. The move will facilitate increased number of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) tests at the VRDLs on a daily basis. The government had in the past recruited 533 staff in three phases to conduct the tests in the medical colleges. In addition, 113 more technical staff had been added now. The Minister said the idea was to ramp up the tests and produce the result in the shortest possible time. The VRDLs are equipped with research scientists, research assistants, lab technicians, data entry operators and office subordinates. “At present, more than 40,000 RTPCR tests are being conducted daily. With the recruitment of additional staff, the number of these tests can be increased to more than 60,000,” he said. The Minister said that the number of TruNat testing would also be increased in the days to come. The RTPCR tests would be conducted at all the government medical colleges in the State, besides two private medical colleges – Asram Medical College in Eluru and Maharaja Medical College in Vizianagaram, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-moves-to-ramp-up-covid-19-tests/article34398377.ece

24 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Close schools completely’||Leaders of the Andhra Pradesh Teachers’ Federation on Friday urged Education Minister A. Suresh to close the schools completely in view of the sharp spike in the number of COVID cases. In a statement, federation's president K. Bhanu Murthy and general secretary P. Panduranga Varaprasad Rao said although schools were closed for students of Classes 1 to 9, teachers in the higher secondary schools had to attend duties to conduct classes for Class 10 students, amidst the raging virus. The rising graph of the case-load in the State was a matter of serious concern, they said. The leaders pointed out that more than 15 teachers had died after contracting the virus in the last 15 days in Guntur district alone and said conducting classes amidst rising number of cases would put both, teachers and students at risk. They said the higher classes also be given holidays and the government should consider postponement of the 10th class examinations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aptf-demands-complete-shutdown-of-schools/article34398361.ece

24 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bodies pile up at Chavulamadum||Though the official death count due to COVID -19 has been six over the last three days, sources say that the actual count has been much higher. One indication for saying that is the higher number of bodies piling up at Chavulamadum, which is the official cremation ground for COVID-related bodies. But according to official sources in the district administration, the number being quoted in a few media is exaggerated, but at the same time they say that bodies had piled up during the last two days at the cremation ground, as a few bodies were not disposed of from the VIMS, due to various logistic issues. Most of the bodies that were held up at VIMS were from Odisha and other districts and do not pertain to Visakhapatnam and a few of them were non-COVID related deaths. But all the bodies were wrapped up in body bags, according to protocol. The number being claimed cannot be kept under wraps and there may be a discrepancy of one or two numbers but not the number that is being claimed in some section of the media, said a senior officer from the district administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bodies-pile-up-at-chavulamadum/article34398478.ece

Y. Saritha (33) and her son Chetan (4) were found dead in their house under suspicious circumstances at Marikavalasa under PM Palem police station limits on Thursday evening. According to PM Palem Inspector Ravi Kumar, Saritha, hailing from Sompeta in Srikakulam district, shifted to the city in 2015. Her husband Ravi ran a restaurant business but was mired in losses. Saritha, who had also taken some loans, was struggling to repay the money. Depressed over her financial condition, Saritha decided to take the extreme step, police said. The bodies of the woman and her son were discovered by her elder son Shashank (10), who then called his father who was at work. Police have recovered a suicide note from the spot. A further investigation is on. Those struggling with suicidal thoughts or depression are urged to call the 100 helpline for free counselling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/woman-killed-son-before-ending-her-life-say-police/article34398474.ece

Speaking to the media Friday, Mr. Ayyanna Patrudu said it was nothing but an attempt to loot, as the YSRCP government which said it could save Rs. 780 crore through reverse tendering after coming to power. He alleged that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his party leaders were looting the State like Alibaba and 40 thieves. He expressed concern that people seem to be more worried about the immediate gains through welfare schemes than the future of their children in the State. He alleged the YSRCP government has more interest in commissions than on completion of the projects. He said that when Mr. Chandrababu Naidu was the Chief Minister officials were on their toes to speed up the project works.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Mortal Kombat’ movie review: A sluggish reboot that has no Mortal Kombat tournament||Those who have played Mortal Kombat in their teens know that there is little in terms of story the video game has to offer. We all picked up the console to gore our opponents and then to hear the immortal words: “Finish him!” But when you still go ahead with a film adaptation, it doesn’t hurt to try. Directed by Simon McQuoid — a reboot of the franchise that brought us a couple of gory films in the ‘90s — the latest film adaptation is no different.  Mortal Kombat begins in 17th Century Japan where Hanzo Hasashi (Hiroyuki Sanada) and his family are slaughtered to death by Bi Han/Sub Zero (Joe Taslim). As fate would have it, Hasashi’s child survives the carnage and is taken into safe custody by Lord Raiden (Tadanobu Asano). Fast forward to the present day and we see Cole Young (Lewis Tan), the protagonist and a descendant of Hasashi’s; Cole is a mixed martial artist past his prime, and he has the dragon mark on his body (the game’s logo) but he thinks it is a birthmark and doesn’t realise its potential until one day Sub Zero returns to Earth realm to eliminate the remaining champions ahead of the next Mortal Kombat tournament. Making a video game adaptation work on screen is a tricky proposition. Mortal Kombat starts off with an obvious disadvantage in that there cannot be a more bland story arc. It is basically the stuff you have seen Avengers do in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — a group of renegade personalities coming together to save the world — but without an emotional hold on the audience.  Mortal Kombat just ambles on — from scene-to-scene and from one ordinary dialogue to another — before we get to another pointless action sequence. The lone bright spot seems to be Kano (a very funny Josh Lawson). To make things worse, there isn’t actually a Mortal Kombat tournament that happens because Shang Tsung, the evil boss from The Outworld, wants to kill all champions before the tournament can happen: which seems odd especially when The Outworld has won nine out of 10 previous tournaments with the Earth realm. Lacking confidence much?

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||A problematic take on a complex character, blinded by its incessant need for glorification||“When I was the empress, the kingdom was rosy,” quips Sheela Birnstiel, while reminiscing on camera her glory days as Ma Anand Sheela, an influential aide to the spiritual leader Osho, and a titular figure in the latter’s multi-million dollar empire. The self-proclaimed imperatrix was once convicted for infecting salad bars in Oregon’s Wasco County with salmonella to influence a local election. Even her own mentor accused her of arson, wire-tapping and attempted murder among other heinous crimes. And yet, in Netflix’s latest documentary titled Searching for Sheela, she is presented as an unlikely feminist icon, a fiery go-getter who merely fell prey to an obnoxious scandal. The one-hour long documentary film chronicles Sheela’s return to India after a hiatus of 35 years. The fiery on-screen presence that tormented Oregononians decades ago, is now a sprightly old woman eager to reconnect with her roots, while being courted by affluent Indians. On-screen, she is in total control of her narrative, even when faced with a barrage of awkward questions from journalists like Barkha Dutt and Shoma Chaudhury, putting on display her brazen personality which has garnered many admirers over the years. Despite that, Searching for Sheela is most effective when Birnstiel lets her guard drop, offering us a peek into her more vulnerable side. This happens while she is visiting her childhood home in Gujarat’s Vadodara. Brimming with nostalgia, she sheds a tear or two for the past she left behind, for greener pastures abroad. Her emotions seem genuine enough to shock even her harshest critics. Searching for Sheela fails to live up to its name. Rather than trying to find the true nature of the controversial figure and what drove her to commit multiple felonies, the film barely manages to scratch the surface, leaving bare its hollow exterior despite concerted efforts to conceal it within a shiny facade, which at first glance might intrigue its views but is sure to leave a bitter aftertaste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-problematic-take-on-a-complex-character-blinded-by-its-incessant-need-for-glorification/article34398400.ece

24 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Death in the middle of night, no place to preserve bodies||Activists and members of NGOs who are taking the bodies of people dying of COVID to crematoriums have flagged an issue which could blow up in the coming days if the Telangana government do not design a system to address it. As crematoriums do not take bodies after 6 p.m. or 7 p.m., family members of the deceased are left clueless when a few private hospitals ask them to take the body late in the evening or night. According to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), crematoriums work from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and some from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. A few small private hospitals, most of which do not have the facility to preserve bodies, are asking family members to take the bodies at the earliest. If a patient dies late in the evening, family members or friends have to find some place to keep the body as they cannot take their dead dear one home. Neighbours too, might raise objections if the body is kept at home. The NGO workers and activists said that a place has to be designated either at crematoriums, government mortuaries, or other places to preserve the bodies throughout the night. “Since there is no such place currently, a few families facing this kind of a situation are switching off their phones so that private hospitals cannot reach them at odd hours. Some are delaying bill payment, or keeping the body somewhere without informing anyone. If the issue is not addressed soon, authorities might see family members grieving next to bodies by the roadside,” alerted a member of an NGO on condition of anonymity. Though only a few such tragic incidents have come to the notice of these activists so far, steps can be taken to avoid more such situations. “We tried to call Gandhi Hospital mortuary to inquire if the body can be preserved there. But there was no response. Having a point of contact to keep the bodies at government mortuaries too, can work as a solution,” said Sai Teja Katragadda, member of NGO Feed The Needy. Space constraint Private hospitals pointed out that they have space constraint to keep the bodies beyond a certain period. Ironically, even the big corporate hospitals have very small facilities to keep the bodies in their mortuaries. At the most, a maximum of five to six bodies can be accommodated. The freezer boxes can keep three bodies and the rest are kept inside the mortuary for two to three hours till the formalities are completed. According to a representative of a private hospital, their chain of hospitals have facility to keep six bodies in each of their branches. “Once a COVID-19 patient dies, immediately the family members are alerted and asked to get a ‘No Objection Certificate’ from the nearest police station under whose jurisdiction the hospital comes. The hospital simultaneously informs the local police station also,” the representative said. The hospitals maintain that as per COVID protocols, they are sending bodies even in the night. “We are also helpless as the mortal remains have to be shifted immediately,” sources said. A senior doctor running a hospital in Secunderabad admitted that very few hospitals above 100 beds would have mortuary facilities. “In the event of COVID death in private hospitals, it takes a couple of hours to complete the formalities as the relatives have to be informed. Till they come, the body depending on the condition is embalmed and kept in a corner and in some cases, freezer boxes are arranged till the family takes possession. Even small, medium and big hospitals are ill-equipped to handle bodies,” he remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/death-in-the-middle-of-night-no-place-to-preserve-bodies/article34398228.ece
24 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Explain your preparedness for vaccination: High Court||Telangana High Court on Friday instructed the State government to file a report explaining its preparedness to administer vaccination to all persons above 18 years of age from May 1 in the light of Centre’s announcement. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy directed the Principal Home Secretary to file a status report by Tuesday with details of how it was planning administration of vaccine to inmates of prisons and old age homes along with the destitute in shelter homes and open places. The plan of action should be presented to the court by Monday. When the Health Secretary sought time since the data needed to be gathered from district Collectors, the bench said: “Why cannot the administration work when this court is working late in the night to hand over its orders to the State so that it can implement the directions?” Chief Justice Hima Kohli said the First Court (bench headed by CJ) would work during summer vacation and keep tab on steps taken by the State to address people’s woes during the pandemic. “...because lives of the citizen and their health are important to the court”, the CJ said. The bench expressed dissatisfaction over the government not stepping up the percentage of RT-PCR tests despite specific direction issued during the previous hearing. Barring GHMC and surrounding districts, RT-PCR tests were done on much lower scale. In majority of the districts, Rapid Antigen tests (RaT) constituted 80% of tests, the bench said. Expressing concern over the recent 198 deaths due to COVID-19 in past few days, the bench directed the government to ramp up RT-PCR tests in Nirmal, Nizamabads, Yadadri Bhongir, Mancherial and Kama Reddy districts. The bench directed the government to publicise the steps taken by government to provide medication to Kumbh Mela returnees. It wanted the government to furnish details of persons manning 108 and 104 call centres, number of ambulances earmarked to attend to the patients, details of calls received received per day. Referring to the government orders on gathering of people at malls, inside cinema halls and other public places in November, 2020 cannot be accepted in the present situation of witnessing high incidence of COVID-19 positive cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/explain-your-preparedness-for-vaccination-high-court/article34398241.ece

24 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||It’s a mad rush for hospital beds||The scramble for beds, particularly those with oxygen and ventilator facilities, both in government and private hospitals, to treat coronavirus patients, goes on unabated in Hyderabad, irrespective of the statistics being given by the State government daily. A senior journalist having good contacts in the corridors of power had to run from pillar to post about 10 days ago to get himself admitted to a hospital after testing positive. His plea for allotment of a bed was turned down by several corporate hospitals and with the intervention of those in power, he was admitted to a super speciality hospital in the public sector. The other day, another person had to struggle hard to get his brother admitted to a corporate hospital for COVID treatment, in spite of having good liaison in the circles of power. The trauma being faced by the lesser mortals for getting their kin or themselves admitted to hospitals for COVID treatment is even more and endless. The instances of COVID patients being referred to Hyderabad from districts breathing their last while waiting outside hospitals for getting a bed allotted are also on the rise, although sparsely for now. On the other hand, Minister for Health Eatala Rajender said that there was no scarcity of beds at least for now in spite of the influx of patients from neighbouring States to private hospitals here. The web link provided by the State government for the real-time information on bed status indicated that 25,805 beds were available in government and private hospitals in the State at 1.04 p.m. on Friday. According to online information, the availability of ICU (ventilator/CPAP) beds was 990 in government hospitals and 2,761 in private hospitals. Similarly, the availability of oxygen beds was 3,466 and 3,833, respectively and that of regular beds was 4,443 and 10,312. On the ongoing vaccination drive in the State, the bulletin said that a total of 36,02,734 doses were administered to healthcare workers, frontline workers and the priority group of those aged above 45 years till 9 p.m. on April 22 from the beginning, including over 2.11 lakh doses on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/its-a-mad-rush-for-beds/article34398236.ece
24 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Governor seeks report on ULB polls||Amid concerns over deteriorating COVID situation in the State and the State Election Commission’s (SEC) decision to go ahead with Urban Local Body elections, Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan called up the SEC and asked him to submit a report. Sources said the Governor called up the SEC C. Parthasarathy to ascertain the ground situation and asked him to submit a report on the areas bound for polls. The Governor’s call was apparently based on serious concerns raised by political parties on the elections and also media reports on the safety of people and poll staff. The State Election Commissioner explained the local arrangements planned for safe conduct of elections as per Election Commission’s guidelines and health department reports. The call further assumes significance with political parties repeatedly demanding postponement of elections through the media and also personally writing to the SEC. However, the SEC had been maintaining that the polls would be held as per schedule on April 30. Except the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), all the major political parties, including the Congress and the BJP, have openly called for postponement as there was an unprecedented spurt in COVID cases and were hospitals filled to the brim. They fear that the virus would further spread due to large gatherings during the election campaign meetings. They also cited how Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was infected after he participated in a public meeting in Halia before the Nagarjunasagar bypolls. Situation had been grim in all the poll-bound areas, including Khammam and Warangal Municipal Corporations. However, the SEC had been reluctant to reschedule the polls and the political parties had accused the SEC of blindly following the government’s directive on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/governor-seeks-report-on-ulb-polls/article34398246.ece

They served the boycott notice to the hospital’s superintendent on Friday. They have demanded adequate and safe protective gear to work as usage of the PPEs provided are leading to extreme exhaustion, and uncomfortable to work in harsh conditions. The summer temperatures are adding to the problem. The doctors sent photos of them drenched on sweat after removing PPEs. The second demand was to allow quarantine period after work since a few of them have already tested positive for coronavirus leading to drop in work force. “Further burdening without quarantine will lead to more losses. Accommodation and transport have not been provided since the past eight months forcing us to stay with families and increasing the risk to the family members. Parents of some senior resident doctors have been affected and some are critically ill. There is shortage of beds and oxygen supply outside to treat or admit the family members,” said members of the Telangana Senior Residents Doctors Association. They have demanded quarantine leave, accommodation and transport for COVID warriors, reserve a few beds for family members and senior residents working at the hospital, allotting Post Graduate doctors along with them to share the work burden.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/docs-threaten-to-boycott-duties-at-chest-hospital/article34398230.ece

In this scenario, NGOs and youth groups are stepping in to conduct the last rites of the patients, irrespective of religion.

Uttam Kumar Reddy has charged the State Election Commissioner (SEC) with endangering the lives of lakhs of voters in the two municipal corporations and five municipalities by blindly going ahead with the polls ignoring the dangerous situation due to COVID-19. In a letter to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, he sought her intervention in stopping the election process at the present point. “Since the Governor is the appointing authority of the State Election Commission (SEC) as per Article 243 in the Constitution of India, she should notice the unbecoming conduct and the highly biased manner in which the SEC of Telangana in conducting the elections,” he said.

The amount was spent for hiring an ambulance and a freezer for one night. After the COVID patient died at around 9 p.m. on Thursday, a private hospital at Chaitanyapuri had pressurised the family members to take the body since they do not have a mortuary. Left with no option, they contacted the NGO, ‘Feed The Needy’, which has resumed providing the last ride to the dead. Member of the organisation, Sai Teja Katragadda, said that since crematoriums do not take bodies after 6 p.m., they had to arrange a freezer. But the body in the freezer could not be taken home or kept out in the open at any place. “So, we hired an ambulance too. It costed us Rs. 32,000 to preserve the body for one night. The government should think of an alternative,” Mr. Sai Teja requested. Members of NGOs said that a few other families were also asked to take away bodies of their loved ones late evening or in the night and therefore, facing similar issues. Government hospitals, either have a mortuary, or are attached to a hospital having a mortuary. In case of private sector, major corporate hospitals have the facility to preserve 5-10 bodies. Private hospitals with 50 or less do not have the facilities.  Since crematoriums do not take bodies after 6 p.m., we had to arrange a freezer. But the body in the freezer could not be taken home or kept out in the open at any place. As a result, we hired an ambulance too.

Corona ward with 120 wards was ready and another isolation ward is being established at Surabhi Medical college. There is no shortage of oxygen, injections or PPE kits. State officials were requested to send another 30,000 vaccines,” said Mr Harish Rao. “There are about 1.6 lakh people who crossed 45 years and 1.4 lakh were already vaccinated. Remaining must be completed in the next tow days and they must be administered second dose of vaccination without any delay,” said the Minister adding that 13,000-litre liquid oxygen plant, one of the biggest in the State, was established in the district to meet any contingency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/people-implement-partial-lockdown/article34398414.ece

24 April 2021||GHAZIABAD,||Help pours in for COVID patients at gurdwara offering ‘Oxygen Langar’||Amidst the COVID-19 crisis that has gripped Delhi-NCR, a gurdwara in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram has started an “Oxygen Langar” to help patients with respiratory problems. The Shri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara, Indirapuram along with an NGO, Khalsa Help International, took up the initiative and started administering free oxygen on Thursday evening. By Friday evening, more than 700 patients had visited the “langar”. On Friday afternoon, a long queue of patients who were in dire need of oxygen was seen outside the gurdwara. There were arrangements made to provide oxygen support to patients who are unable to get out of their cars. Gurpreet Singh, head of the gurdwara committee, said COVID patients are struggling to get oxygen and their relatives are running pillar to post to arrange for cylinders. “With the help of volunteers, we are providing oxygen support to patients who can come to the gurdwara,” said Mr. Singh. Helpline number He added that people associated with gurdwara and other Samaritans have come forward in providing oxygen from their industries. They have also launched a helpline number — 9097041313 — via which people can book their slots. “We are not giving or refilling cylinders. We are asking the patients to come here at the Indirapuram gurdwara along with someone in a car and we will give them oxygen. Be it two, four, or eight hours, we will provide oxygen till the time the patient gets a bed at any hospital,” said Mr. Singh. People from East Delhi, Sahibabad and other parts of Ghaziabad rushed to gurdwara after they got to know about the facility. Sunita Seth said her husband required oxygen, but she was unable to manage a cylinder. “I dialed all helplines numbers that I found on social media but all in vain. My neighbour then told me about the oxygen facility at gurdwara and I rushed here with my husband. I am thankful to the gurdwara committee for providing oxygen support to her husband and other patients,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/help-pours-in-for-covid-patients-at-gurdwara-offering-oxygen-langar/article34397833.ece
24 April 2021||GURUGRAM,||Meghalaya Guv extends support to farmers’ stir||Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik on Friday wrote to Sangwan Khap president and Dadri Independent MLA Sombir Sangwan, extending support to the farmers’ agitation and condemning the attitude of the government towards the farmers. In the letter, Mr. Malik said that more than 300 farmers had lost their lives during the struggle, but the Union government did not express any regret. This, he said, was “cruel” and “condemnable”. He said that the government was trying to defame and derail the movement by not holding dialogue with the farmers. Mr. Malik said that he had made several efforts on this front as per the expectations of the Khaps. He said that he had suggested to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah that the genuine demands of the farmers be met and justice be done to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/meghalaya-guv-extends-support-to-farmers-stir/article34398210.ece
24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Non-COVID bodies being turned away||A large crowd of grieving families waited outside the Punjabi Bagh cremation ground on Friday to perform the last rites of their loved ones, some of whom had died of COVID-19. At noon, however, the cremation ground workers shut the main gate and informed: “ Ab normal bodies nahin lenge. Sirf COVID bodies lenge (We will not take bodies of those who have died of natural causes now)”. Long wait When the families — some of whom had been waiting for up to six hours — raised objections, another employee informed that they were merely following the new protocol introduced to cope with the sudden surge in deaths due to COVID-19. As many as 1,541 people have died due to the virus in the last week, according to official data. Deepak Kumar, 27, a resident of Mahatma Gandhi camp, had come to attend the last rites of his friend’s father. “We had come around 10 a.m. but they did not move the body till 1 p.m. They are collecting all the bodies and then cremating them in one go on separate pyres,” he said. The father had died of a heart attack, said Mr. Kumar, who was sitting with six friends. “There is no check on the number of people coming in with a body”. Roughly 15-16 bodies of people who have died of natural causes are cremated here daily, said workers. No check on crowd Mukesh Gupta, who had come for the cremation of his paternal uncle, complained no one was following social distancing rules. Many people were also seen not wearing masks. Pointing towards a large crowd of people trying to submit relevant documents to get a cremation token, Mr. Gupta said: “There is total chaos. My uncle died of a heart attack. We had come here at 7.30 a.m. but the token counter did not open till 10 a.m. It has been six hours and it is only now that they are starting the process.” One side of the cremation ground has been reserved for burning COVID-infected bodies. “But there are so many people here, there is no separation between the place where normal bodies are being burnt and the infected bodies are being processed,” said Mr. Gupta. Vijay, who had brought his brother-in-law’s body from a government hospital in Moti Nagar, said he has been running from pillar to post to get the body cremated. “We took him to a government hospital where they said they don’t have an oxygen bed. When we got our own cylinder, they would not let use it. They kept asking us to leave and take the patient away. This morning, he died waiting,” he said, adding that the hospital gave them a discharge slip. Necessary documents At the cremation ground, he was asked for a COVID-19 report, which he didn’t have. “They are saying that the hospital should give in writing whether the person has died of COVID-19 or not. The employees are also saying that we need to get a token by 1 p.m. or else the cremation will not be performed the same day,” he said. Munish Awasthi, who had come to cremate his friend Arvind Semwal, said they had completed hospital formalities by Thursday afternoon. Mr. Semwal, 36, an employee of the Archaeological Survey of India, had died of COVID-19 on Wednesday. “When we arrived at the cremation ground around 3 p.m. on Thursday, they informed us that the last rites could not be performed and asked us to come at 9.30 a.m. on Friday. We waited for four hours on Friday before we could cremate the body,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/non-covid-bodies-being-turned-away/article34397829.ece
24 April 2021||New Delhi,||Inside Lok Nayak Hospital: mad rush, cries and gasps for breath||Nearly 20 people on oxygen support gasping for breath, doctors urgently providing CPR to a woman in her 70s, four people on oxygen support squeezed into a single stretcher, and one Chief Medical Officer (CMO), in a green hospital gown, trying his best to attend to all patients in critical conditions. The scenes that rolled out in the emergency room of the largest Delhi government-run COVID-19 facility, Lok Nayak Hospital, were heart-wrenching. Around 5.45 p.m. on Friday, the CMO checked the oxygen levels of a man, who seemed to be in his fifties, using an oximeter and spontaneously raised an alarm. In a jiffy, he was moved into a wheeled-stretcher. A separate oxygen cylinder was taken out for him, for his oxygen levels were dangerously low. His oxygen mask was changed to an upgraded variety, a drip was started, and medicines were administered through an inhaler. “Stay awake, stay awake,” the CMO kept telling the patient, tapping gently in his cheeks. Doctors and nurses, clad in PPE kits, helped the CMO as he held the patient’s face from both sides. Almost every patient was getting oxygen from cylinders. The transparent cables from the cylinders were split using green-and-blue connectors to give oxygen from one cylinder to several patients. “Doctor, please see her,” a shout of help reeled out in the room at around 6.20 p.m. An unconscious woman, seemingly in her seventies, was wheeled into the emergency. The CMO checked her pulse and immediately started giving her CPR. Amidst all the bustle, about 12 patients, who were relatively less critical but were on oxygen, shared six beds. Some of them found breathing difficult. Calls for help Around 6.25 p.m., just outside the emergency room, a woman started crying with folded hands. “Please help our patient,” she pleaded. A stretcher attached with an oxygen cylinder was rolled in from another room for the patient. As the CMO juggled between calls from senior doctors on his two phones and attending patients, he checked the man in his fifties again. Around 6.40 p.m., relatives of a patient walked in with the patient and demanded treatment, furnishing some recommendations. The CMO checked the patient’s details and stared at them. “Should I save him right now [the man in his 50s] or your relative? See his oxygen levels,” he told them, gesturing at the clip pad on which his oxygen level was marked. Around 6.45 p.m., the glass door opened and four people, who were breathing oxygen from a single cylinder, were shifted out in a single stretcher to another area by PPE-clad staffers. Meanwhile, the rush, shouts, and gasps for breath continued in the emergency room with white walls and grey-and-green flooring.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/inside-lok-nayak-hospital-mad-rush-cries-and-gasps-for-breath/article34398213.ece

The gas involved is combustible in its present form and he used to transfer gas into small cylinders from large ones, and sell them at Rs. 12,500 per piece to needy,” said DCP (South-West) Ingit Pratap Singh. A case has been registered against him under relevant sections of law. A search operation will also be conducted at Kumar’s main godown, which is located in west Delhi’s Mayapuri, he said.

24 April 2021||New Delhi,||At testing centres, queue forms at 4 a.m., one’s turn can take 2-3 days||People are waiting outside government-run COVID-19 testing centres from as early as 4 a.m. in parts of the city. Of them, many do not get a chance to test as the centres were testing only a limited number of people. One centre took 40 people, while the other took only 10, officials at the centre said. Many of them had come for the second and third day on the trot to get tested. But their wait goes on. The process is relatively smooth in private testing centres, some of which even offer round the clock testing. Around 8.30 a.m. at a COVID-19 testing centre in Gautampuri Awas in Sarita Vihar, the situation has become tense as people began arguing with the security guards. More than 50 people were waiting in the queue. “We have been coming for three days. Tell us where else is testing happening then?” a person shouted at the guard. The helpless guard replied: “We are taking only 10 people. Tajpur Pahadi has a dispensary, you can go there if you want.” “Give us a reference there,” another person asked him. The guard did not. Chandra Mohan, 34, who was part of the crowd, said he was coming for the second day. “I am a waiter at a restaurant and my employer has asked to come with a negative report. I came here at 4 a.m. and from 9 a.m., tokens were given, but I did not get one. They gave only 10 tokens,” said Mr. Mohan, who earns only Rs. 15,000 per month, but is losing money as he can’t go to work without the report. Ujwal Kumar, 33, had another grouse: “There were 13 people before me. They came at 3.30 a.m. and I came at 4.10 a.m. I did not get the token. I’m going to another centre now.” Same scenes Outside another government centre at Meethapur Chowk, Darmender Kumar, 33, said he has come for the third day and has been waiting since 5.15 a.m. “The people who came after 5.30 a.m. did not get the token for testing. People are facing a lot of difficulties. There should be some solution,” said Mr. Kumar, who had tagged his wife along too. He was lucky that he was the 32nd of the 40 people who were tested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/at-testing-centres-queue-forms-at-4-am-ones-turn-can-take-2-3-days/article34398215.ece

Similar directions were issued by the High Court for the District Courts, which have been ordered to conduct virtual hearings only till May 15. An order issued by the office of the Delhi High Court Registrar General Manoj Jain said, “All the Benches of this court shall continue to take up only extremely urgent matters filed in the year 2021, through videoconferencing mode. All the courts of Registrars and Joint Registrars [Judicial] shall also continue to take up only urgent cases of their respective courts, through videoconferencing mode.” The High Court’s office order also said that all other pending routine or non-urgent matters listed between April 26 and May 15 shall stand adjourned en bloc to dates between July 9 and July 31. On April 18, the High Court had said that from April 19 onwards it will only take up “extremely urgent matters” filed this year. On April 8, it had decided that from April 9 to April 23 it will take up matters “through virtual mode only”. The High Court had commenced complete physical functioning from March 15 onwards. Subsequently, it had said that virtual or hybrid proceedings would be held on the request of lawyers. Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in March last year, the court was holding proceedings through videoconferencing. Its functioning was restricted to urgent matters from March 16 last year. Thereafter, from March 25 last year, the functioning of the High Court and district courts was further restricted and no physical hearing was being conducted due to the spread of COVID-19. Subsequently, from September last year a few Benches started holding physical courts everyday on a rotation basis. Some of them also started holding hybrid proceedings, wherein lawyers have the option to attend the hearing via videoconference instead of appearing in person.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-hc-districts-courts-to-continue-videoconference-hearings-till-may-15/article34397824.ece
24 April 2021||New Delhi,||AAP govt.’s stand sought on plea to resume ration||The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the AAP government to reply on a plea seeking directions to it to resume providing dry rations under the Mukhya Mantri Corona Sahayta Yojna (MMCSY) during the curfew imposed in the wake of spiralling COVID-19 cases. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the Delhi government and the urban shelter improvement board, DUSIB, seeking their stand by May 13 on the application by an NGO. The NGO, Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, in its application has also sought a direction to the AAP government to resume hunger relief centres for providing free hot cooked meals to all those in need so that no one goes hungry during the curfew. e-coupon applications The application, filed through advocate Prasanna S, the NGO has sought directions to the Delhi government to also resume accepting e-coupon applications and to start operating kiosks and help desks facilitating such applications for benefiting all residents not already covered under the regular PDS scheme under the National Food Security Act. The NGO has said that in view of the restrictions imposed by the Delhi government under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act on the movement of people from April 19 to April 26, the issues of distress and food security of the poor and needy need to be alleviated. “With tighter restrictions, lockdowns and curfews on the anvil, it has therefore become imperative that immediate and urgent directions are needed to alleviate the suffering both in the short term and in the medium term as the pandemic and the declaration of disaster under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act are nowhere close to its end,” the application has said. The NGO has claimed that it had last week written to the Delhi government to provide free hot cooked meals through homeless shelters and dedicated relief centres and ensure no person desirous of obtaining food is turned away from these centres. It said it had also asked the government to provide ration to all persons in need of food security, irrespective of whether they possess a ration card.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/aap-govts-stand-sought-on-plea-to-resume-ration/article34397825.ece
24 April 2021||New Delhi,||Hospitals told to first approach nodal officer for oxygen requirement||The Delhi High Court on Friday asked hospitals and nursing homes to first approach the nodal officer of AAP government to meet the requirement of medical oxygen to treat seriously ill COVID-19 patients. A Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli was hearing two separate pleas by two private hospitals, which were running out of medical oxygen, seeking immediate supply of oxygen to treat seriously ill COVID-19 patients. “We would expect all hospitals in the NCT of Delhi to approach the nodal officer Udit Prakash and such other officers... in the first instance for the purpose of meeting their requirement of oxygen,” the court said. The Bench said if the requirements are not met even after contacting the nodal officer, the hospitals shall contact senior advocate Rahul Mehra and lawyer Satyakam, before approaching the court. During the hearing, the Bench noted that an assurance was given to it by the Centre that 480 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen would be supplied to Delhi daily, but the same has “not fructified” mainly for the reason that some of the suppliers are located in West Bengal and Odisha. “Whatever was allocated should be there,” the court observed. The observation came after Mr. Mehra said Delhi has received only 380 MT of oxygen on Thursday and before that it was even less and if it gets its entire allocation, the problems faced by the hospitals can be resolved to some extent. The two hospitals, M/s Bram Health Care Ltd and Batra Hospital and Medical Research Centre, sought immediate relief of oxygen supply to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted at their respective hospitals. The court also asked the nodal officer to look into the grievances of the two hospitals relating to supply of oxygen. During the hearing, the court was informed that Batra Hospital has now received 2.5 MT of oxygen but it will last only till 9 p.m. on Friday and the counsel raised the concern that if further supply is not made, critical patients will suffer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hospitals-told-to-first-approach-nodal-officer-for-oxygen-requirement/article34397826.ece

Each of the 24 civic zones will be allotted 10 medical teams and 10 ambulances. The visits will be conducted from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. and those in need of help between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. can approach the jumbo Covid Care Centres. The decision was taken at a meeting of top BMC officials to discuss bed management amid the surge in COVID-19 cases. The BMC also issued the standard operating procedure (SOP) for hospitals and the administration for using oxygen. The SOP was prepared by Additional Municipal Commissioner P. Velarasu following two incidents of oxygen shortage in the last two weeks. On April 17, owing to lack of oxygen, 168 patients were moved from six civic-run hospitals to nearby facilities. On April 21, H.J. Doshi Ghatkopar Hindu Sabha Hospital informed that it barely had one-and-half-hours of oxygen left. Key data to be recorded As per the SOP, the office of Chief Engineer (Electrical) will maintain a data sheet with details of private hospitals in all wards treating COVID-19 patients and agencies supplying them with oxygen. Data on other hospitals will also be updated and given to the war rooms and control room of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Hospitals have been directed to place orders for oxygen 24 hours in advance and to inform the BMC if suppliers fail to make deliveries within 16 hours. War rooms will coordinate with the suppliers and if they fail to ensure supply within two hours, the FDA control room will intervene. Then the coordinating executive engineer will inform senior officials and make sure oxygen is supplied as per the need. After the Chief Secretary held a review meeting, the State government decided to accord ambulance status to oxygen tankers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bmcs-medical-teams-to-visit-homes-of-covid-19-patients/article34397752.ece

The State’s case fatality rate has incrementally declined to 1.52%. “Of 2,51,73,596 laboratory samples tested thus far, 41,61,676 (with the average case positivity rising to 16.53%) have returned positive” said State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate. Pune district reported nearly 9,000 new cases to take its total case tally to 7,76,446. As per State Health Department figures, 30 deaths were reported as the total death toll rose to 8,928. As per district authorities, however, while the active case tally dipped to 1.01 lakh, the total death toll has crossed 11,900, with more than 100 fatalities reported in the last 24 hours. 7,199 cases in Mumbai Mumbai reported 7,199 new cases, taking its total case tally to 6,16,279 of whom 81,174 are active; 72 fatalities took the city’s death toll to 12,655. Raigad district reported 27 deaths and 1,005 cases to take its toll to 1,924 and its tally to 1,10,973, of whom 14,021 are active.

24 April 2021||Pune,||Pawar urges sugar factories to produce medical oxygen||With Maharashtra witnessing acute shortage of medical oxygen amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who heads the Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI), urged the 190-odd cooperative and privately-owned sugar factories in the State to produce and supply oxygen to hospitals to help tackle the deficit.  “We all know that the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a dire situation in the State and that patients are in urgent need of oxygen. The factories, which are still in the crushing season, as well as those which have taken on distillation projects, should produce medical oxygen, while those which have completed crushing can produce and supply oxygen kits to patients at COVID-19 centres,” read the letter written on Mr. Pawar’s behalf by the VSI. The NCP chief suggested that factories set up oxygen-generating projects by utilising existing equipment and manpower. “For an oxygen production project to be set up, steam and electricity are the essential requirements. These are readily available in sugar factories. The work of generating oxygen can be done simultaneously while the factories are engaged in crushing,” he said. Mr. Pawar said that it had become imperative for all sugar mills to take an initiative as well and set up oxygen-generating plants with the necessary equipment, manpower and capital, if required.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pawar-urges-sugar-factories-to-produce-medical-oxygen/article34397757.ece
24 April 2021||Yangon,||Protests in Myanmar ahead of ASEAN meet||Protesters marched through downtown Yangon on Friday to demand that regional leaders “stand with Myanmar people”, ahead of a weekend ASEAN summit to be attended by junta leader Min Aung Hlaing. The country has been in turmoil since February 1, when the military ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a lightning coup. Using violence and lethal force to quell a nationwide uprising, security forces have killed at least 739 people in near-daily crackdowns, according to a local monitoring group. Coup leader Min Aung Hlaing is set to take part on Saturday in a summit of regional leaders — as part of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) — to address Myanmar’s mounting crisis. The meeting of ASEAN leaders and Foreign Ministers has drawn widespread criticism from activists, human rights groups and protesters for including the military regime. In Yangon — where the anti-coup movement had laid low in recent weeks due to fear of crackdowns — protesters returned to the streets on Friday, flashing three-finger salutes of resistance. “Mother Suu and leaders — release them immediately!” they shouted as they marched quickly past the Sule Pagoda in downtown Yangon. “What do we want? Democracy!” The protesters came from different Yangon townships, some carrying signs that read “ASEAN please stand with Myanmar people” and “ASEAN do you need more blood... to make the right decision?” Also angered by the bloc’s invitation to Min Aung Hlaing was the so-called National Unity Government (NUG) — a group of ousted Myanmar lawmakers attempting to run a shadow administration. ‘Arrest the General’ On Thursday, they called on Interpol to arrest the senior General — the same day Myanmar state media announced the lawmakers in hiding were wanted for high treason. Despite the threat of violence, nationwide demonstrations for a return to democracy persisted on Friday. Scores of people young and old marched through the southern city of Dawei, holding signs that said, “Please, help (us) to arrest Min Aung Hlaing” as they chanted support for the shadow government. Amnesty International’s Emerlynne Gil called ASEAN’s handling of Myanmar the “biggest test in its history”. “The Indonesian authorities and other ASEAN member states cannot ignore the fact Min Aung Hlaing is suspected of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole,” she said. The junta has justified the putsch by alleging electoral fraud in November’s elections — which Ms. Suu Kyi’s party had won in a landslide. The U.S., EU and U.K. have already imposed sanctions on top military brass and some Army-linked businesses. Before the coup, Gen. Min was already facing international sanctions over his Army’s role in the Rohingya crisis. About 7,50,000 of the Muslim minority group fled Myanmar in 2017 following a brutal military crackdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/protests-in-myanmar-ahead-of-asean-meet/article34397438.ece
24 April 2021||Jerusalem,||Israeli police arrest dozens after clashes||Israeli police say 44 people were arrested and 20 officers were wounded in a night of chaos in Jerusalem, where security forces separately clashed with Palestinians angry about Ramzan restrictions and Jewish extremists who held an anti-Arab march nearby. Tensions have spiked in recent days in Jerusalem, which has long been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and is home to holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims. Residents braced for possible further unrest as police stepped up security and the U.S. Embassy appealed for calm. There were concerns the violence could reignite following Friday prayers at a major holy site in Jerusalem, but thousands of worshippers dispersed peacefully after Muslim religious leaders called for restraint. The Islamic militant group Hamas, meanwhile, staged demonstrations across Gaza reiterating its support for armed struggle. Palestinians have clashed with Israeli police on a nightly basis since the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramzan. The tensions began when police placed barricades outside the Old City’s Damascus Gate, where Muslims traditionally gather to enjoy the evening after the daytime fast. Late Thursday, hundreds of Palestinians hurled stones and bottles at police, who fired a water cannon and stun grenades to disperse them. Dozens of Palestinians were wounded in the melee. Meanwhile, a far-right Jewish group known as Lahava led a march of hundreds of protesters chanting “Arabs get out!” toward the Damascus Gate. The show of force came in response to videos circulated on TikTok showing Palestinians slapping religious Jews at random. Other videos made in response to them appear to show Jews assaulting Arabs. Police used metal barricades to halt the far-right protesters a few hundred meters (yards) from Damascus Gate. Later, they used water cannon, stun grenades and mounted police to push them back toward mostly Jewish west Jerusalem. Videos circulated online showed smaller clashes and fires elsewhere in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israeli-police-arrest-dozens-after-clashes/article34397427.ece
24 April 2021||Moscow,||Russia starts pulling back troops from Ukraine border||Russian troops began pulling back to their permanent bases on Friday after a massive buildup that has caused Ukrainian and Western concerns. On Thursday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu declared the sweeping maneuvers in Crimea and wide swaths of western Russia over, and ordered the military to bring the troops that took part in them back to their permanent bases by May 1. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the announcement. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Friday that its forces that took part in the massive drills in Crimea were moving to board trains, transport aircraft and landing vessels en route to their permanent bases. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would await intelligence confirmation of the pullback. “We want to see that Russian deeds match Russian words,” Mr. Kuleba said. “What was said was not enough, we want to see that this will be implemented and all these forces will be removed from our border.” He added that if the pullback is confirmed, “this would mean a real easing of tension.” He thanked NATO and the EU countries for offering “very firm and immediate support to Ukraine” While ordering the pullback of military personnel, Mr. Shoigu also ordered to keep heavy weapons in western Russia for a massive exercise later this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-starts-pulling-back-troops-from-ukraine-border/article34397435.ece
24 April 2021||Bali,||Frantic search for submarine as its oxygen reserve is depleting||Indonesia’s desperate search for a missing submarine and its 53 crew was focused on a signal from an unidentified object on Friday, with just hours to go before the stricken vessel’s oxygen reserves ran out. Nearly two dozen warships were taking part in the ramped-up hunt, as Australia and the United States joined the search off the coast of Bali where the submarine disappeared more than two days ago during training exercises. The military said it had picked up signs of an object with high magnetism at a depth of between 50 m and 100 m. Ships equipped with tracking equipment were deployed in the hope that it may be the KRI Nanggala 402, which was equipped with oxygen reserves that could last until early Saturday, authorities said. The search zone covers an area of about 34 sq km. “We’ve only got until 3 a.m. tomorrow (Saturday) so we’re maximising all of our efforts today,” Indonesian military spokesman Achmad Riad said earlier. But by Thursday afternoon, there was still no word on whether the object was the missing vessel. “There was a strong magnetic field detected there,” Mr. Riad said, but he added that “we’ve yet to find the exact location”. India as well as neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia have already dispatched ships that are expected to arrive at the weekend, including the city-state’sMV Swift Rescue— a submarine rescue vessel. An oil spill spotted where the submarine was thought to have submerged pointed to possible fuel-tank damage, fanning fears of a deadly disaster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/frantic-search-for-submarine-as-its-oxygen-reserve-is-depleting/article34397426.ece
24 April 2021||Paris,||Terror probe begins after police officer is fatally stabbed near Paris||French prosectors opened a terror probe on Friday after a woman working for the police was stabbed to death at a police station southwest of Paris by a Tunisian man who was then shot dead by the security forces. The attack at the station in Rambouillet, a well-heeled usually peaceful commuter town about 60 km from Paris, revived the trauma of a spate of deadly attacks last year in France blamed on Islamist radicals. France’s anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard, whose office is leading the investigation, said the attacker shouted “Allahu Akbar” (God is Greatest) during the attack, and that “comments” indicated a terror motive by the suspect. The attack took place in the secure entrance area of the station at around 2:20 p.m., a police source added, asking not to be named. The 49-year-old woman, an administrative assistant who was returning from a lunch break, was stabbed in the throat twice and died of her wounds shortly afterwards, the source said. The attacker was fatally wounded when an officer opened fire on him. The murdered woman was the mother of two children aged 13 and 18. Prime Minister Jean Castex, who arrived at the scene, denounced on Twitter a “barbaric act of boundless cruelty” against “a hero of daily life.” “I want to tell the police I share their emotion and their outrage”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/terror-probe-begins-after-police-officer-is-fatally-stabbed-in-paris/article34397425.ece

The exercise, running from May 11 to 17, will be the first large-scale exercise in Japan involving ground troops from all three countries. It comes as Tokyo seeks to deepen defence cooperation beyond its key ally U.S. to counter Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the East and South China seas. “France shares the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi said. “By strengthening cooperation between Japan, the U.S. and France, we’d like to further improve the tactics and skills of the Self-Defense Forces,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japan-to-host-joint-drill-with-us-france/article34397428.ece

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Of mini-mutinies and shifting sands||On the sinking island of Ghoramara, at the southernmost tip of West Bengal, which falls under the Sagar Assembly constituency, the impact of cyclone Amphan that hit the State last May is still visible. Homes near the coast lie flattened, the banks have eroded further, and uprooted trees are yet to be cleared. Ashima Giri got Rs. 20,000 as Amphan cyclone relief. “We are for [West Bengal Chief Minister] Mamata Banerjee,” she says without any hesitation. But there are several others like Sareja Bibi who point out that they either did not get anything following the devastation or had to pay the local Trinamool Congress network “cut money” to get the amount. In the coastal areas of South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur, corruption in the Trinamool local leadership over Amphan relief is a common refrain. In Bengal, where two phases of a long eight-phase election are yet to be held, the Trinamool’s entire campaign is built around Banerjee. “ Didi, didi aar ke, Bangla nijer meye keyi chaay (Didi, who else? Bengal wants its own daughter)” is the party’s resounding slogan. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has quickly emerged to become the primary opposition to the ruling party, is trying to push the idea of “ ashol paribartan (real change)” in its campaign. And the Samyukta Morcha, comprising the Left, Congress, and newly floated Indian Secular Front (ISF), has tried to shake things up by challenging both the main contenders. The contest has been marked by numerous defections, taunts, communal statements, violence, and aggressive campaigning even as the number of COVID-19 cases rises alarmingly in Bengal. Fear of violence Across the river, in Purba Medinipur district, all eyes are on the electoral contest at Nandigram where Banerjee is taking on Trinamool-turned-BJP rival Suvendu Adhikari. An injury to the Chief Minister on March 10 has restricted her movement, forcing her on a wheelchair for the rest of the campaign. For several women in Nandigram who were witness to the violent land agitation of 2007-08, the high-voltage contest has rekindled fears of violence after results are declared on May 2. “Suvendu looked after us on behalf of Didi. And now we have been asked to pick one,” says the elderly Narmada Sith, who was tortured during the anti-land acquisition movement. Sith’s fears are not unfounded. Despite the huge deployment of Central forces in West Bengal, the Election Commission of India has not been able to insulate the State from poll-related violence. Till April 22, several incidents of voters being threatened, clashes between political parties, and the killing of political workers have been reported. In the fourth phase of polling, at Sitalkuchi Assembly in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district, Central forces opened fire killing four people. They maintain that they fired in self-defence. A primary assessment of the violence suggests that more than 20 people have lost their lives since the Model Code of Conduct was put in place and more than 30 candidates have been attacked during the poll process. Memories of violence and “area domination” clashes are heard not only in Nandigram, but in many other parts of the State too. In Singur, an elderly farmer, Vivekananda Das, says he was beaten up by the police during the land agitation in 2006 and was only able to re-cultivate his land after 14 years, in 2020. In the Jangalmahal region, which was gripped by mindless violence from 2008 to 2011, 30-year-old Chiranjib Maity from Jhargram stays away from the rallies conducted by Chhatradhar Mahato of the the Trinamool. Mahato led the People’s Committee Against Police Atrocities, the frontal organisation of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), before joining the Trinamool last year after spending more than 10 years in jail. Maity’s father was killed by the CPI (Maoist) before his own eyes in 2010. In Darjeeling, which witnessed a 100-day lockdown and economic blockade in 2017, during which at least 11 persons lost their lives, the elections present an opportunity for the people to express their political preferences. While there are broad-based State-level issues dominating the Assembly polls, West Bengal remains a story of many revolutions and mutinies, big and small, and they will determine the outcome of the polls, say observers. Delivery of welfare schemes For the Trinamool, the biggest poll plank is the delivery of welfare schemes. Banerjee claims that her government has launched 70 welfare schemes. Some of them like Kanyashree (which provides a one-time grant of Rs. 25,000 for a girl child who studies till Class 12) and Rupashree (which provides a one-time handout of Rs. 25,000 for a girl’s marriage for economically stressed families) are targeted towards girls. In densely populated North and South 24 Parganas (64 seats, of which the ruling Trinamool won 56 in 2016), the party is banking on such schemes to see it through. But though the Trinamool chief is popular, there is resentment against the party. “Didi is good. But very few people can say the same of local Trinamool workers,” says Bulti Das of Champahati in South 24 Parganas, who was given some seed money for poultry farming. Former bureaucrat Dilip Ghosh explains that though the Trinamool has done a lot of good work, such as giving rice at Rs. 2 a kg, it has not allowed people to voice their concerns. Recalling the words of Santosh Rana, one of the leaders of the Naxal movement, Ghosh believes that it is the “Trinamool’s lack of democracy that has pulled the BJP to the State”. Ghosh, who was Secretary of Panchayat and Rural Development and later Health and Family Welfare, says during the 34-year Left Front rule, there was “a sort of class alliance in rural Bengal and it was an open secret that benefits were linked to party loyalty”. With the Trinamool in power, “the MLAs and the bureaucracy appear to be more powerful than panchayat functionaries. Like in the later part of the Left regime, the Trinamool has also given an impression that you need to be with the party to get benefits,” he says. A Professor who has followed the rise of the Trinamool points out that control of local administrative bodies is vital to the party’s electoral success. “The Trinamool’s narrative of welfare transfers may not work as a section of its leaders at the grassroots level were involved in corruption, taking ‘cut money’ for disbursement of schemes. In case of some schemes like honorarium to imams and muezzins, the BJP accused the Trinamool of appeasement politics,” he says. According to Ardhendu Sen, former Chief Secretary of West Bengal, some of the development schemes of the Trinamool government have been well implemented, “but the party has destroyed the panchayats”. He says, “Whatever the people get today is what Mamata wants to give. The food situation has improved, but not health as she publicises. As for Kanyashree, I looked at whether the school dropout rate is going down, but there is no comprehensive evidence of that. Her reign has been a mixed bag.” After the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Trinamool government embarked on some “course correction”, launching outreach programmes like Duare Sarkar (government at the doorstop), Paray Paray Samadhan (resolving issues in the neighbourhood) and Swasthya Sathi (a health insurance scheme where the medical card is handed over to the oldest woman member of the family). Blow to democracy For bureaucrats, the biggest difference between the Left and Trinamool governments is that the latter seems to have stopped taking into account inputs from the ground. “Under the Left regime, there was some semblance of consultation with the people. Now, if you ask for something, leaders get annoyed,” says Sen. The 2018 panchayat elections dealt a blow to grassroots democracy and the three-tier panchayat network, say voters and leaders. Not only were Opposition candidates not allowed to file nomination papers but even dissidents within the ruling party were not allowed to contest, say Left and Congress leaders. The Trinamool won 34% of the seats during that election, about 20,000 without a single vote being cast. State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury claims that on the day of polling, 70-80 people were killed. Veteran Left leaders who led their supporters to file nomination papers were assaulted. The ruling party ensured that not a single civic body was administered by the Opposition and all barring the Siliguri Municipal Corporation were run by the Trinamool. It is this stifling of the Opposition that gave BJP oxygen in the State, say both Left and Congress leaders. Also, the Trinamool’s over-reliance on minority politics has afforded the Hindu right a political space. The BJP vote share in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls was 17%. It dropped to 10% in the 2016 Assembly polls and rose to 40% in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “In Bengal, people vote for a party not because of ideological affiliation but because of the perception of protection against violence. If the party they have traditionally voted for cannot protect them in the face of violence perpetrated by hoodlums close to the party in power, their allegiance is bound to shift to the one which can. While the BJP’s capacity to resist Trinamool violence has increased significantly over the last three years, it is ultimately this balance of coercion that will decide who wins rural Bengal,” says a teacher. The BJP’s might and muscle Taking full advantage of this rancour, the BJP has used its “might and muscle” to set foot in Bengal. It has worked assiduously on the disgruntlement on the ground and used defections as a political tool to poach leaders of the ruling party. The politics of defections started in West Bengal in 2011, when MLAs of the Congress defected to the Trinamool even though both the parties had joined hands and contested polls to defeat the Left Front government. In 2016, the Trinamool stormed to power for a second term with 211 seats, but the party continued to break into the rank and file of the Opposition.  Of the 44 Congress MLAs who won the 2016 Assembly polls, more than 20 defected to the Trinamool, says senior Congress leader Abdul Mannan. Taking a leaf out of the Trinamool handbook, the BJP began to engineer defections before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Senior Trinamool leaders like Mukul Roy, Arjun Singh, Nisith Pramanik and Locket Chatterjee switched to the BJP and the party won 18 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats in the State. Once the BJP got its formula right, it began to woo more members of the Trinamool. In December 2020, one of the key ministers of the Trinamool, Adhikari, joined the BJP. He was soon followed by Rajib Banerjee. By the time the State went to the polls, more than 30 MLAs of the Trinamool had defected to the BJP, and many were given tickets. What is most crucial to the rise of the BJP in Bengal is that the party gained strength without participating in any prolonged people’s movement like Singur or Nandigram, say observers. It has used defections, religious polarisation using the trope of infiltration and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and also highlighted communal violence in some parts of the State to stake claim to power. In many areas of rural Bengal, villagers talk about a desire for change. “ Onek toh dekhlam, baam ke, didi ke, ebar dekhi notun party ke diye (We have seen the Left and Trinamool, let us try a new party),” says a young man waiting for Home Minister Amit Shah’s road show at Nandigram. A farmer in the agriculture-rich Bardhaman district is candid: “If there is a new broom, do we use the old one?” Similar sentiments are echoed in Jhargram (the BJP did very well in this erstwhile Maoist belt in the Lok Sabha elections, winning all four seats), Howrah, Hooghly and North and South 24 Parganas. To build on this, the Prime Minister and the BJP top brass including party chief J.P. Nadda, Home Minister Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath besides State BJP president Dilip Ghosh held rallies and road shows. Modi held over 20 public rallies across the State. Identity politics The campaign has been bitter, fractious and communal. The Election Commission has taken some note of the polarisation, but not enough, says a senior Congress leader. Speaking in Bidhannagar, which went to the polls on April 17, on the city’s north-eastern fringes, Shah said “only the BJP can stop infiltration in Bengal. Communists, Congress and the Trinamool have vote banks in ‘ ghuspetias (infiltrators)’.” Campaigning in Asansol, the Prime Minister raked up the 2018 riots: “Who supported the rioters? Who undertook the policy of appeasement? For whom did the police support the rioters? There is only one answer. Everyone is saying ‘because of Didi’.” The Trinamool was quick to retort that the person the BJP had blamed then for being a bystander, Jitendra Tiwari, is now with the saffron party. In Nandigram and other parts of Purbo and Paschim Medinipur, Adhikari has constantly harped on the “70:30” divide of Hindus and Muslims in Bengal. The Muslims make up 27% of the population, according to the 2011 Census. Biswanath Chakraborty, psephologist and professor at Rabindra Bharati University, says this is a watershed election because Bengal is witnessing the rise of identity politics — not just of Hindus and Muslims, but also Dalit sections like Matuas and Rajbanshis. The BJP has focussed on getting the disaffected and neglected elements together from all walks of life to rally against the Trinamool. The Matuas are Hindu migrants from Bangladesh and the BJP has promised to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act if voted to power. On the ground, a section of Matuas do not want special favours and point out that they already have Aadhaar and voter cards, markers of Indian citizenship. The Matuas had backed Trinamool earlier but are now divided between the BJP and the ruling party — they have a say in at least 30 seats. An experiment called the ISF With the Left vote share falling from 26.6% in 2016 to 7.5% in 2019, the Left Front felt it “had to do something” to stop all anti-incumbency votes from going to the BJP. In an attempt to remain relevant in the contest, the Left and Congress alliance joined hands with the ISF , formed by Furfura Sharif cleric Abbas Siddique. “This will help stop votes from going to the BJP, at least a part of them,” claims Mohammed Salim, Polit Bureau member of the CPI(M). “The ISF is fighting in 28 seats,” says Abbas Siddique’s brother Naushad Siddique, chairman of the ISF and a candidate in Muslim-dominated Bhangar, located about 40 km from Kolkata. In 2019, the Trinamool had led in 60 of the 74 Assembly segments in which Muslims constitute over 50% of the electorate. “The Muslim vote is likely to be divided in places where the ISF is strong,” says Chakraborty. “And that will not help the Trinamool.” “A section of Left supporters who first went to the Trinamool is likely to have voted for the BJP in 2019 and may go with either the BJP or the Left-Congress-ISF alliance,” says Ambikesh Mahapatra, who teaches at Jadavpur University and had contested the 2016 Assembly polls with support from the Left and Congress. Things may have changed for the Congress, however, in the Muslim-majority seats of Malda and Murshidabad after the Sitalkuchi firing. “The Muslim vote may consolidate behind the Trinamool,” says a local leader. The BJP has targeted the Trinamool government over alleged corruption, particularly using the term “cut money”. It has taken on Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee, the ruling party’s MP from Diamond Harbour. Those who have defected from the Trinamool to the BJP often attack the ‘ bhaipo ’ or nephew saying he is a “ tolabaj (extortionist)”. While there have been cases of local-level functionaries at panchayats being involved in taking “cut money” and the Trinamool chairperson has asked people to return the money, Abhishek Banerjee has turned out to be an easy target for the Opposition. High turnout amidst a pandemic Charges of mismanagement in dealing with the pandemic are a cause of concern for the ruling party. But now there is anger against the BJP too, in some sections, as Modi continued to hold large rallies where most were seen packed in close proximity without masks, even as cases have soared. The Prime Minister has cancelled his rallies for the last two phases. Banerjee has also promised to connect with the electorate virtually. On April 21, the State’s daily COVID-19 infections crossed 10,000 for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic. On April 22, the day of polling for the sixth phase, the Calcutta High Court came down heavily on the Election Commission saying it is only issuing circulars but not ensuring that COVID-19 protocols are implemented. Despite the surge, there has been no drop in voter percentage. In each of the six phases, more than 80% polling was registered. The 2021 Assembly polls are no ordinary elections, say political observers. “This is the first time that the State is witnessing the rise of the BJP as well as a high-pitched campaign that started months before the poll dates were announced,” says Chakraborty. The people on the ground have picked sides and while some are willing to stick their necks out, others maintain a strategic silence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/of-mini-mutinies-and-shifting-sands/article34397423.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||India’s COVID crisis — when difficult became worse||India is in its darkest days of the pandemic, but there may be still darker days to come. With one in three new infections globally occurring in the country, India’s astronomic surge in cases — more than 3 lakh daily — is propelling the global pandemic, and represents a grave threat to the economic and social well-being of the Indian people. The political leaders, who have been too slow and largely failed to take the outbreak seriously, are now coming to realise the gravity of the task at hand. Lockdowns are spreading, but always one step behind the virus. Given the catastrophic state of affairs, effective intervention will require much more rigorous and extensive action. A data gap It is difficult to grasp the true scope of this crisis. New Delhi’s test positivity rate — the rate at which people getting tested for coronavirus receive positive results — recently climbed above 30%. If it takes three tests to find one positive patient, it means that we are likely missing many, many infections. Indeed, one would not be surprised if the true number of infections was now above 10 lakh daily. And we can see it in all those undocumented deaths. While the official statistics suggest 2,000 deaths daily, the true number again is much higher. One crematorium in New Delhi has gone from managing 20 bodies daily to 100; the constant running of the furnaces has caused its steel chimneys to melt. Premature celebration How did India find itself in this predicament? Certainly, the country faced many challenges in controlling the coronavirus, including the second largest population in the world, and one spread over an enormous, geographically and socially diverse country comprising both very rural areas and sprawling cities. But India’s leaders have made a very difficult situation worse. Early this year, daily new infections dropped to less than 10,000 — a remarkable achievement, driven in part by successful efforts to enforce social distancing and other public health measures. India began to roll out homegrown vaccines to much fanfare. Bharatiya Janata Party President J.P. Nadda declared that Prime Minister Modi had “saved the country,” comparing India’s performance under Modi favourably to that of the United States. But this premature celebration has ushered in a nightmare. The resumption of large, in-person political rallies and other large gatherings are part of the fuel that has caused COVID-19 to explode. The Prime Minister recently declared, “I can see a sea of masses” at a rally in West Bengal, apparently oblivious to the grave risk that such a sea poses to his supporters. The government also took almost no steps to limit the risk posed by the Kumbh Mela festival, ironically claiming that infection precautions would present too great a threat to crowd safety. As a result, the Kumbh Mela has resulted in thousands of positive tests, including several sadhus and former King Gyanendra of Nepal, with many thousands of infections sure to go undetected as pilgrims return to their home communities and expose their families and neighbours. Control strategies The virus has taken advantage of the overconfidence of the government over the past months, making matters worse. Viruses mutate constantly, but it is when they are allowed to spread unchecked through large populations that more infectious and more deadly variants become established and change the dynamics of outbreaks. India is now faced with managing a renewed epidemic driven at least in part by the B1.617 “double mutant” strain of SARS-CoV-2, with similar mutations to more virulent strains found in Brazil and South Africa. At the moment, however, scientists and public health policymakers are drawing on extremely limited data, as far too few cases of infection are being analysed to provide a complete and actionable picture of the spread of variants and their influence on disease dynamics. India must rapidly scale up its genomic surveillance efforts to give scientists and public health researchers the data they need to guide policy decisions. How can the astronomical growth of the pandemic in India be brought under control? Short-term targeted lockdowns can help — the kind we are seeing in New Delhi and elsewhere. They will break the chains of transmission and can curb the exponential growth we are seeing across the nation. A second strategy is expanding access to vaccines although its benefits are likely to take weeks to be felt. Vaccine rollout without massive outreach and support for the complex, the challenging logistics of administering vaccines, and simply broadening eligibility requirements will do little to slow the virus. The lockdowns we are seeing now will almost surely need to be extended beyond a week and will need to be in place until infection numbers start coming down substantially. It is worth remembering that lockdowns exact a terrible economic and social cost and are a strategy of last resort. Steps to take So what might we do to minimise the time that cities and regions need to be in lockdown? India needs a surge of testing. Right now, given high test positivity rates, it is clear that the nation is not testing enough. Ideally, India would increase its testing rates several times over, with the goal of getting the positivity rate under 5%. The nation has the capacity to do that many more tests but has not made it enough of a priority. We also know that universal mask wearing when people are outside their homes can be enormously helpful in curbing the spread of the disease. Given the crowds of Indian cities and towns and the high rates of infections, universal mask wearing, ideally with high quality masks, is critical and must be mandatory. And banning all major indoor and outdoor events, including rallies, religious festivals, weddings, and so forth, is essential. If those were to continue, any hope of bringing this outbreak under control would quickly vanish. Of course, India’s pandemic will finally come to an end when enough Indians are vaccinated — and targeting vaccines now most quickly and effectively can help control the spread of the virus. Whatever strategy India takes to administer vaccines (focus on elderly to save lives, young people to slow spread, etc.), the key is ensuring the country has enough vaccines. Here, the government needs to work with manufacturers like the Serum Institute, identify what is slowing them down, and use the full clout of the Indian government to drive production higher. Looking forward India is now suffering the worst days of the pandemic, going through a second wave of coronavirus as a result of poor political choices, poor communications, and neglect of public health principles. For months, too many celebrated that India had “beaten the virus” even though none of us could explain how that could be and why. In this crisis, there is much that individuals can do to protect themselves and their families. But political leaders must do much more. The good news is that we know it can be done, and we know how to do it. Focus on public health measures, improve vaccinations, universal masking, and effective coordination across public health efforts. If we do these things, infections can turn, hospitals can stop being overwhelmed, and life can begin to go back to normal. Dr. Ashish K.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Arise and rejuvenate the third layer of governance||What is progress? When has a government achieved its goals? What is the true indication that a government is not just planning, but also putting into action those plans? The half-hearted execution of a plan by a government that the people chose is not a sign of achievement. The government must ensure that even the last man sitting in the remote corner of the last row should have access to the beneﬁts of the plan. This is why it is crucial that strong local bodies are formed to enable genuine feasibility and execution. The Cholas were the pioneers in the formation of local bodies as part of a well-organised hierarchy to oversee the implementation of progressive plans.  The journey of Panchayati raj “The voice of the people is the voice of god; The voice of the Panchayat is the voice of the people,” is the quote attributed to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Panchayati raj ensures that the voices of the people are heard loud and clear. But, drawing up a path for a brilliant organisational structure like the Panchayat raj, and then travelling along the path is not a simple task. Realising that seamless administration is impossible without power sharing, the British, in 1884, passed the Madras Local Boards Act. With this, the British formed unions in both small towns and big cities and began to appoint members to ensure better administration. To a certain extent, this brought about positive changes in basic parameters such as health and hygiene. With the advent of gram panchayat laws in 1920, people over 25 years of age were bestowed with the right to vote and choose their panchayat members. Even though Gandhiji was constantly laying emphasis on the importance of autonomously ruled villages, the idea received constitutional recognition only in 1992. It was only after the 73rd Amendment in the 1990s, that the Panchayati raj law came into force. This was the law that brought about massive turning points such as the initiation of grama sabha , a three-tier Panchayati raj methodology of governance, reservation for the downtrodden and women, consistency in economic development, local body elections once in five years, the formation of the State Election Commission, Finance Commission, and the power to draft the rules and responsibilities of the Panchayat. The regions which were better equipped with basic facilities and which were more developed than the villages were brought under one coordinated body, namely, the municipality. The district capitals were further slotted into a combined parameter, namely, the corporation. Administration was transferred to the people, from the politicians and other ofﬁcials. The lofty dream of Gandhiji to make each village of the independent India a republic organisation, and to reiterate that the autonomous administration of villages should be made the foundation of the entire country’s administration was heard and he lay stress on the active participation of the people in governance. Ideal platform For seemingly trivial and easily resolvable issues, the villages did not have to seek the assistance of the State or the Central governments. Grama sabhas could and can be the platform to resolve such issues. According to the rules framed by the Tamil Nadu government, it is mandatory that grama sabhas meet at least four times in a calendar year. Besides, grama sabhas can be convened as and when the necessity arises. Every grama sabha meeting ensures the equal right to highlight the issues that disrupt life. In addition to this, the elected members of the Panchayat are obliged to read out the ﬁnancial statements and balance sheet to ensure transparency. The reality The decisions taken during a grama sabha meeting and the proposed solutions with a feasible deadline are potent and powerful. Unfortunately, the reality today is that grama sabhas have become more like auction houses. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, the present government did not even make an attempt to seek the opinions and the consensus of the people on significant issues such as an eight-lane highway project and even a major hydrocarbon project. Even though the government announced that people’s opinions would be considered, it went ahead and conducted meetings, which were marked by poor attendance and poor representation from the people. Even then, the government went ahead with the approval of projects which are impediments to normal life. The truth is that keeping in mind a single goal, of profit, politicians hold ‘negotiations’ with the ofﬁcials. Several projects are being implemented for the beneﬁt of private and corporate entities. Sadly, in this age, women do not find themselves in major administrative roles in the local bodies, though, on paper, women are shown to be a considerable force. The Makkal Needhi Maiam has been laying stress on the importance of grama sabhas and has been extending its support in a very transparent manner to rejuvenate the dying system of Panchayati raj. The Kerala example The neighbouring State of Kerala has been diligently working toward ensuring the proper use of allotted funds, and ensuring the efﬁciency of administration and eligible member appointments. Thus, it stands tall as being exemplary. If Tamil Nadu wants to stand tall too, it needs to take steps to enable the power of administration to Panchayats, as stated in the Constitution. To ensure efﬁciency, we need to strengthen our grama sabhas , hold area sabhas in cities, form ward committees, hold online Panchayat meetings, ensure decent remuneration to Panchayat chiefs and councillors and also bestow the grama sabha with the power to revoke appointed members and representatives. These steps are what will ensure real growth in the State. The State-appointed corporation commissioner faces mammoth challenges when a member of the Opposition party takes charge as a mayor. The constant and meaningless conﬂicts between the ruling party and the mayor from the Opposition party make it impossible for the corporation commissioner to execute what was agreed upon in a meeting. The ofﬁcials kowtow to pressures from the ruling party. The same treatment is meted out to municipal councillors and district councillors. In Tamil Nadu The Constitution is clear in stating that local body elections must be conducted once in ﬁve years. But the ruling party keeps postponing the holding of local body elections, which is a breach of the Constitution. Strangely, this form of disrespect never materialises when it comes to the Assembly elections! Local body elections have been held once in five years for the last 25 years, since 1996. But for the ﬁrst time, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government has travelled on without holding a local body election. This is not only an act of escapism but also a stain on the State’s political history. The recent reconstitution of nine districts in the State is an invalid excuse to postpone the holding of local body elections. The government gives a variety of empty and irrelevant excuses to postpone these elections and to cancel grama sabha meetings. The time has come to stop this act — of depriving people of their basic rights. The demand for federal rule in the Centre and autonomous rule in the States should resonate along with the need to have autonomous local bodies too. We must collectively ensure that Panchayati raj should be strengthened. This should be the outcome of a peoples’ movement. I wish to end by citing Gandhiji’s belief that the voices of people will resolve what violence can never be successful in resolving. Let the peoples’ voices be heard. We should also note that every year, April 24 is celebrated as Panchayat raj day.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Too little||The Election Commission of India’s decision to restrict campaigning for the remaining two phases of the West Bengal Assembly election is an instance of wisdom dawning late. Nevertheless, it will help limit the public health damage to what was already caused by an unreasonably extended election cycle in the State during the pandemic. After the Calcutta High Court sought an action taken report on what measures it was adopting in the context of the spreading pandemic, the Election Commission has ordered the cancellation of all rallies and roadshows. Only meetings that are attended by no more than 500 people will be allowed now. In its order, the Election Commission noted “with anguish” that parties and candidates were not adhering to safety protocols. Daily campaign hours had already been cut and campaigning was to stop 72 hours prior to polling, instead of 48 hours, as per an earlier directive. A bit of foresight would have been more helpful. The State is recording high numbers of infection. Bengal’s health infrastructure is not robust to deal with a heavy surge. All parties organised rallies amid the pandemic. But parties other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been calling for clubbing the last phases together. In the face of the Election Commission’s refusal to do so, the Congress, the Trinamool Congress and the Left had discontinued big rallies. The only party that did not have a problem with the election being spread over eight phases over five weeks has been the BJP. Allegations that this helped the BJP that was dependent on its star campaigners and workers from other States moving from one region to the next carries weight. It is ironic that the BJP that argues for clubbing together all elections across the country has been happy about such a prolonged process in Bengal. Even after it became evident that the new surge was turning out to be severe, the BJP continued with big rallies in the State. Prime Minister Narendra Modi gloated about massive turnouts at his rallies. BJP leaders declared that there was no correlation between rally turnouts and the spread of the pandemic. It is not that India sleepwalked into this disaster; it was dragged in a boisterous procession of triumphalism and hubris by the political leadership. The unusual and unreasonable schedule of the Bengal election during the pandemic was unwise and avoidable. The Election Commission’s corrective measures at the last moment can only be of limited help. The lack of foresight while drawing up the schedule and monitoring the campaign bordered on complicity in the surge of new infections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/too-little/article34397412.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Infernal infernos||Maharashtra has been facing the merciless onslaught of COVID-19 cases, but its public health response has also had to combat a second, connected scourge of hospital fires. In recent days, the State has been adding, on average, over 60,000 cases and losing a few hundred lives daily in the second wave of the pandemic, straining its infrastructure and institutions. It is also frequently hit by deadly fires, of the kind witnessed on Friday in the ICU of a small hospital in Mumbai’s suburb of Virar, where at least 14 patients severely ill with the coronavirus died. With about seven lakh active cases now, many of the patients in the State require oxygen support and hospitals are stretched to the limit. Many are small institutions, while a number of facilities are simply not built for purpose, such as the hospital located in a mall in Mumbai’s Bhandup area where several lives were lost in a blaze last month. Now that many COVID-19 hospital fires have been reported during the first peak of the pandemic last year and later, in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh in particular, State authorities should be able to document their learnings and put out a checklist to save patients. They should clarify whether fire safety guidelines for hospitals issued by the Centre in September last year, prioritising a strict compliance strategy, third party accreditation on safety, and adoption of a fire response plan were acted upon. This is particularly important in Maharashtra’s context, given that devastating fires have been recurring, and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should lose no time in ordering a comprehensive audit. With no end in sight to serious hospital fires, there may be a case for judicial oversight and systematic inquiries into such mishaps. COVID-19 has turned into a conflagration, and the Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of many aspects of pandemic management, such as availability of oxygen and essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination, and declaration of lockdowns. Nearly 10 High Courts have taken up pressing matters pertaining to COVID-19. It would be logical to add fire safety to such scrutiny, to make accidents rare. Evidently, State bureaucracies can achieve a lot more on their own, if they diligently implement existing regulations. There is a professional knowledge base available with important features. It calls for ICUs to be equipped with an exhaust system to prevent smoke accumulation in a fire, ventilation cut-outs to stop a blaze from spreading, periodic maintenance of safety equipment and, very importantly, an evacuation plan for the sickest patients, who may be attached to life-saving equipment. It is undoubtedly complicated to retrofit poorly designed hospitals for high safety standards, especially when it has to be executed on the go, and every bed is precious in the pandemic. But as each successive blaze proves, business as usual may extract a heavy price. Patients should be able to go to a hospital without the fear of fires threatening their lives there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/infernal-infernos/article34397411.ece
24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||SBI trims GDP outlook on COVID wave||State Bank of India has trimmed its projection for the economy’s performance in 2021-22 to 10.4% real GDP growth and 14.3% nominal GDP growth, from 11% and 15%, respectively, citing the second wave of COVID-19 and the spate of ongoing partial and weekend lockdowns in almost all States. Economists at the country’s largest bank expect the second wave to peak in the third week of May, and pointed out that in the first wave Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra had peaked before the country as a whole did. “Now new cases in Maharashtra seem to be stabilising but share of cases in total of various other States such as Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat has increased and these are showing increase in daily new cases,” the bank’s research team observed. “So if other States also implement strict actions to control their spread, the national peak may come within two weeks after the Maharashtra peak,” the SBI research team estimated. April’s lockdowns had already cost this year’s GDP by 0.7%, SBI reckoned, with total losses estimated at Rs. 1.5 lakh crore as economic activity hit a five-month low as per the bank’s estimates. Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan account for 80% of these losses, with the worst-affected western State alone accounting for 54% of the economic cost.  ‘Most industrialised’ Calling for a sharp ramp up in vaccinations in order to thwart any further waves, SBI’s economics research team said in a report on Friday that Maharashtra had suffered an estimated Rs. 82,000 crore loss already which would ‘definitely increase if restrictions are further tightened’. “Being the economically biggest and most industrialised State in India, this lockdown will have huge impact on growth,” the researchers said, adding that reverse migration of labour was continuing unabated. “For the first 12 days of April, almost 4.32 lakh people returned to U.P., West Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Odisha from Maharashtra,” SBI’s group chief economic advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh wrote, citing data from the Western Railways. Another 4.7 lakh workers were estimated to have left for northern and eastern States, taking total migration out of Maharashtra in the period to more than 9 lakh. “SBI business activity index shows a decline in activity with a latest reading of 86.3 for the week ending April 19. This is the lowest in 5 months,” the team wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sbi-trims-gdp-outlook-on-covid-wave/article34397402.ece

Credit offtake in FY21 at Rs. 109.51 lakh crore was lower than FY20’s when it had clocked a growth of 6.14% — which was the slowest in as many as 58 years. It was way back in FY1962 when credit growth was slower than this at 5.38%. Only about Rs. 3 lakh crore of the Rs. 20 lakh crore stimulus amounting to 11% of the GDP was actually used in fiscal stimulus to fight the impact of COVID-19 as the remaining amount was through credit support with no impact on the fiscal numbers of the government. However, system-wide deposits jumped almost 11.4% in the year to Rs. 151.13 lakh crore, from 7.93% growth in FY20, SBI Research said, citing RBI data.

24 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||IRDAI asks insurers to report errant hospitals||The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has advised insurers to report hospitals levying excess charges or denying cashless facility to the State governments for appropriate action. Citing reports, including those of some hospitals charging differential rates, the regulator on Friday asked health insurance providers to ensure policyholders are charged as per rates agreed upon by the network providers (hospitals). They should also ensure hospitals do not levy any additional charges for the same treatment other than that agreed upon. “Charging differential rates, demanding advance deposits and denying cashless treatment is not only detrimental to the interest of policyholders, but may also [be] violative of the service level agreement (SLA) between the service provider hospitals and the insurance companies,” the regulator said in a press release.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||PBKS bowlers smother MI to snap three-game losing streak||Punjab Kings got its IPL-14 campaign back on track at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai with a nine-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians on Friday. Needing a modest 132 to win, K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal got off to a rollicking start. The duo collected 15 off Krunal Pandya’s first over — Rahul hitting two successive fours before Agarwal launched a six over extra-cover. Rohit Sharma then turned to Jasprit Bumrah, who was pulled over fine-leg for six by Rahul. Agarwal brought up the 50 partnership with a boundary before holing out off Rahul Chahar. Rahul and Chris Gayle struggled to keep the runs ticking over, with the dot balls racking up as Chahar and Jayant Yadav mounted the pressure in the middle overs. The boundary drought ended after 32 balls when Gayle put one away to the fine-leg fence. With the ball turning square, there were a few close shaves but Rahul played the sheet-anchor’s role to perfection, reaching his half-century at a run a ball. PBKS got over the line with 14 balls to spare, riding on an unbeaten 79-run stand between Gayle and Rahul. Earlier, batting first, Mumbai Indians’ innings got off to a shaky start after Quinton de Kock dragged Deepak Hooda straight into the hands of Moises Henriques. While runs didn't reel off the blade of Ishan Kishan — promoted to No. 3 — skipper Rohit, too, was slow up front. The first boundary of the innings came off the last ball of the fifth over when Rohit swept a low full toss behind square. MI had limped to 21 for one in the PowerPlay before Ravi Bishnoi (two for 21) had Ishan caught behind in his first over of the season. On a slow turning pitch, Rohit targeted the slow left armer, Fabian Allen. After scoring back-to-back boundaries off him, Rohit launched one over wide long-on. And when Hooda returned for his second spell, he was pulled over deep mid-wicket. Rohit reached his 50 with a boundary to backward point. At the other end, Suryakumar Yadav batted as serenely as he usually does — an inside-out six over extra cover off Arshdeep Singh being the highlight. These two added 79 off 56 for the third wicket and were threatening to cut loose when Suryakumar was caught for 33 off Bishnoi. Next over, Mohammed Shami (two for 21) had Rohit caught for 63, as the PBKS bowlers staged a late comeback to pick up four for 34 in the last five. They were duly rewarded with a win.  Rohit (63) and Suryakumar (33) shone for MI Rahul and Agarwal (25) got PBKS off to a rollicking start The Punjab side won by nine wickets with 14 balls to spare||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pbks-bowlers-smother-mi-to-snap-three-game-losing-streak/article34397516.ece
24 April 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Wasn’t thinking of my hundred’||After finishing the Vijay Hazare Trophy with a staggering average of 147.4, high expectations were placed on Devdutt Padikkal leading up to the IPL. A bout of COVID-19, however, put paid to Padikkal’s hopes of wearing the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) jersey in its tournament opener. Padikkal described being “really hurt” at missing the first outing, but the setback only increased his hunger to score big when the opportunity arrived. The 20-year-old did just that on Thursday, hitting a remarkable unbeaten 52-ball 101 to star in RCB’s 10-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals (RR) at Mumbai. Even when Padikkal was on the verge of recording his maiden IPL century, he stayed focused on helping the team win. So much so that in the 90s, Padikkal told opening partner and skipper Virat Kohli to finish the match himself. “What mattered most was getting the win as early as possible. I wasn’t thinking about my hundred. That’s why I asked Virat to go for it and win the game,” Padikkal said. Kohli, however, was keen to see Padikkal reach his personal milestone. Kohli’s repartee When Padikkal told him that he had many more centuries to come, Kohli replied, “You can tell me that after you get the first one.” On recovering from the virus, Padikkal said, “All I could do was wait my turn. When I had COVID-19, all I wanted was to come here and play. When I missed the first match, it really hurt me. Coming out of COVID-19 was a real challenge.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wasnt-thinking-of-my-hundred/article34397794.ece
24 April 2021||Madrid,||Messi turns on the style for Barca||Lionel Messi gave up the chance for a hat-trick on Thursday as Barcelona held off a late fightback from Getafe to win 5-2 and stay in the race at the top of LaLiga. Messi scored twice and could have had a third in injury-time at Camp Nou but deferred a penalty to Antoine Griezmann. “He’s the best in the world, he never lets up,” said Barca coach Ronald Koeman. “If he lowers his concentration you never notice. Hopefully he stays for many more years.” Back-to-back wins Atletico had earlier brushed aside Huesca 2-0 to register back-to-back victories for the first time since January and go to the top, though Barcelona has a game in hand. Jamie Vardy ended his two-month goal drought as Leicester blitzed West Brom 3-0 on Thursday to strengthen its grip on a Premier League top-four place and snuff out the Baggies’ revival. Brendan Rodgers’ men were wobbling after losing their previous two top-flight matches but produced a dazzling attacking display against the insipid visitors at the King Power Stadium. First-half goals from Jamie Vardy, Jonny Evans and Kelechi Iheanacho gave West Brom a mountain to climb and Leicester kept a firm grip on the match after the break. Third-placed Leicester, whose implosion at the end of last season cost it a Champions League place, now has a valuable four-point lead over Chelsea and West Ham, with just six games to go. Ten-man Atalanta wasted a chance to move into second place in Serie A with a 1-1 draw at Europa League semifinalist Roma. Still, Atalanta extended its unbeaten streak to six matches. Also, Napoli beat visiting Lazio 5-2 to move within two points of the Champions League places. Third-place Atalanta remains one point behind second-place AC Milan and moves level on points with fourth-place Juventus, which it beat last weekend.  The results:   LaLiga: Atletico Madrid 2 (Correa 39, Carrasco 80) bt Huesca 0; Granada 4 (Soldado 21, 77, Puertas 37, Kenedy 81) bt Eibar 1 (Kike 64); Real Sociedad 2 (Portu 25, Januzaj 39-pen) bt Celta Vigo 1 (Hugo Mallo 22); Barcelona 5 (Messi 8, 33, Chakla 28-o.g, Araujo 87, Griezmann 90+3-pen) bt Getafe 2 (Lenglet 12-o.g, Unal 69-pen).   Premier League: Leicester 3 (Vardy 23, Evans 26, Iheanacho 36) bt West Brom 0.   Serie A: Roma 1 (Christante 75) drew with Atalanta 1 (Malinovskiy 26); Napoli 5 (Insigne 7-pen, 53, Politano 12, Mertens 65, Osimhen 80) bt Lazio 2 (Immobile 70, Milinkovic-Savic 74).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/messi-turns-on-the-style-for-barca/article34397569.ece

CA announced a 17-strong list of contracted players for an action-packed 2020-21 season, which includes the Twenty20 World Cup in India and the home Ashes series against England around the New Year. Green, 21, broke into the Test side last season on the back of some prolific domestic form and played all four matches in the lost home series against India. “Cameron is a player we believe will play an important role for Australian cricket after his impressive breakout summer,” head selector Trevor Hohns said in a statement. Australia is also scheduled to undertake a short format tour of West Indies and a Test tour of Pakistan in addition to the Ashes series and the Twenty20 World Cup. “There is a considerable amount of international cricket to be played across all formats in the next 12 months and the door to national selection is never closed to players outside this list,” Hohns said.  Contracted players (2020-21): Ashton Agar, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Aaron Finch, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Glenn Maxwell, Tim Paine, James Pattinson, Jhye Richardson, Kane Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, David Warner, Adam Zampa .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/cameron-green-gets-australia-contract/article34397817.ece

24 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Sharath happy with training sessions||Preparing for the Tokyo Olympics for the mixed doubles event, Sharath Kamal and Manika Batra had a fruitful five sessions here at the Hall of TT, Nehru Stadium, that concluded on Friday. “It was really really good. We worked on our footwork and co-ordination with multi-ball training in the morning and played with different partners simulating match situations in the evening,” Sharath told The Hindu after a practice session. Getting back confidence Sharath praised Manika for improving her doubles game in a short time. “Now she is compact, not making many mistakes. She is sort of settled in her zone. We are trying to get back her confidence she enjoyed in 2018 where she won medals in Commonwealth Games and a bronze with me in the Asian Games,” said the nine-time National champion. There were technical issues which both addressed during training sessions; the major one being how both being tall players need to space themselves better. “In doubles, you have more reaction time, but being tall we are close to each other during shot making as we are on the same line and so get stuck in the same place. We worked on that,” said Sharath. Manika’s strength According to Sharath, Manika’s strength lies in her ability to slow down the rallies and get him to do the attack. “She slows down the pace of the rallies so that I can generate speed. Moreover, our strengths are in the open game when there are more rallies. That’s how we beat the Korean pair in the Olympic Qualifiers in Doha in the final where Manika was outstanding,” he said, while adding: “Everybody knows that the best chance for a medal in the Tokyo Olympics lies with mixed doubles.” Manika will leave for Pune on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sharath-happy-with-training-sessions/article34397820.ece

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Misfiring Knight Riders favourites against the fragile Royals||Rajasthan Royals’ fragility and inconsistency in IPL-14 so far make Kolkata Knight Riders the favourite for Saturday’s clash at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Both sides have won just once in four games and are looking to revive their campaigns, but KKR is a little ahead in terms of planning and execution. It almost chased down 221 against Chennai Super Kings even after being five down for 31 inside the PowerPlay at the same venue. RR slipped to eighth after failing to defend 178 against Royal Challengers Bangalore, losing by 10 wickets. Welcome change The slow strip in Chennai had curbed the big shots, resulting in low-scoring games. The Mumbai pitch has offered a welcome change. If KKR wants to attack up front and at the death, Lockie Ferguson should be on pace duty with Pat Cummins, as the conditions suit the New Zealander. It remains to be seen whether Sunil Narine makes way for Ferguson. In that case, Harbhajan Singh may rejoin Varun Chakravarthy in the spin department while Kamlesh Nagarkoti sits out. RR skipper Sanju Samson has not delivered since the ton in the opener against Punjab Kings. His inconsistency remains a talking point. Morris under pressure Even big-ticket all-rounder Chris Morris has not flexed his muscles except in one game against Delhi Capitals where his golf-like swing of the bat took RR home. Bought for Rs. 16.25 crore, he will be under pressure to deliver. Young left-arm pacer Chetan Sakariya has impressed with six wickets in four games. RR could include right-arm quick Kartik Tyagi in the mix as an experiment. Andre Russell’s 22-ball 54 against CSK has sounded an ominous note of warning to the bowlers. Samson will need a plan to restrict the Caribbean star.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/misfiring-knight-riders-favourites-against-the-fragile-royals/article34397509.ece

24 April 2021||KOLKATA,||I have learnt from my setbacks: Vinesh||Setbacks have helped Olympic-bound Vinesh Phogat grow as an individual and as a wrestler, enabling her to make an objective assessment of her improvement in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics. Vinesh, a World championships bronze medallist, had a forgettable outing in the Rio Olympics as she retired midway through a bout because of a knee injury. Now, she sounds wiser about the episode. “What happened in 2016 was disappointing. I am mentally ready now even if there is a negative situation,” Vinesh said during an online interaction facilitated by the Sports Authority of India on Friday. “I have learnt from my setbacks. I was thinking why this happened with me but then I realised the universe always chooses you to be stronger. That is the law of nature.  Emotionally mature “I was emotionally breaking down a lot. But now, I have become mature. If I lose today, I know I have flaws and can work on them. My anger has probably become less. I have controlled my aggression. I have become mentally stronger and have learnt a lot after Rio.” Considered a strong medal prospect in Tokyo, Vinesh — who was inducted into the Target Olympic Podium Scheme in 2015 and has been supported with Rs. 87 lakh in the current Olympic cycle — said, “I’m on the right track. I’ve reached 85 per cent. I don’t want to peak early. I am making different strategies for different wrestlers. I have to fight with them accordingly. “I am aware that people have a lot of expectations from me but I am not under pressure. This gives me extra incentive to train and perform. If they are expecting, I have to bring a medal for them.” The 26-year-old rates teenagers Anshu Malik and Sonam Malik, who have also qualified for the Tokyo Games, highly. “They have a strong passion for winning, no fear. That gives them confidence. I am happy Sonam and Anshu have joined me for the Olympics. I’m not the only woman wrestler now! They will push me and I will push them,” said Vinesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-have-learnt-from-my-setbacks-vinesh/article34397686.ece

24 April 2021||Cape Town,||SA cricket faces ‘greatest crisis’ since apartheid||The South African government exercised its power to intervene in the running of the country’s troubled cricket federation on Friday, leaving the federation to face its “greatest crisis” since the end of apartheid. Cricket South Africa’s interim board said it had received notice from sports minister Nathi Mthethwa that he had invoked a section of law allowing the government to take decisions out of the hands of sports officials when disputes can’t be resolved. The move threatens South Africa’s teams as the International Cricket Council does not allow governments to interfere in national cricket bodies. The ICC has previously banned countries from international competitions when that happens. The ICC said on Friday it had not received a complaint from Cricket South Africa over government interference. Complex situation The situation with Cricket South Africa is complex, though, with the government and CSA’s interim board effectively working together against a third body, the decision-making members’ council of the CSA. The latest dispute relates to the refusal by the members' council at a special meeting last weekend to approve a new constitution for CSA that would have given its board an independent chairman and a majority of independent members.

24 April 2021||PALLEKELE,||Karunaratne leads Sri Lanka’s response||Dimuth Karunaratne led Sri Lanka to 229/3 in its first innings at stumps on the third day of the first Test, still 312 runs behind Bangladesh’s mammoth 541/7. There was little threat from Bangladesh seamers when the Sri Lankans started their reply but the two spinners — Taijul Islam and Mehidy Hasan — were rewarded for some tight bowling on Friday. Karunaratne batted for more than five hours for his 85 not out as play was extended on day three to catch up for time lost due to bad light on Thursday. Karunaratne was given out leg before wicket to Taijul but the decision was overturned after the batsman reviewed. Lahiru Thirimanne (58) was cruising with some cracking strokes before he was dismissed off the final ball before tea by Hasan to make it 114/1. Oshada Fernando was then caught down the legside to Taskin Ahmed’s delivery for 20. Sloppy footwork saw Angelo Mathews getting dismissed for 25.  The scores: Bangladesh 541/7 decl. in 173 overs (Tamim Iqbal 90, Najmul Shanto 163, Mominul Haque 127, Mushfiqur Rahim 68 n.o., Liton Das 50, Fernando 4/96) vs. Sri Lanka 229/3 in 73 overs (Dimuth Karunaratne 85 batting, Lahiru Thirimanne 58).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/karunaratne-leads-lankas-response/article34397519.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Archer out of IPL, says ECB||It is confirmed. Jofra Archer will take no part in this year’s IPL. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on Friday said that the fast bowler would not play in the current edition of the IPL. Archer had to undergo a surgery on his hand, following a freak injury that resulted in a piece of glass getting lodged in his finger. “Archer returned to bowling this week with higher intensity, and the ECB and Sussex medical teams will continue to monitor his progress,” the statement said. Archer’s absence is a severe blow to Royals, which has already lost the services of all-rounder Ben Stokes, who was injured and ruled out of the rest of the competition after just one game.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/archer-out-of-ipl-says-ecb/article34397503.ece

24 April 2021||HYDERABAD:,||HFC goalkeeper Kattimani gets extension||Hyderabad FC handed a one-year extension to seasoned goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani from Goa on Friday. Kattimani will be with the HFC till the end of 2021-22 ISL season. “I have now spent two years with the club and I am really happy here. I know the club and the people involved pretty well and it was an easy decision for me to extend my time with Hyderabad FC,” said Kattimani, after signing the deal. “Kattimani is a very good keeper. He is not just good with his shot-stopping but is also very calm with his feet. He is confident of playing out from the back and is a really good fit for our system,” said head coach Manolo Marquez. With 59 ISL appearances to date, Kattimani was a crucial member of the Hyderabad FC squad that finished fifth in the league last season, the coach said. In the 2020-21 ISL season, Laxmikanth kept six clean sheets in 14 games, conceding less than a goal a game.    B. Muthukrishna, former Hyderabad Ranji cricketer, passed away here on Friday following cardiac arrest. He was 65 and survived by wife, a son and a daughter. Muthukrishna played under the captaincy of Syed Abid Ali in the ’80s and was once adjudged ‘best batsman’ in the South Zone inter-school championship. He is the son of the famous coach, late A.R. Bhupathy, whose other son, B. Mohan, is also a Ranji cricketer and former Hyderabad selector.   Kakinada Sea Ports presented Rs. 50 lakh to India’s chief national badminton coach P. Gopi Chand to help him in the second phase of the pandemic. KSP chairman K. Venkateshwara Rao presented the cheque and said it should help the coach in bringing in new training facilities at Gopi Academy. He also presented Rs. 10 lakhs to Tvesa Malik who will be taking part in some golf tournaments in Europe and another Rs. 10 lakhs to Hyderabad women’s cricket vice-captain Pranavi Chandra, who will be playing for Ealing Cricket Club in Middlesex (UK) this season.     Krish Tyagi and V. Apurva won the boys’ and girls’ singles titles respectively in the AITA Championship Series tennis tournament (under-16) at Sania Mirza Tennis Academy (Murtuzaguda) here.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Food in times of a crisis||In this terrible time of chaos and death, the heartening news is that there are many lending a helping hand to people in need. Groups have been formed of people donating blood, or looking for donors. People are organising food for those who are in no position to cook. And some small entrepreneurs are supplying home-cooked food — at nominal costs — to those looking for nutritious meals that are tasty and prepared and delivered with precautionary measures. I got a call from one such kitchen a few days ago. Called Bhojan, it has a subscription meal plan offering light meals and snacks, and has a small combo meal package. The food from Bhojan (bhojan.co.in) was healthy, as it had been cooked with few masalas, but was delicious nevertheless. I learnt it was started in 2020, and has four kitchens, three in Delhi-NCR and one in Bengaluru. The minimum subscription plan is of seven days (plans for a fortnight and a month are also available (WhatsApp 9311419770). People can check the food out before opting for a subscription. The prices are affordable, something one can appreciate in these times when everyone’s pocket is hurting. The Chhota Bhojan breakfast or snack costs Rs. 45; combo meal of roti with sabzi or rice with gravy is priced at Rs. 49; a classic meal that includes rice, roti, vegetable, gravy and pickle is at Rs. 69; and a standard thhali has all this, but in somewhat larger quantities, and a salad, at Rs. 89. For breakfast, they serve masala puri with bhaji, idli sambar, pao bhaji, poha , plain paratha with zeera aloo , and vegetable coleslaw sandwich. On Sunday, there are various types of parathas with curd. Lunch consists of mixed vegetables, kadhai style aloo mattar, petha masala, baingan masala, lauki channa . There is something called gravy, which includes Amritsari chholey , rajma , and kadhi pakora . I enjoyed the food. The vegetable — muttar paneer — had been cooked with a light hand, but was good to eat. Likewise the chholey was deliciously light – in taste and colour. The aloo parathas were soft, filled with a light potato mash, and served with curd. The samosas were the way I like them – with a crisp crust that was not oily, and a scrumptious potato and pea filling. Another interesting place is Paanch Phoran, which has decided to keep its gourmet fare (from Exotisch Cuisines) on the backburner and focus on the kind of food that the body demands in times of crises. Sonali Chatterjee (WhatsApp 9910474449), who runs this service, does various kinds of soups and other dishes. On Thursday, for instance, she had prepared a clear chicken soup and clear vegetable soup. She offers a vegetarian meal of dal, sabzi, roti and rice (Rs. 150); all this with chicken or fish (Rs. 200) and a meal of chicken/ mushroom/ paneer/ tofu grilled, a soup or stew or broth, with bread/rice and sautéed vegetables (Rs. 250). She has a delivery charge of Rs. 100. There is also the House of Kitchens, which serves food across Delhi: East Delhi, GK2, Kalkaji, Panchsheel Park, West Delhi, Dwarka, Faridabad, Gurugram, Noida and Greater Noida. I rang the East Delhi number (9873939959). A representative answered the phone, and said that they had simple meals of rice, roti, sabzi, dal for Rs. 110, which they delivered to east Delhi neighbourhoods. For many people, this is not quite business — but almost a mission. And for many others, it’s a life saver.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||What’s ticking with all things K||It’s not like we needed proof that all things South Korea is popular at the moment. But two minutes into the webinar, ‘The Rising Korean Wave in India’, it was at capacity (sorry folks). Curated by The Hindu Weekend for The Hindu , in association with Korea Tourism Organization, the almost one-hour session had discussions on travel to South Korea, K-Drama and the connect Indians feel with it, K-Beauty and how people use it as both skin care and as a method of self care. And let’s not forget another hot topic: Korean food. Who doesn’t love ramyun and kimchi fried rice? Chef Vikramjit Roy, one of the panellists, even took a short kitchen break to show the audience white kimchi , the flavourful, non-spicy dish made with cabbage and seasonal vegetables, and gochujang , the savoury-sweet red chilli paste that goes into bibimbap and a host of other Korean dishes. Here are a few takeaways from the session:  K-Beauty for everyone:  Chinmayi Sripada, who began trying Korean beauty products in 2014 after reading about them on a few blogs, has since not only become a convert, but has also started Isle of Skin, an e-portal, to bring her favourite brands to the country. Think Cosrx, Pyunkang, Dr Ceuracle, and Ultru. She said that the way Korean products remain in touch with their traditions of herbal medicine reminds her of Ayurveda and its place in our lifestyle. “I was fascinated by how people are using K-Beauty [and its detailed regimens] as a method of self care, to ground themselves, to overcome anxiety,” said the singer and entrepreneur, adding that in 2020, when many of her projects and rehearsals were cancelled, it was her work with the e-store that kept her going.  K- Drama is a holistic experience:  It isn’t just mushy romance! The messaging in these shows is often quite strong — subtly bringing in important conversations such as mental health or sexual harassment at work. “You can’t watch it and ignore [such topics] or the food, fashion and lifestyle. It is all packaged so well that I want to travel there,” said Scherezade Shroff, who’s been to Seoul twice, but would like to go back and see the place with a fan’s eyes. Interestingly, in India, viewing for K-dramas on Netflix increased more than 370% in 2020 from the year before. If you’d like to add to the number, here’s Shroff’s starter kit: Crash Landing on You , Reply 1988 , Descendants of the Sun , Flower of Evil , and The Penthouse: War in Life . “There is no age restriction. My 76-year-old dad and 74-year-old mum have also got into it [without me telling them anything] and watch their own stuff,” said the lifestyle content creator.   Korean language boom:  In 2006, when people registered with the Indo-Korean Cultural and Information Centre in Chennai to learn Korean, it was solely for reasons of employment. “Today, it is to follow what their idol is singing or their favourite star is saying,” shared Rathi Jafer, director of InKo Centre and moderator of the webinar, adding that there’s always a waiting list now.  Travel to South Korea:  “Mass vaccination is ongoing in the country, and South Korea hopes to achieve herd immunity by the end of September. They are also launching vaccine passports by the end of this month,” said Sandeep Dutta, Marketing Manager, Korea Tourism Organization (KTO). “So by the end of this year, hopefully, travel can happen without quarantine.” Once you get there, there’s plenty to look forward to, including dedicated tours to locations used in K-Dramas. Such as Camp Greaves — an hour’s drive from Seoul — where portions of Descendants of the Sun were shot. Needless to say, the audience was relentless with questions. Some were curious about why Hallyu (Korean wave) is spreading so fast now — “the pandemic contributed to this quite a bit, at least in India,” felt Shroff — while others wanted to know if BTS cards would be included in the new McDonald’s meal announced in collaboration with the popular seven-member K-Pop group! That’s still under wraps though. (The BTS Meal will launch in Delhi in June). As for post-pandemic travel, “We hope to see you all in South Korea soon,” said Young-Geul Choi, Director, KTO, in his closing address.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I know I am not boring’||In the two years that she has been in our public consciousness, after the investigative six-part documentary Wild, Wild Country , Sheela Birnstiel has seen polarised opinions of condemnation and sycophancy. “I am a mirror for them. I reflect the other, so what they want to see, they will find in me,” she says, of people’s opinions and questions. “I accept both without judgement. People have a habit of dissecting, so they should have their pleasure, and I know I am not boring.” You see both sides — the demonising and glorification — in the way journalists, social influencers, and celebrities react to the 71-year-old, in a new documentary, Searching for Sheela . Shot by Dharmatic Productions across 22 days, during her visit to India in 2019, the film runs for 58 minutes. It begins and ends with her home in Switzerland, far from the life we saw her live in the previous documentary. In between are scenes from interviews and visits to her old family home in Gujarat — her first trip to India after almost 35 years.  Camera friendly  “My team found it [the movie] lovely,” says Sheela, who watched this movie, unlike the previous one. Shot in an observational style, by a team put together by executive producer Shakun Batra, it documents her navigation through people and places in India. When Batra looked at the rushes, he saw an “audience in need of this idea of redemption from her”. So the film became about examining how “someone like her who is carrying this weight” responds to people’s questions on her past with Osho: of assault, poisoning, wire tapping of which she was convicted in 1984, though now denies. “Some people wear their baggage on their face; I wear the baggage on my shoulders,” she says, in the documentary. In the film she seems, at times, to be laughing at those around her: “I feel like a dulha ,” she says, of the Raw Mango outfit before her interview with Karan Johar. At the event she tells the producer-director-host, “You know, I have bigger scandals than show business.” On a drive in a car she speaks to the camera matter-of-factly: “I didn’t want to become spiritual…enlightened, or learn about meditation. I have no interest in them.” At another time, pragmatic, when they’re in the hills: “Just don’t look down, there’s garbage; look up.” And reflective: “Life is multi-dimensional. There’s no black and white. They have shades of colours, shades of information.” At socialite-entrepreneur Bina Ramani’s residence, she manages to put a slightly overbearing Raghu Rai in his place. And at an event at Gurugram’s The Quorum, she does not react to a bizarre introduction: “Today we have the pleasure of asking her about her crimes, her past, and Osho,” checking, instead, with the team if they’d got some rest. The film doesn’t give answers, but Batra says that wasn’t his job. “My effort is to not try and over-simplify things and to not arrive at answers, because I don’t think I know the answers.” Sheela says she simply accepts how people react to her, even though they are “stagnant”, if all they want to ask her is whether she really did attempt murder. Instead, she wants people to ask about “the love that I feel, I felt, the work I have done”.  Life and love  Love is a constant through all her interviews, but it’s love for Rajneesh, the people she currently lives with, and her parents; she doesn’t speak of her three husbands and her daughter though. “After Rajneesh, I focussed my love on my parents. They suffered my dark days in imprisonment. I wanted to take their pain away, and in love you can take pain away from people,” she says. She also talks about the people with disabilities and those with complex mental illnesses she currently takes care of in her two homes called Matrusaden and Bapusaden. “I live with them, just the way I used to live with Bhagwan’s people in Rajneeshpuram.” Batra, whose forte has been films like Kapoor and Sons and Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu , says this experience has been different because in non-fiction “you arrive at the meaning after you’ve shot it”. In terms of the content, he says it’s difficult to flesh out any person in such a short time, least of all Sheela with her range of experiences. “I can make another six-part series and there will still be questions, because that’s just who she is. She is a person who leaves you with more questions than answers,” says Batra, whose parents were followers of Osho, and who “were not very fond of Sheela…” Even before Wild, Wild Country , Batra had gone to meet Sheela, with questions. Some days before the release of the movie she asked him if he’d found his answer: had he found Sheela? He still finds her an “enigma”. Perhaps the answer lies in Sheela’s own words in an old interview when she was at the height of her fame as Rajneesh’s secretary. In response to a reporter who asks what role she plays, that of Snow White or the wicked witch, she says, “Both.” Searching for Sheelaisnow streaming on Netflix.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Kiss and tell||Chi chi , and by that I don’t mean Govinda, what is our once great land coming to, I say? Read with much sadness that when the Delhi police stopped a couple in a car for travelling without masks, apparently, the woman and her husband behaved in a most unsanskari manner with the law enforcement officers. While the husband said, “Why did you stop my car? I was inside my car with my wife,” the woman — Shiva, Shiva — was heard saying “If I feel like it, I will kiss my husband. What will you do?” That this comes in the wake of 15,000 cheques made out by our brothers and sisters towards the building of a great monument, amounting to approximately Rs. 22 crores, bouncing like stuntmen hit by Allu Arjun is doubly devastating. Is this what we have worked so hard for? Is this our culture? Is this the citizenry that deserves a bullet train, the world’s tallest statue, windmills that can separate oxygen from hydrogen, Vedic internet, the extra 2ab in the (a + b)², Coronil, drought-reducing frog weddings, and a new movie from Akshay Kumar every three months? In our pristine culture, when did wives, heaven forbid, start kissing husbands this way, I say? Even if they are their own. And that too in public? And declare it shamelessly to the law? The job of wives, as we all know, is to wear 11-yard (inclusive of blouse piece) saris and stand demurely behind the doorway, one side of their faces illuminated by the flame from the kerosene stove making ginger tea for the father-in-law, mouths tightly shut, their eyes doing the talking. Provided they have helped the children with their Class 3 nuclear physics homework, packed them off to their virtual classrooms with a snack of Patanjali noodles in their tiffin boxes, pressed the mother-in-law’s swollen feet, politely brushed off the untoward advances of husband’s cousin from the neighbouring town, and made sure the husband’s shoes gleamed like mirrors before he went off to the club. Women, please understand, 20 lakh buck-nakedsadhushave dipped their body parts in the Ganga for the safety and well-being of our ancient nation. Before that, true patriots like the entire Bachchan family have taken time off from going to Maldives and clanged thalis , lit diyas and rung ghantis . All their prayers and efforts have been nullified by brazen mahilas like you who travel mask-free in their own cars, wear ripped jeans and speak of doing unspeakable things with their husbands. What will NASA and UNESCO think of us? What will our overseas brothers and sisters from Palo Alto to Palookaville, upholders of ancient Indian values, say if they hear of this? Don’t our women know that from time immemorial their desire, that terrible thing, is expressed by rubbing two flowers against each other and running away with a ‘Chi, you naughty,’ every time the husband bites his lower lip suggestively? What books authored by Nehru are you all secretly reading, betis ? Detox yourself by watching Ramanand Sagar’s old serial which is back on DD like a saviour from heaven. Don’t forget to have a cold bath from the water you’ve drawn from the well of your 3BHK. A final suggestion to the sister who wanted to kiss her husband: repent, behen , round up other misled sisters, and make yourself useful to the nation. Form a nari posse, and unearth the names of those 15,000 cheque bouncers. Try and persuade them in our uniquely gentle Indian way that they should pay up. You can’t cheat God, you know.

This isn’t going to be a discussion conjecturing who will lift the statuette this year. Instead, let’s consider which ones we remember. Debates over whether the winners were worthy or not will continue raging as long as there is a medium called cinema and there are Oscars. The winner is decided after members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, more than 10,000 of them this year, vote. Every person’s reaction to a work of art, be it painting, sculpture, music or literature is deeply personal. One woman’s Tom Jones (best picture 1963) may be another man’s My Fair Lady (best picture 1964), as it were. Applying the remembrance test, My Fair Lady is more likely to have instant recall value than Tom Jones . Some best picture winners have stood the recall test of time, like say, Gandhi (1982), or The Silence of the Lambs (1991), but some have not, unfairly. Take Kevin Costner’s epic Dances w ith Wolves, which, deservedly, in my opinion, swept the board at the 1990 Oscars, winning seven statuettes. I watched the film at Singapore’s magnificent Capitol Theatre (now sadly redeveloped) and drank in the vistas. The next day, I went back and watched it again. Today, the film hardly ever gets mentioned and there are some revisionist reviews doing the rounds that are a far cry from the near universal acclaim from when it was released. I pay no heed to the carping and, instead, settle down with my four-hour extended version Blu-ray of the film secure in the knowledge that I am having the last laugh. More recently, there are some best picture winners that have been deservedly forgotten, and not a moment too soon. Take 2017 winner The Shape of Water , for example. What? I hear you say. Exactly. Let us forgive it as an aberration in Guillermo del Toro’s otherwise terrific career. How about 2011 winner The Artist or 2012 champion Argo ? What about them indeed? Do aficionados go back and re-watch them obsessively like they would The Godfather films (1972 and 1974) or Lawrence of Arabia (1962)? Or are they likely to go the way of Gentleman’s Agreement (1947) or Patton (1970) — undeniably impressive films, but just not part of the zeitgeist. How many of you have revisited Driving Miss Daisy (1989) or Ordinary People (1980), hand on heart? It’s anyone’s game this year, despite the impressive number of wins at other awards; especially the BAFTAs Nomadland carries into the ceremony. Whoever wins, is the victor memorable enough? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, if you have access, try the 1944 winner Going My Way . Skip Frank Capra’s 1934 winner It Happened One Night for the 100th time and embrace his 1938 winner You Can’t Take It With You instead. The rewards will be immense — so what if you haven’t heard of it or have forgotten about it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-replay-test/article34398095.ece

This year,Jallikattudid the same, but couldn’t make the final cut. What are we getting wrong? Vetri Maaran weighs in.       Whydo producers spend a lot of money sending a film to the Oscars if it does not have a fighting chance of winning?   Thereputation the Acadamy Awards has garnered over the course of these eight decades is so imposing that every film enthusiast wants the film he likes to win an Oscar. A few days ago, I got a message from an acquaintance saying ifAsuranhad gone to the Oscars it would have won! They feel they know it. In this context of having a brand value, most of our producers want to be part of the race, even if they don’t have a chance. And some of the producers are misinformed. In this day of getting your information online, some fans of certain films that are part of the screening think it’s in the competition and put it out on social media. This year there were more such incidents.   How can a regular film enthusiast spot the difference?  The only official category our films can get in is the Best International Film, erstwhile called the Best Foreign Language Film. That is selected every year by a committee consisting of members of the selecting body — an autonomous body, not functioning under the government. Sometimes if these international films are very impressive to the voting members, they are nominated in other ‘main’ categories as well, like Best Film, which are meant only for films produced or co-produced by American companies. We had the best actor award given to an international film forLife Is Beautifuland theParasitephenomenon happened last year.   For such screenings, do filmmakers have to spend money on promotions as they would if selected as an official entry?  It is unbelievably expensive. The Acadamy will give you one free screening for which very few voting members turn up. You can have around four paid screenings. I’ve forgotten the exact numbers. Most of these happen at boutique screens set up in star hotels. The most-liked are the Soho House screenings, for which you pull a lot of strings. If I remember it right, we paid $17,500 for that screening alone.

I’m here to say, ‘Forget about all that’,” says Grégoire Verdin, the Global Brand Ambassador and Associate Vice President, Tastings and Marketing, of Sula Vineyards. The company partnered with the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC) in early 2020 to retail wines across the state and he says they currently offer seven wines. But the TASMAC partnership also led to some complaints. “Availability was to start in February 2020 so we had shipped our wines in January. But then the lockdown happened and our wines were stuck in their warehouses, which led to quality issues because of heat damaging the wine,” explains Verdin. The company will now ship smaller quantities more often, and they are working with TASMAC to improve warehouse storage facilities.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Cuarón and Tamhane’s enviable chemistry||When Gravity released in 2013, the space-thriller made more than $700 million worldwide, and won seven Academy Awards, including one for Alfonso Cuarón as best director. The Mexican filmmaker could have literally made anything he wanted at that point — Hollywood studios and stars were lining up to work with him. Instead, he went back to his neighbourhood in Mexico city where he’d grown up, and made a personal period piece called Roma that released to universal acclaim and ended up winning him another best director Oscar in 2018. As the whole world waited with bated breath to see what he would do next, he announced that he would executive produce a little known Marathi project, helmed by Court director Chaitanya Tamhane. And from thereon, The Disciple began its award-studded journey. Set in contemporary Mumbai, The Disciple is a deeply meditative film that follows the life of musician Sharad Nerulkar, essayed by Aditya Modak. “The film deals with an artistic ambition that is very specific, but the theme is highly universal,” says Cuarón . “It is about fathers and sons, about legacy, about the old world versus the new, how things change and how we adapt to it, how much we can accept ourselves, or how we have to follow the expectations of our parents. It is something that has really touched the core of audiences around the world.” The winner of the Best Screenplay award at the 77th Venice International Film Festival, it also has producer Vivek Gomber (who starred in 2018’s critically-acclaimed film, Sir ) on board, and is set to première in India this month. Cuarón and Tamhane first met through the Rolex Mentor & Protégé Arts Initiative for 2016-17. Four years on, the two are good friends and their mutual respect comes across in every interview they do together. On a Zoom call with The Hindu Weekend , Tamhane is understandably starstruck despite his collaboration with the Mexican icon (he says so in as many words), while Cuarón is his usual Zen self, doling out nuggets of filmmaking wisdom, and full of praise for his Indian counterpart. The duo talks to us about how such international collabs can drive Indian cinema forward, and how the pandemic has influenced their filmmaking. Edited excerpts:       The film is set in the backdrop of Indian classical music, and yet international audiences and critics have been able to resonate with it.   Tamhane: You create something with a certain intent and conviction because you believe in a story and its need to be told. Even before Court or The Disciple released, I had no idea how an international audience would react. We are talking about over 195-200 countries… it’s an abstract entity in that sense. I believe that the film and its themes — which talk about human aspiration, the personal quest for excellence and belonging to a certain tribe — are universal enough. In India, I feel a lot more confident that the film will resonate with people because it is an Indian story. The cultural specificities are what make it unique and original, and there are so many nuances, so many different undertones that an audience here will appreciate.  Cuarón: The response to The Disciple has been amazing from the get go, right from when it premièred in Venice. And the word-of-mouth and reviews have been fantastic. Then came all these invitations, and it played at the New York Film Festival. This is Chaitanya’s second film. You know, I had to wait a decade or two for one of my films to be invited by the NYFF. Not only that, suddenly he starts getting these calls from Hollywood agents, actors and stars just embracing the film. There were already a bunch of people campaigning for the film to be in the Oscars, and disappointed that at the end, it was not the Indian selection even after so much support.        One of the biggest motifs in your films is the relationship between the subjects and their surroundings. In  The Disciple  , the city of Mumbai is almost a character. Is that due to your influence, Mr Cuarón?    Cuarón: I agree with you, and I love that about the film, that Mumbai is really a character in it. But it is a Mumbai that is completely grounded; there is no romanticisation or judgement about the city. Ultimately, what I perceived from Chaitanya is an immense love for his city. I wish I could say I had any influence over him, but his mind is so stubborn! I don’t think anyone can influence him [laughs].  Tamhane: I have absolutely been influenced by him while being on the sets of Roma , and seeing the post-production work. Yes, I had certain inclinations, but Alfonso really gave me the courage to be even more fearless to push myself. For instance, like in many of his [Cuarón] earlier works, we used only one or two lenses throughout the entire film.       Could your film set a precedent for other local talent to collaborate with foreign filmmakers?   Tamhane: To be very honest, I sometimes have to pinch myself that this is actually happening, even the fact that Alfonso is with us, supporting The Disciple . I think of this as a combination of wild luck, a matter of extreme privilege, and a lot of stars aligning. I am nobody to comment on this, but yes, I do hope it does become a precedent of some sort.  Cuarón: Yes Chaitanya, because I watched the stars, not your film. I watched how they were aligned, and they really wanted your film [grins].       The central protagonist’s frustration and insecurity is an emotion that has been dominant in many of us during the pandemic; do you think the film resonates that sense?   Tamhane: What all of us are doing in this pandemic is adapting to the situations in front of us, and that’s kind of what the character is doing. But it’s not a period of a year or two, it’s his entire life. I hope that this pandemic has given people time to sit back, switch off a little bit, and make them more receptive to a film that is meditative in its nature. Read thefull interview, and watch Tamhane and Cuarón in conversation, on weekend.thehindu.com      The Disciple premières on April 30 on Netflix.     I really believe that cinema is a country and film is the language… and the fact that they come from different places enriches that language and that beautiful country. I don’t make too many distinctions on if I’m going to see an arthouse film or something that is more popcorn; I can enjoy both. I can respect both, you know?

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Reviving India’s painting styles||In 2012, April 15 was adopted by the International Association of Art, a partner of UNESCO, to spread awareness on art movements (in honour of Leonardo da Vinci’s birthday) that contribute positively towards society. Two royal painting forms in India — Thanjavur and Mysore — that have faced survival issues, are now dynamically being propagated by veteran practitioners and art colleges. Their efforts to teach the intricacies to connoisseurs will not help the heritage art form live on but also help indigenous Indian art included in interior spaces. While Thanjavur paintings are named after a style of painting that flourished in the temple town under the patronage of the Maratha rulers in the 17th Century, the Mysore school of painting in Karnataka had the discerning patronage of the erstwhile Mysore royals. Both art forms were recognised for their elaborate and ornate attributes. They were in need of revival once the dynasty rule ended, and gradually they were adapted by leading practitioners to suit a common man’s wall. They are now being taught to create economic empowerment amongst the artists’ fraternity, while interior designers who feel the need to encourage Indian handmade art, recommend them for ethnic interiors. Exploring themes Raghavendra H. Kulkarni, professor of art and history, College of Fine Arts, Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath, says although the two schools may look similar, the themes in Mysore paintings reflect a comparatively fresher thought process adapted by the kings to bring in finer line drawings. They depict elaborate landscapes, darbar halls and elephants in contrast to the intensely rich picturisation of religious characters in Thanjavur paintings. While the market for both styles has gradually gained steam over the last 15 years, the royal artworks are increasingly becoming a part of one’s collectibles. Stylised representations of characters from Hindu religious texts mainly fashioned the subject matter, with Lord Krishna remaining every artist’s muse. Thanjavur paintings are characterised by an iconic composition of glittering gold foils overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work. They have an inlay of glass beads, precious stones, and semi-precious stones, while the Mysore style differentiated itself with exclusive free-hand detailing and colouring with minimum superfluities. Specialised skill set Only artists with experience and skill can handle the innumerable aspects of handwork in these forms of painting, says Bharathy Harish, coordinator of arts revival boutique, Madhurya Creations. She not only sources these works from Tamil Nadu and Mysuru, but also re-creates them with the help of specialised artists. “The paintings have carved wooden frames that add to their visual appeal,” she says, pointing to the gigantic Vittobha Krishna with hands resting on his hips, the microscopic distinction of features in the Vishnu avatar or even the aquatic bird Hamsa (swan) done with inventive gold leaf decorations. Only when one witnesses artists of the royal school lineage working with a hawk’s eye will one realise the amount of artistic sensibilities that determine the end-product, adds Bharathy who has nearly 60 intricately worked pieces put up at her Bengaluru boutique until April 30. The artist also undertakes customisation of Thanjavur and Mysore art for interiors. New techniques Thangaraju, an artist who has replicated several iconic Thanjavur works, says, “This is the age to replicate and revive so that people who cannot afford to bring home the originals can still enjoy them. Newer perspectives have come about in dealing with the base art while using modern materials.” Instead of tamarind seeds (that were used for gumming) to the now used Arabian gum, from squirrel’s hair for brushes to speciality grass for having the finer lines come through, from vegetable and mineral dyes used as natural colours to chemical paints, many features have taken a modern twist. “Originally embedded with precious stones and covered with 24-carat gold leaf, the artworks have travelled a long way,” adds Thangaraj.  Mysore paintings depict elaborate landscapes, darbar halls and elephants in contrast to the intensely rich picturisation of religious characters in Thanjavur paintings||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/reviving-indias-painting-styles/article34398127.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Chennai prices see a jump||Residential real estate in Chennai has defied all odds — including the impact of COVID-19 — and registered decent price growth (both new launches and housing sales) post the initial lockdown period. The growing home ownership sentiment amidst the COVID-19 exigencies has been further accelerated by offers and discounts by developers, and the lowest home loan rates in more than a decade. Resultantly, the previous quarter of Q1 2021 saw a 30% increase in housing sales in the capital city, when compared to the same period in 2020. In fact, buoyed by the housing sales growth over the last two quarters — Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 — we saw average property prices in Chennai record a 1% jump in the first quarter this year, against Q1 2020. Clearly, developers once again saw this period of renewed housing demand as an opportune time to increase average prices in the city. As per Anarock Research, average property prices in Chennai stood at Rs. 4,990 per sq. ft. in Q1 2021 as against Rs. 4,930 per sq. ft. in Q1 2020. Price growth in top 5 markets That average property prices in the top seven cities saw movement in Q1 2021, with most cities recording a rise of between 1% and 2% over Q1 2020. Chennai saw a 1% yearly rise despite being hit by the pandemic during the year. The top five markets in Chennai witnessing this upward trend for average prices in Q1 2021, as against the corresponding period in 2020, include OMR, Guduvanchery, Padur, Porur, and Madhavaram. The reason for the price rise is because these areas were among the top areas with maximum housing demand and sales in the last two quarters. All these localities have properties in the affordable and mid-segment categories — the two major segments driving demand in the residential sector in Chennai currently. Given the good sales, developers increased average property prices. Also, average prices in these localities have jumped anywhere between 12% and 19% over the last six years. Chennai recap OMR has been one of the top areas that witnessed a 1.9% yearly growth in average property prices — from Rs. 4,710 per sq. ft. in Q1 2020 to nearly Rs. 4,800 per sq. ft. in Q1 2021. Since Q1 2015, average prices in OMR saw growth of nearly 16%.  Average prices in Guduvanchery increased by nearly 1.5% during the period — from Rs. 3,950 per sq. ft. in Q1 2020 to nearly Rs. 4,010 per sq. ft. in Q1 2021. As compared to Q1 2015, the locality saw prices increase by 19%.  Padur also saw average property prices increase by 1.5% during the last one year — from Rs. 4,400 per sq. ft. in Q1 2020 to Rs. 4,465 per sq. ft. in Q1 2021. The average price appreciation in the last six years was 17%.  Porur saw average property prices increase by 1.3% during the year — from Rs. 5,940 per sq. ft. in Q1 2020 to Rs. 6,020 per sq. ft. in Q1 2021. In comparison to Q1 2015, the area saw 12% jump in average prices.  Average property prices at Madhavaram increased from Rs. 4,965 per sq. ft. in Q1 2020 to Rs. 5,030 per sq. ft. in Q1 2021 — rising by 1.3% during the year. In comparison to Q1 2015, the locality saw a 12% jump.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Designs for the future||Every year, April 22 is celebrated as Earth Day all over the world. I suppose it is a day for us to pause and reflect on how we have treated nature, and look forward to how we can minimise the disruption we cause it. The issue is we soon tend to forget until the next Earth Day is upon us. We need to find a way to keep our planet in mind at all times and ensure we leave behind a minimal carbon footprint. One way is to ensure our buildings are designed to minimise impact on the planet. In cities like Chennai, for example, we have come to a point where air conditioning is unavoidable, and has become a default requirement. Air conditioning uses excessively high electricity and is a significant contributor to global warming today — not only from burning of fossil fuels but also from the release of hot air into the environment. There are ways to reduce or even avoid the use of mechanical conditioning inside our built spaces. The first step one needs to do is choose building materials that are insulating. These are materials that do not let in much heat from the outdoors. Secondly, make sure there is adequate shading of these walls from direct heat, and lastly, keep in mind to have adequate cross ventilation within the indoor spaces in hot and humid places like Chennai. The good news about materials is that we now have access to multiple options. Hollow terracotta blocks, aerated concrete blocks, insulated panels are all good options. Double brick walls (with an air cavity between them) were very common in traditional South Indian homes. The factor to check for is the ‘U-Value’ of the material. The lower the U-Value, the better the insulating properties. Most materials today have data sheets mentioning this factor. Combining insulating materials with adequate shading by use of sunshades, balconies and verandahs will prevent direct heat from getting indoors. In hot and humid climates, adequate cross ventilation can provide the thermal comfort we require. Even when we are outside during a hot summer day, if there is adequate wind movement we don’t feel the heat as much. The key to achieving good cross ventilation within built spaces is to ensure the orientation of the building on site and the location of openings such as doors and windows are done right. Providing openings along the prevailing wind direction and then again in the opposite direction will lead to a draft or wind flow within the space. Another key feature in traditional South Indian homes was the lining up of the front and back doors. Another important climatic feature that has been forgotten in our modern urban dwellings is the provision of high openings or vents. Openings located at a high level, preferably just below the ceiling will push the lighter, warm air out. Courtyards are another key architectural feature that are not only aesthetic, bring the outdoors in but also allow hot air to exhaust. These are just a few factors to keep in mind while planning our buildings, which will go a long way in minimising the harmful effects on our planet.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Thumbelina among the lilies||Amidst work-from-home, many now organise their soirees around the telly and root for their IPL team, with diehard supporters wearing face paint and twirling a real white cricket ball. So, here are two ready images from these unusual times to get a grasp of the Cotton Pygmy Goose’s dimensions. Hold that cricket ball in the paw to feel a this bird’s weight. Expect the bird to be a couple of grams lighter. Hold that 10.1-inch WFH tablet to picture the bird’s length from bill to retrices. Expect the bird to be a couple of millimetres shorter. The Cotton Pygmy Goose is the Thumbelina of the anatidae family which constitutes ducks, geese and swans. While Hans Christian Andersen’s Thumbelina emerged out of a flower, the Cotton Pygmy Goose commonly glides around water lilies. Reasonably undisturbed freshwater waterbodies on the outskirts of Chennai and sections of Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur are known to support small populations of this pint-sized resident bird. Sufficiently filled, if not to the brim, waterbodies that have always enthusiastically hosted the Cotton Pygmy Goose come across as even more of a generous host. Over the last one month, birder E Arun Kumar has found Cotton Pygmy Teals paddling around in relatively good numbers at Nayapakkam, Nemam and Chembarambakkam lakes. “I have been seeing a good population of this bird at all these three lakes. At Nemam, on an average, 15 to 20. At Chembarambakkam, 8 to 12. At Nayapakkam, which is readily associated with Cotton Pygmy Goose sightings, it is 15 to 20,” elaborates Arun Kumar. For most other species, flocks of this size are hardly anything to chirrup about. For the Cotton Pygmy Goose, they make a significant number. Let us recall that the State of India’s Birds 2020 report has placed the Cotton Pygmy Goose under a concerning list — “Common Birds Showing Strong Long-term Declines”. Freshwater lakes and even ponds, its precincts rarely hoofed, and its expanse generously sprinkled with aquatic vegetation, particularly lilies, make a rule-of-thumb formula for assessing which habitats would suit the Cotton Pygmy Goose. “Wherever you have suitable vegetation, particularly constant lily growth, there is a good chance of sighting the Cotton Pygmy Goose. Thenneri and Nayapakkam are among those places. Right outside SSN, there is a small lake marked by lily growth, and it has a flock of ten birds,” says eBird reviewer Vikas Madhav Nagarajan. “Chembarambakkam lake is the best place to sight this species. It has a very healthy population, so does Nayapakkam” The bird is conspicuously rare within urban Chennai, a fact underlined by the scant records of the species from habitats one would intuitively expect it to be drawn to. It is remarkable that freshwater lakes in the outskirts that are not significantly marred by pollution fare better in drawing the Cotton Pygmy Goose. A study of the records of the bird in and around Chennai bear this out. It suggests that the bird has a lower tolerance threshold for polluted waterbodies. “The Pygmy Cotton Goose prefers waterbodies a little cleaner than the ones found in the urban environment. That is an area that needs to be validated with more observations,” says ornithologist V Santharam. Is this bird likely to be found in ponds? What applies to the lakes apply to the ponds as well? At pain of repetition, ponds with suitable vegetation, particularly lilies, may appeal to the Cotton Pygmy Goose, provided they meet two other critical requirements. “Any lily pond found in a place marked by quiet, and where the birds would not be easily disturbed can technically be a place for this species,” says Vikas. Arun Kumar weighs in: “I have not seen them in ponds around our place, only in Rajasthan and Gujarat. In Gujarat, a guide once took me to a place to show me what he called a rare bird. He led me to a small pond and showed me the Cotton Pygmy Goose. I did not want to dampen his excitement, and so played along, sounding surprised.” (’Home Ground’ is a weekly column about the resident birds of Chennai and surrounding areas that are not commonly seen)  The Pygmy Cotton Goose prefers waterbodies a little cleaner than the ones found in the urban environment||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/thumbelina-among-the-lilies/article34398028.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Buddies across the age divide||You probably have an acquaintance who sends that infuriatingly inane ‘Good morning!’ message and slides into silence that is broken 24 hours later with another ‘Good morning!’. It is probably going on for eons and you have trained yourself to ignore that greeting. Or, you are probably that acquaintance persistently posting that well-intentioned but pointless greeting, morning after morning. Here is reason to forgive yourself if you are one. ‘Good morning’ and similarly unimaginative off-the-rack two-word and one-word online salutations have received a step-up, being hailed as life-savers in a big gated community in Padur. Mantri Synergy Owners Association (MASOWN) encourages small buddy-groups, where one young resident “adopts” one or two seniors who are out on their own. This clutch of residents is closeted in a WhatsApp group that abounds in monosyllabic conversations. Sample this: A ‘Hi’ replied with an abrupt ‘Yes’. On a chattier note, a “How are you?” eliciting a “Fine”. A recent accident involving a senior and a couple of similar incidents earlier have led the Association to launch an initiative that identifies resident-volunteers as helper-friends for home-alone seniors, explains Soman Panicker, secretary, MASOWN. “A month ago, a senior living alone had a fall in the bathroom, breaking her hip and a hand. It was with difficulty she managed to find help,” elaborates Panicker. (Read box “A harrowing experience”). “Following this incident, a senior citizen asked me if it would be possible to form an SOS group.” These small, buddy groups are offshoots of a master online-offline group that throws seniors and their benefactors together. First of all, a “census” of senior citizens was undertaken. “When I tried to get some volunteers, the response was spontaneous. Twenty-five volunteers came forward to join the initiative,” begins Soman, adding that around 30 senior citizens joined, tacitly expressing their need for help. “So, we formed a WhatsApp group. As the next step, we started the adoption process. Volunteers in every block would identify home-alone seniors. There are nine blocks. These volunteers are expected to take care of seniors in their block, and then others. In the small groups, one volunteer takes care of one or two seniors, staying constantly in touch, checking on their well-being continually.” The initiative has reached the tail-end of a critical process: Getting to know the seniors better. “Now, we are in the process of collecting data, including the seniors’ medical conditions and information about their relatives — their contact details, and so on. That data bank will be with the Association, and one copy will be pasted on the fridge or in a prominent place in that individual’s flat. In an emergency, this data would prove invaluable. Around 80 p.c. of this process has been completed,” the secretary says. While medical emergencies may readily come to mind, this initiative also covers the workaday irritants of life, which can prove more debilitating when coupled with advanced age. So, the volunteers are expected to source medicine or groceries, or help the seniors draw money from the bank. It sounds like full-fledged commitment. On Old Mahabalipuram Main Road, young residents go where projects lead them. Even in the normal course, many youngsters may regularly travel to their hometown. Wouldn’t that disrupt the smooth functioning of this initiative? Says Soman, “The system is being designed in such a manner that for every dedicated volunteer, there is another on standby.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/buddies-across-the-age-divide/article34398021.ece

Rekha quizzed them about whether the older population — particularly, their parents and parents-in-laws — at their home had taken the vaccination. They answered in the negative, and Rekha arranged for a doctor-friend to drop in at the restaurant. It was an AMA with the doctor, who spoke to them patiently about the science around vaccination and the necessity of getting vaccinated. “We need to understand that people may be hesitant when they are trying out something new. Before encouraging them to get vaccinated, it is important to remove the fears around it from their mind,” says Rekha, adding that the doctor clarifying various question should have helped them. There are also cases of residents dropping their domestic help and other helpers in their employment, at the nearest UPHC for vaccination. Another recurrent feature of the season is residents giving their domestic help an extra off day, so that they could be home taking care of themselves through the expected minor side effects. For instance, the Arunachalams, who live in Tambaram, gave their cook and helper a day off from work. Of the 150 people who got vaccinated during a drive organised by the residents of Valmiki Nagar in coordination with an Urban Primary Health Centre, a good number were support staff — watchmen, house maids, drivers and vendors. “When health officials refused to offer the jab to some of the support staff from our colony, we had residents go with them and speak to the officials on their behalf,” says Jayanthi Premchandar, resident-volunteer, Valmiki Nagar. The fact that the camp was organised, she says, within walking distance from their workplace, was a big driver in getting them to get vaccinated. Says Jayanthi, “We wanted them to make the most of it, and they did.”  The doctor spoke about the science around vaccination and the necessity of getting vaccinated||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-timely-word-for-the-support-staff/article34398031.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Quick off the blocks||First-time visitors to RWD Lemongraz can mistake an enclosed space for a generator room. Or any other regular facility. A poster “We have Earth and no Planet B” is a strong hint of what lies inside. Still, in most probability, not many may associate the space with composting, the reason being that the 129-unit gated community at Kallikuppam in Ambattur is just a year old. The wet waste generated by the community is being composted at this enclosed space. When the residents received the keys to their flats, they started out with a green advantage. In November, when the State Government relaxed various lockdown restrictions, the developer opened the composting facility even as many residents started taking possession of their flats. (The apartment is still under the maintenance of the developer and a residents’ association is yet to be formed). “More than 90% of the flats are occupied and the developer, who has established a similar in situ composting facility at another project in Chennai, wanted to promote source segregation among residents,” says Senthil T, general manager, facility, RWD Lemongraz. Residents received blue and green bins for them to segregate the waste to be handed over to the house-keeping staff, who carry out door-to-door garbage collection within a stipulated time. The process The organic waste is brought to the composting facility where it is shredded in an eco-friendly waste converter and mixed with saw dust before being placed in the curing tank. “Another layer of waste will be added the next day, after following the same process. Once the cement tank fills up, it is kept closed for 20 days,” says Senthil, adding that 15 kilos of compost has been generated since the initiative was launched, and used in the garden. Getting residents to see the merits of in situ composting facility took some doing. “Many residents had objected to the idea that it would exude a foul smell but we have proved them wrong,” says Senthil. When the residents had barely moved, the facilities team went to every house and handed out literature about source segregation. While non-biodegradable waste like paper and plastic are given to recyclers once a month, solid waste like diapers are wrapped separately and collected by the Corporation’s conservancy workers. “If a household does not segregate waste, we meet them in person and explain the importance of this exercise. If they continue to not segregate waste, we post messages on the WhatsApp group without mentioning the flat number that waste from such families would not be collected,” says Senthil, adding that the response so far has been encouraging. R. Ravi Kumar, a resident, believes the composting facility would turn out to be a big boon in the long run. “At my previous apartment, we segregated waste but depended on conservancy workers for waste collection. If they did not turn up, there would be a problem on our hands,” says Ravi Kumar. To ensure every resident takes up waste management in earnest, residents have drafted a bye-law. Ravi Kumar explains, “Even if the owner is letting out his flat for rent, they partly share the responsibility for ensuring that the tenant continues waste segregation.”  (‘Green Neighbourhoods’ spotlights initiatives that communities are persisting with, despite the pandemic)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/quick-off-the-blocks/article34398036.ece

Federation secretary NK Raja points out that in October 2020 and January 2021, the Federation made a representation to the Perumbakkam village panchayat seeking that roads in Nesamani Nagar be relaid. “Nesamani Nagar Second Street and Sixth Street have to be relaid. The former received concrete surface over five years ago. In newly-developed areas, roads have not been laid till date. The Panchayat passed a resolution about this in a recent meeting, but it has not translated into action,” says Raja. The federation secretary recalls how following the Federation’s requests and follow-ups with the CM’s Cell, roads in Golden Castle Layout and Nesamani Nagar Ninth Street in May 2020, were relaid. “The Panchayat cites fund crunch for the delay in carrying out pending road work,”says Raja. “We request the Department of Panchayat Administration to allocate the necessary funds for the road work.” A Perumbakkam panchayat official says, “The issue will be taken with the Block Development Officer in St. Thomas Mount Panchayat Union.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/perumbakkam-federation-persists-with-old-demand/article34397999.ece

Putting it differently, it aims to understand how residents are meeting their water requirements. How much are they on the piped supply from Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB)? On groundwater sources? And on private water suppliers? The centre’s founder-cum-director, Sekhar Raghavan says, “This survey should inform us whether CMWSSB’s water supply is uniform across Gandhi Nagar or not. If there are any differences in the distribution of CMWSSB’s water supply, the exercise will try to understand those reasons. These findings will help us to explore ways to improve the groundwater source and also to evaluate the option of digging an open well to tap the shallow aquifer. The ultimate objective of this survey is to make Gandhi Nagar self-sufficient with respect to water.” The questionnaire can be accessed athttp://bit.ly/3vNUapy.

These residents of Pudupakkam have placed this request with the Department of Posts, Chennai, on the basis that the situation meets certain pre-conditions from the department. As per norms, there should be a population of over 3,000 people; and a minimum of three kilometres should separate the location of an existing post office and the one where the new post office is being proposed. Pudupakkam has around 15,000 residents, says Association president A. Devananth.

With waste pile-ups, it was earlier an eyesore. Now, it is clean and with potted plants, even pleasant to the eye. Tansi Nagar Residents Welfare Association effected this change. M Balakrishnan, Association’s general secretary, narrates how it came about. “For many years, at this spot in 12th Street, garbage would be strewn around the bins. We have made many oral complaints to Greater Chennai Corporation, seeking the removal of the bins as they had been placed near a school. But of no avail. When Urbaser Summet took up conservancy operations in Velachery in October, the garbage bins went, as door-to-door waste collection had been introduced at 12th Street. However, a good number of people continued to dump garbage in that spot. Hence, the conservancy services provider drew kolams there to drive home the message that this space was not meant for dumping garbage. But that made no difference. So, with some residents’ support, our Association sought to tackle this issue this January. We had the space cleaned and fenced. Potted plants were kept. We also installed a board requesting residents’ cooperation to keep the place clean. With this initiative, the menace gradually stopped. A few residents of 12th Street and conservancy workers played their role by confronting violators.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/fenced-protected-and-greened/article34398014.ece

Amma Park, as it is called, saw the light in March 2019, and according to the Association, its maintenance leaves a lot to be desired. Association treasurer V GN Prasad says, “From the time the park was opened, the Panchayat has not maintained it well. This situation led the Association to partly participate in its maintenance, which includes employing a security-guard who doubles as a gardener. The association has also spent towards repairing some play equipment.” “Four lamps at the park have not been functioning for six months. The washroom is under lock and key for days. The compound wall around the park has developed cracks. Sewage from the septic tank has not been cleared for days. Private service providers demand anywhere between Rs.1,200 and Rs.1,400 for clearing 10,000 litres of sewage. The Panchayat should address these issues,” says a resident on condition of anonymity. A Perumbakkam Village Panchayat official says, “As the park is under its control, Perumbakkam Village Panchayat will address these issues. However, the responsibility of sweeping and watering the plants rests the local residents’ association.” KAMPERS Welfare Association represents Kailash Nagar, Mookambigai Nagar, Perumal Nagar, Rathinam Nagar, Sairam Nagar, Shanthi Nagar, Gurudev Colony, Indira Priyadarshini Nagar, Krishna Nagar, Prabhu Nagar, and Anandammal Nagar in Perumbakkam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/two-year-old-perumbakkam-park-cries-for-maintenance/article34398016.ece

Mister and missus would tamely and devotedly follow each other’s tail as they paddle around the lilies, hardly seeming to tire of each other’s company. Even in a flock, the species maintains a picture of domestic harmony, each bird seemingly at peace with its partner. “Most of the time, you can see the male and the female flying together,” remarks birder E Arun Kumar. Partly due to what is popularly expected of the Cotton Pygmy Goose, a lone female bird at the Sholinganallur marsh land, also known as the Perumbakkam wetland, has attracted greater attention among birders. Birder Rama Neelamegam underlines how this particular bird reconciles two seemingly antithetical behaviours. It does not seem troubled by not having the company of its own kind, but does seem to enjoy and seek the company of other species. Rama observes, “Surprisingly, at the Sholinganallur marsh land, there is this lone female Cotton Pygmy Goose that is seen hanging out with moorhens and coots.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-lone-presence/article34398026.ece

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||The nest facts||In India, the Cotton Pygmy Goose breeds between June and August, seeking tree hollows to build its nests. The species belongs to a category called “perching ducks”. Birders around Chennai are given to speculation if the bird could be breeding around certain locations popular for sighting this species. Waterbirds’ movement is dictated by availability of water. With many lakes around Chennai still sufficiently filled, can the bird be expected to breed in nearby locations? That is a possibility, concedes ornithologist Santharam, and goes on to make a broader but pertinent observation about the breeding behaviour of birds in areas where the North-East Monsoon is the primary monsoon. “The breeding season for most waterbirds as given by Salim Ali and others coincides with the South West Monsoon. In the Chennai area, many birds do not breed during that time. They skip that part because they do not have enough water and they start breeding only a little later, waiting for the North-East Monsoon, when at Vedanthangal and other places birds are actually nesting, that is in October and November, which is actually very different from the rest of the country where June-July-August is when the breeding happens.” Santharam further observes: “Resident birds can also engage in local migration for the purpose of breeding. For example, the Pond Herons and Cattle Egret disappear from neighbourhoods around Chennai in mid-June, and would be seen flying towards the north. And then in mid-October and early November, a large number of these birds can be seen flying southwards.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-nest-facts/article34398024.ece

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||A harrowing experience and an eye-opener||Residents of Mantri Synergy cannot believe it happened to Geetha Viswanathan. She herself is struck by the unlikelihood of it. Though 71, Geetha is known for running her life with uncommon elan. By her own admission, she takes pride in being “very independent” where she chooses to punctuate “very” by four repetitions of the word. An entrepreneur running a fashion-technology institute and a former president at her community’s association, Mantri Synergy Owners’ Association, she reveals that “going through this experience was not easy for me.” Besides, it has turned out to be an eye-opener. Without any health issues, Geetha had not thought through possible medical emergencies, and kept handy options on the ready. That morning, just before heading out of the rest-room, she tried to clear a “black insect off a clean bathroom floor”. “While trying to wipe it off with my feet, I lost my balance and had a great fall, which left me fractured on the right side of the pelvic bone and on the right hand. Unable to pull myself up, I knew I was trapped inside.” The door was latched on the top. Excruciated by efforts to drag herself on the floor and locate her mobile phone, she would not dare imagine standing up and unlatching the door. When managed to drag herself to the phone only to realise lack of signal had rendered it temporarily useless. “I would have tried hundreds of numbers. I tried those of all the committee members, but none of the calls was going through. There was no signal. When I managed to reach a security lady, the signal being patchy, she hung up, not having heard what I communicated to her,” recalls Geetha. “Luckily, the waste collection people arrived. A woman-worker rang the bell. I cried out my need for help, saying the door should be broken open. She heard me. Within 10 minutes, the carpenter arrived. All the committee members had come.” Geetha’s children were informed and medical help was promptly arranged for. Geetha points out it was her will-power that came to her aid in the seemingly interminable moments when she had to handle the crisis helplessly locked inside her home. It was still anything but easy. Geetha visualises how most other home-alone seniors would have handled this situation. She concludes that MASOWN’s initiative to help home-alone seniors with volunteers is the best thing to have happened to them.  I would have tried hundreds of numbers. I tried those of all the committee members, but none of the calls was going through. There was no signal.

A member of Dignity Foundation, 70-year-old Lakshmi is a volunteer with the helpline programme that calls upon ‘home-alone’ senior citizens who want to talk to somebody. Lakshmi calls a senior citizen from the list provided to her by the Foundation. She has also drawn up her own list of seniors who need such help. “I have at least one caller a day. There are days when more than two would call. The average duration of these calls lies somewhere between 15 minutes and an hour,” says Lakshmi, who has been engaged in this service for many years now. Many seniors, she says, are happy talking/venting out to another senior citizen and bond better when the the other person is on the same wave-length. Before the pandemic, Lakshmi visited some of these seniors at their home to play a game of carrom-board with them, accompany them to the hospital or read a book for them. Dignity Foundation has 11 volunteers, including a few college students, who have signed up to offer this kind of service to anyone calling on their helpline number (6380080496). “For college students, we offered a small stipend as travel allowance but due to the pandemic, we do not have home visits now,” says Felista Jose, Chennai chapter head, Dignity Foundation. She says this service is open to anyone who is aged above 60. “We have not promoted this initiative optimally. If a caller requests that they want to speak to someone on a regular basis, we arrange for it,” says Felista. HelpAge India also offers a similar kind of service where calls coming to their helpline number (1800 180 1253) are attended by one of the staff. “Last year, we also ran errands for seniors. That has however become a challenge in these times,” says R. Muthukrishnan, senior manager, HelpAge India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/support-for-home-alone-seniors/article34398022.ece

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Cops become mid-road counsellors||It a customary practice for the traffic police to issue a challan and then counsel motorists, especially youngsters among them, who overstep the rules of the road. The pandemic has caused their “counseling workload” to spike sharply. Take the case of the Harrington Road junction in Chetpet. The Chetpet police personnel manning the junction look for motorists with the missing face mask, wave them down, and give away a free face to them. On an average, every day, these pwesonnel give away face masks to around 70 motorists, mostly youngsters. This gesture is preceded by five minutes of counselling. After handing over a face mask to the motorist, the police ensure they leave with the mask lodged where it should be. The initiative to counsel violators of COVID-19 safety protocols and also provide them with free face masks was initiated by Chellapa, inspector (L&O), Chetpet police station (G-7) a few months ago. At the field level, the initiative is executed by two sub-inspectors — G. Ramalingam at Harrington Road junction and Ravikumar, near the Chetpet bridge, as these are are two key intersections within the limits of Chetpet police station. “We also collect a token fine of Rs. 20 from repeat offenders as we monitor the traffic spot every day. We give a face mask to those who pay fine too. Our aim is that they should understand the need to wear face masks,” says 57-year-old G. Ramalingam, sub-inspector (L&O), Chetpet police station. The Teynampet police have put up big screen projectors on important roads, including TTK Road, Eldams Road, Anna Salai and SIET College Road to promote COVID-appropriate behaviour. The police have also drawn markings where those out there without a face mask are asked to stand, and then counselled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/cops-become-mid-road-counsellors/article34398076.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Thumbelina among the lilies||Amidst work-from-home, many now organise their soirees around the telly and root for their IPL team, with diehard supporters wearing face paint and twirling a real white cricket ball. So, here are two ready images from these unusual times to get a grasp of the Cotton Pygmy Goose’s dimensions. Hold that cricket ball in the paw to feel a this bird’s weight. Expect the bird to be a couple of grams lighter. Hold that 10.1-inch WFH tablet to picture the bird’s length from bill to retrices. Expect the bird to be a couple of millimetres shorter. The Cotton Pygmy Goose is the Thumbelina of the anatidae family which constitutes ducks, geese and swans. While Hans Christian Andersen’s Thumbelina emerged out of a flower, the Cotton Pygmy Goose commonly glides around water lilies. Reasonably undisturbed freshwater waterbodies on the outskirts of Chennai and sections of Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur are known to support small populations of this pint-sized resident bird. Sufficiently filled, if not to the brim, waterbodies that have always enthusiastically hosted the Cotton Pygmy Goose come across as even more of a generous host. Over the last one month, birder E Arun Kumar has found Cotton Pygmy Teals paddling around in relatively good numbers at Nayapakkam, Nemam and Chembarambakkam lakes. “I have been seeing a good population of this bird at all these three lakes. At Nemam, on an average, 15 to 20. At Chembarambakkam, 8 to 12. At Nayapakkam, which is readily associated with Cotton Pygmy Goose sightings, it is 15 to 20,” elaborates Arun Kumar. For most other species, flocks of this size are hardly anything to chirrup about. For the Cotton Pygmy Goose, they make a significant number. Let us recall that the State of India’s Birds 2020 report has placed the Cotton Pygmy Goose under a concerning list — “Common Birds Showing Strong Long-term Declines”. Freshwater lakes and even ponds, its precincts rarely hoofed, and its expanse generously sprinkled with aquatic vegetation, particularly lilies, make a rule-of-thumb formula for assessing which habitats would suit the Cotton Pygmy Goose. “Wherever you have suitable vegetation, particularly constant lily growth, there is a good chance of sighting the Cotton Pygmy Goose. Thenneri and Nayapakkam are among those places. Right outside SSN, there is a small lake marked by lily growth, and it has a flock of ten birds,” says eBird reviewer Vikas Madhav Nagarajan. “Chembarambakkam lake is the best place to sight this species. It has a very healthy population, so does Nayapakkam” The bird is conspicuously rare within urban Chennai, a fact underlined by the scant records of the species from habitats one would intuitively expect it to be drawn to. It is remarkable that freshwater lakes in the outskirts that are not significantly marred by pollution fare better in drawing the Cotton Pygmy Goose. A study of the records of the bird in and around Chennai bear this out. It suggests that the bird has a lower tolerance threshold for polluted waterbodies. “The Pygmy Cotton Goose prefers waterbodies a little cleaner than the ones found in the urban environment. That is an area that needs to be validated with more observations,” says ornithologist V Santharam. Is this bird likely to be found in ponds? What applies to the lakes apply to the ponds as well? At pain of repetition, ponds with suitable vegetation, particularly lilies, may appeal to the Cotton Pygmy Goose, provided they meet two other critical requirements. “Any lily pond found in a place marked by quiet, and where the birds would not be easily disturbed can technically be a place for this species,” says Vikas. Arun Kumar weighs in: “I have not seen them in ponds around our place, only in Rajasthan and Gujarat. In Gujarat, a guide once took me to a place to show me what he called a rare bird. He led me to a small pond and showed me the Cotton Pygmy Goose. I did not want to dampen his excitement, and so played along, sounding surprised.” (’Home Ground’ is a weekly column about the resident birds of Chennai and surrounding areas that are not commonly seen)  The Pygmy Cotton Goose prefers waterbodies a little cleaner than the ones found in the urban environment||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/thumbelina-among-the-lilies/article34398086.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Park in Kellys needs a facelift||A park opposite the G5 police station at AK Swamy Nagar First Street in Kellys would do well with some regular maintenance. The facility is littered and lacks lighting. For a park, it is shockingly low on greenery. In the evenings, younger children can be seen playing on the swing, under the supervisory eyes of their parents. Occasionally, older children can be seen playing a game of volleyball. Considering the park already draws visitors, efforts to maintain it according to the best standards possible would not go in vain. The space outside the park adds to the picture of squalor. Seized vehicles and scrapped garbage vans are dumped on the footpath. Clearing these unseemly non-runners, this space should be put to its intended purpose. Recently, Palani, who was working with Railways and a kabbadi coach, began kabbadi classes for children at the park. Spending out of his own pocket to purchase a big light, he recently fixed it at park, and with the help of children, cleared weeds and other unwanted vegetation to make the space usable. He has appealed to Greater Chennai Corporation to have ensure proper upkeep of the park.

The link road provides motorists with access to many neighbourhoods; and the dusty and uneven road is giving motorists a bumpy ride. The trench that connects the existing manholes and the new collection pits were levelled with coarse sand. Due to continual movement of vehicles, this spot has caved in. “The road has to be relaid completely because the whole of it got damaged due to the new pit work. Steps should also be taken to prevent wrong-way driving especially from Poonamalle High Road to Flowers Road,” says K. Mohan, a motorist from Kilpauk. Flowers Road is separated from other key stretches such as Ormes Road, Dr. Alagappa Chetty Road, Barnaby Road, Flower’s Road and Millers Road by a small triangular roundtana. This was an important work taken up by the department drainage overflowing from manholes on Flowers’ Street has been a perennial problem for residents in the neighbourhood. Decades-old narrow drainage pipelines have limited capacity to discharge drainage water from the congested neighbourhood. As a result, the drain on the stretch gets clogged regularly. To ensure free flow of drainage from these narrow pipelines, an additional collection pit was constructed. “The entire stretch will be re-laid and safety features such as reflectors will be provided soon,” says a Corporation official.  Steps should also be taken to prevent traffic violations, on the section from Poonamallee High Road to Flowers Road||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/dust-storm-on-flowers-road/article34398068.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Buddies across the age divide||You probably have an acquaintance who sends that infuriatingly inane ‘Good morning!’ message and slides into silence that is broken 24 hours later with another ‘Good morning!’. It is probably going on for eons and you have trained yourself to ignore that greeting. Or, you are probably that acquaintance persistently posting that well-intentioned but pointless greeting, morning after morning. Here is reason to forgive yourself if you are one. ‘Good morning’ and similarly unimaginative off-the-rack two-word and one-word online salutations have received a step-up, being hailed as life-savers in a big gated community in Padur. Mantri Synergy Owners Association (MASOWN) encourages small buddy-groups, where one young resident “adopts” one or two seniors who are out on their own. This clutch of residents is closeted in a WhatsApp group that abounds in monosyllabic conversations. Sample this: A ‘Hi’ replied with an abrupt ‘Yes’. On a chattier note, a “How are you?” eliciting a “Fine”. A recent accident involving a senior and a couple of similar incidents earlier have led the Association to launch an initiative that identifies resident-volunteers as helper-friends for home-alone seniors, explains Soman Panicker, secretary, MASOWN. “A month ago, a senior living alone had a fall in the bathroom, breaking her hip and a hand. It was with difficulty she managed to find help,” elaborates Panicker. (Read box “A harrowing experience”). “Following this incident, a senior citizen asked me if it would be possible to form an SOS group.” These small, buddy groups are offshoots of a master online-offline group that throws seniors and their benefactors together. First of all, a “census” of senior citizens was undertaken. “When I tried to get some volunteers, the response was spontaneous. Twenty-five volunteers came forward to join the initiative,” begins Soman, adding that around 30 senior citizens joined, tacitly expressing their need for help. “So, we formed a WhatsApp group. As the next step, we started the adoption process. Volunteers in every block would identify home-alone seniors. There are nine blocks. These volunteers are expected to take care of seniors in their block, and then others. In the small groups, one volunteer takes care of one or two seniors, staying constantly in touch, checking on their well-being continually.” The initiative has reached the tail-end of a critical process: Getting to know the seniors better. “Now, we are in the process of collecting data, including the seniors’ medical conditions and information about their relatives — their contact details, and so on. That data bank will be with the Association, and one copy will be pasted on the fridge or in a prominent place in that individual’s flat. In an emergency, this data would prove invaluable. Around 80 p.c. of this process has been completed,” the secretary says. While medical emergencies may readily come to mind, this initiative also covers the workaday irritants of life, which can prove more debilitating when coupled with advanced age. So, the volunteers are expected to source medicine or groceries, or help the seniors draw money from the bank. It sounds like full-fledged commitment. On Old Mahabalipuram Main Road, young residents go where projects lead them. Even in the normal course, many youngsters may regularly travel to their hometown. Wouldn’t that disrupt the smooth functioning of this initiative? Says Soman, “The system is being designed in such a manner that for every dedicated volunteer, there is another on standby.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/buddies-across-the-age-divide/article34398088.ece

Rekha quizzed them about whether the older population — particularly, their parents and parents-in-laws — at their home had taken the vaccination. They answered in the negative, and Rekha arranged for a doctor-friend to drop in at the restaurant. It was an AMA with the doctor, who spoke to them patiently about the science around vaccination and the necessity of getting vaccinated. “We need to understand that people may be hesitant when they are trying out something new. Before encouraging them to get vaccinated, it is important to remove the fears around it from their mind,” says Rekha, adding that the doctor clarifying various question should have helped them. There are also cases of residents dropping their domestic help and other helpers in their employment, at the nearest UPHC for vaccination. Another recurrent feature of the season is residents giving their domestic help an extra off day, so that they could be home taking care of themselves through the expected minor side effects. For instance, the Arunachalams, who live in Tambaram, gave their cook and helper a day off from work. Of the 150 people who got vaccinated during a drive organised by the residents of Valmiki Nagar in coordination with an Urban Primary Health Centre, a good number were support staff — watchmen, house maids, drivers and vendors. “When health officials refused to offer the jab to some of the support staff from our colony, we had residents go with them and speak to the officials on their behalf,” says Jayanthi Premchandar, resident-volunteer, Valmiki Nagar. The fact that the camp was organised, she says, within walking distance from their workplace, was a big driver in getting them to get vaccinated.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Quick off the blocks||First-time visitors to RWD Lemongraz can mistake an enclosed space for a generator room. Or any other regular facility. A poster “We have Earth and no Planet B” is a strong hint of what lies inside. Still, in most probability, not many may associate the space with composting, the reason being that the 129-unit gated community at Kallikuppam in Ambattur is just a year old. The wet waste generated by the community is being composted at this enclosed space. When the residents received the keys to their flats, they started out with a green advantage. In November, when the State Government relaxed various lockdown restrictions, the developer opened the composting facility even as many residents started taking possession of their flats. (The apartment is still under the maintenance of the developer and a residents’ association is yet to be formed). “More than 90% of the flats are occupied and the developer, who has established a similar in situ composting facility at another project in Chennai, wanted to promote source segregation among residents,” says Senthil T, general manager, facility, RWD Lemongraz. Residents received blue and green bins for them to segregate the waste to be handed over to the house-keeping staff, who carry out door-to-door garbage collection within a stipulated time. The process The organic waste is brought to the composting facility where it is shredded in an eco-friendly waste converter and mixed with saw dust before being placed in the curing tank. “Another layer of waste will be added the next day, after following the same process. Once the cement tank fills up, it is kept closed for 20 days,” says Senthil, adding that 15 kilos of compost has been generated since the initiative was launched, and used in the garden. Getting residents to see the merits of in situ composting facility took some doing. “Many residents had objected to the idea that it would exude a foul smell but we have proved them wrong,” says Senthil. When the residents had barely moved, the facilities team went to every house and handed out literature about source segregation. While non-biodegradable waste like paper and plastic are given to recyclers once a month, solid waste like diapers are wrapped separately and collected by the Corporation’s conservancy workers. “If a household does not segregate waste, we meet them in person and explain the importance of this exercise. If they continue to not segregate waste, we post messages on the WhatsApp group without mentioning the flat number that waste from such families would not be collected,” says Senthil, adding that the response so far has been encouraging. R. Ravi Kumar, a resident, believes the composting facility would turn out to be a big boon in the long run. “At my previous apartment, we segregated waste but depended on conservancy workers for waste collection. If they did not turn up, there would be a problem on our hands,” says Ravi Kumar. To ensure every resident takes up waste management in earnest, residents have drafted a bye-law. Ravi Kumar explains, “Even if the owner is letting out his flat for rent, they partly share the responsibility for ensuring that the tenant continues waste segregation.”  (‘Green Neighbourhoods’ spotlights initiatives that communities are persisting with, despite the pandemic)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/quick-off-the-blocks/article34398082.ece

These findings will help us to explore ways to improve the groundwater source and also to evaluate the option of digging an open well to tap the shallow aquifer. The ultimate objective of this survey is to make Gandhi Nagar self-sufficient with respect to water.” The questionnaire can be accessed athttp://bit.ly/3vNUapy.

Recently, 36 people got the jab at a camp conducted by the Greater Chennai Corporation at Fountain Plaza on Pantheon Road in Egmore. A team from the Urban Primary Health Centre came down to the shopping complex on the request of the Khaleel Shirazi Estate Owners’ Association, the shopowners management running the 45-year-old place. “The UPHC team came prepared to vaccinate 50 people; but could manage to get only 36,” says Association treasurer Vijay Bajaj, adding that the Plaza has nearly 200 shops that employ a few hundred employees. The majority did not meet the criteria. Association members opened their office doors for the initiative. Vijay Bajaj’s office played the perfect host with participants being offered beverages to sip. “I have two cabins and I gave one to the doctor and nurse to sit comfortably and attend to the people,” says Bajaj. Chairs were placed on the passage where participants waited before their turn came up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/vaccination-drive-conducted-at-iconic-shopping-plaza-in-chennai/article34398080.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||A lone presence||Seen in pairs, the Cotton Pygmy Goose is the waterfowl-equivalent of the Laughing Dove. Mister and missus would tamely and devotedly follow each other’s tail as they paddle around the lilies, hardly seeming to tire of each other’s company. Even in a flock, the species maintains a picture of domestic harmony, each bird seemingly at peace with its partner. “Most of the time, you can see the male and the female flying together,” remarks birder E Arun Kumar. Partly due to what is popularly expected of the Cotton Pygmy Goose, a lone female bird at the Sholinganallur marsh land, also known as the Perumbakkam wetland, has attracted greater attention among birders. Birder Rama Neelamegam underlines how this particular bird reconciles two seemingly antithetical behaviours. It does not seem troubled by not having the company of its own kind, but does seem to enjoy and seek the company of other species. Rama observes, “Surprisingly, at the Sholinganallur marsh land, there is this lone female Cotton Pygmy Goose that is seen hanging out with moorhens and coots.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/a-lone-presence/article34398085.ece

If you do, there is support to be gained from Viruksham, a non-profit engaged in tree-conservation and planting drives. Lt Col N Thiagrajan of Viruksham points out that the saplings are given away to people on two conditions. One, they would ensure the saplings are planted right, with enough space and the right spacing. Two, they would water the saplings on a regular basis till it turns into a plant or a tree that can be on its own. Recently, as part of World Earth Day, Viruksham along with Husky Moldings organised an event at Mahindra City, where 100 saplings were distributed to the staff working on the campus. The staff took an oath to nurture the saplings. At the event, Lakshmi TK, a psychologist and founder of Viruksham, spoke about the various means with which one can restore and balance the basic elements of nature.

With the old street lights having given way to LED street lights, the frown of painful concentration has now disappeared from the motorists’ brows. More than 15 LED street lights have been installed near the Puzhal intersection, with around 30 metres separating every two LED street lights. Earlier, most of the sodium vapour street lights on these two roads around where they met at the junction, were damaged. Most of the container lorries from the port that were heading towards Andhra Pradesh halt at the freight yards in Puzhal. The LED street lights can help in surveillance near the Puzhal junction as the rear side of the Central Prison is not too far from the junction. “Better street lights near the junction would help motorcyclists slow down from a distance, thereby ensuring their safety; it would also prevent petty thefts,” says S. Rajan, a motorist from Puzhal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/led-lamps-light-up-puzhal-junction/article34398070.ece

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||The nest facts||In India, the Cotton Pygmy Goose breeds between June and August, seeking tree hollows to build its nests. The species belongs to a category called “perching ducks”. Birders around Chennai are given to speculation if the bird could be breeding around certain locations popular for sighting this species. Waterbirds’ movement is dictated by availability of water. With many lakes around Chennai still sufficiently filled, can the bird be expected to breed in nearby locations? That is a possibility, concedes ornithologist Santharam, and goes on to make a broader but pertinent observation about the breeding behaviour of birds in areas where the North-East Monsoon is the primary monsoon. “The breeding season for most waterbirds as given by Salim Ali and others coincides with the South West Monsoon. In the Chennai area, many birds do not breed during that time. They skip that part because they do not have enough water and they start breeding only a little later, waiting for the North-East Monsoon, when at Vedanthangal and other places birds are actually nesting, that is in October and November, which is actually very different from the rest of the country where June-July-August is when the breeding happens.” Santharam further observes: “Resident birds can also engage in local migration for the purpose of breeding. For example, the Pond Herons and Cattle Egret disappear from neighbourhoods around Chennai in mid-June, and would be seen flying towards the north. And then in mid-October and early November, a large number of these birds can be seen flying southwards.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/the-nest-facts/article34398084.ece
24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||A harrowing experience and an eye-opener||Residents of Mantri Synergy cannot believe it happened to Geetha Viswanathan. She herself is struck by the unlikelihood of it. Though 71, Geetha is known for running her life with uncommon elan. By her own admission, she takes pride in being “very independent” where she chooses to punctuate “very” by four repetitions of the word. An entrepreneur running a fashion-technology institute and a former president at her community’s association, Mantri Synergy Owners’ Association, she reveals that “going through this experience was not easy for me.” Besides, it has turned out to be an eye-opener. Without any health issues, Geetha had not thought through possible medical emergencies, and kept handy options on the ready. That morning, just before heading out of the rest-room, she tried to clear a “black insect off a clean bathroom floor”. “While trying to wipe it off with my feet, I lost my balance and had a great fall, which left me fractured on the right side of the pelvic bone and on the right hand. Unable to pull myself up, I knew I was trapped inside.” The door was latched on the top. Excruciated by efforts to drag herself on the floor and locate her mobile phone, she would not dare imagine standing up and unlatching the door. When managed to drag herself to the phone only to realise lack of signal had rendered it temporarily useless. “I would have tried hundreds of numbers. I tried those of all the committee members, but none of the calls was going through. There was no signal. When I managed to reach a security lady, the signal being patchy, she hung up, not having heard what I communicated to her,” recalls Geetha. “Luckily, the waste collection people arrived. A woman-worker rang the bell. I cried out my need for help, saying the door should be broken open. She heard me. Within 10 minutes, the carpenter arrived. All the committee members had come.” Geetha’s children were informed and medical help was promptly arranged for. Geetha points out it was her will-power that came to her aid in the seemingly interminable moments when she had to handle the crisis helplessly locked inside her home. It was still anything but easy. Geetha visualises how most other home-alone seniors would have handled this situation. She concludes that MASOWN’s initiative to help home-alone seniors with volunteers is the best thing to have happened to them.  I would have tried hundreds of numbers. I tried those of all the committee members, but none of the calls was going through. There was no signal.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Support for home-alone seniors||Every day between 10 a.m. and noon, Lakshmi Ragunath’s calendar is blocked for what she calls ‘Happiness Calls’. A member of Dignity Foundation, 70-year-old Lakshmi is a volunteer with the helpline programme that calls upon ‘home-alone’ senior citizens who want to talk to somebody. Lakshmi calls a senior citizen from the list provided to her by the Foundation. She has also drawn up her own list of seniors who need such help. “I have at least one caller a day. There are days when more than two would call. The average duration of these calls lies somewhere between 15 minutes and an hour,” says Lakshmi, who has been engaged in this service for many years now. Many seniors, she says, are happy talking/venting out to another senior citizen and bond better when the the other person is on the same wave-length. Before the pandemic, Lakshmi visited some of these seniors at their home to play a game of carrom-board with them, accompany them to the hospital or read a book for them. Dignity Foundation has 11 volunteers, including a few college students, who have signed up to offer this kind of service to anyone calling on their helpline number (6380080496). “For college students, we offered a small stipend as travel allowance but due to the pandemic, we do not have home visits now,” says Felista Jose, Chennai chapter head, Dignity Foundation. She says this service is open to anyone who is aged above 60. “We have not promoted this initiative optimally. If a caller requests that they want to speak to someone on a regular basis, we arrange for it,” says Felista. HelpAge India also offers a similar kind of service where calls coming to their helpline number (1800 180 1253) are attended by one of the staff. “Last year, we also ran errands for seniors. That has however become a challenge in these times,” says R. Muthukrishnan, senior manager, HelpAge India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/support-for-home-alone-seniors/article34398089.ece

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I know I am not boring’||In the two years that she has been in our public consciousness, after the investigative six-part documentary Wild, Wild Country , Sheela Birnstiel has seen polarised opinions of condemnation and sycophancy. “I am a mirror for them. I reflect the other, so what they want to see, they will find in me,” she says, of people’s opinions and questions. “I accept both without judgement. People have a habit of dissecting, so they should have their pleasure, and I know I am not boring.” You see both sides — the demonising and glorification — in the way journalists, social influencers, and celebrities react to the 71-year-old, in a new documentary, Searching for Sheela . Shot by Dharmatic Productions across 22 days, during her visit to India in 2019, the film runs for 58 minutes. It begins and ends with her home in Switzerland, far from the life we saw her live in the previous documentary. In between are scenes from interviews and visits to her old family home in Gujarat — her first trip to India after almost 35 years.  Camera friendly  “My team found it [the movie] lovely,” says Sheela, who watched this movie, unlike the previous one. Shot in an observational style, by a team put together by executive producer Shakun Batra, it documents her navigation through people and places in India. When Batra looked at the rushes, he saw an “audience in need of this idea of redemption from her”. So the film became about examining how “someone like her who is carrying this weight” responds to people’s questions on her past with Osho: of assault, poisoning, wire tapping of which she was convicted in 1984, though now denies. “Some people wear their baggage on their face; I wear the baggage on my shoulders,” she says, in the documentary. In the film she seems, at times, to be laughing at those around her: “I feel like a dulha ,” she says, of the Raw Mango outfit before her interview with Karan Johar. At the event she tells the producer-director-host, “You know, I have bigger scandals than show business.” On a drive in a car she speaks to the camera matter-of-factly: “I didn’t want to become spiritual…enlightened, or learn about meditation. I have no interest in them.” At another time, pragmatic, when they’re in the hills: “Just don’t look down, there’s garbage; look up.” And reflective: “Life is multi-dimensional. There’s no black and white. They have shades of colours, shades of information.” At socialite-entrepreneur Bina Ramani’s residence, she manages to put a slightly overbearing Raghu Rai in his place. And at an event at Gurugram’s The Quorum, she does not react to a bizarre introduction: “Today we have the pleasure of asking her about her crimes, her past, and Osho,” checking, instead, with the team if they’d got some rest. The film doesn’t give answers, but Batra says that wasn’t his job. “My effort is to not try and over-simplify things and to not arrive at answers, because I don’t think I know the answers.” Sheela says she simply accepts how people react to her, even though they are “stagnant”, if all they want to ask her is whether she really did attempt murder. Instead, she wants people to ask about “the love that I feel, I felt, the work I have done”.  Life and love  Love is a constant through all her interviews, but it’s love for Rajneesh, the people she currently lives with, and her parents; she doesn’t speak of her three husbands and her daughter though. “After Rajneesh, I focussed my love on my parents. They suffered my dark days in imprisonment. I wanted to take their pain away, and in love you can take pain away from people,” she says. She also talks about the people with disabilities and those with complex mental illnesses she currently takes care of in her two homes called Matrusaden and Bapusaden. “I live with them, just the way I used to live with Bhagwan’s people in Rajneeshpuram.” Batra, whose forte has been films like Kapoor and Sons and Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu , says this experience has been different because in non-fiction “you arrive at the meaning after you’ve shot it”. In terms of the content, he says it’s difficult to flesh out any person in such a short time, least of all Sheela with her range of experiences. “I can make another six-part series and there will still be questions, because that’s just who she is. She is a person who leaves you with more questions than answers,” says Batra, whose parents were followers of Osho, and who “were not very fond of Sheela…” Even before Wild, Wild Country , Batra had gone to meet Sheela, with questions. Some days before the release of the movie she asked him if he’d found his answer: had he found Sheela? He still finds her an “enigma”. Perhaps the answer lies in Sheela’s own words in an old interview when she was at the height of her fame as Rajneesh’s secretary. In response to a reporter who asks what role she plays, that of Snow White or the wicked witch, she says, “Both.” Searching for Sheelaisnow streaming on Netflix.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Kiss and tell||Chi chi , and by that I don’t mean Govinda, what is our once great land coming to, I say? Read with much sadness that when the Delhi police stopped a couple in a car for travelling without masks, apparently, the woman and her husband behaved in a most unsanskari manner with the law enforcement officers. While the husband said, “Why did you stop my car? I was inside my car with my wife,” the woman — Shiva, Shiva — was heard saying “If I feel like it, I will kiss my husband. What will you do?” That this comes in the wake of 15,000 cheques made out by our brothers and sisters towards the building of a great monument, amounting to approximately Rs. 22 crores, bouncing like stuntmen hit by Allu Arjun is doubly devastating. Is this what we have worked so hard for? Is this our culture? Is this the citizenry that deserves a bullet train, the world’s tallest statue, windmills that can separate oxygen from hydrogen, Vedic internet, the extra 2ab in the (a + b)², Coronil, drought-reducing frog weddings, and a new movie from Akshay Kumar every three months? In our pristine culture, when did wives, heaven forbid, start kissing husbands this way, I say? Even if they are their own. And that too in public? And declare it shamelessly to the law? The job of wives, as we all know, is to wear 11-yard (inclusive of blouse piece) saris and stand demurely behind the doorway, one side of their faces illuminated by the flame from the kerosene stove making ginger tea for the father-in-law, mouths tightly shut, their eyes doing the talking. Provided they have helped the children with their Class 3 nuclear physics homework, packed them off to their virtual classrooms with a snack of Patanjali noodles in their tiffin boxes, pressed the mother-in-law’s swollen feet, politely brushed off the untoward advances of husband’s cousin from the neighbouring town, and made sure the husband’s shoes gleamed like mirrors before he went off to the club. Women, please understand, 20 lakh buck-nakedsadhushave dipped their body parts in the Ganga for the safety and well-being of our ancient nation. Before that, true patriots like the entire Bachchan family have taken time off from going to Maldives and clanged thalis , lit diyas and rung ghantis . All their prayers and efforts have been nullified by brazen mahilas like you who travel mask-free in their own cars, wear ripped jeans and speak of doing unspeakable things with their husbands. What will NASA and UNESCO think of us? What will our overseas brothers and sisters from Palo Alto to Palookaville, upholders of ancient Indian values, say if they hear of this? Don’t our women know that from time immemorial their desire, that terrible thing, is expressed by rubbing two flowers against each other and running away with a ‘Chi, you naughty,’ every time the husband bites his lower lip suggestively? What books authored by Nehru are you all secretly reading, betis ? Detox yourself by watching Ramanand Sagar’s old serial which is back on DD like a saviour from heaven. Don’t forget to have a cold bath from the water you’ve drawn from the well of your 3BHK. A final suggestion to the sister who wanted to kiss her husband: repent, behen , round up other misled sisters, and make yourself useful to the nation. Form a nari posse, and unearth the names of those 15,000 cheque bouncers. Try and persuade them in our uniquely gentle Indian way that they should pay up. You can’t cheat God, you know.

This year,Jallikattudid the same, but couldn’t make the final cut. What are we getting wrong? Vetri Maaran weighs in.       Whydo producers spend a lot of money sending a film to the Oscars if it does not have a fighting chance of winning?   Thereputation the Acadamy Awards has garnered over the course of these eight decades is so imposing that every film enthusiast wants the film he likes to win an Oscar. A few days ago, I got a message from an acquaintance saying ifAsuranhad gone to the Oscars it would have won! They feel they know it. In this context of having a brand value, most of our producers want to be part of the race, even if they don’t have a chance. And some of the producers are misinformed. In this day of getting your information online, some fans of certain films that are part of the screening think it’s in the competition and put it out on social media. This year there were more such incidents.   How can a regular film enthusiast spot the difference?  The only official category our films can get in is the Best International Film, erstwhile called the Best Foreign Language Film. That is selected every year by a committee consisting of members of the selecting body — an autonomous body, not functioning under the government. Sometimes if these international films are very impressive to the voting members, they are nominated in other ‘main’ categories as well, like Best Film, which are meant only for films produced or co-produced by American companies. We had the best actor award given to an international film forLife Is Beautifuland theParasitephenomenon happened last year.   For such screenings, do filmmakers have to spend money on promotions as they would if selected as an official entry?  It is unbelievably expensive. The Acadamy will give you one free screening for which very few voting members turn up. You can have around four paid screenings. I’ve forgotten the exact numbers. Most of these happen at boutique screens set up in star hotels. The most-liked are the Soho House screenings, for which you pull a lot of strings. If I remember it right, we paid $17,500 for that screening alone.

24 April 2021||Chandigarh,||Punjab CM calls for Centre-State parity in vaccination from May 1||Describing the new vaccination policy for the 18 years and above age group as unfair to the States, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday sought Centre-State parity in vaccination from May 1, while calling for urgent steps to ensure adequate oxygen supply. While his government had adopted all measures to minimise the demand for oxygen given its necessity in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients, the Centre must ensure compliance on allocation by liquid oxygen manufacturers in other States, Capt. Amarinder said. “This is not happening at present. Punjab’s supplies come from Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and there are reports of supplies being ‘hijacked’,” he said at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s virtual conference to discuss the COVID-19 crisis with Chief Ministers of the worst-hit States. On the vaccination front, the Chief Minister said that at the rates declared by one manufacturer, the cost to the Punjab government would be over Rs. 1,000 crore. He sought Central government funding for vaccination, with permission to fit the cost to funds available with the State Disaster Response Force in the interim. Regular vaccine supply must be ensured to maintain the supply chain to the last vaccination booth, he said, adding that due to supply shortage, vaccination in last one week has been slightly low, that is, around 75,000-80,000 shots daily. While Punjab had received fresh vaccine supplies on Thursday, the current stocks could last only for three days as the demand for vaccine is increasing, he stressed. Captain Amarinder also expressed concern over lack of clarity on the quantity of vaccines to be made available by Centre after May 1, and how manufacturers would regulate supplies to different States and private buyers. The State government, on its part, had constituted an Expert Group to advise on Punjab’s vaccination strategy for the 18-45 years age group, which States had been allowed to vaccinate at their cost, he said. Blackmarketing The CM also pointed to the shortage and blackmarketing of medicines like Remdesivir and Toci, which he said was creating great panic in the media and general public. Though the Central government was making efforts to increase their supply, clearer messaging was required to inform the public that these medicines were not magic wands, and also on the available substitutes, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-cm-calls-for-centre-state-parity-in-vaccination-from-may-1/article34397727.ece
24 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘Deploy Army to escort vehicles carrying oxygen’||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, during his interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the COVID situation in Delhi via videoconferencing here on Friday, asked that Army be deployed to escort vehicles carrying supplies from oxygen plants to various cities. While expressing gratitude to the Prime Minister for increasing the quota of oxygen supply for Delhi to 480 tonnes, the Chief Minister complained that only 350 tonnes from this quota could reach Delhi in the last 24 hours. “Sir, since the oxygen crisis has begun my phone keeps ringing. One hospital or the other calls to inform us that it has oxygen supply for only a few hours. When we ask the reason, we are told that the supply has been stopped beyond the border by one State government or another,” he said. “The citizens of this country have the right to all its resources. If there isn’t an oxygen plant in Delhi, will its two crore people not have the right to oxygen supply at all? Can States where oxygen factories are located stop it from reaching Delhi?” he said.   “I appeal to you on behalf of the people of Delhi and submit that if stern but constructive steps are not taken in this regard, a big tragedy can take place,” he said. “There are few States from where a significant quantity of our oxygen supply comes. I request you to call the respective Chief Ministers and ask them not to stop the supply meant for Delhi,” he also said. The situation at city hospitals was deteriorating by the day due to lack of oxygen supply, Mr. Kejriwal said. A ‘national plan’ to defeat the pandemic, he said, needed to be put in place. Mr. Kejriwal suggested, the Centre should take over oxygen plants across the country and martial units should escort vehicles carrying supply to their destinations. If this was done no one would be able to stall such a vehicle, he said “I also request that 100 tonnes of oxygen allocated to Delhi from Odisha be airlifted or brought by Oxygen Express [train]. Please help us bring oxygen from West Bengal in a similar manner, if possible,” he said. “We request a corridor to Delhi for 100 tonnes of oxygen intended for the city...

The order, which comes following a recent spike in deaths due to COVID-19, has attracted the ire of the teachers’ association, which said the task was not apt for someone holding the post of a teacher. “The teachers are deployed for monitoring of dead bodies coordinating with GTB Hospital with immediate effect. The teachers will, according to their shift, contact the nodal officer of GTB for the purpose and ensure that COVID guidelines are being followed by rightful authorities,” said the order issued by the sub-divisional magistrate of North East Delhi. “The teachers will also remain in contact with the DDMA Northeast authority and ensure that all calls regarding hearse vans be disposed of on time,” it added. On Thursday, Delhi recorded 306 COVID-19 deaths and 26,169 cases with a positivity rate of 36.24 per cent, the highest since the pandemic began a year ago. Ramnivas Solanki, the general secretary of the MCD Teachers’ Union, said: “The move to depute teachers for counting dead bodies in morgues is not apt for the post of a teacher, hence they should be relieved of this duty. Ever since the pandemic, teachers have been deputed for several tasks, including at isolation centres, vaccination camps, for distribution of food and other aid as well as monitoring implementation of restrictions.” “We demand that if during the course of duty, someone gets infected with COVID-19, beds should be kept reserved for them,” Mr. Solanki added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-govt-deputes-teachers-for-monitoring-bodies/article34397744.ece
24 April 2021||chandigarh,||Hooda flays ‘sluggish’ crop procurement||Former Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has hit out the ruling BJP-JJP government in Haryana of tardy lifting and sluggish procurement of wheat crop across the State. Mr. Hooda said tall claims of the government about smooth procurement process have fallen flat and farmers were suffering adversely. The former Chief Minister, who has been hospitalised due to COVID, said he has been receiving complaints from all over the State that procurement has not been timely, lifting was being delayed and several farmers have not yet received payments for their crops. “Besides government apathy, bad weather has increased farmers’ troubles as wheat in large numbers is lying under the open sky in the ‘mandis’ (markets) due to tardy lifting as the ready-to-lift scheme launched by the government has failed completely. The government claimed that under this scheme, the contractor would have to lift the wheat from the mandi within 48 hours but heaps of wheat in the mandis are themselves testifying to the complete failure of the plan,” the former Chief Minister said. Mr. Hooda said rain in the region has damaged the wheat crop. “The government should compensate the farmer for the loss caused by wheat getting wet in the rain and till then, tarpaulins should be provided in the mandis,” he said. ‘Shortage of bags’ Mr. Hooda alleged that there is a shortage of gunny bags in the markets and farmers are not even able to find a place to keep grains in the ‘mandis,’ which is delaying the purchasing process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hooda-flays-sluggish-crop-procurement/article34397733.ece
24 April 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha border entry curbs spark tension||A day after the Odisha government announced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all those entering the State from West Bengal, tensions ran high at various entry points, with people trying to sneak-in through the porous border. Odisha’s two districts — Baleswar (Balasore) and Mayurbhanj — border West Bengal. While the Baleswar administration has identified 44 roads through which visitors from West Bengal could enter Odisha, Mayurbhanj had 34 such entry points. At the Udayapur border check post, tension prevailed for an hour with people demanding immediate entry into Odisha. They alleged that as the “Odisha government had started a blockade at border in the morning after declaring 14-days of mandatory quarantine just hours earlier in the night, people who wanted to return home could not cope with new system at short notice.” Two grooms were stranded at the Jaleswar border post in Baleswar district, hit by the overnight order though marriages were scheduled well before the State government’s curbs. On Thursday evening, Chief Secretary Suresh Chandra Mohapatra announced that anyone entering the State from West Bengal side would have to undergo quarantine for 14-days at a designated institution. The decision was taken in the wake of the steep rise in COVID-19 cases.  Police patrolling Baleswar Collector K. Sudarshan Chakravarthy, who inspected various border points on Friday, said police were patrolling major entry points and people were allowed to enter after due registrations. “There are reports of people trying sneak through village roads and paddy fields. Farmers, panchayati raj institution members and villagers have been urged to keep a tab on newcomers in their village and inform administration,” said Mr. Chakravarthy. Similarly, Mayurbhanj district had requested all persons coming from West Bengal through two border check-points to register. “We have identified 34 different entry points. But, we are allowing people through two gates only. It is not possible to deploy manpower at every road and carry out registration. We will gradually increase entry points by expanding registration process,” said Sumit P. Parmar, Mayurbhanj Superintendent of Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/odisha-border-entry-curbs-spark-tension/article34397734.ece
24 April 2021||JAIPUR,||Gehlot seeks equitable resource allocation during pandemic||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday sought an “equitable allocation” of resources by the Centre for better management of COVID-19, while alleging that the State was being discriminated against in the supply of medical oxygen and Remdesivir. The life-saving medicines should be allocated in proportion to the number of active infection cases, he said. “The entire nation should remain united, rising above politics, in this hour of crisis,” Mr. Gehlot said at a video-conference meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the Chief Ministers. He said the Centre should give the highest priority to saving the lives in its COVID-19 management and ensure systematic supply of resources to the States. Mr. Gehlot said though Rajasthan had more active cases than several other States, it was given only 26,500 Remdesivir injections on April 21 as part of immediate allocation. The BJP-ruled Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh were distributed 1.63 lakh and 92,200 injections respectively despite both of them having less numbers of active cases. No attention had been paid to the ratio of active cases in the supply of liquid oxygen as well, Mr. Gehlot said. The Union government should also formulate a definite plan for making the diagnostic test kits available in sufficient numbers to ensure proper treatment of patients, he added.  ‘Under allocation’ According to the data released by the Rajasthan government, the State has been allocated 205 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen which stands to 1.64 cubic metre per active case, when calculated with the 96,366 active cases till April 21. On the other hand, Gujarat with 84,126 active cases was allocated 975 MT oxygen, which is 544.15% higher than Rajasthan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/gehlot-seeks-equitable-resource-allocation-during-pandemic/article34397729.ece
24 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Congress hits out at Delhi govt. over ongoing COVID crisis||The Delhi Congress on Friday hit out at the Delhi government for failing to tackle the surge in COVID-19 cases in the city. The party said that sick patients are not getting oxygen, while those developing symptoms are not being able to get tested on time. Delhi Congress leader Anil Bhardwaj alleged that due to reduction in number of tests in private hospitals and government hospitals, patients with symptoms were not able to get tested. “Some patients are critical, but have not received their test reports, without which hospitals do not admit them. If the Kejriwal government had worked to increase the number and capacity of labs during the last one year, this would not have happened.,” Mr. Bhardwaj said. He added that the situation on the ground is far from the picture that the government was trying to portray. Mr. Bhardwaj added that that while the people of Delhi and Corona warriors followed government guidelines, the governments showed negligence due to which Delhi is facing a crisis. The Congress said that if the Delhi government had set aside funds to set up oxygen plants over the past year, then this situation could have been averted.

After Fortis Hospital spent tense moments on Thursday, Aremtis Hospital in Gurugram put out a series of tweets on Friday saying that they were left with only three hours of supply. The supply to the hospital was not restored till the time of filing of this report. “SOS- Less than 3 hours of#Oxygensupply at Artemis Hospital, Gurugram. Last night’s commitment of delivering Oxygen remains unfulfilled. We request the government to help urgently [sic.],” said the tweet from the official handle of the hospital, during the day. It tagged the Prime Minister’s Office, Union Health Minister and Haryana Chief Minister. “We are living on a day-to-day supply of oxygen. Every morning, we have to make numerous calls to get a 24-hour supply. Doctors and other healthcare staffers are fatigued working round the clock. Lack of basic support, like oxygen can break their backs. It’s a pity that we are not able to help hundreds of people coming to our ER, gasping for breath. We have stopped chasing the lack of Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, ventilators. We request all now to provide us the very basic uninterrupted supply of oxygen” said a press statement by Dr. Devlina Chakravarty, Managing Director, Artemis Hospitals, Gurugram. A few hours later, Anjali Kaul, Medical Superintendent, Artemis Hospitals, Gurugram, released a press statement saying they were still waiting for the supply and it was “a minute-to-minute struggle for all of us”. “At present, we have 140 COVID patients at the hospital and around 50 patients are in the ICU. INOX is our oxygen supplier. Post the SOS message, we have been informed that oxygen supply is in transient, but so far we have not received it. For refill of cylinders, we have been going to different vendors wherever it is available. It is a minute-to-minute struggle for all of us,” she said. Ritu Garg, Zonal Director, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, in a press statement, said they continued their operations “on very thin margin of oxygen support”. “Seeing the surge in demand we are left at the mercy of our vendors and have to follow up with them regularly for supply. We have been coordinating with the local authorities,” she said. Columbia Asia hospital spokesperson said that they too had run out of oxygen last evening, but managed to get the stock after a little effort. Deputy Commissioner Yash Garg did not respond to calls.

The facility in Chhatarpur is being revived considering the unprecedented surge in COVID-19 cases, they added. “We are ready with a 500-bed facility at the SPCCC.

24 April 2021||April 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Cuarón and Tamhane’s enviable chemistry||When Gravity released in 2013, the space-thriller made more than $700 million worldwide, and won seven Academy Awards, including one for Alfonso Cuarón as best director.The Mexican filmmaker could have literally made anything he wanted at that point — Hollywood studios and stars were lining up to work with him. Instead, he went back to his neighbourhood in Mexico city where he’d grown up, and made a personal period piece called Roma that released to universal acclaim and ended up winning him another best director Oscar in 2018.As the whole world waited with bated breath to see what he would do next, he announced that he would executive produce a little known Marathi project, helmed by Court director Chaitanya Tamhane. And from thereon, The Disciple began its award-studded journey. Set in contemporary Mumbai, The Disciple is a deeply meditative film that follows the life of musician Sharad Nerulkar, essayed by Aditya Modak. “The film deals with an artistic ambition that is very specific, but the theme is highly universal,” says Cuarón . “It is about fathers and sons, about legacy, about the old world versus the new, how things change and how we adapt to it, how much we can accept ourselves, or how we have to follow the expectations of our parents. It is something that has really touched the core of audiences around the world.” The winner of the Best Screenplay award at the 77th Venice International Film Festival, it also has producer Vivek Gomber (who starred in 2018’s critically-acclaimed film, Sir ) on board, and is set to première in India this month. Cuarón and Tamhane first met through the Rolex Mentor & Protégé Arts Initiative for 2016-17. Four years on, the two are good friends and their mutual respect comes across in every interview they do together. On a Zoom call with The Hindu Weekend , Tamhane is understandably starstruck despite his collaboration with the Mexican icon (he says so in as many words), while Cuarón is his usual Zen self, doling out nuggets of filmmaking wisdom, and full of praise for his Indian counterpart. The duo talks about how international collaborations can drive Indian cinema forward, and how the pandemic has influenced their filmmaking. Edited excerpts:       The film is set in the backdrop of Indian classical music, and yet international audiences and critics have been able to resonate with it.   Tamhane: You create something with a certain intent and conviction because you believe in a story and its need to be told. Even before Court or The Disciple released, I had no idea how an international audience would react. We are talking about over 195-200 countries… it’s an abstract entity in that sense. I believe that the film and its themes — which talk about human aspiration, the personal quest for excellence and belonging to a certain tribe — are universal enough. In India, I feel a lot more confident that the film will resonate with people because it is an Indian story. The cultural specificities are what make it unique and original, and there are so many nuances, so many different undertones that an audience here will appreciate. Cuarón: The response to The Disciple has been amazing from the get go, right from when it premièred in Venice. And the word-of-mouth and reviews have been fantastic. Then came all these invitations, and it played at the New York Film Festival. This is Chaitanya’s second film. You know, I had to wait a decade or two for one of my films to be invited by the NYFF. Not only that, suddenly he starts getting these calls from Hollywood agents, actors and stars just embracing the film. There were already a bunch of people campaigning for the film to be in the Oscars, and disappointed that at the end, it was not the Indian selection even after so much support.        One of the biggest motifs in your films is the relationship between the subjects and their surroundings. In  The Disciple  , the city of Mumbai is almost a character. Is that due to your influence, Mr. Cuarón?    Cuarón: I agree with you, and I love that about the film, that Mumbai is really a character in it. But it is a Mumbai that is completely grounded; there is no romanticisation or judgement about the city. Ultimately, what I perceived from Chaitanya is an immense love for his city. I wish I could say I had any influence over him, but his mind is so stubborn! I don’t think anyone can influence him [laughs].. Tamhane: I have absolutely been influenced by him while being on the sets of Roma , and seeing the post-production work. Yes, I had certain inclinations, but Alfonso really gave me the courage to be even more fearless to push myself. For instance, like in many of his [Cuarón’s] earlier works, we used only one or two lenses throughout the film.       Could your film set a precedent for other local talent to collaborate with foreign filmmakers?   Tamhane: To be very honest, I sometimes have to pinch myself that this is actually happening, even the fact that Alfonso is with us, supporting The Disciple . I think of this as a combination of wild luck, a matter of extreme privilege, and a lot of stars aligning. I am nobody to comment on this, but yes, I do hope it does become a precedent of some sort. Cuarón: Yes, Chaitanya, because I watched the stars, not your film. I watched how they were aligned, and they really wanted your film [grins].       The protagonist’s frustration and insecurity is an emotion that has been dominant in many of us during the pandemic; do you think the film resonates that sense?   Tamhane: What all of us are doing in this pandemic is adapting to the situations in front of us, and that’s kind of what the character is doing. But it’s not a period of a year or two, it’s his entire life. I hope that this pandemic has given people time to sit back, switch off a little bit, and make them more receptive to a film that is meditative in its nature.       The Disciple premières on April 30 on Netflix.     I really believe that cinema is a country and film is the language… and the fact that they come from different places enriches that language and that beautiful country. I don’t make too many distinctions on if I’m going to see an arthouse film or something that is more popcorn; I can enjoy both. I can respect both, you know?
