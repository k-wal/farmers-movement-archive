They will be eligible to receive vaccines only at private facilities on payment, except in cases where the States decide to lower the minimum cut off age for eligibility for free vaccination to less than 45 years. In a letter to the States on April 23, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said: “Citizens in the age group of 18 years to 44 years shall be eligible to receive vaccination, on payment, from any of the private CVCs (COVID-19 Vaccination Centres).” He said those below the age of 45 would “also be eligible to receive vaccination from a government CVC in a State/UT where that State/UT decides to lower the minimum cut off age for eligibility of beneficiaries to less than 45 years, for covering such additional eligible beneficiaries from the vaccine stocks directly procured by the respective State/UT government from vaccine manufacturers”. “Since, the cohort of eligible beneficiaries has been significantly enhanced, suitable arrangements must be made to avoid overcrowding and consequent law and order situations, at the vaccination centres,” he wrote. Vaccine wastage With registration on the CoWIN portal opening for all above 18 from April 28, he added: “All vaccination slots at private CVCs will continue to be offered only for online appointment from CoWlN or Arogya Setu. On-site registration/appointments will be allowed only, if any doses are left in the last opened vial(s) so as to minimise vaccine wastages.” Vaccinations would remain available for frontline workers and citizens above the age of 45 at government centres free of cost from the Centre’s quota of 50% of vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/walk-in-vaccinations-will-not-be-allowed-in-the-18-44-age-group/article34410023.ece

His brother, Shyamdhar, 45, too appears to be recuperating well from the disease. But Mr. Kand says, “We were left puzzled when we tested positive for the coronavirus. We rarely go outside for shopping while vendors occasionally come to us. Our interaction with the outside world is limited.” One has to cross a small forest patch to reach Bikrampur, home to about 50 families. “If tests are conducted scrupulously, identifying people with flu-like symptoms, I am sure every home will turn into a COVID Care Centre,” Mr. Kand remarks. While COVID-19 is creating havoc in urban India, in Nuapada, it is infecting people and claiming lives silently. At Belpada village under Lanji panchayat of Nuapada’s Khariar block, 20 out of 30 villagers tested positive when rapid antigen tests were conducted. In Brahmanipada, under Sinapali block, 29 cases were detected in early April. Several villagers under Komna block refused to get tested after 23 persons there tested positive. COVID-19 has claimed 42 lives at Nuapada COVID-19 Hospital since April 8. If the deaths of patients who were referred to outside hospitals are taken into account, the toll in the past 20 days will exceed 60.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-stalks-odishas-remote-nuapada-district/article34410021.ece

He reasoned that Tamil Nadu should have an adequate stock as its active case-load had crossed one lakh-mark. In his letter, Mr. Palaniswami said that in the latest national medical oxygen allotment, the quantum for Tamil Nadu had been fixed at 220 metric tonnes, while the State would shortly require 450 metric tonnes, more than its production capacity of 400 metric tonnes. “Based on this wrong allotment [of 220 metric tonnes], 80 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen has been diverted from the manufacturing facilities at Sriperumbudur to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. This is based on the wrong position that the current oxygen consumption in Tamil Nadu is lower than the manufacturing capacity,” he said. He said that according to data from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, Tamil Nadu’s oxygen consumption had already reached 310 metric tonnes as against the allotment of 220 metric tonnes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/stop-oxygen-diversion-tn-cm-urges-pm/article34410075.ece

26 April 2021||Kolkata,||Trinamool sets great store by Kolkata||Eleven seats in Kolkata go to the polls in the last two phases of polling in the West Bengal Assembly election, and the Trinamool Congress has fielded political heavyweights to defend it. They include five senior Ministers in the West Bengal government, well-known sitting MLAs and key faces of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The State’s Panchayat and Rural Development Minister, Subtrata Mukherjee, one of the senior-most politicians in West Bengal, is defending his Ballygunje Assembly seat. Former Kolkata Mayor and Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim is contesting from the Kolkata Port. Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, the State’s Power Minister, is contesting from Bhawanipur, a constituency that elected Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to the Assembly in 2011 and 2016. Kolkata, particularly south Kolkata, has always had a special fondness for the Trinamool Congress and its chairperson, Ms. Banerjee. The city elected her MP seven times. Even during the height of the reign of the CPI(M)-led Left front government in the State, Ms. Banerjee could always count on winning in the metropolis. The Ministers contesting the election include Minister for Women and Child Development Sashi Panja from Shyampukur, and Minister of Consumer Affairs and seven-time MLA Sadhan Pande from Manicktala. Also among the Trinamool’s prominent faces from the city and its Municipal Corporation are former Deputy Mayor Atin Ghosh contesting from Kashipur Belgachia, and Debasish Kumar from Rashbehari. Both Mr. Ghosh and Mr. Kumar were prominent members and administrators of the civic body’s council. Nayana Bandyopadhyay, wife of Trinamool MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay, is defending the Chowrangee Assembly seat, and Paresh Pal is defending the Beleghata Assembly seat. In the 2016 Assembly poll, the Trinamool Congress won all 11 seats in the city, but in 2019, breaches began to appear in its fortress, with the BJP leading in three seats. The Lok Sabha elections also saw the BJP leading in 53 of the 144 civic wards of the city. Political observer Biswanath Chakraborty said that the Trinamool Congress remained better placed than the BJP. “Kolkata is the only district or region in West Bengal where the BJP has not been able to engineer defections in the Trinamool Congress leadership. In all other parts of the State, we see that BJP has been able to bring a section of Trinamool leaders in its fold, but the party’s [BJP] efforts in the city saw little success,” Mr. Chakraborty said. In fact, when the BJP fielded candidates from other parties in the Chowrangee and Kashipur Belgachia seats, they refused to contest, causing much embarrassment to the party. The BJP has fielded a few interesting candidates like Lt. Gen. (Retired) Subrata Saha from Rashbehari; actor Rudranil Ghosh from Bhawanipur; and footballer Kalyan Chaubey from Manicktala. The party has fielded relatively new faces like Priyanka Tibrewal from Entally and Sandipan Biswas from Shyampukur. The Samyukt Morcha has fielded candidates like the CPI(M)’s Fuad Halim from Ballygunje and Rupa Bagchi from Beleghata; and the Congress’s Santosh Pathak from Chowrangee and Shadab Khan from Bhawanipur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-sets-great-store-by-kolkata/article34409952.ece
26 April 2021||New Delhi,||Ignore rumours on vaccine: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 76th edition of “Mann Ki Baat” urged the nation not to fall prey to any rumours about the vaccine and said the free vaccine provided for those above 45-years of age will continue. His monthly radio address comes at a time when the country is in the middle of a virulent second wave of infections. The States ruled by Opposition parties have been attacking the Centre for forcing them to buy the vaccine at a price higher than what the Centre is paying.  “I urge people not to fall prey to any rumour about vaccines. You all know that people above 45 years of age get a free vaccine. Now, from May 1 onwards, the vaccine is going to be made available for every person above 18 years. The programme of free vaccines by the government of India that is going on now will continue. I appeal to the States, too, to extend the benefit of this free vaccine campaign of the government of India to the maximum number of people,” Mr. Modi said. The Prime Minister conceded that the second wave is “testing our patience”. “The second wave is testing the limits of all of us at enduring misery. Many of our near and dear ones have left us untimely. After successfully confronting the first wave of COVID-19, the country was full of enthusiasm, full of self-confidence, but this storm has shaken the country,” he said. Mr. Modi took the opportunity to speak to two doctors, two nursing staff and an ambulance driver. He first spoke to Dr. Shashank Joshi from Mumbai, asking him for clarifications on the difference between the first wave and the second one. Dr. Joshi said the spread now is much faster than the first wave. The primary difference, he said, is that this time, the young and children are also getting infected. On Remdesivir demand The Prime Minister also asked Dr. Joshi to address the question of high demand for certain medicines like the Remdesivir. “There is no need to run after Remdesivir. It has a limited role and should be taken strictly as per the doctor’s advice,” he said, advising people instead to do ‘pranayam’ (breathing) exercises. ‘Authentic sources’ “I urge you to seek information only through authentic sources. You may consult your family doctors. Many doctors are sharing information through social media, consulting through phone and WhatsApp. There are several hospitals who have put information on their website,” Mr. Modi said. Mr. Modi discussed the vaccine hesitancy with Dr. Naveed Nazeer Shah from the Government Medical College in Srinagar. He also commended Dr. Shah for working hard during the Ramzan festival. The Prime Minister also spoke to a nurse from the BR Ambedkar Medical College Raipur, Surekha, senior nursing in KC Jindal Hospital in Bengaluru, and ambulance driver Prem Verma, commending them for their services in these difficult times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ignore-rumours-on-vaccine-pm/article34409966.ece
26 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||70 tonnes of oxygen set to reach Delhi by train tonight||An Oxygen Express train carrying about 70 tonnes of medical oxygen is expected to reach Delhi by Monday night, the Indian Railways said on Sunday. The train, the first such service for the national capital currently facing a severe shortage of medical oxygen, is leaving from the Jindal Steel Works plant in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh, on Sunday night. “We will move about four tankers of liquid medical oxygen from the Jindal plant in Raigarh... the tankers are getting loaded there. We have already provided our wagons, which are ready, and as soon as the tankers are loaded, they will be moved tonight,” Railway Board Chairman and CEO Suneet Sharma said in a press conference. He said the tankers would reach Delhi by Monday night. In addition, the Railways had chalked out plans to transport medical oxygen from Angul, Kalingnagar and Rourkela to Delhi and the National Capital Region. Mr. Sharma said the Delhi government had been advised to get road tankers ready to obtain the oxygen. The national capital has been grappling with a shortage in oxygen supply for the past several days amid a huge surge in COVID-19 cases, with several hospitals even taking to Twitter to send out SOSs for liquid medial oxygen. Two journeys completed Mr. Sharma said that, so far, two Oxygen Express trains had completed their journey to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Further, while one such express with four loaded tankers is currently on its way back to Uttar Pradesh, one train with five oxygen tankers is travelling towards Bokaro for procuring oxygen. Each tanker carries about 15-16 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen. A Railways official said that the Delhi government, in its letter to the Railways, had asked it to load liquid medical oxygen from nine locations. The Railways has informed the State government that it will be able to transport liquid medical oxygen from seven of these locations. “The other two sites were not feasible due to technical reasons,” the official added. On deployment of its COVID care isolation coaches, Mr. Sharma said that 3,816 coaches are available, and are being provided to the States according to demand. In Delhi, 50 coaches with 800 beds are deployed at the Shakurbasti station where four patients are currently admitted, and 25 coaches with 400 beds have been made available at the Anand Vihar terminal. In Maharashtra, 21 coaches with 378 beds are positioned at Nandurbar and currently 55 patients are admitted at this facility. Twenty coaches have been positioned at the Bhopal station; 50 coaches have been readied for deployment in Punjab; and 20 coaches positioned for deployment in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/70-tonnes-of-oxygen-set-to-reach-delhi-by-train-tonight/article34409982.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. to allow India access to vaccine raw materials||The U.S. will immediately deploy supplies and other assistance to India, the White House said, following a Sunday call between the National Security Advisers of the two countries, Ajit Doval and Jake Sullivan. The U.S.’s assistance will include making raw materials for COVID-19 vaccine Covishield immediately accessible and pursuing options to generate oxygen “on an urgent basis”. However, there was no mention of the U.S. shipping ready-to-use vaccines. Over the past week, the Biden administration had faced growing criticism for not doing or saying enough about the situation in India.  The U.S. was “working around the clock” to deploy “available resources and supplies,” said a statement released by NSC spokesperson Emily Horne on Sunday. “Mr. Sullivan affirmed America’s solidarity with India, the two countries with the greatest number of COVID-19 cases in the world,” Ms. Horne said. The U.S. had identified sources of raw materials needed to manufacture Covishield and will make them “immediately” available for India, she said. Earlier this month, Adar Poonawalla, whose company Serum Institute of India (SII) manufactures the vaccine, had publicly appealed to U.S. President Joe Biden to lift export embargoes on raw materials. The administration denied that outright embargoes exist. However, as a consequence of the U.S.’s Defense Production Act (emergency powers that allow the government to control private sector production decisions), federal government purchase orders have to be prioritised over foreign orders. Sunday’s statement from Ms. Horne detailed other forms of immediate assistance. “To help treat COVID-19 patients and protect front-line health workers in India, the United States has identified supplies of therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators, and Personal Protective Equipment [PPE] that will immediately be made available for India. The United States also is pursuing options to provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis,” Ms. Horne’s statement said. The U.S. will also expand financing for BioE, a Hyderabad-based firm, to ramp up production to meet requirements of a vaccine supply programme that is being rolled out by the Quad. It will also deploy a team of experts to work with the U.S. Embassy in India. “The U.S. Development Finance Corporation [DFC] is funding a substantial expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE, the vaccine manufacturer in India, enabling BioE to ramp up to produce at least 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022. Additionally, the United States is deploying an expert team of public health advisers from the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] and USAID to work in close collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, India’s health ministries, and India’s epidemic intelligence service staff. USAID will also quickly work with the CDC to support and fast-track the mobilisation of emergency resources available to India through the Global Fund,” Ms. Horne said. “Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the United States is determined to help India in its time of need,” the statement said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reacted publicly to the COVID-19 wave ravaging India on Saturday, saying the U.S. would “rapidly deploy additional support”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-to-allow-india-access-to-vaccine-raw-materials/article34410458.ece
26 April 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha govt. to GPS tag all vehicles carrying oxygen||Following the chaos over oxygen shortage in Delhi and other States, the Odisha government has decided to tag vehicles carrying the cylinders with global positioning systems (GPS). The GPS tagging is expected to help authorities keep a tab on the movement of oxygen-laden vehicles from source points to hospitals. Issuing modalities for meeting the demand for oxygen cylinders, Additional Chief Secretary (Health), Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra, said, “The medical superintendents or chief medical officers will engage vehicles for transport of oxygen cylinders by utilising existing vehicles or by hiring private vehicles by following financial guidelines. The details of these vehicles must be shared with the local drug inspectors for GPS tagging.” Besides, the drug inspector of the district would have to ensure timely dispatch of the empty cylinders to the assigned fillers and inform his counterpart for timely filling of the cylinders, according to the modalities. Collection points Moreover, the drugs inspector would identify collection point in consultation with the medical superintendents and CDMO, and assign transport vehicles to each collection point. In Odisha, the current oxygen consumption hovers around 26 metric tonnes a day, the production capacity is around 130 metric tonnes a day through cylinders and 375 metric tonnes through liquid medical oxygen (LMO). In healthcare facilities, about 70 MT of oxygen is produced through cylinders and 60 MT through LMO. An LMO plant is likely to be operational in MKCG Medical College Hospital by second week of May. State government sources said procurement had been initiated for setting up LMO storage tanks at 15 locations, including at Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Burla. The government had started the process of procurement 8,000 D-type cylinders and 10,000 B cylinders. Besides, the Centre is setting up 14 Pressure Swing Adsorption plants out of PM Care Funds for ensuring oxygen supply at hospitals in district headquarters. Bed capacity Meanwhile, the State government claimed to have increased bed capacity including COVID-19 Care Centres beds with oxygen to 20,347. While, 2,140 (24.37%) beds out of 8,782 beds have been occupied, the occupation of ICU beds has gone up to 30.71% with 748 serious COVID-19 patients admitted in 2,436 ICUs. Of the 804 ventilators, 128 (15.92%) are in use.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/odisha-govt-to-gps-tag-all-vehicles-carrying-oxygen/article34410329.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Blinken promises to deploy additional support to India||U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday night reacted publicly for the first time to the second COVID-19 wave ravaging India, saying the U.S. would “rapidly deploy additional support” as the Biden administration faced growing criticism for not doing and saying enough about the situation. “Our hearts go out to the Indian people in the midst of the horrific COVID-19 outbreak. We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India’s healthcare heroes,” Mr. Blinken said on Twitter on Saturday, after the Biden administration had been widely criticised over the past week for not adequately supporting India, which is in need of vaccines and oxygen. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. and Indian officials and experts were in touch and that the U.S. offered “its deepest sympathy to the people of India”. She remarked on the historically high levels of health assistance the U.S. had provided to India. India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Mr. Blinken spoke last week and discussed the COVID-19 situation but the State Department was unwilling to get into any details of the call beyond the readout. Some people, such as Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India, had called on the Biden administration to lift embargoes on the export of vaccine raw materials. Others, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Asia policy specialists and lawmakers, called on the U.S. to donate vaccines from its stockpile of 30-40 million doses of unused AstraZeneca shots. The administration has denied that there is an “outright ban” on such exports. However, a consequence of the U.S.’s Defense Production Act (emergency powers that allow the government to control private sector production decisions) is that the federal government purchase orders have to be prioritised over foreign orders. “We are currently sitting on close to 40 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the U.S. stockpile, a stockpile which we’re not using … I respectfully but strongly call on the Biden Administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to countries hardest-hit by the spread of COVID-19, including India, Argentina, and potentially others,” Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat, said on Saturday. In March, a deal was struck wherein 4 million of these doses would be shared with Canada and Mexico. The administration has not announced plans since to send more such vaccines abroad. “@POTUSplease speak to@PMOIndiaand see if we can lend 10M doses of AZ vaccine like tomorrow. We must help now!” tweeted Shekar Narasimhan, founder of Super PAC (Political Action Committee) Asian American Pacific Islander Victory Fund. Some Democrats, including Democratic primary candidates, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, had asked Mr. Biden to support a waiver of intellectual property rights to facilitate the production of COVID-19 therapeutics globally. India has begun receiving supplies from other countries. Singapore sent Oxygen cylinders on Saturday and the UAE, Russia and the EU are in the process of sending medical supplies. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had posted a message of “solidarity with the people of India” on Twitter on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/blinken-promises-to-deploy-additional-support-to-india/article34409971.ece
26 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘No volunteer list under cyber scheme’||The Ministry of Home Affairs has said it does not maintain a centralised list of volunteers enrolled under the cybercrime volunteer programme since the police is a “State subject” under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The Ministry, through its cybercrime grievance portal, cybercrime.gov.in, aims to raise a group of “cybercrime volunteers” to flag “unlawful content” on the Internet. Digital rights group, the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), has said the programme enables a culture of surveillance and could create potential social distrust by encouraging civilians to report the online activities of other citizens.  ‘Sought directly’ In response to a Right to Information Act (RTI) application by The Hindu on the total number of volunteers who have applied under the Cyber Crime Volunteers Program of the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, the Ministry stated that the information could be sought directly from the respective States and Union Territories. State subjects The Ministry said in the RTI reply that “police” and “public order” were State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, and States were primarily responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of crimes through their law enforcement agencies (LEAs). “The Cyber Crime Volunteer Framework has been rolled out as a part of cyber hygiene promotion to bring together citizens to contribute in the fight against cybercrime in the country and assist State/UT LEAs in their endeavour to curb cybercrimes. The volunteers are registered, and their services utilised, by the respective State/UT LEAs as per their requirement. It is requested to kindly seek the information directly from the respective State/UT LEAs. The detailed programme document is available at www.cybercrime.gov.in,” the Ministry said in the RTI reply. Though the Ministry did not provide information in the RTI reply, according to its Output Outcome Monitoring Framework budget of 2021-22, the programme was expected to include 500 volunteers, 200 “cyber awareness promoters” and 50 “cyber experts”. MP’s poser In March, Biju Janta Dal (BJD) MP Pinaki Misra had asked whether “concerns of infringement of privacy due to surreptitious and mala fide intrusion into an individual’s online activities are addressed in this programme and its operating protocol”. The National Cyber Crime Ecosystem Management Unit, of which the Cyber Crime Volunteers Program is a constituent, is part of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) scheme launched by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in January 2020. The project was approved in October 2018 at an estimated cost of Rs. 415.86 crore. The I4C scheme that includes other components also has been allocated Rs. 69.80 crore in the 2021-22 budget.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-volunteer-list-under-cyber-scheme/article34409956.ece
26 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi extends lockdown till May 3 as pandemic rages||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Sunday that the lockdown in the city would be extended till May 3 in a bid to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, as patients continued to struggle amid the shortage of hospital beds and oxygen. At least 45 persons have died due to oxygen supply-related issues at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and the Jaipur Golden Hospital in the past few days, and the Centre and the Delhi government have scrambled to ensure adequate supply of oxygen to the city’s hospitals. “The lockdown was our last weapon against corona. We have spoken to several sections and have decided to extend the lockdown by one more week. We hope that this will bring down the positivity rate,” Mr. Kejriwal said. He added that despite the lockdown, cases continued to rise in the city. However, he said the positivity rate, which rose to 36-37% at the start of the lockdown, was showing signs of improvement over the past two days and, in the past 24 hours, had fallen below 30%. “This is not to say that the disease is ebbing, though that is the hope,” Mr. Kejriwal added. As desperate pleas from hospitals for oxygen continued on Sunday, the Chief Minister said the government had been working all night to ensure oxygen reached hospitals and patients did not suffer. “We have failed at times and have been successful at times. We need to manage our oxygen resources properly and have started a portal, which will update availability of oxygen every two hours.”  He added that Delhi needed 700 tonnes of oxygen and the Centre had allotted 490 tonnes, but this was still not reaching the city. “Only 335 tonnes reached the capital against our requirement of 700 tonnes. This is the reason for oxygen shortage and is proving to be a huge impediment in the recovery of COVID-positive patients.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-extends-lockdown-till-may-3-as-pandemic-rages/article34409963.ece
26 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘Vaccine roll-out for under-45s will be delayed’||Rajasthan, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Kerala, States ruled by parties other than the BJP or its partners, said the roll-out of vaccination for the 18-45 age group from May 1 will be delayed, since the manufacturers have made it clear that they can negotiate future orders only after meeting their prior vaccine commitment to the Union government. Rajasthan Health Minister, Raghu Sharma, said the Serum Institute of India, the maker of Covishield, told the State government that no vaccines were available till May 15. “The Serum Institute told us that till May 15, they may not even be able to complete the prior order of the Central government,” Mr. Sharma said. He was speaking at a press conference of Health Ministers from Congress-ruled States, T. Singh Deo from Chhattisgarh, Balbir Singh Sidhu from Punjab and Banna Gupta from Jharkhand. Mr. Sharma said the orders from the States will begin to be processed only after May 15. Mr. Deo said the BJP government was playing an elaborate joke on everyone. “Currently, we are producing close to seven crore vaccines, both including Covishield and Covaxin. If half of this goes to the Centre, then only 3.5 crore doses are available for the States to vaccinate those above 18 years. The 18-45 years category is at least 35-40% of our population. Just 3.5 crore doses for them ... this is a joke,” he said. Mr. Deo said the Centre was trying to misguide people and putting the onus on the States. He said the Congress-ruled States were not alone in this predicament. “The Assam government was told that vaccines will be available only in a month’s time. So where is the question of unrolling the vaccines for the 18-45 group from May 1 onwards?” Mr. Gupta said the Centre, before announcing the third phase of vaccine strategy, should have figured out the supply chain. The situation in Punjab, Mr. Sidhu said, is already critical. “We are practically hand to mouth.” The State has only been given 34 lakh doses, out of which 30 lakh have already been spent. “We only have four lakh doses right now.” He said due to limited supply, the State has not been able to expand the vaccine programme. Kerala is also facing a similar situation. It has just close to four lakh doses in stock now. The State, which was administering over 2.5 to 3 lakh doses per day, could administer only around 60,000 doses on Sunday due to dwindling supply. Though registration for the vaccination of those in the 18-45 years age group is being opened up on May 1, the State has already made it clear that vaccinations for this group can be conducted only when more stocks are available.The Health Ministers alleged that the Centre was already meting out a step-motherly treatment to their States. Citing the example of Rajasthan, Mr. Sharma said with 1.37 lakh active cases, the State’s quota of oxygen is only 140 tonnes, while Gujarat, with a little over one lakh active cases, has a quota of over 900 tonnes. Similarly, problems arose in the case of the Remdesivir drug too. “Our order was cancelled at the last minute ... We got 26,000 doses while our neighbour Gujarat got one lakh doses,” he said. Mocking the BJP, Mr. Gupta said a party that claims Kashmir to Kanyakumari is one country is now working on parochial lines.

26 April 2021||CHENNAI,||India records over 3.5 lakh new cases and 2,809 deaths||India recorded 3,34,198 new COVID-19 cases and 2,490 deaths till 9.30 p.m. on Sunday. The country has so far reported 1,72,85,965 cases and 1,94,800 deaths. Maharashtra reported 66,191 infections, accounting for 20% of the new cases, followed by Uttar Pradesh (35,614) and Karnataka (34,804). Maharashtra also recorded 832 casualties, followed by Delhi (350) and Uttar Pradesh (208). The figures do not include cases and deaths from Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Ladakh and Sikkim. The data is sourced from covid19india.org, an independent aggregator of daily figures. Cumulatively, the number of vaccine doses administered in the world crossed 1 billion on Saturday. The U.S. led the world in the doses administered, with 225.6 million shots given, followed by China with 220.3 million doses. India stood third, accounting for 140.9 million doses. However, in terms of population, India has administered only 10 doses for every 100 people in the country. In comparison, Israel administered nearly 120 doses per 100 people, the highest among major countries. Nearly 25.4 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the country in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Sunday. It is about 3.64 lakh doses fewer than what was recorded in the previous 24 hours. Also, it is over 1.48 lakh doses lower than what was recorded in the same period one week before. Over 17.19 lakh tests were conducted on Saturday (results of which were made available on Sunday), the third consecutive day with over 17 lakh samples tested. As many as 2,03,024 new recoveries were recorded on Sunday, taking the total to 1,42,81,103. Globally, India recorded the second most number of average daily deaths (2,165) until Saturday. Brazil, with 2,544 average daily fatalities, is leading in this category.

26 April 2021||New Delhi,||Use of liquid oxygen only for medical purpose: Centre||Invoking the Disaster Management Act, the Centre on Sunday ordered States that all liquid oxygen, including the existing stock with private plants should be made available to the government and will be used for medical purposes only. Earlier on April 18, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had written to States prohibiting supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, except for nine industries that include the pharmaceutical, petroleum, nuclear energy and steel sectors. Situation reviewed The order by the Union Home Secretary, who is the Chairman of the National Executive Committee under the DM Act, 2005 said, “The Central government has reviewed the oxygen supply situation and has decided that with immediate effect, use of liquid oxygen, including the existing stock, will be allowed for medical purposes only, and that all manufacturing units may be allowed to maximise their production of liquid oxygen, and make it available to the government, for use for medical purposes only.” The order said that under Sections 10(2)(I) and 65 of the DM Act, States had to ensure that “liquid oxygen is not allowed for any non-medical purpose” and all stocks to be made available to the government without any exception. On April 22, the Centre issued an order under the DM Act making the district magistrates and senior superintendents of police personally liable to allow unhindered inter-State movement of vehicles carrying medical oxygen and to ensure that the supply is not restricted to a particular State where the oxygen plant is located. Medical oxygen to States are being provided as per daily quota decided by an empowered group of officers in Central ministries. Despite the MHA’s orders and letters, States continued to flag shortage of oxygen supply with hospitals in Delhi using social media to send distress messages. On Friday, steel industrialist Naveen Jindal tweeted that a tanker carrying 16 MT of liquid medical oxygen dispatched from its Raigarh plant in Chhattisgarh had reached Batra Hospital in Delhi. The hospital had said in a statement that it was running low on oxygen that could last only few hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/use-of-liquid-oxygen-only-for-medical-purpose-says-centre/article34409978.ece
26 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Railways to waive charges for ‘Oxygen Express’ trains||With the demand for liquid oxygen on the rise from major hospitals across the country, the Indian Railways has decided to waive certain charges on ‘Oxygen Express’ trains. Though sources said the Centre had decided to divert 80 MT of liquid oxygen from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the State does not figure in the list of originating points on the routes mapped for operating the special trains. The Ministry of Railways has exempted the ‘Oxygen Express’ trains transporting liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tankers from the levy of ‘Over-Dimensional Consignment’ charges as a special case. Replying to a query flagged by the Container Corporation of India, the Railways waived the ‘Busy Season Charge’ and ‘Development Charge’ levies. It was also decided not to levy ‘Terminal Access Charges’ for the rakes at the container Rail Terminal. Haulage charge The Railways has decided to levy haulage charges per 20-foot length container. Though no charges would be made on empty flats in the rake, the operator was requested to mobilise additional liquid medical oxygen from other consignors so as to obviate any empty flat movement. The operator was also advised to ensure necessary precaution for the same movement of liquid oxygen. In view of the rapid rise in COVID-19 cases and a significant surge in the demand for liquid medical oxygen in all parts of the country, the Ministry of Home Affairs had written to all States a couple of days ago to map all oxygen manufacturing units. Where such facilities were closed, the MHA called for necessary action to revive the plants, considering the urgent requirement of liquid medical oxygen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-to-waive-charges-for-oxygen-express-trains/article34409980.ece

This is the reason for oxygen shortage and is proving to be a huge impediment in the recovery of COVID-positive patients.” He added that the government had been working all night to ensure oxygen reached hospitals and patients did not suffer. “We have failed at times and have been successful at times. We need to manage our oxygen resources properly and have started a portal, which will update availability of oxygen every two hours.” He added that Delhi was receiving support from the Central government, and he had appealed to all States that had oxygen to share, and other countries as well, to send oxygen to Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-extends-lockdown-as-pandemic-rages/article34410532.ece

He was 70. Belonging to the Benaras gharana, Mr. Mishra, with brother Sajan Mishra, made a mark for himself as a vocalist in the khyal style of Indian classical singing. Tributes poured in for the late singer. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, “The demise of Mishraji, who was associated with the Banaras Gharana, is an irreplaceable loss to the art and music world. My condolences to his family and fans in this hour of mourning. Om Shanti!” Mr. Mishra was admitted to Delhi’s St. Stephen Hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/musician-rajan-mishra-dies-from-covid-19/article34410455.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||COVID-19 stalks Odisha’s remote Nuapada district||Chief District Medical Officer Kalicharan Behera admits that Nuapada has been clocking a test positivity rate of close to 40% in the past one week and its health infrastructure has come under severe strain. Health experts are attributing the rapid spread to neighbouring Chhattisgarh, on which people in Nuapada depend for everything, from employment to trade. “When cases increased in Chhattisgarh in March, people started returning home. At that time, people in Nuapada were complacent and were not adhering to precautionary measures. Soon the situation went from bad to worse,” says Annada Shankar Das, an Ayush doctor assigned to track COVID-19 trends in the community. The district headquarters hospital, eight community health centres, around 20 primary health centres and 100 sub-centres of the district cater not just to the people of Nuapada, but also the bordering districts of Chhattisgarh.  Active cases Nuapada has 2,584 active cases after Khordha (7,969) and Sundargarh (5,981). The rising numbers have greatly strained the health infrastructure in the district. There is one COVID-19 hospital with 165 beds in Nuapada, and a 50-bedded COVID Care Centre in Khariar. Of the five beds with ventilator facility, only two are functional at any given time. If tests are ramped up, the number of positive cases in Nuapada is likely to shoot up. The present outcome from antigen tests is an indicator. On April 17, 221 (25.66%) out of 861 persons tested positive. On the next day, the test positivity rate (TPR) went up to 31.24%, when 249 of 797 persons tested positive. Subsequently, the TPR continued to hover between 35% and 40%. The TPR was 37.75% on April 23 and 39.75% on April 24. As Nuapada sends samples to Bhubaneswar for RT-PCR testing, it takes an average of 10 to 12 days for results to be known. Though the local district administration claims to have enough test kits stocked up, a large population stuck at home with COVID-19 symptoms is estimated to be shying away from tests. Non-existence of public transport is a major reason. Symptomatic people are unable to hire vehicles. “A man with a family in Bendrabahal village in Bargaon panchyat tried everything to access a testing centre but he failed. After my personal message to a senior officer on April 14, the administration sent a team to his house. Two people from the house later tested positive,” says Ajit Panda, a Khariar-based journalist. “Though we have enough test kits, we are facing staff crunch. Many staffers have gone into home isolation after getting infected,” says Gopal Chandra Mallick, Nuapada district COVID officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-stalks-odishas-remote-nuapada-district/article34409947.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Russia to fly in oxygen generators, medicines||It and will include oxygen generating equipment for various purposes, ranging from use in individual homes to nursing homes and hospitals, as well as drugs such as favipiravir, used to treat milder versions of COVID-19. However, exports of remdesivir, which the Russian government had earlier offered to facilitate, have run into trouble, with the California-based Gilead Sciences Inc., which developed the drug, invoking the U.S. licensing laws. Sources said the Russian side has now conveyed that the drug may not be sent to India unless the issue is resolved. Earlier reports said Russia had offered to supply 3,00,000-4,00,000 injections of remdesivir to India, which is understood to have triggered an alarm in the U.S., which is already upset with Moscow over unlicensed production of the drug. Any exports, said officials, could invoke stringent U.S. penalties against Russia and even India. So far, Gilead has signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements with 10 manufacturers based in India, Egypt and Pakistan for remdesivir production, of which seven are Indian companies, but none with Russia. Demand for the drug has grown worldwide, despite a recommendation from the World Health Organization against its use. In India, in the past few weeks, with the number of cases catapulting to record highs, hospitals have run out of the drug, which is being sold at 10 times the maximum retail price (MRP) in the black market. While supplies of the non-licensed product from Russia would have eased the pressure on the market, industry analysts say they hope Indian companies, that have now been banned from exporting remdesivir, will be able to ramp up their supplies instead.  The Hindu reached out to Gilead Sciences representatives over the issue, but was unable to receive a reply on Sunday. India has already been in touch with the U.S. government over other licensing and regulatory issues, and the remdesivir issue could add to New Delhi’s wishlist from Washington. Remdesivir, which was cleared for COVID-19 treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2020, is being made in Russia after the government in Moscow decided to defy the international patent held by Gilead, and issued an ordinance allowing Russian company Pharmasyntez to manufacture the drug under a “compulsory licence”. According to Pharmasyntez president, Indian-born Russian national Vikram Punia, quoted in a Reuters report, the decision to manufacture the drug came after he wrote to Gilead requesting licensing permission, but did not receive any reply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/russia-to-fly-in-oxygen-generators-medicines/article34409948.ece
26 April 2021||Srinagar,||Kashmir Valley divided on prayers in mosques||As Kashmir sees no let up in COVID-19 cases and related deaths, opinions were divided on Sunday between doctors and religious leaders on continuing mass prayers in mosques during the ongoing holy month of Ramzan. Kashmir’s grand mufti Nasir-ul-Islam, who called upon mosque committees to procure oxygen concentrators to meet any eventuality, pitched for the continuation of congregational prayers in mosques. “Committees must procure fumigation machines and sanitise every masjid. Worshippers should abide by the COVID-19 standard operation protocols [SOPs] and offer prayers,” Mr. Nasir-ul-Islam said. Another religious body, Karwan-e-Islami, headed by Sheikh Ghulam Rasool Hami, also stressed continuing prayers only after “proper adherence to SOPs”. However, leading doctors working in the Valley’s top government-run hospitals have warned against congregations till the new wave subsides in the Union Territory. “We need to ensure all such spaces that can lead to fast multiplication of infected cases are immediately thinned out to slow down the spread of the infection. It will help in lessening the burden on the hospital infrastructure,” a senior doctor at the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital said. A doctor at the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences also warned that oxygen-supported beds were depleting in the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kashmir-valley-divided-on-prayers-in-mosques/article34409950.ece
26 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Justice Shantanagoudar of SC passes away||Supreme Court judge Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar died at a private hospital in Gurugram early on Sunday morning. He was 62. He was admitted to the Medanta Hospital after developing a lung complication and was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU). There is no official confirmation whether Justice Shantanagoudar’s death was related to COVID-19. He was the ninth senior-most judge of the Supreme Court. Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana condoled the passing of Justice Shantanagoudar. “I was hoping for his speedy and complete recovery, and his return to the Bench at the earliest. The news of his passing has come as a rude shock. I have not only lost a valued colleague but a good friend. We shared a Bench for close to a year, which brought us closer. I will dearly miss our conversations, his warmth, wit and humour. My heart goes out to his family and friends. May his soul rest in peace.” Justice Shantanagoudar was born in 1958 and enrolled as an advocate in 1980. After a brief spell of practice in Dharwad, he joined the chamber of advocate (as he was then) Shivaraj V. Patil, who became a Supreme Court judge. Justice Shantanagoudar specialised in civil, criminal and constitutional matters. Among other offices, Justice Shantanagoudar had served as the State Public Prosecutor of Karnataka from 1999 to 2002. He was appointed a permanent judge of the Karnataka High Court in September 2004. He was appointed the Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court in 2016 and was elevated to the Supreme Court on February 17, 2017, and was scheduled to retire only on May 4, 2023. Justice Shantanagoudar was known as a judge who spoke his mind. He never minced his words, both in his judgments and in his public addresses. A clutch of his recent judgments and orders in the Supreme Court bear witness to Justice Shantanagoudar’s pronounced penchant for the grant of personal liberty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-judge-justice-mohan-m-shantanagoudar-dead/article34409958.ece

26 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Waive charges for oxygen imports, Centre tells ports||A day after the Central government dropped the basic customs duty on the import of COVID-19 vaccines, medical oxygen and equipment needed for patients to use such oxygen, the government has directed all major ports to waive all charges for oxygen-related imports and accord them the “highest priority” in the berthing sequence. The Shipping Ministry’s directive to chairpersons of these ports, however, does not mention the import of COVID-19 vaccines as part of the proposed waivers. Details to be monitored “The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways will monitor the details of such vessels and cargo along with the time taken in the port from the time a ship entered in the port limits till the exit of cargo from the port’s gate,” said a government statement on Sunday. Chairpersons of ports have been asked to personally supervise logistic operations to ensure unhindered movement of such consignments for berthing of such vessels on top priority in the ports, unloading of oxygen related cargo, co-ordination with Customs and other authorities for speedy clearance and documentation for quick evacuation of oxygen-related cargo from the ports. The list of items for which the government has asked for swift clearance from these ports includes medical grade oxygen, oxygen tanks, oxygen bottles, portable oxygen generators, oxygen concentrators, and steel pipes for manufacturing oxygen cylinders and associated equipment. Exemptions till July 31 The customs duty exemptions on some of these items will be in effect till July 31, as per a notification issued by the Finance Ministry. The Ministry’s directive to major ports, including the Kamarajar Port near Chennai, is effective for the next three months, “or until further orders”. In cases where a shipping vessel is not carrying just oxygen-related cargo, ports have been instructed to waive their relevant charges on a “pro-rata basis, considering the overall cargo or containers handled at port”. Ports usually levy a vessel-related charge and storage charges for inbound and outbound cargo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/waive-charges-for-oxygen-imports-centre-tells-ports/article34409973.ece

The Fund had earlier this year allocated Rs. 201.58 crores for the installation of 162 such plants, the PMO said. The aim is to set up an oxygen plant in all districts with government hospitals. “Oxygen plants in every district to ensure adequate oxygen availability...

26 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Misinformation being spread, says Vardhan||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday denied the allegation that the Centre was getting COVID-19 vaccines for cheap while the States would not. He said it was the States that wanted lifting of curbs on vaccine supplies. In a statement on the new policy, which gives 50% of the vaccine supply to the Centre and 50% to the States and private organisations, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said it was “unfortunate” that misinformation was being spread. “Several questions are being raised on the ‘balance 50% quota’ and what that means ... this balance 50% quota grants flexibility for States,” he said, adding that States would continue to get one guaranteed channel of free supply, while being able to procure from another.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/misinformation-being-spread-says-vardhan/article34410459.ece

26 April 2021||New Delhi,||Chidambaram flays Centre for vaccine prices||Senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram accused the Centre of helping the two COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers in the country to commercially exploit the pandemic by quoting high rates for vaccines. The Congress leader wrote on Twitter on Sunday, “The government’s ineptitude has been called by the two vaccine manufacturers who have now put five prices on the tanks for similar vaccines and the government is silent!” Mr. Chidambaram said the government should call the bluff of both Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India. “The way to do it is to invoke compulsory licensing and invite price bids from other pharma manufacturers that will include royalty payable to SII and Bharat Biotech. L1, L2 (lowest bidders) etc. will reveal the true cost of manufacturing of the two vaccines including a reasonable profit,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chidambaram-flays-centre-for-vaccine-prices/article34409967.ece

26 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre issues advisory on containment measures||The Health Ministry on Sunday advised the States and Union Territories on COVID-19 containment measures, including declaring entire cities or districts containment zones. The Ministry suggested intensive action and local containment measures for districts with either 10% or more positivity in the previous week or more than 60% occupancy of oxygen-supported or ICU beds. “On account of a very high number of daily new cases being reported for the past few days, the Union government has expressed the urgent need for States to consider strict management and control measures in surge areas to bring the situation under control…The existing infrastructure may not be able to cope with this kind of surge, it has been stressed,” it said. Among the actions suggested were local containment zones for 14 days. The areas that need containment zones could be cities, towns, parts of towns, districts headquarters, semi-urban localities, municipal wards and panchayat areas, it said. The advisory said only quarantining individuals or families would not help where there were clusters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-issues-advisory-on-containment-measures/article34410460.ece
26 April 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||Many dental, eye clinics close doors||The second wave of COVID-19 infections, which experts are admitting is a more aggressive one, has started to make an impact on practices such as dental and opthamology, where doctors are in close proximity to patients. While some clinics have decided to remain closed until the situation improves, the number of patients too has seen a drop with most preferring to remain indoors. Clinics that have chosen to remain open are tweaking their functioning to meet the new challenges. Manjunath B.M., PRO of a well known eye-hospital in the city, said they are taking in patients in batches while following all protocols. “We have an app where new patients are given online consultations and then appointments, if required. For old patients, it is easier as we already have their records. Those with COVID-19 symptoms are not allowed inside as they are a risk to other patients.” “Last year, we didn’t know anything about the infection. Now we are better prepared so we don’t have to close,” he said, adding that with their staff and a bulk of patients vaccinated, there is more confidence to remain open. Secretary of the Indian Dental Association, Bengaluru branch, Sudarshan Sajjan said the same protocols and guidelines brought out during the first wave have been sent to all dentists. “But a lot of them are scared and have shut down practice as the second wave is more aggressive. Those who are open are implementing different scheduling to sterilise the system after each patient,” he said. With online consultations not possible in many cases, those who are open are obliging cases with emergency need for treatment or referring them to clinics which are open, he said. Walk-ins too have reduced, he said. Dentists and their staff are, however, much more comfortable with availability of PPE kits and other requirements this time, he added, recalling the shortage of last year. Y.L. Rajashekar, president, Karnataka Ophthalmic Society, cautioned patients against delaying treatment. “Last time, a lot of people went blind. People with glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and cataract came with advanced eye diseases,” he said. “We are taking cases by appointment and spacing them out. We are also not allowing attendants unless the patient is very old. Slit lamp examination is done using barrier shields and protective gear,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-dental-eye-clinics-close-doors/article34409998.ece
26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai residents stay indoors||After several months, the city came under a complete lockdown on Sunday. The roads were mostly deserted as people stayed indoors. Only a few ventured out for important purposes, and most of them wore masks. To control the spread of COVID-19, the Tamil Nadu government announced new restrictions, including a night curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. and a complete lockdown on Sundays. The Chennai city police geared up to enforce the lockdown by deploying 12,000 policemen and erecting 192 checkpoints. “But our work was made easier as people stayed indoors. Only a few were out on the road, heading to hospitals or for essential services. The conduct of marriages, with permission, was allowed with the permitted number of people,” said N. Kannan, Additional Commissioner of Police, South. Arterial roads such as Anna Salai, Poonamallee High Road, Old Mahabalipuram Road, East Coast Road and Kamaraj Salai wore a deserted look. Lanes leading to these major roads were barricaded. The usually bustling MGR Chennai Central Railway Station was also without the usual crowd. “A few people were seen taking selfies on Anna Salai, we asked them to leave immediately. We had placed barricades at traffic signals to slow down vehicles and check them. However, compared with last time, we feel people have become aware of the danger of stepping out unnecessarily and are staying indoors,” said a police officer on Anna Salai. A few food delivery agents and lots of the Greater Chennai Corporation’s sanitary workers were seen on the roads. Most of the shops, except pharmacies, were closed. “We sensitised shop-keepers to the need for keeping the shops shut during the lockdown. We are also using drones to monitor the situation,” a senior police officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/most-city-residents-stay-indoors/article34410503.ece
26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu reports 15,659 fresh cases||Tamil Nadu’s steady rise in COVID-19 cases continued on Sunday, with the State reporting 15,659 fresh cases. The number of active cases rose to 1,05,180. The daily death count increased to 82 from 80 on Saturday. The total deaths in the State stood at 13,557. The State also reported a sharp increase in the number of persons recovered, with 11,065 patients reported recovered, compared with 9,142 the previous day. Even as the cases increased, the number of persons tested daily remained at 1.23 lakh. Consequently, the test positivity rate increased from 11.21% on Friday to 12.77%. Chennai continued to report the highest number of cases. There were 4,206 cases, 4,271 persons discharged and 30 deaths on Sunday. It had 31,535 active cases. Chengalpattu, 1,242, and Coimbatore, 1,038, were the two other districts that reported over 1,000 cases. Tiruvallur, 885, Madurai, 603, Kancheepuram, 558, Tirunelveli, 549, and Salem, 511, reported more than 500 cases. Another 25 districts reported cases in the range of 100 to 500. The only districts that reported less than 100 cases were the Nilgris, 79, Sivaganga, 75, Ariyalur, 49, and Perambalur, 15. The fresh cases included 33 people who returned from other States. According to the bulletin released by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, 70 of the 82 persons who died had co-morbidities.

She was admitted to the Institute of Child Health and Children Hospital here a week later on Thursday. She died on Friday within 24 hours of hospitalisation. The oldest was a 94-year-old man from Chennai. The number of people vaccinated on Sunday declined sharply from the previous day. While the number generally comes down on Sundays, the decline was sharp owing to the lockdown. While 1.19 lakh people were vaccinated on Saturday, only 10,552 were vaccinated on Sunday. They included 425 healthcare workers, 852 frontline workers, 5,478 people aged 45-59 and 3,798 aged 60 and above.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-reports-15659-fresh-cases/article34410109.ece
26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A smooth ride for passengers despite lockdown||The operation of long-distance trains and flights remained unaffected despite the total lockdown on Sunday in Chennai. While the lockdown brought life to a standstill in the city, a section of commuters who arrived by trains, faced difficulties in getting autorickshaws or taxis to reach their destination. The city witnessed limited operation of public transport services of bus, metro and train, but the services were mostly for government staff. The Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) operated 100 services for conservancy and other staff of the Greater Chennai Corporation. The Southern Railway operated workmen special trains in all the four sections, including the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) between Velachery and Chennai Beach. The Chennai division operated around 86 train services mainly for the government staff involved in COVID-19 prevention work with train services available every two hours. However, the train services were allowed to be used by the passengers commuting from long distance after showing the tickets. For the first time during complete lockdown, Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) operated services from 7 a.m. till 9 p.m. with a reduced frequency. On the stretch Wimco Nagar-Chennai airport stretch, there were trains every hour and from Chennai Central to Chennai airport and Chennai Central to St. Thomas Mount, a train was available once every two hours. Four trains were pressed into service for Sunday and they had planned nearly 30-35 trips. On Sunday morning, there were complaints of commuters facing severe hardship in getting autorickshaws from the Egmore railway station. Some of them took to the social media to register their protest. However, railway authorities and the traffic police denied having received any complaints of autorickshaws and taxis refusing a ride. A few commuters who reached the Egmore railway station pointed out they did not face any problems in hiring autorickshaws at the railway station. Anthony Thangaraj, a resident of Pattabhiram, said though they had initial apprehension when they boarded the train from from Tirunelveli, they did not have any issue in getting a taxi at the Egmore railway station. B. Guganesan, Chief Public Relations Officer, Southern Railway, said no complaints of commuters facing any difficulties to get autorickshaws or commercial vehicles in the Egmore or Dr. MGR Chennai Central railway stations were received on Sunday. He said the pre-paid auto stand functioned as usual and the railway authorities in the Egmore railway station had permitted autos to ply the commuters. In case of any issues regarding any autos operating inside the railway premises refusing to ply commuters they could give complaint to the Station Master for taking appropriate action. A senior official of the traffic police said instructions had been issued to the police personnel not to harass the drivers plying passengers from the railway stations or airports. The traffic police said: “The drivers should show the train tickets of the passengers at the security check post during lockdown on Sundays and they would not be disturbed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-smooth-ride-for-passengers-despite-lockdown/article34410501.ece
26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Oxygen production needs to be augmented||Tamil Nadu’s current daily oxygen manufacturing capacity of 400 metric tonnes, though comfortable, should be augmented amid the surge in COVID-19 cases, according to industry. The State recently informed the Madras High Court that the current usage of oxygen was to the extent of 250 metric tonnes a day and that it had a storage capacity of 1,167 metric tonnes. On Sunday, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said oxygen consumption in Tamil Nadu had already reached 310 metric tonnes, and the State would need 450 metric tonnes soon. He stressed the need to make available adequate oxygen because of a high number of oxygen-dependent COVID-19 cases. “About 20 metric tonnes of capacity is available in industries, but they don’t have the licence to produce medical oxygen. The government should act quickly and issue the licence...,” says R. Kannan, past president, All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association, New Delhi. Oxygen is distributed to private hospitals and nursing homes through a slew of refillers, who purchase liquid oxygen from bulk producers such as INOX Air Products Limited and National Oxygen Limited, he points out. Mr. Kannan runs two plants — TN Oxygen Private Limited, Ayanambakkam, which has a capacity of 8 metric tonnes a day, and Tamilnadu Air Products Private Limited, Gummidipoondi, which has a capacity of 4 metric tonnes a day. “Earlier, the Ayanambakkam plant was setting aside 35% of its production for the medical needs and the rest for the industrial use. The supply to industries was stopped on April 23, and now 100% is going towards the medical requirements,” he says. “The Gummidipoondi plant was under shut-down last year, and we have restarted it only this month and have been running it to full capacity since April 23,” he says. He says the non-availability of cylinders is a challenge. The supply of liquid oxygen to the refillers has been cut down, resulting in a serious shortage of oxygen at private hospitals. Mr. Kannan says the State is not providing financial assistance for augmenting capacity, and it should look at using idle capacity available with the likes of Sterlite Copper. JSW Steel has been supplying liquid medical oxygen from across its plants in India, including Salem. While the company does not share details of Tamil Nadu-specific capacity and supply, it is targeting to supply 20,000 tonnes of liquid oxygen in April from its three plants in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka. JSW Steel has said it has been supplying 600 tonnes daily from its plants in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Kerala, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Marathwada. An industry executive explains that any steel plant requires only gaseous oxygen, and most plants have captive gaseous oxygen units. A fraction can be converted into liquid medical oxygen, he notes. Industry Secretary N. Muruganandam says his Department is working closely with oxygen producers to augment capacity by providing whatever clearances they require. INOX Air Products is setting up a plant at Hosur, which would take a few months to come up, and the Industries Department is doing all it can to support the project. The Department is helping in identifying land and getting consent to establish the plant. “We are also helping another big firm in land identification at Ranipet. Another firm, called Praxair, wanted some clearances which were pending, and we got it done for them.” Mr. Muruganandam says lead time for establishing additional capacities is more. “Currently no incentives are offered, but we are in touch with industry players for support.” Senior officials of the State government whom The Hindu spoke to said that as on date, the situation was manageable. A source said that in the 48 hours. a list of industrial oxygen manufacturers in the State had been collated. “Licences are being given to them to make medical oxygen, and we are procuring from them. The Industries Department has been giving clearances,” the source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/oxygen-production-needs-to-be-augmented/article34410497.ece
26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||People stay indoors during Sunday lockdown||People stayed indoors during the first total lockdown enforced in Tamil Nadu after several months on Sunday to control the spread of COVID-19. Barring the supply of essentials, such as milk and newspapers, business activities came to a standstill. The total Sunday lockdown was relaxed on September 6 last year. Since then, there has been no restriction on movement, except in containment areas. But there was a huge increase in cases in the second wave. To check the spread of the contagion, the State government announced restrictions with effect from April 20, including a night curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. and a complete lockdown on Sundays. In Chennai, people stayed indoors and only a few ventured out for essential purposes; most of them wore masks. The city police geared up to enforce the lockdown by deploying 7,000 men and setting up 192 checkpoints. A total of 60 vehicles that violated the lockdown norms were seized. Conduct of marriages, with prior permission, was allowed with the permitted number of people. Arterial roads such as Anna Salai, Poonamallee High Road, Old Mahabalipuram Road, East Coast Road and Kamaraj Salai wore a deserted look. Few events held In southern districts, the lockdown was total. But pharmacies were open and emergency services were operated. People remained indoors. Most of the weddings scheduled for Sunday were postponed, while very few marriages were held with a small number of people in Tiruchendur, Palani and Madurai. Thoothukudi SP Jayakumar said the lockdown was total, and 2,000 policemen were on duty. Madurai Collector T. Anbalagan checked vehicles at the Goripalayam junction. In the western districts, too, all the markets remained shut. Guest-workers who had arrived at the Coimbatore junction to take trains to their home towns were made to wait outside the main entrance. They were allowed into the platforms only when the trains arrived. The empty roads encouraged the wild animals to venture out, and many in the Nilgiris district spotted them. R. Raveendran, who travelled to Udhagamandalam from Gudalur, said Sambar deer and barking deer were spotted along the road. Tiruppur Corporation Commissioner K. Sivakumar said 10 Amma canteens were allowed to function till afternoon. In Salem, grocery shops also remained closed and only milk delivery services and milk booths functioned. Farmers’ markets were kept open, but no customers came. Erode Corporation workers carried out disinfection at the bus stand and the vegetable market, and on all arterial roads. The lockdown was total in the nine Central districts as people stayed put in their homes. Police presence was intensified at vantage locations and checkpoints to ensure compliance with the government’s directive. In Vellore, Tirupathur, Ranipet and Tiruvannamalai, the roads were empty. Policemen were deployed in large numbers to enforce the lockdown. Main roads in Vellore, such as Anna Salai and the Green Circle, wore a deserted look.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-stay-indoors-during-sunday-lockdown/article34410105.ece

26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Kamal, Anbumani slam Union govt. for not releasing NEP document in Tamil||Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan and PMK youth-wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss on Sunday criticised the Union government for failing to translate the National Education Policy (NEP) document, released recently in 17 languages, into Tamil. Mr. Haasan said the Union government had translated the NEP into several languages, but not Tamil. “It is unacceptable that Tamil has been ignored. It is merely a form of play acting to quote Tirukkural and Bharathiyar poems on stage. In reality, they are waging a war on the culture of the Tamil land and are uprooting its rights,” he said. Mr. Anbumani said while the NEP had been released in 17 languages, it had not been released in Tamil, the oldest language in India. “While the document has been released in Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Konkani, Gujarati, Kashmiri, Nepali, Odiya, Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Marathi, Punjabi, Dogri, Maithili, Manipuri and Sandhali, it has not been released in Tamil. Several aspects of the NEP are being opposed in Tamil Nadu. However, it has been accepted as the official document and it is only fair that it is released in all 22 languages mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution,” he said. Mr. Anbumani added that the Union government’s policy, opposing Tamil, was wrong and that it should be rectified at the earliest.  They are waging a war on the culture of the Tamil land and are uprooting its rights   It is only fair that it is released in all 22 languages listed in Eighth Schedule||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kamal-anbumani-slam-union-govt-for-not-releasing-nep-document-in-tamil/article34410102.ece
26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Schoolteachers want to work from home||With practical exams completed on Saturday for Class 12 students, teachers from government schools are hoping to get work from home option in the coming days owing to the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases across the State. “The safety of teachers and their families should be taken into consideration and since there are no physical classes in schools at the moment, teachers can be given the option to work from home. When there is a need to distribute textbooks or other material, we can be asked to come to school then,” said S.N. Janardhanan, State Executive Committee member, School Teachers Federation of India. Students of Class 12 alone had been attending physical classes in schools across Tamil Nadu till the State government announced that their board exams were postponed. While their practical exams were to be conducted as per schedule, students will now continue preparing for the exams from their homes as schools have been asked not to have physical classes any more. A science teacher from Tiruvarur said most schools wound up the practical exams by Saturday and had completed uploading the marks online to the School Education Department. In several government schools, teachers of all classes have been coming to school despite students not having been on campus for over a year. The School Education Department is yet to announce the end of the 2020-21 academic year or that schools can close for a summer break. “Even during vacation, many of us take turns and go to school in case there is any work to be done such as distribution of material. We can implement the same now and have just two or three teachers coming in if absolutely necessary,” said P.K. Ilamaran, President, Tamil Nadu Teachers Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/school-teachers-want-to-work-from-home/article34410140.ece
26 April 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||How refineries are aiding hospitals||With hospitals running out of oxygen, oil refineries of the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) in Panipat and the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited’s facility in Kochi are supplying the gas to them.  Is oxygen an important gas in refineries? More than oxygen, refineries require high-purity nitrogen to maintain inert atmosphere in certain processes to prevent air ingress into hydrocarbon-containing vessels and for purging purposes. Nitrogen is mostly produced in cryogenic air separation units. Some refineries have the facility to produce oxygen of 99.7% purity, too, in these cryogenic air separation units. Some of the refineries have VPSA oxygen units that produce oxygen of 90% purity. Where do refineries use oxygen? Refineries use oxygen to enrich the air used in sulphur recovery units and catalytic cracking units. In the former, high-purity oxygen is added to the air for combustion. The latter units help convert vacuum gas oil to value-added products such as LPG, petrol and diesel. What is the process in IOCL, Panipat? IOCL has been supplying oxygen to various hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. It has a high-purity oxygen production unit, which is used in its mono ethylene glycol (MEG) unit to produce medical-grade liquid oxygen. It has reduced production of MEG and is supplying the oxygen to hospitals. What is BPCL Kochi doing? The build-own-operate unit of Kochi Refinery has a provision to produce and store liquid oxygen of 99.7% purity. When the oxygen crisis started, the facility was put to use. The unit can produce oxygen in both gaseous and liquid forms. So far, it has supplied for free 66 tonnes of oxygen from October 2020. Is the CPCL refinery in Manali supplying oxygen? No. The CPCL refinery does not supply oxygen to hospitals because it does not have the facility to bottle or store it. It does get a small quantity of oxygen from the unit that produces it.

26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Sterlite’s proposal to be discussed today||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has convened an all party meeting at the State Secretariat on Monday to discuss the issue of allowing the Sterlite copper smelter plant at Thoothukudi to reopen to produce oxygen. The DMK said it would participate in the meeting. Sterlite has offered to produce 1,000 MT of oxygen per day from the facility and had moved the Supreme Court to allow it to produce and provide oxygen for free at a time when many States were reeling under a shortage of oxygen to treat COVID-19 patients. Mr. Palaniswami on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking that the diversion of 80 KL of liquid oxygen from Sriperumbudur to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana be immediately stopped as the active case load in Tamil Nadu had crossed the one-lakh mark. Last week, a bench headed by then Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde had voiced its anguish at the State’s objection to re-open the plant. “We do not care if it is you, Vedanta, Centre, A, B, C who runs the plant, but oxygen must be produced from a place capable of producing it... The Constitution demands that material resources should be equally distributed all over the country,” the then CJI told Tamil Nadu. In May 2018, 13 anti-Sterlite protesters were killed in a police firing at Thoothukudi. The proposal to reopen the plant is facing resistance from a section of residents in Thoothukudi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sterlites-proposal-to-be-discussed-today/article34410106.ece
26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC forms panel to provide insurance cover to 65,000 lawyers||Taking cognisance of the fact that many advocates have died due to COVID-19, the Madras High Court has constituted a committee to hold discussions with the State government and the insurance companies and come up with a group health insurance policy that could cover the medical expenses incurred by around 65,000 advocates, enrolled with the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (BCTNP), and their family members. Justices N. Kirubakaran and R. Pongiappan ordered the constitution of the committee while passing interim orders on a public interest litigation petition filed by activist-lawyer Sudha Ramalingam. The petitioner, a senior member of the Bar, had suggested that the government could be directed to provide insurance to the lawyers and their families after collecting money through the sale of insurance stamps. Pointing out that advocates already stick multiple stamps towards advocate welfare and advocate clerks’ welfare on thousands of vakalats (authorisation of appearance given by clients to their lawyers) filed in the courts across the State every day, the litigant said the lawyers would be more than happy to purchase and stick one more stamp of a nominal denomination for providing insurance cover.  Panel members Finding force in her submissions, the court decided to elicit suggestions from a committee and appointed Advocate General Vijay Narayan as its chairman so that it becomes easy for holding discussions with the State government, too, if necessary. Additional Advocate General P.H. Arvindh Pandian was appointed as its coordinator, and PIL petitioner Ms. Ramalingam, too, was inducted as one of its members. The judges ordered that Additional Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan, insurance law expert N. Vijayaraghavan, National Insurance Company standing counsel S. Arunkumar, the company’s senior Divisional Manager P. Manoharan, BCTNP member M.R. Sivasubramaniam, BCTNP standing counsel C.K. Chandrasekharan and advocate S. Devika shall also be the members of the committee expected to suggest viable proposals to the court.

26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Ensure fairness in counting of votes’||Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar, who has contested from Karur Assembly constituency, has moved the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to follow a slew of measures aimed at ensuring fairness in the counting of votes on May 2. Since as many as 77 candidates had contested in his constituency, the Minister insisted upon proper display and tallying of votes. The case filed by the Minister has been listed for admission before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on Monday. In his affidavit, he pointed out that too many counting agents would be present at the counting centre since the number of candidates were too high. He claimed that it would take more than 20 hours to count the votes in 25 rounds. Pointing out that the State government had imposed several restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including a complete lockdown on Sundays, Mr. Vijayabhaskar said the Chief Electoral Officer had nevertheless said that the lockdown would not apply on the day of counting despite it falling on a Sunday. Therefore, he insisted on following a series of measures to be followed at the counting centre. The Minister wanted the counting agents of recognised political parties to be seated on the front table in the counting halls, the votes polled by each candidate to be displayed, announced and tallied clearly during every round and not to begin the next round without the consent of all agents. More CCTV cameras He insisted on installing more closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the counting centre and ensuring maximum surveillance. “Police protection must be increased to ensure public peace and safety. All persons entering the counting station should be thoroughly checked and no one with any weapon or sharp object or any other object that could be potentially used as a weapon should be permitted. Persons who had consumed alcohol should not be permitted inside the counting premises,” the affidavit filed by the petitioner read. He, however, said the counting agents should be allowed to carry towels, calculators and writing pads inside the counting halls. He claimed that it might not be possible to maintain physical distance if the counting of votes for Karur constituency was held in just two counting halls and said the number of halls must be increased to three and that the agents must be provided with hand sanitisers. The Minister also insisted that the counting should be stopped during lunch time and claimed that it might lead to chaos if food and refreshments were not provided at the right time. He wanted catering passes to be issued to the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) party workers so that they could supply food to his counting agents who would not be allowed to leave until the counting gets completed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ensure-fairness-in-counting-of-votes-minister/article34410080.ece

26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Police issue alert on revival of Tablighi activities||The Tamil Nadu police have issued an alert on the revival of the Tablighi Jamaat’s activities in the State. Instructions were given to senior police officers to advise local religious heads not to entertain strangers or foreign nationals at a time when the State was reeling from the second wave of COVID-19. Police sources said a few instances of Tablighi Jamaat members, including some from other States, taking part in various activities in Chennai, Krishnagiri, Tenkasi and a few other places had come to their notice in recent weeks, and the advisory was issued in the backdrop of the sharp increase in the number of fresh cases and deaths. However, there was no mention of the returnees of the Kumbh Mela held in Haridwar, in which thousands of people from across the country took part, triggering a controversy over the violation of COVID-19 safety guidelines. Kumbh Mela attendees It was not clear whether law-enforcement agencies had a list of those from the State who attended the Kumbh Mela in Uttarakhand to follow up on their health since dozens of participants, including health workers, had tested positive for the virus, sources said. Last week, the police headquarters sent out the advisory reminding officers of the Tablighi Jamaat international conference held in Malaysia and the All India Tamil Nadu Masura organised at New Delhi in the third week of March 2020, which coincided with the outbreak of the first wave of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-issue-alert-on-revival-of-tablighi-activities/article34410107.ece
26 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Can proceed with reassessment of Tasmac’s returns, HC tells I-T Dept.||The Madras High Court has dismissed writ petitions filed by the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac), which holds exclusive right to sell liquor in both wholesale and retail across the State, against reopening of its tax assessments for previous years on the ground of alleged evasion. The Income Tax Department had accused the corporation of routing its profit to the State government by way of frequent revision of special privilege fee instead of paying dividend from profits after taxation. Justice S.M. Subramaniam refused to interfere with the decision to reopen the assessments after referring to an observation made by an Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax that Tasmac was adopting a colourable device to evade legitimate payment of corporation tax to the coffers of the Central government. It was brought to the notice of the court that the special privilege fee was increased every year by way of Government Orders, and accordingly tax exemption was claimed for the fee. The court was also told that on many occasions that the special privilege fee was increased with retrospective effect after the end of the financial year and a substantial amount of income was taken away from the tax net by claiming it to be the fee paid to the government. Senior standing counsel for the I-T Department Hema Muralikrishnan claimed that Tasmac had falsely shown losses by claiming that all its profits were paid to the government with special privilege fee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/can-proceed-with-reassessment-of-tasmacs-returns-hc-tells-i-t-dept/article34410121.ece

Tilapia is a very important fish in India’s aquaculture industry. Over the past decade, the Tilapia Lake Virus has been causing havoc among producers of this fresh water fish. If one infected fish gets into the water, it takes only four to 10 days for the infection to spread to the other fish, she said. For now there is no vaccine for this and the study will find out ways of administering it, she said. “The mortality rate due to this virus is nearly 80%,” she added. The fellowship has been jointly awarded by the International Development Research Centre, Canada, and International Veterinary Vaccinology Network, U.K. and is for 10 months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tilapia-researcher-gets-international-fellowship/article34410138.ece

26 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||250 participants take part in virtual textile expo||‘Textile Exchange 2021,’, a business to business platform, saw more than 250 participants at its two-day virtual expo that concluded on Saturday. Hosted by Supporting Indian Trade and Investment for Africa (SITA) initiative of the International Trade Centre (ITC), jointly with India ITME Society, the exchange was for Indian and east African textile businesses to network and capitalise on marketing opportunities. S. Hari Shankar, chairman of India ITME Society, said that the platform enabled buyers and sellers to interact. Africa is a rapidly growing market and there are opportunities for buyers and sellers to present their businesses, showcase products, connect and network with relevant partners. “It (the platform) will focus on machinery, fibre, yarn, fabric, trimmings and accessories. It extends opportunities to both, buyers and sellers. India's textile and apparel sector is undergoing structural changes to retain its competitiveness. The pandemic has thrown open supply chain and logistics challenges and we should make this challenge into opportunity,” he said. According to a press release, over 700 business to business (B2B) meetings were planned. Close to 250 businesses from Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda used the Textiles Exchange platform to present their company’s products, source inputs, exchange knowledge, ideas and technology, and create vibrant business networks in the process. Govind Venuprasad, co-ordinator of SITA, said, “Covid-19 pandemic with ensuing travel restrictions has limited opportunities to network through physical trade fairs and exhibitions. This has been to the detriment of business and trade...SITA is attempting to fill the gap through virtual means, by hosting this online trade fair for the textile sectors of India and east Africa.” Kanzayire Theopiste, chairperson of Apparel Manufacturing Group (AMG) of Rwanda, highlighted access to finance as a major challenge for the group's members, 99% of whom were women. Anda Valla, SITA project officer, explained about SITA’s Access to Finance guide that seeks to address this problem, the press release said. Majority of the east African delegates to the programme were women. Sheena Frida from the Kenyan Fashion Council emphasised the timeliness of the Textiles Exchange event, since the sector has been particularly badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. The participants also took part in technical sessions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/250-participants-take-part-in-virtual-textile-expo/article34410516.ece
26 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Panchayat in Coimbatore district bags Centre’s award||An orchard, bitumen-topped road, improved drinking water supply, efficient waste collection among others were the achievements that made the Government of India sit up, take notice and finally award the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Sashaktikaran Puraskar to Muthugoundenpudur panchayat, near Sulur. The panchayat with four habitations – Anna Nagar, Mudalipalayam, Kurumbapalayam and Muthugoundenpudur – was ahead of others for long but it progressed further after V.P. Kandhavel became president, said S. Kavitha, Project Officer, District Rural Development Agency. Mr. Kandhavel said the developments that drew the Government of India’s attention was the panchayat’s efforts at getting more water under the Pilloor I scheme and utilising funds under the Jal Jeevan Mission to improve water distribution infrastructure. From two lakh litres a day until a few years ago. the panchayat now received two more lakh litres a day to serve nearly all the 4,500-odd families, he said. Likewise, the panchayat had streamlined the waste collection system. It was an exercise that started a few years before he even took over as panchayat president. First, as an activist, he had removed bins after informing residents that there would be door-to-door waste collection. As old habits die hard, the people continued to dump garbage in places where the bins were. Therefore, Mr. Kandhavel said, he had to announce a prize of Rs. 500 for residents who clicked photographs of people dumping garbage. This brought about a behavioural change. This was in 2017 when he also mobilised funds for six battery-powered vehicles for door-to-door waste collection. After winning the presidentship, with government funds he got six more vehicles. Now, every ward in the panchayat has a waste collection vehicle with the requisite manpower. Ms. Kavitha said the panchayat did not stop with that. It was also into proper waste segregation, turning degradable waste into compost and segregating and selling non-degradable waste to recyclers. And it used the compost to nourish a two-acre government land where it raised an orchard. Mr. Kandhavel said that on the land, classified ‘mandaiveli poromboke’, the panchayat had raised fruit-bearing trees and herbs. It gave the fruits and herbs to people who worked under the 100-day Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Scheme. The panchayat had also built houses for 150 families under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna and a few other schemes, he added.  The panchayat is also into proper waste segregation, turning degradable waste into compost and segregating and selling non-degradable waste S.

26 April 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore Corporation shuts Flower Market||Coimbatore Corporation has shut down the Flower Market on Mettupalayam Road and asked traders to shift to the Shastri Maidan at R.S. Puram. According to sources, the Corporation was forced to take the decision because the traders were unwilling to cooperate with the civic body’s measures to control the spread of COVID-19. The decision to shift the traders came three days after the Corporation attempted to decongest the Flower Market by asking around 60 traders to shift to the new market complex it had constructed on the east of Mettupalayam Road, opposite the Market. The sources said the traders did move but only in front of the officials’ eyes as they returned to the Market fearing loss in business to competitors. As this happened repeatedly and as the Corporation officials had to drain all their time and resource in disciplining the traders, the Corporation decided it was better to shift all the traders to the Maidan, just as it had shifted them during the 2020 pandemic lockdown. Ensuring vigil This, the sources said, would come into effect on Monday, once the Sunday’s complete lockdown period ended. The Corporation would post a couple of personnel to ensure vigil at the Market, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-corporation-shuts-flower-market/article34410520.ece

26 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Madurai planned ahead to augment oxygen supply||As a result of coordinated efforts, Government Rajaji Hospital is equipped with adequate number of oxygenated beds. The GRH had only a 6,000-litre oxygen plant in June last year when the first wave of COVID-19 struck. “When we learnt that oxygen was in short supply for COVID-19 in many parts of the world, we had a detailed discussion with officials,” Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan said. Only 400 beds then District Monitoring Officer B. Chandramohan, the then Collector T.G. Vinay and Dean J. Sangumani found that the hospital had only 400 oxygenated beds for COVID-19 patients. “Considering the urgency, priority was given to increase oxygen storage,” Mr. Venkatesan said. The officials acted swiftly and obtained necessary permissions quickly. As a result, the liquid oxygen storage facility in the hospital was increased to 20,000 litres by August. This meant that an additional 700 beds can have oxygen facility. In Thoppur too Similarly, the Government Hospital for Thoracic Medicine in Thoppur had only 30 oxygenated beds. A new oxygen plant with a storage capacity of 2,000 litres was installed and 110 beds were provided piped oxygen. “Now, GRH has 1,461 beds for COVID care out of which 1,100 have piped oxygen supply,” Mr. Venkatesan said. These facilities have come handy as critically ill patients from five southern districts are admitted to the GRH and the hospital is able to give life-saving treatment to them. “Now, we have planned to still increase the number of oxygenated beds at the Thoppur hospital,” he said. Mr. Venkatesan thanked the officials for their commitment and dedication for timely augmentation of facilities by bringing resources and labourers from Puducherry and Bengaluru during this highly critical time. “When the country suffers from an oxygen shortage, we are confident of handling a crisis with confidence,” the MP said.  When it was learnt that oxygen was in short supply abroad, officials took stock and augmented oxygen storage  Su.

26 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Water released from Vaigai dam for river wetting||Water is being released from Vaigai dam from Saturday by the Public Works Department (PWD) for wetting of the river. The move will help in recharging the infiltration wells sunk on the Vaigai riverbed and thereby help in addressing the issue of drinking water shortage in Madurai city, say PWD officials. A senior PWD official said that 216 million cubic feet (mcft) of water will be released from Vaigai dam from April 24 to 29 for the river wetting. As on Sunday morning, the water level in Vaigai dam stood at 62.78 feet against the permissible level of 71 feet. Every year, 150 mcft of water used to be released for the grand event of Lord Kallazhagar entering river Vaigai as part of the Chithirai festival. However, for the second consecutive year, water was not released as the event was cancelled due to lockdown imposed to contain COVID-19 pandemic. “Since the Corporation asked for releasing the water for river wetting, a Government Order was passed and water reserved for the festival was released,” the official added. Recharge of wells A Corporation official said that the civic body supplies 147 mld of drinking water through two drinking water pipelines from Vaigai dam. It also supplies 10 mld of drinking water through Cauvery Drinking Water Integrated Scheme. Currently, the Corporation is able to source 21 to 25 mld of drinking water from riverbed sources. “The wetting of Vaigai river will help in recharging infiltration wells sunk at Thachampathu, Melakkal, Kochadai and Manalur and provide additional 10 mld of water to the city. This will help solve drinking water shortage,” he added. This move will also recharge the infiltration wells sunk by Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board, said a TWAD board official.

26 April 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt.-run vaccine unit yet to pick up steam||The Government of India-owned integrated vaccine complex — HLL Biotech Limited at Chengalpattu — is yet to start commercial production after it was established in March 2012 with a capital investment of Rs. 594 crore, according to the reply to a question under the Right to Information Act. Speaking to reporters here on Sunday, activist Anand Raj of Madurai said the 100% subsidiary of HLL Life Care Limited, fully owned by the Central government, had remained a non-starter. “To at least four questions, the response was like the commercialisation is yet to begin, the unit was in project stage and yet to commercialise...,” he said. To a question on the number of employees on the roll, the response was that the unit had 157 employees, including a CEO, against the sanctioned strength of 408 and had 251 vacancies as on March 2020. The objective of the government was welcomed because it proposed to make life-saving and cost-effective vaccines, primarily to minimise the demand-supply gap. But the time taken to issue the no-objection certificate and approvals had raised eyebrows. The public money had been wasted, with the production yet to start. The RTI applicant, who had sought the response in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic started in Tamil Nadu, said that even after the health emergency in the country, the Central government had not yet given its approval. He alleged that the delay in giving the approval could be to help private vaccine manufacturers. Mr. Anand Raj said VCK MP Ravikumar had recently taken up the issue with the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and suggested that judicial intervention alone would help.  To at least four questions, the response was like the commercialisation is yet to begin, the unit was in project stage and yet to commercialise||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-run-vaccine-unit-yet-to-pick-up-steam/article34410099.ece

26 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Micro-containment zones rise twofold||The number of micro-containment zones in Puducherry has more than doubled in the span of a week, in proportion to the recent surge in new cases and the net increase in home isolation cases and the overall caseload. From about 20 micro-containment zones on April 17, the figure is now inching towards 50, and is expected to increase further if the current trend continues for a longer period. This follows a rapid surge in cases over the past few days. In Puducherry alone, home isolation cases have steadily increased from 3,291 on April 21 to 4,624 on Sunday. District Collector Purva Garg said there were a total of 47 micro-containment zones across Puducherry, Oulgaret, Villianur and Bahour taluks. There are currently nine micro-containment zones in Puducherry, 15 in Oulgaret, 17 in Villianur and six in Bahour. Some of the highest incidences of COVID-19 cases in the Puducherry region have been reported from Reddiyarpalayam, Lawspet, Kosapalayam, Gorimedu, Mettupalayam, Murungapakkam, Muthialpet, Mudaliarpet and Odiansalai. The administration also declared similar zones in places like Orleanpet, Embalam, Karikkalampakkam and Uruvaiyar. S. Mohan Kumar, Director of Health Services, said the level of restrictions depended on the incidence of cases in a locality, and ranged from pasting stickers on individual houses to sealing an apartment or even cordoning off streets if a cluster develops. The COVID war room attached to the State Emergency Operations Centre maps data on a dynamic basis and flags emerging potential hotspots. The containment measures are implemented on the ground by revenue and police officials. The Health Department is focused on ramping up the monitoring of home isolation patients through physical visits/IVRS automated calls as part of efforts to cut down mortality. Health Secretary T. Arun flagged the late diagnosis and delay in reporting to hospital, which were found to have contributed to 75% of recent COVID-19 fatalities in the Union Territory. In a majority of recent deaths, patients who died after 24 hours to 48 hours of hospitalisation had waited for five or six days without undergoing a test for their symptoms and reached a healthcare facility only after developing severe breathing difficulty. A contingent of ASHA/ANM/Anganwadi workers has been tasked with monitoring home isolation cases in these containment zones. Movement of persons/vehicles is also restricted, and police personnel have been posted at the entry/exit points of the zones. Movement is permitted only for supplying essentials and for medical emergencies. Among the other measures are door-to-door visits by medical teams for clinical management of cases, public alerts to residents in the area and disinfection of these zones with sodium hypochlorite solution. “While scaling up treatment facilities, adding health manpower and drawing up containment zones, all of which have their limits, do play a role in checking the spread of the pandemic, they need to be complemented by public participation in adoption of personal protection measures,” Dr. Mohan Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/micro-containment-zones-rise-twofold/article34410668.ece

26 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Alternative strategy to contain COVID-19 sought||Former MP M. Ramadass on Sunday called for an alternative strategy to lockdowns to contain the second wave of the pandemic. In a letter to Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, Mr. Ramadass said the micro-level containment strategies adopted by the government in the last three weeks were in the right direction and only had to be strengthened. They were more viable and healthy instruments of tackling the pathogen. On the other hand, imposing a full or partial lockdown would only affect the people and the small economy of Puducherry, he added. The former Parliamentarian, while hailing the response of the government and specifically the Lt. Governor’s personal effort to bring Remdevisir stocks from Telangana, reasoned that forcing a shutdown of economic activities would entail a loss of about Rs. 100 crore per day to the economy. Besides, it would incur a loss of about Rs. 20 crore tax and non-tax revenue to the government, loss of wages to labourers, closure of shops and industries, deprivation of livelihood of vulnerable sections of the society such as industrial labour, construction workers, automen, migrant labourers, fishermen and street vendors who had already been hit hard in the first wave of the pandemic last year. The size of Puducherry economy, as measured by the State Domestic Product, is about Rs. 35,000 crore out of which only 6% is derived from agriculture and the remaining 94% is generated from micro, small, medium and large units, construction activities, trade, commerce, hotels, restaurants, transport, storages, communication and services, financial services etc. Besides producing an annual income of about Rs. 32,900 crore, these secondary and tertiary sectors alone provide employment to about 3.8 lakh organised and unorganised labour force and contribute to exchequer in the form of GST, excise, stamps and registration fees, taxes on vehicles etc. According to Mr. Ramadass, though the present COVID-19 situation as indicated by surging spread of virus and the consequent case fatality rate is a little alarming and suggests a closure of economic activities as a precautionary measure, the other critical factors such as test positivity rate, recovery rate, bed occupancy, availability of other health infrastructure and a vigilant government machinery do not really warrant the present lockdown as the first resort. “Strengthening of the existing safety protocols and selective restrictions to curb the reckless movement of the people will be the optimal combination and choice to stem the rising tide of infection,” he said. Scientific data Puducherry needs to evolve a region-specific model of COVID-19 management based on appropriate scientific data. “We need to organise genomic studies with epidemiological investigations to obtain scientific data on the basis of which the government can prepare a better plan of COVID-19 management and its implementation,” he said. Since the pandemic response is citizen centric, it is worthwhile to consider the formation of People’s Committees (PCs) at the ward levels in the municipal areas and at the panchayat level in the villages. The Union Territory has five municipalities spread over 121 municipal wards and 10 commune panchayats with 92 villages. The government should constitute 213 PCs immediately. Each committee should be headed by a former MC in urban areas and a former president of the panchayat at the village level. The committee should include active and willing members of the Voluntary Agency, Youth Club, Madhar Sangam and women Self Help Groups functioning in the area. A teacher, village level worker, health worker, anganwadi worker, police, a religious head of the area should also be part of the committee. Plugging loopholes Apart from setting up of additional testing centres at Puducherry and other regions and accelerating results, he suggested plugging the loopholes in case of detection as the experience hitherto suggests that considerable percentage of cases are missed by single RT-PCR test alone due to limitations of swab collection, transport efficiency and laboratory competency. The government may aim to reduce the test positive rate to less than 1 and the Union Territory should test 7,500 persons per day which should go up to 10,000 . He advocated a ban on large-scale social, political, sports, cultural, religious and entertainment gatherings. Dusk-to-dawn curfews could be imposed without hindering smooth movement of freight and essentials. The supply chain and overall industrial activities should remain unaffected. Police should take stringent steps to regulate crowding and ensure social distancing at potential hot spots. Time restriction on the functioning of markets may be considered. He called for higher vigil at all borders of the Union Territory to certify the entry of symptom free people into the territory after careful medical examination. Alternatively, the government has to make COVID-19 test mandatory for all visitors. Drafting in a panel of experts in virology drawn from the National Institute of Virology, Pune, AIIMS, New Delhi and Jipmer for guiding health strategy, monthly assistance of Rs. 6,000 to COVID-affected families and increasing the outpatient facilities at the Rajiv Gandhi hospital and GH were other suggestions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alternative-strategy-to-contain-covid-19-sought/article34410665.ece

26 April 2021||Pudukottai,TAMIL NADU||Pudukottai’s mental health programme is proving to be a boon||Over 8,500 people have benefited from the District Mental Health Programme in Pudukottai since last year. The programme also has a helpline, through which COVID-19 patients, their contacts and even healthcare workers dial in for counselling. At the time of inception in March 2020, counselling was undertaken for stress management, and training was imparted to nurses, and other medical and non-medical staff at Primary Health Centres (PHCs). Thursdays were identified as ‘Mental Health Thursdays’ across Pudukottai for conduct of awareness programmes through all PHCs and government hospitals. With the COVID-19 lockdown and the stress which arose due to it, focussed group counselling- for students, aspirants of competitive examinations, and sanitary workers on duty were also undertaken. R. Karthik Deivanayagam, District Mental Health Programme officer, Pudukottai district, says a dedicated helpline will be rolled out for healthcare workers keeping in mind the second wave of COVID-19. The helpline launched last year has received 39,655 calls, and the phones continue to ring with apprehensive people calling for guidance about the viral infection. Dr. Deivanayagam said that each caller is called back at least three or four times in the subsequent days to monitor their wellness. The kind of treatment is called supportive psychotherapy, he said. Dr. Karthik Deivanayagam believed that inter-departmental dependence was the reason for the success of the programme. “Some callers inform us that their reason for anxiety and stress was the difficulty for families to procure groceries and food due to hospitalisation of their parents. We immediately inform the revenue department who intervene and help,” he said. Similarly, while counselling COVID-19 patients, the psychiatrists inform the doctors in the hospital about the patients’ condition. In rural areas, village mental health committees are being formed led by panchayat members, doctors and patients receiving treatment, if there are any. An Emergency Care and Recovery Centre has also been created at the Muthulakshmi Reddy Memorial Government Hospital. Taluk-level rescue teams were created and these teams rescued patients who required admission for treatment. In the last year, 40 patients have been admitted, of whom 20 have been treated and rehabilitated with their families. “We call this the Pudukottai Model and hope that all other districts can adapt it,” Dr. Deivanayagam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pudukottais-mental-health-programme-is-proving-to-be-a-boon/article34410084.ece

26 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Curfew is no barrier||A group of small business owners and workers distributed nearly 300 food packets to the homeless and destitute on the streets of Tiruchi on Sunday. Unlike week days when they would get food one way or another, the Sunday lockdown meant that all their sources were shut off, and hence the initiative was carried out, functionaries of the group called Kanavu Paadhai Nanbarkal Kuzhu said. About 250 members of the group mobilised funds, groceries, and meals for the needy, especially those living on the streets. “We saw that there was nobody to help these people and we took it up,” K. Jahir Hussain, a member of the group said. The group also keeps in touch with restaurants and convention halls from where they take excess food and distribute it to the needy. On Sunday afternoon, the group, at their own expense prepared and distributed curd rice along with pickle to nearly 300 people living on the streets across the city, from Tiruchi Railway Junction to Amma Mandapam. The food was prepared early in the morning, and all the members packed it and prepared it for delivery by 11 a.m. “About 12 of our members took the food and travelled on their two-wheelers to various parts of the city, distributing the food packets. Since we do this in a systematic manner, authorities too, did not object,” Mr. Hussain said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/curfew-is-no-barrier/article34410087.ece
26 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Stop public sector units from enforcing penalty clauses: BHELSIA||The BHEL Small and Medium Industries Association (BHELSIA) has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that public sector units (PSUs) did not enforce penalty clauses against MSMEs for delays or slippages in meeting contracted supply obligations. In a representation sent to the Prime Minister, BHELSIA president Rajappa Rajkumar said that this was essential to save fabrication units in Tiruchi from turning sick and closing down. The Centre, he suggested, could also consider issuing an order granting amnesty to all MSMEs executing contracts to PSUs and government agencies from penalties for delay in delivery of contracted items. Mr. Rajkumar said that a number of MSMEs, particularly in Tiruchi, execute contracts for various public sector undertakings throughout India supplying critical components and engineering items. There were about 400 MSMEs here catering to the demands of PSUs for ancillary items. Their operations were smooth until the Supreme Court Order cancelling the coal contracts. “The situation turned from bad to worse after the lockdown was imposed due to the pandemic last year and even survival has become very difficult for the MSMEs,” he said. Besides restrictions such as complete closure of units and inter-State movement of materials and finished goods, several migrant workers left the workplace creating a vacuum even though employers were willing to provide sustenance to them during the period of closure. Though the restrictions were gradually relaxed later, it took considerable time for the MSMEs to resume operations and stabilise production after remobilisation of labour and sourcing raw materials after the long shutdown. Just as the units were limping back to normality, another wave of pandemic has resulted in fresh restrictions. Currently, use of oxygen for industry has been restricted / banned. Without adequate oxygen supply, the units will not be unable to cut plates for processing. This would lead to stoppage of production as cutting is the first operation in fabrication process. The exodus of migrant workers again and local shutdowns have crippled the movement of men and material, Mr. Rajappa contended. Hence, the units are not able sustain their normal level of operations since March 2020 and consequently there have been slippages in completing supplies as per the contracts. PSU clients are threatening to enforce the penalty clause of contract for delayed supply and this has put many MSMEs under severe strain. “The situation arising out of the pandemic and its consequences should be treated as force majeure. This will provide a great relief to the industries. The situation is still volatile and we are afraid this may continue for a considerable time,” Mr. Rajkumar said and urged the Prime Minister to stop PSUs from enforcing the penalty clauses till September-end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stop-public-sector-units-from-enforcing-penalty-clauses-bhelsia/article34410076.ece

26 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||WhatsApp groups seek poll result predictions||As the day of counting of votes for the Assembly election draws closer, new WhatsApp groups have surfaced, inviting members to predict the results accurately and win prizes. Some of them have become an instant hit. One of the groups has framed rules and asked participants to post their observations and details. In order to remain apolitical, the admin of another group has asked the members to refrain from making personal attacks. To motivate the members, some groups have announced cash prizes ranging from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 10,000 and gift hampers. Similar to the opinion polls conducted by various organisations, the opinions and predictions are deeply divided in the election results groups too. In one such group, nearly 50% of the participants predicted an edge for the DMK-led alliance, while others predicted a win for the AIADMK.

26 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Tiruchi wears a deserted look||Normal life came to a virtual standstill on Sunday as people stayed indoors and vehicles kept off the roads during the course of the lockdown imposed by the State government to check the spread of COVID-19 virus.

CM urges PM||“Furthermore, the States to which the allotment has been made have a lower number of active cases than us and have major steel industries located within or close by. Hence, the diversion from the Sriperumbudur plant, which supplies to Chennai city that has the second biggest case-load in south India, seems to have no justification. This needs to be immediately corrected,” Mr. Palaniswami said. He further said that while Tamil Nadu had never imposed any restriction and was always ready to help other States, “such mandatory diversion of liquid oxygen from our State can lead to a major crisis in Chennai and other districts”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cancel-oxygen-diversion-tn-cm-urges-pm/article34410110.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Readers Mail||The condition of the road between Erikadu and Erumaipatti hamlets in Kombai Panchayat on pachaimalai hills which has remained bad for long has turned worse, much to the chagrin of the residents using the back-breaking 1.5 km stretch. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation operates a bus from Thuraiyur Bus Stand to Erikadu via Sempulichampatti, Maruthai and Erumaipatti. Pits and gravel erosion has caused utmost discomfort to two-wheeler riders. It's time the damaged stretch was re-laid.  Saravanan Natesan  Puthanampatti   In the midst of summer, it is imperative for people to safeguard themselves from COVID-19 by remaining indoors. For, travel increases chances of contracting and spreading COVID-19. We are still in a spot of bother and need to exercise abundant caution by sticking to the safety procedures. Also, one must take care to consume adequate fluids to build immunity, live in well-ventilated space.  M. A. Aleem      The intention of the government behind imposing fines for not wearing masks - to enforcing safe practices to prevent spread of COVID-19 - is understandable, but hefty fines are being imposed. It would be apt if the government retains one portion of the amount as fine, and supplies masks to those without the protection for the remaining amount. It would prevent a repetition of the offence.  Dimple R. Mohan  Sangiliyandapuram   In a vast and hugely-populated country like India, wearing of masks and vaccination are the only ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Alongside, all sections of the population need to be involved in the fight against the pandemic. Having instructed people to work from home and students to attend online classes, the government could have extended the same online approach for political campaign. Adaptation to the pandemic situation is inevitable and need of the hour. Transportation of goods must be permitted in the night hours so as to prevent vehicular traffic during daytime. Politicians, leaders, officials and social groups have to lead by example to prevent the further spread of the pandemic.  A. Meenakshisundari Cantonment   The steep rise in the number of COVID-19 active cases in the recent past is worrisome. Yet, the scenario in departmental stores, grocery shops and vegetable joints depict carelessness of the people as not many could be found wearing masks. The onus is on the business community to make customers wear face masks and maintain social distancing while making purchases.  M. Raja  Tiruchi   While the first wave of COVID-19 could be controlled appreciably, a sense of complacency seems to have set in now among people with regard to following safety norms at the time of the second wave. The significance of the adage ‘Better late than never’ has to sink in among people to mitigate severity of the pandemic.  S. Raghavan Cantonment   The Centre's decision to prioritise use of oxygen for COVID-19 patients over industrial needs is a step in right direction. But then, any effort to reduce the COVID-19 positive cases will bear fruit only with complete cooperation by the people by way of adhering to safety protocol.  R. Pichumani  Thippirajapuram   The outer surface of the road over the railway bridge road at Budalur has turned rough and has a lot of potholes. Motorists struggle to negotiate the pits. Black-topping of the stretch will make the ride safe for motorists.  M. Sheik Abdullah  Budalur||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/readers-mail/article34410082.ece

26 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||We will improve infrastructure on a war-footing, says Joshi||Union Minister Pralhad Joshi has expressed concern that the second wave of COVID-19 is more serious and devastating and is spreading at a faster rate than the first. “However, the Union and State governments have geared up to face the challenge and they will improve infrastructure on a war-footing. Hopefully, the curve will flatten shortly,” he said. He was speaking to journalists after inspecting medical facilities and oxygen stock at the Civil Hospital in Dharwad on Sunday. As of now, there are 1,300 beds available in private and government hospitals in Hubballi-Dharwad. The government plans to create 1,000 additional beds, he said. “I have spoken to Dharmasthala Dharmadhikari and head of SDM Hospitals Veerendra Heggade asking him to reserve more beds for COVID-19 cases. He has agreed. SDM Director Niranjan Kumar has assured us of reserving 500 beds with oxygen facilities at the SDM Hospital at Sattur in Dharwad. I have also appealed to them to treat patients at government fixed prices,” he said. He urged other private hospitals to reserve some of their beds for pandemic patients. He said that there was no shortage of Remdesivir injections, oxygen supply or ventilators in the district. “We have 150 ventilators ready here and oxygen is being continuously supplied from Karnatak Industrial Gas unit at Sattur and also from Jindal Steel plant in Ballari. I have spoken to Jindal company officers who have assured us of supplying oxygen across the State. Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar has also spoken to them,” he said. The Centre has sent 800 tonnes of oxygen and 1.22 lakh doses of Remdesivir. They reached Bengaluru on Saturday. Custom duty on life saving drugs and oxygen has been waived by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for six months, he added. Oxygen tanks and even plants are being air-lifted from Singapore and Germany. Indian Railways is running Oxygen Express trains to places with high prevalence rates, Mr. Joshi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/we-will-improve-infrastructure-on-a-war-footing-says-joshi/article34410171.ece
26 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Proper management can help overcome oxygen scarcity’||The former MP and industrialist Vijay Sankeshwar has criticised some of the Union and State government policies and methods of handling the pandemic. First of all, the Union government should withdraw its announcement that it will provide foodgrains to BPL families for the next few months. This makes the beneficiaries lazy and they will not come to work, he said. “When we ask workers to come to work, they refuse saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is giving them free foodgrains. The Union government should make them work and pay wages instead,’’ he told journalists in Hubballi on Sunday. “Free ration for 80 crore Indians is a big mistake,” he said. According to him, only around 30 lakh-40 lakh people were living in utter poverty in the country and free ration should be given only to them,’ he said. Free foodgrains will stop workers from seeking work, he said. Mr. Sankeshwar criticised the holding of elections in Karnataka and other States and the Kumbh Mela gathering in Haridwar, during the pandemic. He, however, said that despite all such challenges, the Prime Minister and all the Chief Ministers were doing a commendable work in managing the epidemic. He expressed the confidence that the Prime Minister would rectify the oxygen scarcity soon. He said that the scarcity was artificial and could be resolved through proper management. “Till now, Linde India, a private company that produces 50% of India’s liquid oxygen, was supplying only around 1% of its total production to the health care sector, while giving the rest 99% for industrial use,” he said. However, with the Modi government banning the supply of liquid oxygen to industries, there will be enough oxygen supply to hospitals, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/proper-management-can-help-overcome-oxygen-scarcity/article34410177.ece

We were forced to take strict steps like closing down of non-essential shops and offices, night curfew and weekend curfew, as the casual attitude and negligent behaviour of the people led to a spike in cases,” Mr. Shettar said in Dharwad. “We are considering extending night curfew and weekend curfew for the next one week. But there has been no final decision yet,” he said. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has called for a Cabinet meeting on Monday where a decision will be taken. Inputs from a six-member expert committee will be considered, he added. He said that the tough rules were to break the infection chain. He urged the people not to think that the government was acting tough against them. “It is for your own good. If you cooperate, it will flatten the curve,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/weekend-curfew-may-continue-says-shettar/article34410178.ece

26 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Demand for O2 cylinders for home use puts strain on supply||Apoorva S. was relieved when she successfully organised an oxygen cylinder for her COVID-19 positive husband who is undergoing treatment at home as he was unable to find a bed in Bengaluru. But her relief was short-lived, and her anxiety returned almost immediately as she started planning to procure more oxygen. “I either have to find him an oxygenated bed or another cylinder of oxygen, before the one we have runs out. Neither beds nor oxygen cylinders are easy to come by in the city,” she said. She spent the better part of the last two days calling up hospitals and oxygen suppliers, begging for a bed or a cylinder. For the past one year, Syed Touseef Masood has been coordinating six oxygen control rooms run by Mercy Mission. “We have 500 oxygen cylinders that we continuously refill and give out to patients in dire need, whose oxygen saturation levels are low but are unable to get beds. In our experience, this can only work as a stop gap arrangement till they find a bed.” He observed that over the last ten days, the demand for oxygen to be administered at home has risen exceeding the limited resources they have. “The core problem is unavailability of oxygenated ICU beds and shortage of oxygen supply. There have been many cases where patients with low oxygen saturation are unable to get either a bed or oxygen cylinder, which may lead to death,” he said. The crisis has also hit non COVID-19 patients, who are dependent on a steady supply of oxygen to go about their daily life such as people suffering from acute pulmonary diseases. “There are many senior citizens who take oxygen regularly at home. Most of them are suddenly finding themselves left high and dry,” said Rajendra Prasad, an oxygen supplier in Mandya and Bengaluru. Demand and scarcity has spurred a price rise and even a black market. Depending on its capacity, a cylinder can cost anywhere between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 5,000. “The price of an oxygen cylinder has gone up several times in the market,” said Aravind Kumar, working at an oxygen supplier in the city. Mr. Prasad said that in the past week, even regulators for the cylinders have run out of stock. “I have been trying to procure them from producers in Kolkata and Delhi for the past two days to no avail. Without a regulator, the cylinder is useless,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/demand-for-o2-cylinders-for-home-use-puts-strain-on-supply/article34410479.ece
26 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Yediyurappa’s diktat has uneven impact||Nearly a week after the BJP government came under intense criticism from the Opposition over district in-charge Ministers not doing enough in their districts, it seems to have been a mixed effort from the Ministers, who have been present, physically or virtually, to monitor the situation. Following the criticism from the Opposition at the all-party meeting convened by Governor Vajubhai R. Vala, the Ministers were nudged to be more proactive in their districts by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. The surge in COVID-19 cases outside Bengaluru has become a cause for concern since several districts are reporting a higher Case Fatality Rate and higher cases in proportion to their population. However, it has now emerged that most of the Ministers monitoring their own home districts in their capacity as district in-charge are working from the ground, while the others remain mostly physically absent and are monitoring remotely. No one in charge Belagavi and Chikkamagaluru districts have no district in-charge Ministers following the resignation of Ramesh Jarkiholi and C.T. Ravi. Belagavi is being monitored informally by Food and Civil Supplies Minister Umesh Katti, while officials are managing the Chikkamagaluru situation. Incidentally, four Cabinet Ministers, including Mr. Katti, are from Belagavi. Deputy Chief Ministers Govind Karjol and Laxman Savadi, who are the in-charge Ministers of Kalaburagi and Raichur, respectively, have not been seen in the districts in the recent past. Mr. Karjol, who is in charge of his native district Bagalkot as well, had opted for virtual monitoring during floods. He has chosen the same mode this time too. After visiting Raichur along with Mr. Yediyurappa last month for attending the BJP’s election campaign for Maski, Mr. Savadi has not returned to the district. He, however, held a meeting online on Friday. Koppal in-charge and Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil, who is from Hirekerur in Haveri district, held a meeting of senior officers and legislators on April 19. After that, he neither visited the district nor held any virtual meetings, sources said. In the coastal district of Udupi, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai has only been able to participate in a videoconference meeting with the district administration once, on April 22. Kodagu in-charge and Housing Minister V. Somanna visited Madikeri last Friday and promised to hold videoconference meetings thrice a week. Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar, who is in charge of Mysuru district, had accompanied Health Minister K. Sudhakar during a visit on Thursday. Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar, who is in charge of Chamarajanagar, met officials on Friday. Minister for Excise K. Gopalaiah, the Hassan in-charge, visited the district on Friday. The Ministers are “in touch on phone” with officials, these district administrations claim. On home turf Meanwhile, Ministers holding charge in their home districts — such as Backward Classes and Muzrai Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary in Dakshina Kannada, Minister for RDPR K.S. Eshwarappa in Shivamogga, Prabhu Chauhan in Bidar, and Anand Singh in Ballari — have been seen spending more time being physically present there.  (Compiled by Sharath S. Srivatsa with inputs from R.

26 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cases of illegal sale of Remdesivir unearthed||The Drugs Control Department, which is working with the Central Crime Branch police in its drive against the black marketing of Remdesivir, unearthed yet another racket where a private hospital in Varthur allegedly purchased vials illegally to treat patients. Acting on a complaint filed by Harish A.R., drug inspector, the Varthur police on Saturday registered an FIR against Thrivikram Reddy, managing director of Sahasra Hospital. He has been booked for cheating and also under various sections of the Drug Control Act. Purchase details While on an inspection of the hospital, Mr. Harish requested the hospital for purchase details of the injections and also the patients’ case details. “The staff failed to produce the files. In his complaint, Mr. Harish said he suspects that the hospital had purchased the injections in black market to make profits illegally and sought a detailed investigation to ascertain the source of drugs,” said a police officer. In another case, a 33-year-old doctor and receptionist of a private hospital were arrested by the Jigani police on Sunday for allegedly trying to sell Remdesivir vials for Rs. 15,000. The accused has been identified as Dr. Farman Ali, resident of Austin Town, who had joined Ace Suhas Hospital in Jigani two months ago. The other accused is Rakshith V. Salian is a receptionist, said the police. The police, who seized two vials that the accused had procured from the government quota, also booked Jagadish Hiremath, head of the hospital.

26 April 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Hassan police, CWC stop two child marriages||The staff of the Child Helpline and government officials stopped two minor girls from getting married in Hassan on Sunday. The relatives of one girl, whom the officers had brought to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in Hassan, took her back forcibly in a vehicle, prompting the police to intervene and bring back the girl to the custody of CWC. The staff at Child Helpline received information about a 17-year-old girl’s marriage scheduled at Hampanahalli in Hassan taluk. The staff reached the spot and succeeded in stopping the marriage and took the girl to the office of CWC in Hassan. Even as the CWC officials were engaged in the procedure of recording statements, the relatives of the girl took her forcibly and fled in a car. CWC chairperson Komala contacted the police immediately and succeeded in bringing the girl back to the CWC’s custody. Another marriage of a girl from Boovanahalli near Hassan, was arranged at Tirupathihalli in Hassan. As the information reached the officials, the girl and her parents were stopped on the outskirts of Hassan, even before they could reach the venue. Anganwadi worker Sudha, Panchayat Development Officer Prakash, police and the Child Helpline staff were involved in stopping the marriage. The parents of the girl had taken permission to hold the marriage during the lockdown from the Hassan tahsildar. It is said the parents had tampered with the Aadhaar card of the girl to show her age above 18 years while seeking permission. When the Child Helpline staff enquired about her educational records, it came to light she was 17. Both the girls are in the custody of the Child Welfare Committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hassan-police-cwc-stop-two-child-marriages/article34410292.ece
26 April 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Towns, cities in Kalyana Karnataka region largely deserted during weekend curfew||The weekend curfew imposed for the containment of rapidly spreading COVID-19 evoked a good response in the districts of the Kalyana Karnataka region on the second day on Sunday. Towns and cities across the region largely wore deserted looks as most of the commercial establishments, except for those offering essential goods and services, remained closed and vehicular movement thin. Police vehicles were found patrolling the city blowing sirens and appealing to the people through loudspeakers to remain indoors. Since the district administrations had deployed teams in places where people tend to assemble in large numbers, including markets, on Friday itself with a view to sensitise the people on the weekend curfew, these busy places also wore a deserted look on Saturday and Sunday. People were allowed to visit grocery shops and buy essential commodities between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. In Kalaburagi city, police took strict action against people who ventured out without any valid reasons. In some places, they even beat up those found on the roads and who could not give the police any valid reason for venturing out. Shops in Super Market, Kapda Bazaar, SVP Chowk, China Market, Kirana Bazaar and other areas that are heavily crowded on normal days remained closed. Mariyammanahalli Police in Hosapete taluk, Vijayanagara district, seized 25 vehicles that were on the roads in violation of the lockdown norms. Police Sub-Inspector M. Shivakumar, along with his staff, was found beating people who were out on the streets without any valid reason. Kottur Tahsildar G. Anil Kumar fined motorcyclists outside the NEKRTC Bus Stand in the town. COVID-19 awareness teams in Koppal visited the residential localities in the city and surrounding villages and undertook a campaign there. The police heavily barricaded many places, including Ambedkar Circle, Basaveshwara Circle, Teen Kandeel, Chandramouleshwara Circle and Gandhi Chowk, to prevent vehicular movement. The administration collected over Rs. 1.20 lakh in fine from those who were out on the roads on Saturday and Sunday in violation of the lockdown norms and seized over 100 vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/towns-cities-in-kalyana-karnataka-region-largely-deserted-during-weekend-curfew/article34410181.ece
26 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Many a marriage over the weekend in twin districts||The second day of weekend curfew witnessed many a marriage in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts albeit with thin attendance. Marriages were held in temples, conventional halls and in some houses. COVID-19 restrictions had forced some families to shift venues fixed earlier, from halls to houses. As many as 90 marriages were held in about 10 locations surrounding the Durgaparameshwari Temple in Kateel. “Five members each from the bride and bridegroom side, respectively, took part in them. There was no crowd,” Moodbidri MLA Umanath A. Kotian told The Hindu . All the 90 marriages were scheduled to be held at the temple on Sunday. With restrictions to allow only 50 persons for each marriage, these marriages were held at community hall, school and eight other places near the temple. “Apart from five each from bride and bridegroom side, a priest and a photographer were part of the ceremony. Each marriage ceremony lasted about 15 minutes,” he said and added that the married couple left the place after paying obeisances to the Goddess from outside the temple. “The marriages went on nicely ensuring compliance with the guidelines laid down by the State government,” Mr. Kotian said. Swastik Friends Club founded by Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat member Tungappa Bangera organised its 13th annual mass marriage at Punjalkatte in Bantwal taluk with 16 couple tying the nuptial knot. Marriages of eight couples were performed at 9.45 a.m. and the remaining eight couple entered wedlock at 11.45 a.m. One of the organisers Rakesh Bangera said that two relatives each from the bride and bridegroom side were allowed to participate. Everybody wore masks and kept social distancing. “The event was organised in compliance with the stipulated regulations,” he said and added that the Panchayat Development Officer of Punjalkatte Gram Panchayat was present at the venue to prevent any COVID-19 violation. Meanwhile, after images of the mass marriage were circulated on the social media, Bantwal Tahsildar Rashmi sought a report in writing from the Panchayat Development Officer of Punjalkatte Gram Panchayat. Mangaluru City Corporation had given permission to people to hold 80 marriages in the city. “Our personnel visited these places, I have also seen photographs of these events. There was no case of violation of norms laid down by the State government,” said corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar. Managaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath set up a help desk at his office in the city corporation building to help people in securing permission for marriages scheduled on Sunday and Monday. “I too did not hear of any problems caused in such events on Sunday,” he said. An official communique said that the government authorities permitted 372 marriages in Dakshina Kannada on Sunday. Of these, 82 were in the jurisdiction of Mangaluru City Corporation, 225 in rural areas and 65 were in urban areas. Taluk-wise 52 marriages were permitted in rural areas of Mangaluru, 62 in Bantwal, 43 in Belthangady, 24 in Puttur, 19 in Sullia and nine in Kadaba taluk. Meanwhile, the Udupi district administration granted permission to conduct 644 marriages in the district on Sunday and Monday. Of these, 354 marriages were held on Sunday. Of the 354 marriages, the highest of 91 was in Kundapur taluk, followed by 71 in Udupi, 55 in Brahmavar, 54 in Baindoor, 41 in Karkala, 30 in Kaup and 12 in Hebri taluk.

26 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Competition to promote planting fruit-bearing saplings from June||Karkala-based non-government organisation, Jagrati Foundation, has come out with a unique programme to encourage planting of fruit-bearing saplings for the benefit of monkeys that have been straying into human habitation and agriculture fields in search of food. It has mooted State-level Vanara Vana (Park for Monkeys) competition for institutions and youth clubs wherein the organisations plant at least 15 saplings of long-term fruit-bearing tree species and nurturing them. Foundation’s honorary advisor Gurme Suresh Shetty told reporters in Udupi on Wednesday last that the winner in the competition will get a prize money of Rs. 55,000. Those desirous of participating in the competition can plant at least 15 saplings between June 1 and July 15 and send pictures of the formal planting programme to the foundation. After nurturing them for about two months, they have to again send pictures of the plants between September 15 and 30. In the last leg, photographs of the plants taken between December 15 and 30 have to be sent. All photographs should be taken from the same angle so as to assess plant growth properly, Mr. Shetty said. Foundation office-bearers will visit the spot to verify plant growth before declaring the winner on January 25, 2022. Consolation prizes will be given to one institution in each district of the State. Mr. Shetty said that the Jagrati Foundation comprises several enthusiastic youths who want to contribute to the betterment of the universe. He said that the twin objectives of conserving the environment and avoiding man-animal conflict could be addressed through the Vanara Vana competition. Endorsing the initiative, Udupi Pejawar Mutt Seer Sri Vishwaprasanna Tirtha Swamiji has urged schools, colleges and youth clubs to actively participate in the competition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-level-contest-to-promote-planting-fruit-bearing-saplings/article34410169.ece
26 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Declare health emergency, MP appeals to State govt.||Member of Parliament from Udupi-Chikkamagalur Shobha Karandlaje has appealed to the State government to declare a health emergency and take over 50% of beds in private hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients. The government should constitute a task force for this purpose, she said. The Member of Parliament has also requested the State government to provide financial assistance to small private hospitals to purchase ventilators. In addition, she said, the companies which manufacture ventilators should be paid advance fund to manufacture equipment in the required quantities. The step is to wade through the difficult times in view of increasing cases of COVID-19, she said in a letter written to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Saturday. She said that 1,000 ventilators should be provided for hospitals across the State. Ms. Karandlaje said that the Health Department should announce on a daily basis the availability of Remdesivir and oxygen to avoid panic among people. Many COVID-19 patients are out of fear psychosis showing urgency in getting themselves hospitalised. But that will lead to a condition of scarcity of beds to the needy COVID-19 patients. A help desk should be opened at every hospital and doctors should decide who needs hospitalisation. The MP said that it appears that the situation will go out of hand in the next fortnight. Hence, the government should take these steps to manage the situation in better manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/declare-health-emergency-mp-appeals-to-state-govt/article34410625.ece
26 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Art teachers give a new look to the office of Assistant Commissioner with Warli art||A group of 11 art teachers from Bantwal and Puttur have given a new look to the office premises of the Assistant Commissioner, Puttur sub-division, by drawing traditional Warli paintings on it. These teachers from different schools have put up paintings depicting local culture and customs on the corridor of the second floor of the Mini Vidhana Souda in Puttur. Puttur Assistant Commissioner Yatish Ullal said that the idea of getting the corridor painted with Warli paintings came to him after a discussion with his friend who is an arts teacher. “Apart from them giving grandeur to the premises, these paintings are easy to maintain. Hence, I was in favour of using the Warli art form for our office improvement project,” he said. Mr. Ullal said that he had had a discussion with Deputy Director of Public Instruction Malleswamy and Puttur Block Education Officer Lokesh after the maiden Kannada Sahitya Sammelan of teachers from Puttur and Kadaba taluks, which was held in the last week of March this year. “Mr. Malleswamy and Mr .Lokesh agreed to provide a set of 10 art teachers. I took concurrence of Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra and the work commenced on April 8,” he said. The group of teachers was led by Taranath Kairangala from the Government Secondary School, Manchi, Bantwal, and it comprised Jagannath Ariyadka from Government Pre University College, Kombettu; Prakash Vitla from Karnataka Public School, Kumbra; L.H. Goundi, Karnataka Public School, Keyyur; Jayalakshmi B. from Salmara School, Salmara; Sharada G. from Subhodha School, Panaje; Sucheth Sullia from Sandeepini School, Narimogaru; Srikanth Kambalakodi, Government Lower Primary School, Areltady, Savanuru; Charan Pudu, Government Upgraded Higher Primary School, Mukve; Keshava Mottetadka and Amit S.N. The teachers used the time available after a long list of holidays from April 8 to do the work. Mr. Kairangala said that apart from depicting government schemes such as on rainwater harvesting and on scholarships and pensions, this art form was used to show traditional culture, incluing Aati Kalinja, Go Puje and Bhoota Kola. The office of the surveyor was shown with a drawing of the Surveyor. “We started work on April 8 and completed it on April 14,” Mr. Kairangala said. Mr. Ulllal said that such beautification work will be taken up shortly on the first floor of the Mini Vidhana Soudha that comprises the Sub Registrar’s office and the office of Puttur MLA Sanjeeva Matandoor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/art-teachers-give-a-new-look-to-the-office-of-assistant-commissioner-with-warli-art/article34410624.ece

Shashi Kumar being the latest to fall victim. Mr. Kumar said that he got to know of a fake Facebook account in his name on Sunday evening soon after receiving a call from his friend who stated that there was request made for Rs. 6,000 through that social media account. In a message posted on his Facebook account, Mr. Kumar said, “A fake account with same photo and details created... all be careful... because someone may start requesting to transfer some money... all be alert on such requests.” Mr. Kumar said that he will file a complaint with the Cyber Crime Police on Monday. On April 11, Udupi Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha filed a complaint about a fake Facebook account in his name. Similar fake accounts have been created in the names of R. Chethan, Superintendent of Police, Coastal SecurityPolice; Durgaprasad M.R., Superintendent of Government Lady Goschen Hospital; and Santosh Kumar, Deputy Commissioner, Mangaluru City Corporation.

26 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Misquith Hospital licence suspended temporarily||Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra has ordered the temporary suspension of licence of Misquith Hospital in Surathkal on the charge that the hospital allowed Ayurvedic doctors administer allopathic treatment and appointed nurses not recognised by the Karnataka Nursing Council. The order was issued in his capacity as the district designated officer under the Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (KPME) Act. In a statement here, Dr. Rajendra said that the hospital was negligent in not testing Appi for COVID-19 when she was admitted in the hospital between March 6 and March 8. Appi died of COVID-19 complications on March 18. A look at the case sheet related to Appi showed the hospital’s negligence in treating Appi, he said. Dr. Rajendra said that the hospital has permitted a clinic that is not registered under the KPME Act, to function on its premises. During inspection, it was found that there were a total of 13 patients. Of these, only nine patients were admitted in the hospital, while four had not been admitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/misquith-hospital-licence-suspended-temporarily/article34410631.ece
26 April 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Revenue of Kukke temple drops||The COVID-19 pandemic and reduced footfall has hit one of the richest temples of Karnataka. The annual revenue of Kukke Subrahmanya Temple, a Muzrai temple, dropped by Rs. 29.98 crore in 2020-21, falling from Rs. 98.92 crore in 2019-20 to Rs. 68.94 crore. Many devotees from the State and outside visit the temple, mainly to offer “ sarpa samskara ” and “ ashlesha bali ” sevas. Both sevas are offered by people irrespective of religion. The temple attracts actors, politicians, and cricket players, among others. According to Mohanram Sulli, chairman of the temple management committee, the temple remained closed for devotees from March 17 to September 8 last year because of the lockdown and COVID-19 restrictions. Hence, the temple did not earn any revenue for about six months. The temple earns its revenue from hundi droppings, which include money, silver and gold, the fees fixed for sevas, rentals of its buildings and accommodation facilities, its arecanut plantation, and the interest on bank deposits and investments. During the last financial year, the revenue earned from hundi droppings stood at Rs. 12.75 crore, while that from various sevas was Rs. 24.10, Mr. Sulli said. He said the government allowed the conducting of some sevas from September 14 for a limited number of people. More sevas with more participants were allowed in a phased manner subsequently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/revenue-of-kukke-temple-drops/article34410306.ece

26 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Weekend curfew total on second day||The second day of the weekend curfew in Mysuru and surrounding regions was total on Sunday underlining the growing realization among the public of the gravity of the second wave of the pandemic. Though the police was present to ensure that people stayed indoors during the curfew hours, their numbers were conspicuously less and people voluntarily stayed indoors. Only pharmaceutical shops were open throughout the day and this was the scenario even in residential areas. This is unlike during political bandhs and curfews wherein the impact is only in the heart of the city and business establishments tend to ignore the call to shut down operations in residential areas. All the main arterial roads as also the major business hubs of the city remained shut. KSRTC ran skeletal services but there were hardly any takers. Though autorickshaws were found stationed in their respective stands to cater to any emergency, a majority did not find any passengers. But there was a semblance of activity between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. when the curfew hours were relaxed to enable the public to procure grocery or other essential items. The Railways operated intra and inter-State trains as per schedule but the number of outbound and inbound passengers were in double digits. As the publicity for the weekend curfew was given in advance, people had desisted from travelling in their own interest as evident in the small number of passengers. The surge in the number of COVID-19 cases was also a contributing factor for people taking precautionary measures and avoiding travelling. This was evident in the pharmaceutical shops where there were hardly any customers without their masks on. This is a far cry from the scenario till two weeks ago when COVID-19 appropriate behaviour was thrown to the wind. The scenario was similar in major towns like Nanjangud, T. Narsipur, Hunsur, Periyapatana, K.R. Nagar and even in the rural hinterland. In Kodagu, the recent spike in number of positive cases in the last few days has created concern and this resulted in people complying with the curfew norms in full. People in Chamarajanagar and Mandya too remained indoors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/weekend-curfew-total-on-second-day/article34410287.ece
26 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Property tax hike raises more questions||The controversy over the escalation in property tax which came into vogue under Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) limits with effect from April 1, refuses to die as citizens and activists continue to question the methodology for effecting the hike. Recently, a large group of citizens including the KPCC spokesperson M. Lakshman flayed the authorities for the manner in which the hike has been effected and threatened to file a PIL in the High Court questioning the escalation. On Sunday, activist Bhamy V. Shenoy, founding working president of Mysore Grahakara Parishat (MGP), questioned the rationale of the hike and described it as flawed at various levels. He computed the hike for different properties to find out that the increase is not 15% as claimed by MCC and mandated by the law. “In reality it is as much as 170% depending upon the vacant land around ones house,” said Dr. Shenoy. Till date, the MCC has not come up with any explanation about how they misled the public by stating it will go up by mere 15% and that too during a pandemic year, he added. Based on the calculations, he pointed out that a property with no vacant land around the house has a hike of only 14% while another property with a huge vacant land around the house has seen the tax increase by 170%. In the past, vacant land did not attract any tax. Thus a small house on a small plot had more or less the same tax liability as a small house on a large parcel of land. This was not fair and equitable since land is often far more valuable than the house, he said. The government is justified in levying a tax on vacant land, but they should have done it gradually and not at one go, he added. He also pointed out that there was no double taxation in case of houses without a Completion Report and wondered whether it was a change of policy or a glitch in the software. The list of cess had also increased and to the existing health, library, urban transport, beggary and solid waste management cess, the authorities have added garden and cemetery cess, Dr. Shenoy added. Similarly, the discount of 5% for paying the tax in April was only on house tax without cess. Now a 5% discount is applicable to all the cess. But the authorities have failed to include garden and cemetery cess. Dr. Shenoy, whose organisation fought for introduction of the Self Assessment System and strongly advocated the online payment system, said it is not clear on what basis depreciation rates for buildings have been fixed or how land and construction values have been arrived at in computation of the property tax. Calling for a committee of experts to go into the issue of property tax and conceive a sound policy, he said the present exercise has raised more questions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/property-tax-hike-raises-more-questions/article34410284.ece
26 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Shree Nagaraja theatre closes||Shree Nagaraja theatre situated at the junction of Kabir Road and Benki Nawab Street in Mandi Mohalla has become the latest single-screen theatre in the city to wind up operations. It had attracted film-goers for several decades by screening latest Hindi and Kannada hit films, besides English and other language movies also. The 650-seater had not screened any movie for more than a year now since COVID-19 lockdown was declared in March 2020. Rajaram, Secretary of Mysuru Theatre Owners Association, told Shree Nagaraja will no longer screen any movies and the theatre owners had put the building up for sale. Shree Nagaraja’s closure follows the closure of Shantala Talkies on Narayana Shastri Road in K.R. Mohalla last year. Shree Nagaraja becomes the tenth single-screen theatre to wind up operations in Mysuru in the last few years. Out of the 21 theatres, which were screening movies in the early nineties, only 11 are remaining in the city today, Mr. Rajaram said. Ganesh, Ratna and Vidyaranyawere among the first to close operations in the nineties. The other single-screen theatres which remain only in memory include Ranjit, Opera, Chamundeshwari, Sreenand, and Olympia. Sources in the theatre business in Mysuru said three more theatres in Mysuru were up for sale. “Though the three are presently screening movies, they will stop doing so if buyers come forward”, said the source. Meanwhile, Mr. Rajaram, who owns Gayathri theatre on Chamaraja Double Road, said the taxes were too heavy for theatre owners to profitably run their businesses. Contending that the property tax alone for Shree Nagaraja was more than Rs. 1.2 lakh per annum, besides trade licence, which costs another Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 25,000, Mr. Rajaram said theatre owners would prefer to sell their properties and plough the returns on some other business. While closure of single-screen theatres is considered a huge loss to the cinegoers in the city, multiplexes had come up in different malls. Even though the capacity of a multiplex may be higher, the seating capacity in each screen of the multiplex will be lesser than single-screen theatres, Mr. Rajaram said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shree-nagaraja-theatre-closes/article34410281.ece
26 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 second wave: Local units feel the pinch of lockdown, fear delay in revival||The second wave of COVID-19 has affected industrial activity in Mysuru with reports of minor hiccups affecting production. The spectre of prolonged lockdown and its cascading impact on the industries is worrying the stakeholders even though the industrial activity is not expected to screech to a halt like last year. Providing direct and indirect employment to nearly 2.5 lakh people in the city and surrounding areas including Nanjangud, there are about 100 major and medium enterprises apart from around 20,000 small scale units in the district, most of it engaged in manufacturing. The industrial sector suffered a massive slow down during the lockdown which came into effect on March 25, 2020. A little more than an year later the sector is beginning to see a similar trend with the rise in COVID-19 cases. Raw material “Supply and transportation of raw material from Maharasthra has been affected and we are beginning to feel the pinch,” said Suresh Kumar Jain, Secretary, Mysuru Industries’ Association. He pointed out that the transportation of raw materials was only being delayed and not stopped unlike last year. But in case the situation worsens and a lockdown is resorted to in the weeks ahead, then the industrial activity will go into a tailspin once again, he cautioned. A.S. Satish, president, Mysuru Chamber of Commerce and Industries (MCCI), said there is no national lockdown as last year but local lockdowns in Maharashtra and Mumbai and weekend lockdowns in the State will have a negative bearing. The total lockdown last year ensured that the migrant workers returned to their respective States leaving local units in the lurch. Subsequently, there was a graded unlocking and many did return but the supply chain had been badly hit which impacted the manufacturing sector. It took more than six months after the graded unlocking for the industries to attain 50% of their installed capacity. Much of it was due to issues that dovetailed with the overall pandemic situation in the country and across the globe. Now, a similar trend is being observed as a bulk of the components for auto industry manufactured in the ancillary units in Mysuru finds its way to Maharasthra which is shut. Also, the COVID-19 cases in Mysuru breaking out daily is the second highest in the State after Bengaluru while the active cases was pegged at 4,992 on Saturday evening. Tthis is another worrying trend. Closure of factories Meanwhile, the State government has issued a notification for closure of factories sparing units that are considered essential. These include food and packaging units, pharmaceuticals, etc., though engineering and manufacturing units will remain shut during the weekend lockdown starting April 24. Mr. Satish said bulk of the industries in Mysuru are general engineering and manufacturing units and are not categorized under the ‘essential’ list under the present circumstances. Hence, MCCI, MIA and others perceive the weekend lockdown will have a negative bearing or hamper the revival of the manufacturing units in Mysuru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-second-wave-local-units-feel-the-pinch-of-lockdown-fear-delay-in-revival/article34410288.ece

The opinion poll, conducted between April 16 and 19, captured the responses of various stakeholders, including teachers, students and parents, besides the general public, said GRAAM executive director Basavaraj R. Shreshta.A total of 1,487 respondents — 737 from rural areas and 750 from urban areas — participated in the Statewide survey, conducted by sharing a simple and structured online questionnaire.  The question went: “Should the board exam for class X students be conducted in 2021 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic?” “It is interesting to note that 78% of teachers, 60% of students, 60% of parents, and 65% of the general public who participated in the survey were in favour of conducting the exam at this juncture. In total, 64% of the respondents favoured holding the exam,” said a statement issued by GRAAM. When asked for an option to consider promotion of students to the next class without holding exam, but on the basis of internal assessment marks, a little more than half — 51% — of the respondents opined that the children should not be promoted this way. “Interestingly, 68% of the students expressed their consent to getting promoted to the next class based on internal assessment,” the survey report said. A majority of the respondents (70%) opposed the idea of holding the exam online for the Class X students. “A total of 64% of the students, 71% of parents, 86% of teachers, and 64% of the general public opposed the idea of online examination,” the report stated. Expectedly, the opposition to online exam was more from people in rural areas (77%) than in urban areas (63%). More than any other respondents, it was the teachers (86%) who were most against the idea of online exam. Also, a majority of respondents opined that students would face difficulty in choosing their next discipline of study without the results of class X exam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/majority-favours-offline-exam-for-class-x/article34410296.ece

He was trying to get down from the moving train at Yelahanka station on Saturday around 6.30 a.m. RPF personnel Madhav Singh and jis colleague Ashish Kumar were on rounds on platform number 3 when they saw the passenger, identified as M. Gurjeeth Singh, struggling to extricate his leg that was getting crushed. “Mr. Gurjeeth hails from Barnala district in Punjab and had come to the city to meet his friends. He realised that he had to get down at Yelahanka only when the train started to pull away from the platform. While trying to deboard, he slipped and his right foot got crushed,” said an official. The two RPF personnel pulled him to safety in the nick of time. They provided first aid to the injured passenger to stem the bleeding. He was taken to Yelahanka General Hospital, where he was treated for severe blood loss and later shifted to Victoria Hospital.

26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||Senior BJP leader Umesh Katti(in picture), who is now Food and Civil Supplies Minister, had been demanding the creation of a separate “Uttara Karnataka” State and had wished, publicly, that his son would become the Chief Minister of the “UK State” one day. In the past few years, he has made this statement every now and then. However, he has not repeated this since he was inducted into the Cabinet a few months ago. Meanwhile, his family has invested in a luxury hotel in Belagavi. Interestingly, it is named “UK -27”. Recently, journalists waiting for Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa at a hotel met Mr. Katti. A scribe asked him why he had stopped speaking about the separate State and asked whether his dream State of the “UK” existed only in imagination. Mr. Katti laughed aloud and said the “UK” that he had been talking about was just the name of the hotel, and not another State. He insisted that joining the Cabinet had nothing to do with the demand for a separate State. Any takers for this line of defence?   It has been argued that the export of COVID-19 vaccine by the Narendra Modi-led Union government is one of the reasons for the poor vaccination drive in the country. Even as the second wave of infection has struck lakhs of Indians, the Opposition Congress has highlighted the shortage of vaccines, ventilators, ICUs beds, and oxygen, and taken the Centre to task for its failure to properly manage the pandemic. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar has alleged that Mr. Modi exported vaccine in the ambition of becoming a global leader, but it cost the country’s people heavily. Instead of giving daily pravachana s (discourses), the Prime Minister should focus on increasing vaccination to save lives, he suggested.   Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah(in picture)has publicly refused to make any donation for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, citing its disputed nature. Wary of the BJP targeting him, he was forced to reveal to the public for the first time the fact that he has been silently patronising the construction of a Ram Mandir in his own native Siddaramanahundi in Mysuru. The construction of the temple was taken up more than a year ago, but was suspended because of the pandemic. It was, however, resumed subsequently and the inauguration was fixed for April 19 by Mr. Siddaramaiah, his wife Parvathamma, and son Yathindra, as per the plaque installed at the temple. With the inaugural date coming in the midst of a raging second wave of COVID-19, the former Chief Minister and his son, who is an MLA, gave the function a miss. Congress leaders in the district defended the father-son duo’s absence by saying they did not wish to attract a crowd during thepandemic and expose people to the infection. So, the inauguration by Ms. Parvathamma, who rarely makes public appearances, was perhaps just as low-key and inconspicuous as Mr. Siddaramaiah had originally intended.

26 April 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Portraying an open picture of patriarchy||'Brothers, Fathers and Uncles', a series of acrylic paintings by Melbourne-based artist Devi Seetharam displayed at ‘Shed D’ of the Kerala State Coir Corporation, one of the venues of the ‘Lokame Tharavadu’ contemporary art show, visualises patriarchy in Kerala society. Ms. Seetharam from Thiruvananthapuram, who grew up living in China, Cambodia, South Africa, Switzerland and Thailand, uses the paintings to divulge the dominance of men in contemporary Kerala. Although set in the State, instead of the usual lush green and vibrancy, her paintings “look worn, weathered and tired” in her own words. “The natural outdoor space, rather than being a celebration is in a state of being exhausted. This dictated the mood and colour palette and they are not supposed to be happy paintings,” says Ms. Seetharam. Caught in time warp She says that men are painted dark, to tackle their valued beauty standard. “Basically, it is supposed to be a study of our community, the notion of men occupying space, to being entitled to that space. Every painting is a reconfiguration of the men, but the details on the floor keep changing, signifying the passage of time," she says, adding that those items have fallen, but those men are still caught in a time warp. All the figures are wrapped in silvery white Kerala attire with the signature golden zari work accentuating the contrast. Ms. Seetharam completed her Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the Lasalle College of the Arts, Singapore, in 2011. Primarily a painter, she currently works with acrylic on canvas, using reductive techniques to create grain, texture and form. Ms. Seetharam was recently short-listed for the Incinerator and Darebin art prize in Australia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/portraying-an-unflattering-picture-of-patriarchy/article34410246.ece

And, when it is time for souls to meet, there is nothing on earth that can prevent them, not even the COVID-19. Sarath Mon, 28, of Kainakary in Alappuzha, who is undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Alappuzha, married Abhirami, 20, of Thekkanaryad here, in the hospital on Sunday. Outside the ward The couple tied the knot outside the COVID-19 ward in the hospital at 12.10 p.m. in a low-key affair. Sarath and his mother have been admitted to the MCH since April 21 with the disease. As there are no auspicious dates for the marriage any time soon, the families agreed to go ahead with the wedding as planned. They had contacted authorities and were given permission to conduct the marriage in the hospital in accordance with COVID-19 protocol. Exchange of garlands On Sunday, Ms. Abhirami, accompanied by a relative, reached the MCH just before the ‘muhurtham.’ Sarath tied the ‘thaali’ around the bride’s neck, the latter wearing a PPE kit, in the presence of his mother, the relative, and a few hospital staff. The couple also exchanged garlands made of basil leaves. Quarantine N. Sasidharan, Sarath’s father, who is observing mandatory quarantine at his house, said though he felt sad about not attending his son’s wedding, he was happy was that the function went off well as planned. “I want to thank all those who helped the wedding materialise,” he said. A few relatives of the groom and bride along with some politicians turned up outside the hospital building when the couple tied the knot. MCH authorities said the wedding was conducted by adhering to COVID-19 protocol. Earlier District Collector A. Alexander granted special permission for the function, based on a report of doctors.

26 April 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Tribal produce market turns online||When the first wave of COVID-19 hit, the Chilla, an exclusive market for tribal produce under the Marayur Sandalwood Division had to be closed for long. When it was reopened, again it had to be closed after the second wave hit affecting badly the livelihoods of tribespeople in the forest settlements of Marayur. Now the authorities have made arrangements to market the tribal produce online. UNDP help A mobile app and an online auction system for Chilla was developed in association with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The mobile app based online version was started two weeks ago and it proved a success. The Chilla market on every Thursday was launched seven years back and the tribespeople could sell all their farm produce through the auction. An important feature was that the consumers got organic and quality produce while the tribespeople could sell them at a higher price without middlemen. Marayur range officer M. G. Vinod Kumar said that the details of the produce are available through the mobile app. In the trial version the facilitator adds the amount of the produce which the auctioneer quoted. A big screen in front of the auction centre at Marayur displays it. If another auctioneer quotes a higher price the facilitator will include it too. When the final amount quoted is displayed for three minutes on the screen the deal is fixed, he said. If the price quoted is not remunerative, the farmer can withdraw his produce, he added. Soon the Chilla market will be fully online, he said adding that it will help those participating in the auction to do it without reaching the spot. Anyone can participate in the auction through online. By courier “In future we will start Chilla retail market and the people can buy the exclusive forest produce online. We will deliver the product through Kerala State Road Transport Corporation(KSRTC) courier service to anywhere in the State,” he said. The payment can also be done online. Every crisis is an opportunity and the new platform helps in reducing the cost. Marayur Sandalwood Division had earlier turned to e-auction for sandalwood. It was found more effective and auctioneers from far away places also participated in it. Chilla market has a currently a turnover of over Rs. 3 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tribal-produce-market-turns-online/article34410251.ece

The elephants had apparently come under a tiger attack. The carcass of the she-elephant, aged around 25 years, was found in a steep forest area nearly 4.5 km from Idaliparakudy, a settlement in Edamalakkudy tribal grama panchayat. It is suspected that the elephant fell to death from a rock while trying to ward off the tiger attack. The calf is believed to have been with its dead mother for two days. Hareendrakumar, Munnar range officer, said that tribespeople intimated the forest officers of loud voices, apparently of elephants and tigers, on April 18. The forest officials told them to keep away and monitor the situation. On April 20 a team of forest officials and veterinary surgeons reached the spot after being informed that the mother elephant was dead and the calf was staying close by. A necropsy was conducted on the she elephant and the carcass was buried there itself. The calf was transported to a forest camp at Devikulam, 31 km away, on a truck. Tribals’ opinion The official said that there were six wounds on the neck and legs of the calf. “However, it is healthy and is being monitored by forest veterinary surgeons.” He said tribals were of the opinion that the elephants were attacked by two sub-adult tigers. The tigers might have been learning to hunt and the elephant’s trumpeting could have scared them. The elephant died of injuries from the fall. “Once the calf recovers fully, it will be handed over to an elephant care centre,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/orphaned-elephant-calf-taken-to-forest-camp/article34410248.ece
26 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Amid opposition, MCH to be made COVID-19 treatment centre||The Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) at Kalamassery is gearing up to go back to being a 300-bed COVID treatment facility to handle the surge in cases and offer crucial COVID treatment services. But, medical students, house surgeons, and the parent-teacher association at the institution are all displeased with the district administration’s decision to turn it entirely into a COVID treatment centre. The hospital is in the process of shifting non-COVID patients to other government facilities. A total of 36 ICU beds will be available for COVID care. Teachers’ forum While the Ernakulam unit of the Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association had earlier suggested that the government must reconsider its decision to convert the MCH entirely into a COVID hospital, it appears to have now softened its stand. The association had suggested that academics should continue at the college and the MCH should be used to treat only category C patients, so that treatment for non-COVID patients can also continue. “But in an emergency situation, with a rapid rise in number of cases and patients requiring admissions and expert care, we might be forced to convert fully into a COVID treatment centre. Meanwhile, the peripheral centres should be strengthened and more facilities made available, so that academics and non-COVID services can resume at the earliest,” said Dr. Unmesh A.K., president of the association. Pregnant women Health officials maintain that the facilities at the MCH are crucial in handling the recent spike in cases. Sources said around 35 COVID-positive women were being provided antenatal care at the MCH. “The facility is crucial for deliveries in the case of COVID-positive pregnant women. When the district saw a surge in cases earlier, we were dependent on the MCH to handle the patient load. This time, the number of patients is much higher than what we saw then. Using all available resources at the MCH is absolutely necessary,” said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. Lakshmi Raghavan, chairperson of the students’ union at the medical college, said that medical students, house surgeons and postgraduate students, were worried about their academics and clinical postings being disrupted. OP facility “We want this medical college to function just like the others in the State, where non-COVID services continue. Though the administration has informed us that non-COVID outpatient treatment might continue here, patients will not arrive since there is talk of the entire facility being a COVID centre,” she said. “We understand that cases are on the rise. But facilities at other government hospitals should have been augmented to treat COVID patients,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/amid-opposition-mch-to-be-made-covid-19-treatment-centre/article34410596.ece

The KWA wants to continuously trench the stretch, while the NHAI has told it to probe alternatives like push-through method where the road surface is untouched, while the pipeline is pushed beneath it. Another suggestion is to construct a duct to lay the water pipeline. Traffic disruption NHAI sources said they feared major disruption of traffic and hassles to pedestrians if the KWA opted for the conventional pipe-laying method using trenching.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nhai-kwa-differ-on-pipe-laying/article34410604.ece
26 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Call to postpone public hearing on GIFT City||The residents of Ayyampuzha, where the proposed Global Industrial Finance and Trade (GIFT) City is slated to come up on around 500 acres, have appealed to the government not to hold the public hearing on various issues on April 30, as proposed earlier, in the backdrop of the rising COVID-19 cases. A public hearing has been planned at the Ayyampuzha panchayat hall, said a spokesman for Janakiya Munneta Samiti, which is opposing the project. According to the Samiti, the hearing is being opposed because hundreds of people will have to congregate in a small space. The Samiti said while the government was calling for physical distancing in public places, the hearing was a violation of its own prescriptions against COVID-19 spread. The Samiti held that while land was available under the Plantation Corporation for a project like GIFT City, it was not proper on the part of the State to take over the land and evict people from their homes. The proposed GIFT City is part of the Kochi-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor project. The meeting is scheduled to be held at 11 a.m. on April 30 in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol, and only 50 people will be allowed into the hall at a time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-to-postpone-public-hearing-on-gift-city/article34410603.ece

Capacity of plant The plant had the capacity of 260 m3 per hour gaseous oxygen, 235 litres of liquid medical oxygen, as well as storage capacity of 40 KL of liquid medical oxygen, said R. Venugopal, deputy chief controller of explosives PESO, and nodal officer for oxygen manufacturing, Kerala. He said that Kerala’s capacity in medical oxygen production now stood at 199 MT per day and that the State had a demand for 35 MT per day (MT pd) for COVID care and 45 MT per day for non-COVID care. Ramp up production He also said it was possible to ramp up our production in the short term. Presently, all filling plants were not running at 100% capacity. If demand for oxygen was there, we could go for 100% capacity. There were 11 plants in Kerala for filling cylinders änd they could function at 100% capacity, said Dr. Venugopal. He said that the daily oxygen production capacity from INOX, KMML, BPCL and ASU plants was sufficient to meet per day demand and that it was possible to build capacity in the next six months to meet the soaring demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nod-for-medical-oxygen-production/article34410200.ece

Kollam  As the district’s single day spike crossed 1,000 for the third consecutive day on Sunday, the Health Department has strengthened field testing in areas that reported highest number of fresh cases. District Collector B.Abdul Nasar has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in Kulasekharapuram panchayat considering the surge in positive cases. While a total of 1,209 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Sunday, the number of recoveries is 674. At the same time there is no sharp spike in the test positivity rate after the initial jump, says Health officials. The TPR was 4% on April first week and towards the fourth week it had touched 14%. “Then it came down to 11% and Kollam has the lowest TPR in Kerala.

26 April 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Riverine forest to get protection||The lush wilderness along the Meenachil’s banks near Peroor, Kottayam which is home to rare varieties of riparian plant species, has finally been afforded some real protection. Acting on a recommendation forwarded by the Kottayam Social Forestry Division and concerted efforts put up by the conservationists, the Ettumanur municipality has decided to accord the location the status of a local bio-diversity hotspot, sources said. The move enables the authorities to ensure protection of the riverine forest, which has been under pressure from sand-mining and illegal tree felling. Diversity Act Accordingly, the government agencies including the State police and the Kerala Forest Department can now enforce protection of the area by invoking provisions of the Biological Diversity Act 2002 . The two-km-long patch of land, which extends from the Poovathumoodu bridge to the hanging bridge at Peroor, has been home to different varieties of riparian plant species, commonly called Attuvanji, says G.Prasad, Assistant Conservator of Forests, Social Forestry Division. “It's an intimidating confusion of vines and towering trunks that also comprise plant species like Ochreinauclea missionis (Attuvanji) and Mallotus atrovirens (Ezhanjil), Tetramilis nudiflora (Thavalamaram) etc, which has been classified as ‘vulnerable’ by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources,” noted the official. The unique eco-system, according to him, also supports a variety of crustaceans, amphibians, fish and bird species including the bitterns and darters, besides regulating the micro-climate of the locality. The Kottayam Nature Society, a collective of nature enthusiasts that has been at the forefront of the efforts to conserve the land, recently held a mapping of the riparian plant species at the location. “It’s indeed a feral from the history of the Meenachil with an impenetrable network of roots. Protecting this green spectacle, which is one among only a handful of such locations left along the Meeanchil's course, from human interventions is crucial in conserving the river eco-system as a whole,” noted N.Unnikrishnan, a naturalist and secretary of the KNS. First step Declaration of the local bio-diversity spot, according to him, was only the first step in the right direction as the focus is on bringing it to the attention of the Kerala State Bio-Diversity Board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/riverine-forest-to-get-protection/article34410255.ece
26 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Police act tough on those who ventured out defying norms||Deploying patrol squads and operating mobile pickets, the police acted tough on those who defied weekend regulations put in place as part of the pandemic control measures in the district on Sunday. Though a majority were found falling in line with safety regulations, there were a few who tried to exploit loopholes in guidelines and ventured out for non-emergency purposes. Within Nadakkavu and Elathur police station limits, some traders who tried to carry out business without complying with physical-distancing norms were booked. There were also beauty parlour owners who faced action for not complying with directives. Details of legal action taken would be released on Monday. On national and State highways, there were multiple checking points to collect details of vehicles and passengers. Vehicles were allowed to proceed only after verifying personal affidavits explaining details of trips. Inter-district travel was strictly monitored near the district borders with separate police teams. “A majority of the vehicles we checked on Sunday were out for emergency purposes. They were only asked to follow personal safety measures,” said a Circle Inspector who was part of the patrol squads. Though Saturday’s activity was mostly focussed on creating awareness, many patrol squads swung into stringent enforcement on Sunday, he said. As the police had already warned of impounding vehicles used for non-emergency purposes and pleasure rides, there was a noticeable drop in vehicular traffic on Sunday. On the Kozhikode-Wayanad highway alone, there were three main checking points, which helped screen almost all vehicles. Subsequent to the fall in the number of passengers, only very few private buses conducted regular services. Following the District Collector’s order, patrol squads kept strict vigil around critical containment zones. Along with them, there were Incident Commanders, Sectoral Magistrates, and Rapid Response Teams to oversee the implementation of safety protocols. Some locals who were found wandering on the streets were asked to undergo mandatory RTPCR tests on Saturday and Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-act-tough-on-those-who-ventured-out-defying-norms/article34410205.ece
26 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Most patients home-quarantined||Amidst the rising number of COVID cases in the district, most patients not showing any symptoms is a big relief for health workers. At present, there are 29,279 COVID patients in the district, of which 23,204 patients do not have serious health risks and are quarantined in their homes. However, local bodies and vigilance committees are at their service if required.

Fresh cases On Sunday, the district recorded 3,998 new cases, of which eight patients recently came from other States. The source was unknown in 44 cases, while 3,946 people got infected through local transmission. As many as 14,564 samples were sent for testing, while 1,099 were cured and discharged on Sunday. There are 63,726 persons under observation in the district at present. Meanwhile, strict vigil is being kept to ensure space and availability of oxygen in hospitals, anticipating further rise in the number of positive cases. Ambulances in the district will have oxygen cylinders readily available. The district has been recording a test positivity rate above 20% continuously since April 16 and strict restrictions have been imposed in view of that. Section 144 has been declared in 454 containment zones, 94 critical containment zones and 28 local bodies in the district. The rate of spread of COVID-19 in the district is above the State average.

26 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Ensuring dignified last rites for victims||A spike in the number of critical COVID-19 cases and unexpected deaths have prompted many political and religious organisations in the district to voluntarily form their own youth task forces to ensure dignified last rites for victims of the pandemic. Complying with the safety protocol, they have reached out to many needy families that were going through a painful situation with the death of their dear and near ones. White Guards, COVID-19 Prevention Armym and Millat Brigade are some of such volunteer units supported by political parties like the Indian Union Muslim League, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and the Indian National League. Many similar volunteer groups supported by organisations like Kerala Catholic Youth Movement (KCYM), Seva Bharati, Muslim Youth League, and Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre are also functional in the district to lend a hand to their fellow beings in need. P.K. Subair, captain of the White Guards in Koduvally Assembly constituency, said his trained team had already carried out 35 funeral ceremonies irrespective of religious differences. “It was quite a demanding situation, and people were badly in need of support to survive. “Apart from funeral services, we took up disinfection activities and other related charity support for bereaved family members,” he said. Ambulance service for critical patients and delivery of medicines for those undergoing treatment at their homes are also being taken care of by many such local volunteer units. Students who are part of voluntary organisations, ex-servicemen, residents’ association leaders, teachers, and neighbourhood members have also stepped in with field support for the newly formed task forces. “We have named our initiative as Good Neighbours with a slew of measures to fight the pandemic. There will be separate help desks for facilitating vaccination, funeral services and emergency medical support under every unit in the State,” said a functionary of KCYM. He also said online awareness campaigns and emergency support for administrators in containment zones would be taken up by the Good Neighbours group. Sponsors representing charity organisations were also found standing by the voluntary task forces to provide them the required stock of personal protective equipment, masks, sanitisers and medicines. With the high precautionary measures, incidents of contracting the virus too were found very minimal among volunteers.

26 April 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Survey identifies 35 tigers in Parambikulam||A survey held at Parambikulam Tiger Reserve in recent weeks identified 35 tigers, indicating an increase in the apex predator population. Out of the 35 individuals identified, 22 were found in the last year survey and 13 were new tigers. There were two cubs among the tigers noted during the estimation done with camera traps, said S. Vysak, Deputy Director of Parambikulam Tiger Reserve. Fourth phase Mr. Vysak said that the survey was conducted as the fourth phase of the tiger monitoring programme initiated by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). “The early indications from this survey would go a long way in the long-term management and conservation and protection of tigers,” he said. The 40-day intensive monitoring had deployed camera traps in a grid pattern with one pair in every two square kilometer. The survey included the entire core area and buffer zones of Parambikulam Tiger Reserve. The tigers were identified from their unique stripe pattern. “Unlike the elephants, identifying tigers is easy as each tiger will have a unique stripe pattern. That’s how we identified 22 tigers which had been found in our camera traps in the last year’s monitoring,” said Mr. Vysak. The survey also found that Parambikulam has an estimated density of 2.43. In other words, there will be 2.43 tigers within 100 square kilometer. “We used spatially explicit modelling approaches to analyse the camera trap survey to find out density,” he said. According to Mr. Vysak, the existing tiger density in Parambikulam was because of a continued serve security, effective habitat management, tight control on wildfire incidents in the last 10 years, intact connectivity of habitats, and minimal human intervention. Animal movements “Although we could find the movement of many other animals, including a large number of leopards, the human disturbance was considerably less,” said Mr. Vysak. “COVID-19 restrictions could be one of the reasons for the decrease in human movement within the tiger reserve.” The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and NTCA jointly developed survey methodology after consultation with conservationists and wildlife experts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/35-tigers-identified-in-parambikulam/article34410000.ece

26 April 2021||SANGAREDDY,KERALA||Village well in Telangana becomes a super-spreader||Is a common collection point becoming super spreader of corona? Yes was the answer from public at least in the case of Peerla Tanda. This tanda with about 1,000 population was located in Narayankhed constituency and near both Karntaka and Maharashtra. People from these States visit this tanda frequently to visit darga and offer prayers and for animal sacrifice. The village has supply of Mission Bhagiratha water which will be given for about 10 minutes every day, according to claims made by villagers. About 500 metres away from the tanda is located an open well, which is the only water source available other than Mission Bhagiratha supply. Hence, people from the tanda arrive there from morning to collect water and they will be large in numbers. The villagers say that it has become a spreader of corona virus in the village which has witnessed as many as 70 cases in two days. It was stated that more than 100 members will be there at the open well in the morning hours to collect water and the mad rush was one of the reasons for witnessing a high number of corona cases, that is about 120 cases, 10% of the population. “I have personally spent money and dug as many as six borewells in the past few weeks and only one was successful with four-inch water. When we fixed a motor for that to connect it to a pipeline some villagers removed it. The bore was dug on March 13 after passing a resolution by the panchayat. From then, we are making repeated appeals for water but in vain. This can be addressed by the district authorities in no time but for the reasons best known to them it is not being addressed,” Pathloth Rajesh, sarpanch of the tanda, told The Hindu , adding that a large number of people gathering here and collecting water was one of the reasons for the spread of corona.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/village-well-in-telangana-becomes-a-super-spreader/article34409997.ece

While the number of ICU beds will be ramped up from 115 to 200, 130 of them will be equipped with ventilator facilities. The number of oxygen-supported beds for COVID-19 management will also be increased from 227 to 425. All non-COVID-19 patients will be shifted to the super-speciality block, and wards 16, 17, 18 and 19 will be reserved for their treatment. A total of 450 beds will be kept aside for non-COVID-related ailments. Surgeries deferred While all non-emergency surgeries will be deferred, non-COVID patients who did not require critical care would be referred back to the General Hospital and the Government Women and Children Hospital in Thycaud. Back-referred patients who were registered with the Kerala Arogya Suraksha Padhathi (KASP) could also be shifted to private hospitals accredited under the scheme. Medical equipment will be procured to handle the rising caseload at the MCH. Besides new equipment, those that have been remaining unused in other hospitals will also be collected. As many as 150 nurses and 150 cleaning staff will also be appointed through the National Health Mission (NHM) on emergency basis. For this, a walk-in-interview has been scheduled for nurses on Monday. Workers will also be engaged for the Ophthalmology and Respiratory Medicine Departments.

26 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||State has cash reserve of Rs. 3,000 cr. to buy vaccine: Isaac||The State Treasury has a cash balance of Rs. 3,000 crore on April 25 to purchase COVID-19 vaccines directly from manufacturers and making it available free of cost to the citizens as announced in the Budget, Finance Minister T. M. Thomas Isaac has said. “Money is not a problem for purchasing the vaccine directly from the manufacturers. We are waiting for the outcome of the negotiations being held by a committee led by the Chief Secretary and secretaries of Finance and Health with the manufacturers. A decision will be taken after completing the formalities,” Dr. Isaac told The Hindu on Sunday. A political decision in this regard is likely on Monday after an online all-party meeting convened by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. In view of the counting of votes on May 2, the government has made it clear that it will not wait for the Centre’s decision on distribution of free vaccine. ‘Centre can reimburse’ The State is of the view that the Centre can later reimburse the cost of the vaccine purchased. It is estimated that the State will need Rs. 1,300 crore for procuring the vaccine directly from the manufacturers. Although it was stated in the Budget presented by Dr. Isaac that COVID-19 vaccine would be distributed free, no Budget allocation was made. The Minister is of the view that additional expense can be made from the cash balance of Rs. 3,000 crore. The expense for vaccine purchase can be ratified by the Assembly by creating a new Head of Account. Pay revision Dr. Isaac hinted that austerity measures will have to be adopted as the additional expenses will be incurred soon after implementing the pay revision for government employees and teachers and revised pension. A sum of Rs. 5,000 crore was needed for pay revision and arrears. “The State Budget is only Rs. 1.60 lakh crore. It is a fact that the income will not increase during the pandemic period and expenses will shoot up. Some austerity measures will have to be adopted,” the Minister said. Dr. Isaac also criticised the decision of the Serum Institute of India to price the vaccine at Rs. 600 a dose and said citizens should protest. “The Institute has no right to revise the prices,” he said, adding the State will purchase the vaccine whatever be the price.

26 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Curbs on daily life likely to be extended||On Sunday, the State seemed on track to extend the duration of restrictions on civic life to slow down the spread of COVID-19. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will chair an all-party meeting on Monday to arrive at a general agreement on whether or not to widen the scope of the curbs. Mr. Vijayan hinted on Saturday that the State was in the long haul for an extended period of restraints on daily life. He had urged people to hold off unessential events ‘for at least a month’. An official said much would hinge on the trajectory of the current phase of the pestilence. The daily caseload and transmission rate would determine the nature and intensity of future stipulations. Keeping economy alive The government has attempted to walk a tightrope between imposing a strict pandemic code and keeping the economy ticking to protect jobs. The 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew is likely to continue. The administration would take a call on continuing the ban on non-essential travel and indoor dining. Work from home arrangement would stay. Schools, colleges and cultural venues were likely to remain shuttered. The government might restrict the number of attendees at social gatherings further. The government would also seek political support to procure vaccines against long odds, including pricing and availability. It would soon unveil its plan for rapid and universal vaccination. Food security The meeting would also make an accurate assessment of the availability of hospital beds, steroids, anti-viral drugs, paramedical staff and supplemental oxygen. The government would also assess how the worrying pandemic situation in north India, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka would impact the State’s food security. Kerala relies heavily on food imports. The State’s current grain, edible oil, wheat, pulses and sugar storage levels were reportedly optimal. But, it has to guard against disruption in freight movement. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala expressed reservations about imposing an economically crippling State-wide lockdown. He instead batted for extending business timings to prevent the press of people. ‘UDF will support govt.’ A total curb on business would wipe out jobs and crater the economy. The administration should narrow strict controls to hotspots and allow life to go on outside demarcated containment zones. The UDF would back the government's pandemic control efforts, he said.

26 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Active cases cross 2 lakh||For the fifth consecutive day, the State reported over 20,000 new COVID-19 cases, letting the case graph soar. The State’s case graph, in its second tryst with COVID, is beginning to look like a steep wall rather than a wave as the epidemic curve is rising relentlessly. On Sunday, 28,469 new cases were added to the tally, when results of 1,26,773 samples tested over the past 24 hours came in. This is yet another high in daily case tally. ICU admissions The test positivity rate rose to 22.46%, while it has crossed 26% in districts such as Ernakulam. The active case pool crossed the two-lakh mark, with 2,18,893 patients and the peak is still a long way off. The first epidemic peak had just over 97,000 active patients. Disease transmission is intense and uniformly rising across all districts, with six districts reporting over 2,000 cases each. ICU admissions rose again and the State now has 1,3129 critically ill patients in ICUs, with 419 requiring ventilator assistance. The cumulative case burden now stands at 14,05,655 cases. The number of patients currently being treated in hospitals rose to 19,565, with 3,279 new admissions. 8,122 recoveries At present, a total of 4,50, 993 persons have been put on home or institutional isolation.

26 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||It’s back to home deliveries and online shopping||As the State reels under the second wave of COVID-19, it feels like deja vu , with people going back to home deliveries and online shopping to avoid stepping out of their homes and risk exposure to the virus. Big Bazaar, which had its footfall drop by nearly half, is now encouraging home deliveries, says Robin Xavier of the store. Despite weekend restrictions, essentials such as dairy, vegetables and certain provisions are being delivered to customers. The store is also promoting offers on the Big Bazaar app to attract customers to make online purchases. Shopping app AM Needs has seen nearly a 30% increase in volume, with many customers returning, says its CEO Sujith Sudhakaran. While it is not comparable to the exponential surge in demand they saw during the lockdown last year, they have managed to retain customers in the months since. The company has invested in infrastructure improvement and can meet even double the current demand of 15,000 items a day, courtesy tie-ups with VFPCK, MPI, Milma, Kerala State Coconut Development Corporation and so on. Nearly three tonnes of vegetables alone are being processed, up at least 50% than a month or so ago, says Mr. Sudhakaran. Big increase More supermarket at Jagathy, however, has not seen a huge increase in home deliveries in recent days, most likely because other stores are open, unlike during the lockdown last year. Another reason for this could be that people have stocked up on grocery and other household products. Nevertheless, both in-store purchases and home deliveries were up on Friday in anticipation of the near-lockdown conditions during the weekend. Sales of milk, bread and vegetables shot up, says a store manager. Home deliveries are also up at Manju Medicals, General Hospital Junction, which is open round the clock. The number of customers coming to the store have also increased in recent days. Home deliveries were fewer when the case numbers dipped, but had seen a good increase now, says Swapna, a pharmacist at the store. Hari Babu, proprietor of a margin-free market at Poojappura, says the demand for home deliveries shot up so much on Friday that they were not able to deliver all orders and had to make some rounds on Saturday morning as well. The lockdown-like conditions during the weekend are the reason, he surmises. Some venture out Prior to that, despite the increase in COVID-19 cases, they did not see over a handful of home deliveries in a day. Most people, he thinks, are happy to get out of their houses, visit stores, see various products and offers, and buy them rather than send a list over WhatsApp.  Home deliveries have seen a good increase nowSwapnaA pharmacist||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/its-back-to-home-deliveries-and-online-shopping/article34410697.ece
26 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||With shortage, vaccination sessions limited to minimum||With just over four lakh doses of COVID-19 vaccine remaining in stock, the State is limiting its vaccination sessions to bare minimum so as to pull on till the stock is replenished. There seems to be uncertainty regarding opening up of registrations for the vaccination of all above 18 years from May 1. The State has plans to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers to offer it free of cost to all its citizens but it is unlikely that purchases will be through any time soon. Though a communication from the Union Health Ministry has made it clear that the registration for vaccination for the 18-45 age group be limited to the private health sector, the State Health officials said that they were yet to receive any direction on how this could be executed on the ground. On availability The State has already made it clear that while it intends to offer vaccines free of cost to everyone, vaccination will be offered only on the basis of availability. On Sunday, vaccination was held at 606 sites and close to 60,000 doses were delivered. Till date, the State has covered 58,00,683 with at least one dose and another 10,45,387 with two doses. The vaccination sessions in the State are now completely streamlined and inoculation is being carried out only on the basis of prior online registration. Spot registrations have been discontinued, following chaos and overcrowding at vaccination sites. Special arrangements are being made at vaccination sites for senior citizens and the differently abled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-shortage-vaccination-sessions-limited-to-minimum/article34410704.ece

The centres will act as control rooms, where migrant workers can seek assistance, and will be under the supervision of labour officers. Data sheet of workers Labour Commissioner S. Chitra has asked the labour officers to visit labour camps and assistant labour officers to identify places where they live in groups in order to generate awareness. Those with COVID-19 symptoms will be isolated and steps will be taken to vaccinate all workers. A data sheet of migrant workers will be prepared as was done during the first wave of COVID-19, Ms. Chitra said. The Labour Department will sensitise all workers, including migrant workers, to the perils of the pandemic. While posters in various languages and social media will be leveraged for generating awareness, facilitation centres will also be used.  The department has come up with guidelines for the plantation sector to contain the pandemic. Chief Inspector of Plantation R. Pramod has asked the management to hold mass vaccination camps for workers and facilitate their registration in thewww.cowin.inportal. Scene at ‘layams’ Guest workers should be retained in the estate itself. Workers should be discouraged from going out of ‘layam’, the dwelling place, and the management should ensure that there is enough air circulation in these places. The managements have been asked to make available soap, water and sanitisers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-centres-set-up-in-districts-to-assist-migrant-workers/article34410264.ece
26 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Put off practical exams, KSSP tells Chief Minister||The Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP) has appealed to the Chief Minister to postpone the Plus Two higher secondary practical examinations and SSLC-IT examinations in the wake of a steady rise in COVID-19 cases. In a statement here on Sunday, the KSSP said the second wave of COVID-19 had created an atmosphere of panic. Though the SSLC and Plus Two theory examinations were under way in compliance with COVID-19 protocols, these would not be enough for the practical examinations. The conduct of both were entirely different. While physical distancing and the no-sharing rule could be implemented in the theory examinations, it would not be that easy in the practical examinations. The KSSP pointed out that a Science student would have to reach school five times for the practicals. This year, practicals are to be held for Mathematics too. Commerce and Humanities students too would have to reach schools a couple of times at least. Two or three batches would appear for the practical examinations in a day. Equipment used in Chemistry and Biology practicals would require body contact. There were limitations to sanitising and using equipment such as pipette and burette. It was the same for mouse and keyboard in examinations involving the use of computer. Teachers too would need to stay close to students to give directions and touch equipment. Similar issues would arise during the SSLC practicals, it said. Admissions only later Conducting practical examinations while adhering to COVID-19 protocols would be difficult. Moreover, other examinations in the country too had been put off. Only after these were held could the admission to various institutions at the national level begin. The situation did not warrant swift conduct of the practical examinations and declaration of results, the KSSP added. It was ideal that the valuation of theory papers be conducted, and the practicals held when the pandemic situation came under control and the results declared thereafter, the KSSP said, urging the Chief Minister to take steps to put off the Plus Two practical examinations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/put-off-practical-exams-kssp-tells-chief-minister/article34410659.ece

26 April 2021||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Some private hospitals creating scare among patients, allege kin||Attendants of COVID-19 patients are making rounds to the District Medical and Health Officer’s (DMHO’s) office, near Bullayya College to get the authorisation of the official concerned for issue of Remdesivir injection. Some private hospitals are taking undue advantage of the anxiety of the patients and their attendants and creating a scare among them. These hospitals are admitting patients and directing their relatives to get an authorisation from the DMHO for supply of the injection. These hospitals are issuing letters addressed to the district authorities seeking that the Remdesivir injection vials be issued in the name of the patient, giving his/her name and Aadhaar number. The hospital authorities are requesting the officials to issue the drug, through the DMHO, as the patient requires it immediately and it is not available in the open market. A private hospital near Jagadamba Junction and another at Sheela Nagar had asked the attendants of patients to get authorisation letters from the DMHO. “The DMHO is away most of the time attending meetings at the Collectorate and there is no one else to sign the authorisation in his absence,” says N. Kalidas, a resident of Sheela Nagar area. An elderly woman, undergoing treatment at a government hospital in the city, was given four vials of Remdesivir and her attendant was asked to get two doses from outside. The attendant was running from pillar to post but stockists turned him away on the plea of non-availability.  “Remdesivir injection is being supplied by the pharma companies and stockists to the hospitals directly. The drug is available at government hospitals,” says DMHO P. Suryanarayana. People alleged that unscrupulous private hospitals misleading patients to create artificial scarcity for the injection and make them shell out more money. Meanwhile, the names of Remdesivir stockists in Vizag and their phone numbers are being circulated on social media. Those who require the same are being asked to contact them so that the drug could be supplied directly to the hospital, where the patient was being treated. Attempts by this correspondent to reach the mobile number of a supplier failed as the repeated answer was ‘phone switched off’. This drug company claims to have been authorised by the Drug Controller to distribute Remdesivir to hospital pharmacies. Repeated attempts to reach the Drugs Controller, for a clarification on his mobile, failed as there was no response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/some-private-hospitals-creating-scare-among-patients-allege-kin/article34410738.ece

26 April 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tension in Agency on eve of Maoist bandh call||Tension gripped the vast swathes of the contiguous forest region in Telangana’s Bhadrachalam Agency straddling the border with Chhattisgarh as the shadow of Maoist violence looms large on the eve of the Bharat Bandh called by the proscribed CPI (Maoist) in protest against the Operation “Samadhan-Prahar” on Monday. As the Maoist violence continued unabated in the adjoining south Bastar division of Chhattisgarh, the Bhadrachalam sub-division police intensified anti-Maoist operations in the forest fringe areas dotting the Telangana-Chhattisgarh border to tackle any eventuality. The police adopted a multi-pronged strategy to prevent a Maoist resurgence in remote tribal pockets of Telangana’s Bhadrachalam Agency. The police intensified the outreach activities in the border mandals by organising sports tournaments for local youth and distributing water filters to Adivasis living in interior tribal habitations in Charla and Dummugudem mandals in the last three months. Water filters were distributed under the supervision of SP Sunil Dutt based on the assessment of the needs of the Adivasi communities, sources said. The move was aimed at weaning away the tribal youth from the influence of the Left-Wing Extremism. The Bhadrachalam sub-division police in coordination with the CRPF had arrested around 27 “Maoist militia members and couriers” from the Agency in the last six months, sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tension-in-agency-on-eve-of-maoist-bandh-call/article34409992.ece
26 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Restrictions in Karnataka, T.N. hit RTC bus operations||The night curfew and restrictions on the inter-State transport imposed in neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the wake of the spurt in coronavirus cases have a telling effect on the operations of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) buses in Chittoor district. The officials said that though the number of services was being drastically reduced following the sharp fall in demand, buses operating in all rural routes were doing sufficient trips to prevent congestion. APSRTC Regional Manager (Chittoor) T. Changal Reddy told The Hindu that all bus services bound to Karnataka were following the 50% occupancy norm strictly in tune with the restrictions imposed in that State. COVID protocols Similarly, the services to Tamil Nadu have been stopped on Sundays as lockdown has been enforced in that State. “Our field staff have been instructed to enforce mask rule in buses, besides prompting the passengers to follow social distancing. “Even as, no restriction has been imposed on seating capacity yet, the slump in occupancy rate helps maintain the social distancing,” said Mr. Reddy. The official further said that the average the daily passenger count had come down to below 12,000 when compared to the 1 lakh commuters travelling between Tirupati and Tirumala in the pre-CVOVID time. The passenger count has reduced drastically due to the cancellation of issuance of Sarva Darshan token by the TTD at Tirumala temple. “We have observed that many devotees now prefer to travel in cars and two-wheelers instead of public transport owing to the fear of contracting the infection ,” said Mr. Changal Reddy. Deputy Chief Traffic Manager (Chittoor) M. Bhaskar said that the occupancy rate in the RTC buses plying on prime routes between Chittoor district and Bengaluru had come down to below 40%. Meanwhile, with sharp decline in the number of devotees visiting Tirumala, Srikalahasti and Kanipakam temples in Chittoor district, the RTC officials are adjusting the services to cater to the demand, without giving scope to congestion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/curbs-in-karnataka-tn-hit-rtc-bus-operations-in-chittoor/article34410036.ece

26 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Remdesivir shortage affects availability of beds||Shortage of Remdesivir is having a direct impact on the availability of beds in some corporate and private hospitals. Since it has been taking two days or more for many people to lay their hands on the drug vials, treatment of COVID-19 patients is dragging, keeping them in hospitals for longer periods, said a senior government official. In such a scenario, beds are not unable to be freed up for new patients. “If the drug is available immediately, then waiting time will be cut down. One can be discharged faster, making the bed available for the next patient,” said the official on condition of anonymity. It is expected that supply of the antiviral drug will ease by the end of the month. Currently, a few small private hospitals with 50 or less beds are not admitting COVID-19 patients since they do not have access to Remdesivir. “If it is made available to those hospitals too, some more COVID patients can get treated there. That would also free up beds in major government and private hospitals and critical patients can be taken in. Supply of oxygen to these facilities will also help,” the official said. Indiscriminate prescription of Remdesivir in several cases was also leading to its shortage, the official added. In fact, several doctors and officials have stated that the drug is prescribed to many patients who do not need it and that it is not a magic bullet to treat COVID-19. On April 17, superintendent of Gandhi Hospital, M. Raja Rao said that Remdesivir should be given only in the first week to moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, and not to asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients. Because of the shortage and indiscriminate use, the medicine is being sold for Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 30,000 a vial in the black market. Many, however, are unable to find the drug.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/remdesivir-shortage-affects-availability-of-beds/article34409989.ece

The government’s “adamant stand” of conducting the examinations as per schedule would put the lives of not only the students but also the teachers, non-teaching staff and others at risk, the TDP leader alleged. Many States had cancelled the examinations in view of the spike in COVID-19 cases, he said, and questioned as to who would own up responsibility if the students contracted the virus while appearing for the examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-to-move-court-seeking-postponement-of-exams/article34410646.ece
26 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP govt. harassing Telugu Desam leaders, says Naidu||Telugu Desam Party national president and and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has slammed the YSRCP government for “targeting” the Opposition leaders at a time when it is expected to initiate measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the State. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Naidu condemned the demolition of a building belonging to former TDP MLA Palla Srinivasa Rao, at Old Gajuwaka in Visakhapatnam. He alleged that the building was demolished “without serving a prior notice” to the TDP leader. ‘Vengeful acts’ “While the other State governments are busy in rescuing their people from the deadly coronavirus infection, the YSRCP government is preoccupied with its vengeful acts,” Mr. Naidu said. Former TDP MLA Dhulipalla Narendra was also wrongfully arrested a couple of days ago and Mr. Srinivasa Rao’s property was unlawfully demolished in Visakhapatnam, alleged the TDP president. “The State government is resorting to such acts only to divert the attention of the people from its failures and the worsening COVID-19 crisis in the State,” he alleged. “The government has failed in ensuring beds in hospitals and oxygen supply to the coronavirus patients. People are suffering because of lack of medicines and vaccines. The ruling dispensation is trying to escape from its responsibilities,” Mr. Naidu said. ‘New modus operandi’ “The YSRCP government is following a new modus operandi. It is demolishing the buildings of TDP leaders on days when the courts are on a holiday. The officials of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) have brought down Mr. Srinivasa Rao’s building in the early hours of the day,” alleged TDP State president K. Atchannaidu. “Since coming to power, the YSRCP has been showing a keen interest in destruction, demolition, and cancellation. It is not interested in development of the State and true well-being of the people,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-govt-harassing-telugu-desam-leaders-says-naidu/article34410648.ece
26 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Power utilities told to ensure uninterrupted supply to hospitals||Energy Secretary N. Srikant has directed the power utilities and their employees to ensure uninterrupted supply to the hospitals and COVID care and vaccination centres, which are grappling with the second wave of the pandemic. In a review meeting on Sunday, Mr. Srikant said the focus should be on the hospitals where a large number of COVID-19 patients were undergoing treatment, and hundreds of them were on ventilators. These hospitals had around 4,000 ventilators, he said. “The State also has more than 500 Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana - empanelled hospitals serving the COVID-19 patients,” he said. Power supply to all these hospitals should have no interruptions, he made it clear. The APEPDCL, APSPDCL, and APCPDCL are supplying 9.20 MU, 6.80 MU and 1.24 MU per annum respectively to the hospitals, including COVID Care Centres. Due to outbreak of the pandemic last financial year, revenues from the industrial and commercial sectors had dwindled, he said. “But the government has come to the rescue of the power utilities, which have incurred a loss of around Rs. 4,300 crore in the form of subsidy to the tune of Rs. 17,904 crore in 2019-20,” he said. The power utilities should continuously monitor the operation of distribution transformers and the maintenance activities as per the check-list to avoid inconvenience to the consumers. While calling upon the employees, mainly the field staff, to rise to the occasion, Mr. Srikant advised them to take precautions to save themselves from the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/power-utilities-told-to-ensure-uninterrupted-supply-to-hospitals/article34410652.ece

Mr. Sanjay, along with 30 supporters, started the cycle rally from Tummalapalli Kala Kshetram in Vijayawada on April 17 and came through Hanuman Junction, Eluru, Tadepalligudem, Tanuku, Ravulapalem, Mandapeta, Ramachandrapuram, Kakinada, Pithapuram, Kattipudi, Tuni, Payakaraopeta, Yelamanchili and Anakapalle. The participants created awareness among people en route on the policies of the Centre to divest 100% stake in the VSP and the need to oppose them. Mr. Sanjay alleged that the Centre was planning privatisation of public sector units (PSUs) with the idea of doing away with reservations. He said that if there were no PSUs in the country, the existence of social backward classes would be at stake. The BJP government has taken the route of privatisation as lifting of reservations would result in a backlash from the public, Mr. Sanjay alleged. Outsourcing employees JAC chairman A.V. Nageswara Rao said unemployed youth were being appointed on ‘contract basis’ or ‘outsourcing’ and were treated as slaves. Now, privatisation would put them at the mercy of the corporate groups, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-privatising-psus-to-do-away-with-reservations-mrps/article34410654.ece

26 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Elections more important than lives?||As the coronavirus caseload in Telangana continues to surge by the day, the overstretched doctors cannot seem to wrap their heads around the State government’s decision to go ahead with municipal elections. Elections are scheduled to be held for 248 wards in Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation and Khammam Municipal Corporation, as well as Atchampet, Nakrekal, Siddipet, Jadcherla and Kothur municipalities. The polls will be held on April 30. “Are political leaders trying to be super spreaders of coronavirus? All of us are seeing how widespread the virus is. Even if we go by official numbers in the daily media bulletin, daily cases have crossed 8,000 on Saturday. As doctors, we witness first-hand how patients and their family members are suffering in these times. Holding elections in these times can be disastrous,” said a doctor of a government hospital, requesting anonymity. The medical fraternity in the State has been questioning the rationale behind holding the elections from the time campaigning to theNagarjuansagar by-polls kicked off. The polls were held on April 17. With the municipal elections round the corner, they are once again raising concerns and expressing helplessness. “We hope our doctor associations can prevail upon the authorities concerned to postpone the elections. People must also think over what is important in these tragic times — elections or lives,” the doctor said. Concerns raised earlier A few days ago, the Forum for Good Governance had also requested the State Election Commission to postpone the upcoming polls in view of the raging COVID-19 pandemic.  Finding a ventilator bed in a hospital in and around Hyderabad has become a challenge, and people are forced to spend Rs. 50,000-60,000 at private hospitals. In such a scenario, politicians must rise to the occasion, opines a senior doctor, adding, “We all know that many politicians in our State either own private medical colleges or have high stakes in them. They must step forward in these times and open their medical colleges to COVID-19 patients and announce what kind of services would be available there”. Politicians need not offer medical services free of cost, says the doctor: “They can charge according to the rates decided by the State government.” Top doctors in government and corporate hospitals have been insisting on the involvement of private medical colleges in sharing the load of mild and moderate patients so that tertiary care centres can admit only critically-ill patients. Beds data at private medical colleges are listed on ‘health.telangana.gov.in’.  Many politicians in our State either own private medical colleges or have high stakes in them.

26 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Industrial units to make oxygen’||Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said on Sunday that the Centre has directed all industrial oxygen making units to make medical oxygen to tackle the current shortage in various hospitals across the country. Permissions have been accorded to begin 300 new industrial units for making medical oxygen and it is also being imported from Singapore and Germany, he said. “Everyone is criticising the Central government but please note that oxygen supply is being augmented on a war footing to handle the current crisis. Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), Gachibowli, will also get a dedicated oxygen unit similar to the one being installed in Gandhi Hospital soon,” he announced, while talking to the media after visiting the hospital and interacting with the healthcare personnel. For the second successive day, the Minister put the onus on preventing spike in cases on the citizens themselves. “There is little that governments or doctors can do. This pandemic control is in the hands of people with their COVID appropriate behaviour of social distancing, washing hands, face masks and getting tested at the first sign of symptoms as any delay will infect the lungs of the infected along with transmitting the virus to the near and dear ones,” he said. “Prime Minister Narendera Modi has been emphasising on preventive measures since last year itself because when developed nations like United States and Germany have been brought to their knees by coronavirus, a populous country with insufficient health infrastructure like ours would face more challenges,” he added. Later, speaking at the ESI Medical College and Hospital, Mr. Reddy assured that he would ensure the necessary funds, medical personnel and permissions to the proposed out patient wing. The hospital had done more than one lakh RT-PCR tests through the country’s first mobile virology research and development laboratory established with the support of the DRDO a year ago. The Minister also congratulated Dean Dr. M. Srinivas for receiving the best medical college and hospital award in the country from ESI Corporation. DRDO chairman G. Sateesh Reddy also spoke to the Minister virtually from Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/industrial-units-to-make-oxygen/article34410575.ece
26 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS farmers achieve record maize yield||Amid the despair and distraught being left behind by the coronavirus pandemic, the farming community of Telangana has been providing some ray of hope ensuring production of surplus foodgrains, irrespective of assured returns on investment besides their toil. After setting the record of cultivating highest extent of paddy, on about 52.79 lakh acres, in the country during the current yasangi season, the farmers set another milestone of achieving the highest average yield of 2,800 kg (28 quintals) of maize per acre this season against the global average of 2,357 kg per acre, against odds such as uncertainty over market price and over procurement. Cultivation area According to officials of the Agriculture Department, maize has been cultivated on over 4.66 lakh acres with the estimated average yield of 2,800 per acre the production of the millet crop is likely to be about 13.05 lakh tonnes. Although the support price for the crop is fixed at Rs. 1,850 per quintal, traders have been paying a maximum of Rs. 1,500 per quintal in the absence of market intervention by the government and record production of maize in the country this year. “In the prevailing grim situation, the second summer in a row, it’s the agriculture sector that has been proving to be a glimmer of hope to the economy as consumption of foodgrains in raw, processed and value-added forms continues to be high. But for such growth, returns to farmers would have been much lower in the absence of market intervention”, a senior official said. Officials said the world average of maize yield was 2,357 kg per acre although it was much higher in the United States of America (USA) at 4,262 kg per acre. In the country, the average maize yield during 2019-20 was 1,973 kg per acre and in Telangana in the last five years yield of maize has been 2,600 kg per acre. However, this season it is estimated to be 2,800 kg per acre although there instances of some individual farmers achieving production higher than the average of the United States of America (USA). A farmer at Kamanchikal in Raghunadhapalem mandal of Khammam district, N. Venkata Krishna Rao, achieved a yield of 5,050 kg per acre. “I have raised green manure crops before sowing maize to enhance the soil fertility and applied timely and recommended doses of fertilizer,” the farmer said. “With an extension officer available for every 5,000 acres of land in the State now, timely guidance to the farming community is not difficult to the administration. Also, many farmers are hard working to achieve much as possible,” Principal Secretary (Agriculture) B. Janardhan Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ryots-reap-record-maize-yield/article34410584.ece
26 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Schools, colleges closed from tomorrow||After suspending classes a few days ago due to rising corona cases, the State government has declared holiday for schools and junior colleges from April 27 to May 31, and April 26 will be the last working day of the academic year. Education Minister P. Sabitha Indra Reddy said the decision was taken by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who reviewed the situation with Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and other education department officials. With regard to reopening the schools and junior colleges on June 1 for the new academic year, the Minister said that the decision would be taken depending on the COVID situation. The schools open every year on June 1 to kickstart the new academic year. This academic year will end with no exams conducted for school students as the government decided to promote all the Class 10 students as the situation was not conducive for conducting the examinations with corona cases spiking. It means, all the 5,21,392 students enrolled in Class 10 will be promoted based on internal assessment. As per the schedule, Class 10 exams were to be held from May 17 to 26. The government had earlier decided to promote 53,79,388 students enrolled in Classes 1 to 9 to the next class without conducting any exams. Apart from the corona cases the closure of schools for most part of the year was cited to be the reason for promotion. Schools and junior colleges were reopened in February with the option given to students to either attend physical classes or take offline classes. Some schools insisted on physical classes for higher class students. But with the virus cases spiking in the schools, particularly where hostels were attached, the government preferred closure from March 23. Private school managements differed with the government on the closure and said it would be a big blow on the students’ learning capabilities. But the government did not yield to the representations of school managements with the virus spreading rapidly and parents worried about the safety of the kids in an unprotected environment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/schools-colleges-closed-from-tomorrow/article34410589.ece
26 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Separate vaccination slots for frontline workers at PHCs||A visit to any primary health centre (PHC) during these testing times might well reflect the other side of how a government establishment is functioning in the vaccination drive especially as they seem to have become the first-choice destination because it is free and hassle-free. All that a citizen looking for a vaccine jab — be it the first dose or the second dose — can just walk in with an original Aadhaar card, be at the PHC around 9 a.m and get the token. “There has been a heavy rush in recent days and we have had to turn away citizens for want of a vaccine as the number of doses are limited,” said an official. But again, like in many government centres, the more ‘influential’ and the deserving frontline warriors getting vaccinated without being in the queue is a familiar sight. For instance, at Sriramnagar PHC, policemen, medical and health personnel were taking the vaccine bypassing the queues. While they do certainly have the right to get jabbed first, it caused consternation among the waiting elderly citizens. “No one questions the right of frontline workers to get the vaccine but they can be allotted a separate slot in the afternoon for the vaccination because they are many diabetic and aged persons standing in the queue since morning as it is taking a couple of hours for their turn to come. Many have reached here after breakfast and it is lunch time now. It would save lot of time and tension on the health front,” pointed out a senior citizen, not wishing to be identified. A senior official at the PHC agreed it was a sound idea but stated that the decision has to be taken up by the higher ups with regard to specific timings for different categories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/separate-vaccination-slots-for-frontline-workers-at-phcs/article34410559.ece
26 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CCMB dry-swab test kits soon||CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) has offered to provide necessary technical know how and training to the healthcare personnel in handling the dry swab RT-PCR testing or ‘DArRT-PCR’ for COVID-19 on Friday. CCMB director Rakesh Mishra informed that the dry swab test is extremely useful, particularly in the current pandemic surge when there is a need for increasing the number of testing. It has been developed in-house last year and has been tested extensively across various labs as well as hospitals in the last few months and is awaiting regulatory clearances. Further validation It found further validation through a second advisory from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), paving the way for quick release of this method into the market. “There is no specific technique, but we are ready to help familiarise healthcare workers on this method, which is cheaper, safer and faster,” he said. Advantages How the dry swab test scores over the traditional method of RT-PCT tests is in how the sample is stored after taking nose and throat swabs are packed and transported for testing to identify a positive a negative patient without the need for expensive liquid Viral Transport Medium (VTM). If the original RT-PCR test results take upto 24-48 hours or more, the dry swab test result come out in just three hours. It is because “the collection of the swab in the liquid and RNA isolation steps are dispensed with,” say CCMB research scholars Sai Uday Kiran and C. Gokulan User friendly “It is very user friendly as it makes easy for the collection of samples for testing. Since no liquid is involved, there is no spillage either. We have already conducted 50,000 tests using the dry swabs successfully,” testified CSIR-National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEER) scientist and head of the COVID testing centre Krishna Khairnar. Dr. Mishra said interested healthcare professionals or labs can send a mail to director@ccmb.res.in or somdattakarak@ccmb.res.in, or call 040-27160789/9773468303, for details. A full fledged kit developed in collaboration with the Apollo Hospitals and Meril Life Pvt Ltd., is under validation from the Drug Controller General of India and these could be released into the market soon, he added.  There is no specific technique, but we are ready to help familiarise healthcare workers on this method, which is cheaper, safer and faster.

26 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Doctors’ plea to Chief Minister||A number of senior doctors have written to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao suggesting a 20-point action plan to improve the State government’s COVID-19 management policy-making and implementation. The signatories to the letter urged the Chief Minister to ensure that there was no manufacture, sale and use of poor-quality masks. The government should provide good quality masks to people in the lower socio-economic strata, and ensure mask compliance as “this seems to be one of the most effective preventative measure for this pandemic”. The government should issue an ordinance and take control of all oxygen plants and channelise the distribution of the gas through a single window system. It also called for creating community oxygen centres for easy access of mild to moderately ill patients. “This will reduce burden on the hospitals. The oxygen production and supply should be regulated by the government immediately,” it said. Among other suggestions made to the Chief Minister were the need for government intervention to make available emergency medications such as Remdesivir in a fair and a quick way to hospitals to avoid price gouging by various players. The signatories also urged Mr Rao to consider using a hospital preparedness check-list and the COVID-19 surge spreadsheet to estimate and respond to the surge in demand for hospital-based services apart from creating plans to reduce staffing shortages and assess the need for alternative care sites such as emergency field hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/appeal-to-chief-minister/article34410569.ece
26 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Vintage car still going strong||Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering (MCEME) here has been maintaining one of the rare vintage cars known as Humber Super Snipe that was used by General K M Cariappa who later became the Field Marshal. The Super Snipe was introduced in October 1941 by combining a four-litre inline six-cylinder engine from the larger Humber Pullman with chassis and body of Humber Snipe. The result was a car of superior performance and a top speed of 79 mph. The model with MCEME is of 1941 vintage. The vintage car was packed by the British army and ferried to India in 1943 and ultimately assigned to ‘A’ Pl of Army HQ Transport Company. The car was declared unserviceable in 1958. On 29 December 1964, the car was taken by 515 Army Base Workshop, Bangalore, which carried out extensive repairs. In 1977, it was brought to Secunderabad and the Mechanical Engineering Department of MCEME took charge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/vintage-car-still-going-strong/article34410573.ece
26 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||MGM Warangal begins 24x7 COVID testing||As the corona cases spike, the MGM Hospital in Warangal, the lifeline for the entire North Telangana districts, has decided to ramp up testing by keeping the facility open 24 hours. Hospital superintendent K. Nagarjuna Reddy told The Hindu that this facility will bring some relief to people worried over testing and timings. It will also reduce pressure on the testing staff that are now dealing with almost 800 test-seekers every day. The hospital is also stormed with patients coming from border districts in Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, increasing pressure on the facilities and the staff. “But we are dealing with it and trying our best to help the patients in this unprecedented situation,” Dr. Reddy explains. The hospital will add 200 more oxygen beds on Monday to the existing 360 beds with the facility. This is apart from the 80 ICU beds. Another 150 beds, without the oxygen lines, are also being added taking the total capacity to 800. As of now 350 patients are admitted. Dr. Reddy said that the hospital is extremely careful in admissions and only those in need of oxygen or critically ill are being preferred. The other COVID-affected who can recover without oxygen are being taken care in the two COVID centres being run by the District Medical and Health Office (DMHO). Admitting that demand for oxygen is spiralling by the day, Dr. Reddy says the hospital has stocks sufficient for three days now. “We have two liquid oxygen tanks in the hospital – one of 10 kilolitres and another of 13 kilolitres capacity,” he explains. At the same time, 200 bulk cylinders that would take care of half a day’s needs are also kept ready for emergency use. As of now there is enough oxygen, he said, but admitted some private players were trying to divert oxygen tankers coming from Hyderabad. “The other day I had to take police protection to fill up our tanks,” he said indicating that some private hospitals were trying to lure the suppliers. Full staff on COVID duty To deal with the pressure of COVID patients, the hospital has suspended all other operations, closed the medical college and the entire staff is deployed to serve such patients. More than 200 doctors and nearly 1,000 para medical staff are engaged in the service doing their best. Expecting further surge in patients, CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Health Minister Eatala Rajender have allowed temporary recruitment of para medical staff and the notification is being given, he said. “Even some of our staff are also infected and we are being cautious to ensure that the system is not crippled,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mgm-warangal-begins-24x7-coronavirus-testing/article34410580.ece

In a teleconference held with the district medical and health officers, and officials of the department from Hyderabad on Sunday, the Minister said most of the positive cases were in home isolation and there was a need to keep a tab on their condition every day so that they could be hospitalised, if need be, before it was too late as had been happening in many cases reaching government hospitals. Infection spreading fast Stating that an infected person in home isolation was spreading infection to other family members faster this time, the Minister said daily monitoring of their condition would help check the severity of virus (load). He also asked the department officials to collect the details of persons getting tested in private hospitals and labs so that home isolation kits could be sent to the homes of positive persons. The Minister enquired about the availability status of medical oxygen and Remdesivir in government and private hospitals in the State. He instructed the officials to conduct tests on everybody turning up at the centres and give medicines to persons with symptoms irrespective of them testing positive or negative. Meanwhile, the State government has accorded permission for engaging 449 doctors and other support staff by Directorate of Medical Education and 306 doctors and other staff by Vaidya Vidhana Parishad on contract and outsourcing basis for a period of three months to deal with the emerging situation of the quick COVID spread.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/send-ashas-to-check-on-those-in-home-isolation-twice-a-day/article34410560.ece

Prof. Haragopal said all the 16 organizations had been working within the constitutional framework openly for the last three to four decades and all of them participated in the separate Telangana movement. You would have interacted with many of them during the Telangana movement.” In a separate statement, the Telangana Jana Samithi said invoking the Telangana Public Security Act (1992) against well-known people’s organisations was highly condemnable.

At a meeting with fair price shop dealers in the mandal the other day, the tahsildar there sked the dealers to create awareness among ration cardholders to get the COVID-19 vaccine administered to get their ration, mainly rice, issued. To drive home its point the mandal administration had also tom-tommed in all villages that beneficiaries of ration and social security pension schemes would get their benefit only if they (eligible persons) get vaccinated. “There are no orders to do so from higher-ups but the local administration has taken the decision only to ensure more and more people take vaccine since the mandal is bordering with Maharashtra where COVID cases are high. It’s not to deny them the benefits”, a district officer said.   Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao is out of action in the election campaign of TRS for two municipal corporations and five municipalities on April 30 as he tested positive for COVID. He was scheduled to lead road shows in Warangal and Khammam municipal corporation limits but it was unlikely in the two days left for the campaign to end. The burden of campaign is now shouldered by TRS Ministers in districts where the polls will be held. Party leaders are up against hostile conditions while carrying out campaign with temperatures soaring on one hand and the threat of coronavirus infection from crowding on the other. On top of it, curfew from 9 p.m. has largely curtailed the campaign. The Ministers are just meeting voters in residential localities. Absence of processions, rallies and public meetings has left the campaign dull and lacklustre.   As the State government is gearing up to launch COVID vaccination for all above 18 years of age from May 1, the staff in the State Secretariat are hopeful that one of their major demands – setting up a vaccination centre on their premises – will be fulfilled. Staff members submitted representations in the past urging the government to put up a vaccination centre at the Secretariat dispensary. Now, with the Centre announcing vaccine for all from May 1 and the State deciding to bear the cost of the vaccine, employees are confident that their demand for hassle-free administration of the vaccine at their doorstep will materialize.   A video of former TRS Minister and Jadcherla MLA C. Laxma Reddy threatening voters in election to Jadcherla municipality went on social media on Saturday. He warned them that he would not sanction houses if the TRS candidates got less votes. He went on to say that several contesting candidates would go to voters with the promise of doing a lot for their welfare. But, they would do nothing and it would be left to the ruling TRS. “So, don’t be lured by “beer or biryani” on offer and vote for them. “I will not sanction houses if TRS candidates get less votes”. The video sparked off a strong protest from national vice-president of BJP D.K. Aruna.   It’s the season of special puja and yagams in Telangana with politicians conducting the rituals for the welfare of their leaders infected with COVID. Police Housing Corporation chairman Koleti Damodar conducted a homam at the Ganesh temple in Secunderabad seeking better health to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao. AICC secretary A. Sampath Kumar held special puja at the Bhagya Lakshmi temple in Charminar followed by prayers at a church in Secunderbad praying for better health to COVID-affected leader Rahul Gandhi. Senior leader V. Hanmantha Rao conducted a three-day homam, seeking speedy recovery of Rahul Gandhi.  (B. Chandrashekhar,   N. Rahul, M. Rajeev and   R.

26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Waiting for that elusive second dose||This is a sample of the overwhelming response from our readers sharing their vaccination experiences with us:       Since the past 15 days, there is an acute shortage of vaccines at hospitals in our area. Though the slots are getting booked through Co-Win App, scheduled vaccinations are getting cancelled. There is no one to attend to our calls at the hospital help desk and upon reaching the hospitals we see a ‘no vaccine available’ notice. This is causing a lot of inconvenience especially to senior citizens, whose second dose is due. I request the authorities concerned to ensure supply of vaccines to hospitals in ECIL area at the earliest. Parimala.G.Tadas, A.S. Rao Nagar    First dose of Covaxin was administered on March 18 at an Ameerpet hospital but when I approached the hospital after 28 days for the second dose, I was informed of non-availability of the vaccine. Since April 17, I have been in regular touch with the hospital, but was told there is no stock of the vaccine and was asked to try my luck in other hospitals. I am wondering whether I have to go for a fresh set of doses again if I fail to get my second dose in the next five days. P.S. Raman, Ameerpet    I am a senior citizen and had my first dose of Covaxin on March 20 at a private hospital in Chandanagar. I have to take the second dose by May 1 and have been trying to book it since April 17 on the government website which says: “No appointment is available” whenever I open it. I do not know what to do in case I miss the last date. A.Balakrishnan, BHEL R.C. Puram    I am a senior citizen and my sister is 78 years old. We have been running from pillar to post to get the second dose of Covaxin as almost six weeks have lapsed since we took the first dose. Co-Win registration site did not mention which vaccine is available in which centre. It was only after going to the vaccination centre that we were told about it. We were forced to return as our vaccine was not available. It has happened four times so far. It would be of much help if at least Covaxin centres are designated or the portal shows which vaccine is available where. P.B.V.K. Prasad, Hyderabad    I booked a vaccination slot online at a private hospital at Attapur but was asked to fill up the registration form manually when I reached there. That process took about two hours waiting amid the crowd that didn't bother to maintain social distancing or wear masks. Even for the second dose, the registration form did not contain any columns regarding the first dose or second dose. Until I told the staff concerned that I was there for my second dose, they had assumed it was my first dose. Registrations for vaccination should be streamlined online with timeslots so that unnecessary crowding at vaccination centre can be avoided in view of the surge in cases. I.V.

26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Readers Mail||The drainage manhole on Srinagar colony main road opposite Katuru Niwas has been overflowing for the past one week. The water is flowing on the main road, putting pedestrians to inconvenience. We have complained to the municipal personnel many times but no action has been taken by the area officials, who are already aware of the same. The overflowing manhole is the cause for spread of infections in the area. I request repair of the drainage manhole and provision for a dust bin in Yellareddyguda. K. Durga Prasad Rao, Hyderabad   COVID-19 patients are being overcharged by private hospital due to poor grievance redressal system. Most complaints made by the patients have elicited poor or no response from the government and hospitals have not refunded the excessive amounts charged. As there is no structured grievance redressal system, no one knows how many complaints have been received by the government. Most shocking is that Remdesivir injection is sold in black at high price beyond the reach of many. The State government has to appoint a committee to keep a check on billing and hoarding of the drug. V. Suresh Kumar, Hyderabad   The Supreme Court has rightly termed the second wave of the pandemic as a national health emergency and that the government should act accordingly. Covid control rooms should be set up in all major cities for immediate help and action. Civil society organisations should be involved for effective preventive norms and awareness campaigns to be taken up. All elections should be postponed till the pandemic comes under control. Governments should recruit health machinery and experts as per need, ensure vaccines follow the ‘one nation, one price’ idea, strict monitoring of private hospitals in pricing and reporting, check black marketing of drugs plus maintain supply chain management of oxygen cylinders and drugs.

26 April 2021||GHAZIABAD,||Indirapuram crematorium revived as more bodies land up at Hindon||The staggering number of bodies being brought to Ghaziabad’s Hindon cremation ground has forced the district administration to revive a non-functional crematorium in Indirapuram. A senior officer, who did not wish to be named, said due to a long waiting time at Hindon cremation ground, they have revived the ground in Indirapuram with immediate effect for non-COVID bodies. At present, they have provided 34 platforms at Indirapuram cremation ground for non-COVID bodies and if required more such platforms will be constructed. Triloki Nath, a priest at the Indirapuram cremation ground, said all non-COVID bodies have been moved to Indirapuram and that is leading to a waiting time of around three hours. “Before ashes of a body cool down, another body in the queue takes over space. Back-to-back cremations have caused a shortage of wood. They have started using cow-dung cakes to overcome the shortage,” said Mr. Nath. Relatives and family members of non-COVID bodies alleged that the staff at cremation ground is harassing them by charging triple the amount that was fixed by the authorities. “The administration has fixed cremation rate around Rs. 3,100. They are turning away non-COVID bodies by claiming shortage of space but agree if the relatives agree to pay double or triple the fixed amount,” said Mukesh Kumar, a relative. Extra charge He added that staff members are charging extra for preserving ashes. “I am waiting in a car with my brother to cremate our sister, who died due to COVID. We have been waiting for four hours to get a space. The ambulance driver is in hurry, but we have promised him to pay extra as we have no other option to keep the body,” said Sajal Ahuja, a resident of Vaishali. More parking space According to district authorities, the number of daily cremation has gone up from 20/day to over 60/day. For this reason, they have developed a parking facility for around 200 cars at the cremation ground. They said the parking would be expanded so as to accommodate 500 cars. “People visiting the cremation ground are facing inconvenience as they have to park their vehicles on main road that cause traffic chaos in the area. We have created parking space for around 200 vehicles, and it could be expanded further,” said a senior officer with Ghaziabad district administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/indirapuram-crematorium-revived-as-more-bodies-land-up-at-hindon/article34410321.ece
26 April 2021||GURUGRAM,||Gurugram NGO comes to rescue of patients in need of oxygen||Ritwik, a resident of Sector 56 here, panicked after his mother, Ritu (47), a COVID-19 patient, suddenly begin gasping for breath on Sunday afternoon. The oxygen cylinder at home too had exhausted earlier in the day putting him in a spot. However, a social media post about a non-government organisation in the city helping patients with oxygen supply came to his rescue. “I had seen a post on the social media about Hemkunt Foundation helping COVID-19 patients with oxygen supply. The post said that a patient can avail of oxygen supply at the office of the NGO. So, my younger brother and I rushed to their office,” says Ritwik, who was relieved after having reached the said office in Sector 42 on time. For more than ten days, the NGO has been “doing its bit” to bridge the gap between the demand and supply for liquid oxygen for COVID patients. Jitender Pal Singh, Director, Hemkunt Foundation, claims that they have supplied more than 1,000 oxygen cylinders to needy patients. “People from across the National Capital Region and places as far as Ghaziabad and Palwal come to us for oxygen cylinders. We gave them the cylinders for a security deposit of Rs. 10,000. We refund the entire money after they return the empty cylinder,” says Mr. Jitender, refusing to divulge the source of liquid oxygen for his organisation. “I won’t reveal that,” he curtly replies to a query for the source. He claimed that there was no help from the administration, but they were getting donations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/gurugram-ngo-comes-to-rescue-of-patients-in-need-of-oxygen/article34410538.ece

26 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi Prisons initiates drive to educate inmates about vaccination eligibility||The Delhi Prisons Department has initiated a drive to educate and inform inmates about their eligibility to get vaccinated against COVID-19, said officials on Sunday. The government has allowed vaccination for everyone above the age of 18 from May 1. Director General (Prisons) Sandeep Goel said they are encouraging the inmates to get the jab at the earliest. “We are informing the inmates that now all of them will be eligible for the vaccination. We are encouraging them to get vaccinated. The process is already on inside the jails for prisoners above 45 years of age,” Mr. Goel said. Total inmates There are a total of 20,300 inmates in the three jails of the Delhi Prisons Department — Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli. More than 450 inmates have been vaccinated so far, a senior jail official said, adding that none of them reported any complications. The vaccination drive for the inmates started on March 18. On April 17, around 50 eligible inmates were vaccinated at a COVID centre established at Rohini Jail. The officials said they are asking the family members of the inmates to send the required documents through WhatsApp to the jail officer for the vaccination process. The prisons department has set up COVID-19 vaccination centres inside Tihar and Rohini Jails. According to data shared by the prisons department, 241 fresh COVID cases have been reported among the inmates since March 2021. Of them, 14 have recovered and there are 227 active cases. Similarly, 60 staff members have tested positive for the virus since March 2021. None of them have recovered yet, the data said. In view of surge in cases, the officials said they are taking several measures to ensure that the infection does not spread inside the prisons. Inmates are no longer allowed to gather inside the library or for music and sports activities. The jails have been divided into several wards and the movement of inmates cannot move between these wards, the officials said. “We have sensitised the inmates about the virus, and they have been told to maintain social distancing norms”, they said. The first COVID case was reported in Rohini Jail on May 13, 2020. Two COVID-19 positive inmates of Mandoli Jail died on June 15 and July 4, 2020. Both were senior citizens.

Justice Prathiba M. Singh gave the direction on a petition filed by Abhay Ratan Bauddh, who highlighted that six out of seven posts in the Commission are lying vacant. He said there is only one vice-chairperson, who is currently functioning in the Commission. Mr. Bauddh, represented by advocate Vinay Kumar, sought directions for filling up vacant posts of chairperson and members from the Buddhist, Christian, Parsi, Sikh and Jain communities in the Commission. An affidavit filed by the Under Secretary, Ministry of Minorities Affairs, before the High Court stated that out of 1,279 complaints/representations, which were listed before the Commissioner, 815 complaints have been disposed of. The Ministry further stated that “under sub-clause 4 of Section 4 of the NCM Act, no specific time period has been provided to fill the post of chairman and or Members of the Commission”. “...Utmost care and caution has to be taken while nominating the said members to the Commission so as to protect the interests of the minority communities as provided in the Constitution,” the ministry added. Additional Solitor General Chetan Sharma, on one of the previous hearing, had submitted that vacancies have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Commission is, however, functioning efficiently. Mr. Bauddh, however, submitted that the Commission cannot be converted into one-man Commission. “If representation is not given to all the communities in a proper manner, it cannot be held that the Commission is fully functional,” he argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/fill-up-vacant-post-of-ncm-chairperson-hc-tells-centre/article34410307.ece
26 April 2021||Mumbai,||Virar fire tragedy: hospital’s CEO, CAO held||The police on Sunday arrested the chief executive officer (CEO) and the chief administrative officer (CAO) of a Palghar-based hospital where a fire killed 15 COVID-19 patients two days ago, an official said. After their arrest, the hospital’s CEO, Dr. Dilip Bastimal Shah (56), and CAO Dr. Shailesh Dharmadev Pathak (47) were produced before a Vasai court which remanded them in police custody for one day, he said. They were held for alleged negligence and violation of the fire safety norms, the official from the Mira-Bhayander Vasai-Virar police’s Crime Branch said. The blaze erupted on Friday in the intensive care unit (ICU) located on the second floor of the four-storey Vijay Vallabh Hospital at Virar in Palghar district. The hospital’s CEO and the CAO have been booked under Sections 304 (culpable homicide but not amounting to murder), 337 and 338 (both dealing with rash or negligent act endangering human life) of the Indian Penal Code, the official said. During a probe into the incident, the police found the hospital allegedly violated several norms and guidelines of the State government and the Supreme Court, he said. The hospital failed to get its fire audit conducted for the current year and also did not have the fire department’s no objection certificate, he said. “The medical facility also allegedly violated several precautionary safety measures. If they had a proper firefighting mechanism, such a big tragedy would not have occurred,” the official said. He said the police are waiting for the electric audit and fire audit reports and more arrests are likely. There were 83 patients in the hospital, 17 of them in the ICU when the fire broke out after a blast in the AC unit shortly after 3 a.m.. It was extinguished at 5.20 a.m., an official earlier said. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had directed the local administration to conduct a probe into the cause of the blaze and also announced an assistance of Rs. 5 lakh to the families of each deceased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/virar-fire-tragedy-hospitals-ceo-cao-held/article34410221.ece

Mr. Malik said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government would float a global tender to procure the “best vaccine at the best possible price” to fight the scourge. He said for two doses per person, the State government would need to purchase 14-15 crore vials for the third phase of the drive. “The Centre had earlier announced vaccination for all citizens above 18 years with the caveat that the expenditure for the inoculation of citizens between 18-45 years would have to be borne by the State governments. In the last Cabinet meeting, we discussed this issue and it was unanimously decided that the State would provide for the vaccination of all citizens in the 18-45 age group,” he said. Following the Centre’s announcement, Mr. Malik said the Serum Institute of India (SII) had given its pricing for per dose of its Covishield as Rs. 150 for the Central government, Rs. 400 for State governments, and Rs. 600 for private hospitals while the Bharat Biotech (which rolls out Covaxin) had put out its price as Rs. 150, Rs. 600, and Rs. 1,200 respectively. “Now that the prices of these two indigenous companies are out, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, who is also the Finance Minister, has said the government will float a global tender to get the best vaccine at the most competitive price,” Mr. Malik said. With Maharashtra facing a high demand of medical oxygen in the wake of rising cases, 14 plants for producing the life-saving gas from the atmospheric air would be set up in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Minister Eknath Shinde said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-to-provide-free-vaccine-to-all-above-18-years/article34410213.ece
26 April 2021||Pune,||20 patients escape from quarantine in Yavatmal||As many as 20 COVID-19 patients were reported to have escaped from a COVID Care Centre (CCC) in Maharashtra’s Yavatmal district in the Vidarbha region, officials said on Sunday. District authorities said the incident occurred on Saturday at a local CCC set-up in Ghatanji taluk. Based on a complaint lodged by health officials, the Ghatanji police have registered an FIR against the 20 patients under relevant sections. Yavatmal Collector Amol Yedge said a search was on to trace the escaped patients who cut loose from their quarantine on the morning of April 24. “Such utterly irresponsible behaviour will only result in a further surge in cases and fatalities in the district. Instructions have been given to take criminal action against the patients who escaped. A committee will be formed to probe and control such actions in the future,” he said. Local health officials said 19 patients had tested positive for COVID-19 during a sample testing camp that was organised on April 23. They, along with another patient, broke loose from their quarantine the next day. Yavatmal was among the first districts in the Vidarbha region (along with Amravati and Buldhana) to report a spike in cases, which contributed to the second wave of infections in Maharashtra. The district had reported relatively low cases and fatalities last year, but it today has more than 9,500 active cases and nearly 800 deaths. It is reporting nearly 1,300 new cases each day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/20-patients-escape-from-quarantine-in-yavatmal/article34410211.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||‘ I’m interested in urgent cinema’||Ben Rekhi is no stranger to navigating the murky world of politics and human suffering. His début feature, Waterborne (2005), starring Shabana Azmi, revolved around a terrorist attack; the 2018 documentary The Hidden Vote looked at minority communities who voted for Donald Trump in 2016; and his 2019 crime thriller Watch List (Maria) told the story of a woman whose husband was killed in an extrajudicial killing under President Rodrigo Duterte’s watch in the Philippines. In his latest documentary, The Reunited States , Rekhi, 42, profiles four individuals who are grappling with the growing political chasm in the United States — Susan Bro, whose daughter was killed when a car ploughed through a rally in Charlottesville in 2017; Greg Orman, an independent politician who wants to provide a viable alternative to the two-party system; Steven Olikara, a political commentator working to build a coalition of bi-partisan lawmakers; and David and Erin Leaverton, two Republicans who travel across the U.S. to understand what is driving Americans apart. I ask him what draws him to politics, a topic many filmmakers seem to veer away from. “It’s never overtly about politics... I call it urgent cinema,” Rekhi says over a phone call from the U.S. “There are a lot of crises in our world and cinema is a very powerful tool to help us understand and navigate it. I ask myself ‘where are the stories of people in conflict, or under oppression?’ and a lot of times that comes from politics and policy,” he says, adding that there is hope for independents with electoral reform. “We live in a world where it’s black or white in politics, but the world is grey. There is a lot of momentum now to change the way we vote. We need more political parties so that it’s not just this duopoly where the two of the most powerful keep everyone else out.”  S et to release digitally in India soon, his new film might find resonance in the country and in Europe, says the Indian-American filmmaker. “There is some entertainment value in watching the turmoil happening in the U.S., but there is also some self-reflection that can come from it.”  Edited excerpts from the interview:  How did the idea for the documentary come about? In the aftermath of the killing of Bro’s daughter, which saw hate spill over into violence, she very simply spoke about the need to have difficult conversations, and to avoid further violence. Listening to her, I wondered how someone who had suffered such an incredible tragedy could come out the other side as a voice of reason. I felt that her wisdom could benefit others in this time where people feel lost, scared or angry about politics. I then spoke to Bro and started filming with her. I met Olikara, Orman, David and Erin through Mark Gerzon [the author of a book of the same name] who has been working on bridging the divide between politics for over 30 years. What is your fascination with minorities supporting Trump?  After Trump won in 2016, there was a sense of denial, and a lot of us were trying to understand things we had ignored about our country. To me, the fact that 31% Latinos, 18% Muslims voted for him... it was different than the narrative that we were hearing about how this is an ‘angry white man’ problem. What we learned while filming is that a lot of it comes down to religious lines. For instance, many Hispanic voters are Catholic so, for them, it comes down to issues of pro-life vs pro-choice, and the Republican agenda aligns with their religious morals. Similarly, there are divides within the Muslim community, so when Trump enacted the Muslim ban keeping out certain types of Muslims, there were some within the community who were happy. I realised that no minority group is monolithic; politics just tries to paint it as so. Is the process of creating narrative films and feature documentaries similar? I come from the narrative film world and this was my first feature documentary. One of the big differences is that in fiction, you have the script beforehand. In a documentary, you do all the production and then you try to shape it into a story. It was an incredibly big learning curve for me, to go through two different versions of the movie, to throw them out and start over. We are trying to challenge peoples’ perceptions and raise awareness, but it has to be entertaining. So we went back to the editing table, edited them individually first and then we inter-cut them. How did people react to the Leversons’ decision to travel through all 50 States?  It wasn’t an easy journey for them. They gave up everything, and still many people doubted them. What I loved about such interactions is that it shows conflict and drama, but also the family’s transformation. There is a scene where they are talking to a woman who lost her baby over a racial disparity. There are a lot of conversations about race happening in the U.S. now and the film is trying to explore the topic in a sensitive way. How has the feedback for the film been?  It’s been mixed. We’ve got messages like ‘now I can talk to my father or mother who I disagree with’ and also had some intense responses from people who are angry and don’t want to get along with the other side. We have been called a leftist film by the right and a right-wing film by the left. If you’re upsetting both sides, you are doing something right. Is polarisation really at its peak right now or has it been heightened by social media?  In the 1960s, there was a lot more political violence in the U.S., but in our generation, this is the most divided it has been. What we are watching in the news is the most extreme 5% of each party. What about the rest of us who are somewhere down the middle? A study called the Hidden Tribes of America states that 67% of Americans are an exhausted majority that are just hiding in this toxic division. But the event on January 6 [the storming of the U.S. Capitol by a right-wing mob] has raised the stakes. A lot of people view it as a point of no return... but there is a lot of potential for us to find common ground in our pain. What next?  I am pursuing two fictional projects: a film on mass shootings set in the U.S. and another one in India. It’s something I’m excited about, but can’t talk about just yet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/im-interested-in-urgent-cinema/article34410219.ece
26 April 2021||Baghdad,||82 patients killed as fire engulfs COVID-19 hospital in Baghdad||More than 80 people died on Sunday in a fire that ripped through an Iraqi COVID-19 hospital, sparking anger and prompting the suspension of top officials in a country with a long-dilapidated health infrastructure. Many of the victims were on respirators and were suffocated or burned in the smoke and flames when the blaze at eastern Baghdad’s Ibn al-Khatib hospital started with an explosion caused by “a fault in the storage of oxygen cylinders”, medical sources said. The Health Ministry said 82 people were killed and 110 wounded, while the Iraqi Human Rights Commission said 28 of the victims were patients who had to be taken off ventilators to escape the flames. “The tragedy at Ibn al-Khatib is the result of years of erosion of state institutions by corruption and mismanagement,” President Barham Salih said in a tweet. No fire safety measures The blaze spread quickly across multiple floors in the middle of the night, as dozens of relatives were at the bedsides of the 30 patients in the hospital’s intensive care unit where the most severe COVID-19 cases are treated, a source said. “The hospital had no fire protection system and false ceilings allowed the flames to spread to highly flammable products,” Iraq’s civil defence services said. Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi suspended Health Minister Hassan al-Tamimi — who is backed by the powerful Shia leader Moqtada Sadr — amid angry calls on social media for him to be sacked, as part of a probe that would also include the Governor of Baghdad. Mr. Kadhemi also declared three days of national mourning, while Parliament said it would devote its Monday session to the tragedy. Witnesses said the evacuation was slow and chaotic, with patients and their relatives crammed into stairwells as they scrambled for exits. “It was the people (civilians) who got the wounded out,” Amir, 35, said, saying he saved his hospitalised brothers “by the skin of his teeth”. Iraq’s hospitals have been worn down by decades of conflict and poor investment, with shortages of medicines and hospital beds. But many also said negligence and endemic corruption were to blame for the deadly inferno.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/82-patients-killed-as-fire-engulfs-covid-19-hospital-in-baghdad/article34409938.ece
26 April 2021||Dubai,||Yemen rebels advance on Marib||Yemen’s Houthi rebels have made important gains in the battle for the government’s last northern stronghold, advancing close to the centre of Marib city despite heavy casualties, military sources said on Sunday. The rebels have taken full control of the northwest Kassara battlefield and made progress on western frontlines despite airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition which backs Yemen’s government, the loyalist military sources said. Marib and its surrounding oil fields make up the last significant pocket of government-held territory in the north, the rest of which is under rebel control, including the capital Sanaa. Fierce fighting has left at least 65 dead over the past two days alone, including some 26 loyalists, among them four officers, the government sources said. The Iran-backed Houthis rarely disclose their own losses. With the Houthis taking control of the Kassara front, the battles have moved to the Al-Mil area, which is a mere 6 km from the centre of Marib and its population centres, they said. However, mountains around Al-Mil remain a formidable barrier to the rebels, who began their campaign for Marib in February. The government sources said the Houthis had poured in hundreds of reinforcements in recent days to achieve the gains, resorting to motorbikes after the coalition targeted their military vehicles. The loss of Marib would be a major blow for the Yemeni government and for Saudi Arabia which has supported its militarily since March 2015, after the rebels captured Sanaa. Humanitarian crisis Observers say the Houthis are intent on capturing the city in order to gain leverage before entering into any negotiations with the government, amid a U.S. push to revive peace talks. The city’s fall could also lead to a humanitarian disaster, as vast numbers of civilians displaced from fighting elsewhere have sought refuge in the area. Around 140 camps have sprung up in the surrounding desert to provide basic shelter for up to two million displaced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/yemen-rebels-advance-on-marib/article34409945.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||What happened to Armenians in 1915?||The story so far: U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday officially recognised the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-16 as “an act of genocide”. Mr. Biden’s announcement on the Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day could infuriate Turkey, America’s NATO ally. Up to 1.5 million Armenians are estimated to have been killed in the early stage of the First World War within the territories of the Ottoman Empire. In 2019, the U.S. Congress passed resolutions calling the slaughter a genocide, but the Donald Trump administration stopped short of officially calling it so. Was it a genocide? According to Article II of the UN Convention on Genocide of December 1948, genocide has been described as carrying out acts intended “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”. Raphael Lemkin, the Polish lawyer who coined the term “genocide” in 1943, had written that he had been influenced by atrocities against Armenians as well as the Nazi killings of Jews. Before the First World War broke out in 1914, there were 2 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. According to a study by the University of Minnesota’s Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, in 1922, four years after the War, the Armenian population in the region was about 387,800. This has led historians to believe that up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed during the course of the War. Armenians were largely living in the eastern fringes of the Empire. The Ottoman Turks unleashed Turkish and Kurdish militias upon them, killing and pillaging tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians were deported from eastern Anatolia (today’s Turkey) to concentration camps in the Syrian steppe. Most of the deaths occurred during this flight. “Rape and beating were commonplace. Those who were not killed at once were driven through mountains and deserts without food, drink or shelter. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians eventually succumbed or were killed,” writes historian David Fromkin in A Peace to End All Peace . Victims of power contest In a way, the Armenians were victims of the great power contests of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. When the Ottoman Empire was in decline on its fringes by the last quarter of the 19th century, Armenians were seen by the rulers in Constantinople as a fifth column. The resentment started building up after the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78 in which the Turks lost territories. In the Treaty of Berlin, big powers dictated terms to the Ottomans, including putting pressure on Sultan Abdülhamid II to initiate reforms “in the provinces inhabited by Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the Circassians and Kurds.” The Sultan saw this as a sign of strengthening ties between the Armenians and other rival countries, especially Russia. Post the treaty, there were a series of attacks on Armenians by Turkish and Kurdish militias. In 1908, the Young Turks wrested control from the Sultan and promised to restore imperial glory. Under the Turks when the administration was run by the famous “Three Pashas” (Mehmed Talaat Pasha, the Grand Vizier or Prime Minister; Ismail Enver Pasha, the Minister of War; and Ahmed Cemal Pasha, the Minister of the Navy) , the empire became more “Turkik” and persecution against the ethnic minorities picked up. In October 1914, Turkey joined the First World War on the side of Germany. In the Caucasus, they fought the Russians, their primary geopolitical rival. But the Ottomans suffered a catastrophic defeat in the Battle of Sarikamish by the Russians in January 1915. The Turks blamed the defeat on Armenian “treachery”. First, Armenians in the Ottoman Army were executed. On April 24, the Ottoman government arrested about 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. Most of them were later executed. (April 24 is the Remembrance Day). As the War was still waging, the Ottomans feared that Armenians in eastern Anatolia would join the Russians if they advanced into Ottoman territories. The Ottoman government passed legislation to deport anyone who is a security risk. Then they moved Armenians, including children, en masse to the Syrian Desert. That was a march of death.  After the fall of the empire, many Ottoman officials, including a governor in Anatolia, were tried and executed for the atrocities committed against Armenians. But the Three Pashas fled the country and took refuge in Germany. They were sentenced to death in absentia. But Armenian resistance fighters under the banner of Operation Nemesis continued to hunt down Ottoman officials. On March 15, 1921, Talat Pasha, the Grand Vizier and the key architect of the atrocities, was assassinated on the street of Berlin by Armenian student Soghomon Tehlirian. Turkey’s response? Turkey has acknowledged that atrocities were committed against Armenians, but denies it was a genocide (which comes with legal implications) and challenges the estimates that 1.5 million were killed. The Turkish Foreign Ministry has issued a strong statement to Mr. Biden’s announcement saying it doesn’t not have “a scholarly and legal basis, nor is it supported by any evidence”. “This statement ...will open a deep wound that undermines our mutual trust and friendship. We call on the U.S. President to correct this grave mistake,” it read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/what-happened-to-armenians-in-1915/article34409942.ece
26 April 2021||Berlin,||Germany mulls easing virus curbs for vaccinated people||Germany plans to ease some of the current coronavirus restrictions for people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to a draft text drawn up by the government. The proposal is to be discussed at a meeting on Monday by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government and State premiers. According to the text, it was a question not of awarding people with proven immunity any special privileges, but of “lifting curbs on their basic rights that are no longer justified”. The debate comes as Germany is struggling to tame a third wave of coronavirus infections, and just 22% of Germans have had their first of two COVID-19 jabs. Under the proposed relaxations, people who are fully vaccinated would no longer have to show a negative coronavirus test to enter certain shops, get a haircut or attend certain events. They would also be exempt from quarantining after returning from abroad, unless they were coming from a country classed as a high-risk virus variant area such as India. Granting more freedoms Rules on social distancing and mask wearing would still apply to everyone. German politicians from across the political spectrum have come out in favour of giving vaccinated people more freedoms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/germany-mulls-easing-virus-curbs-for-vaccinated-people/article34409939.ece
26 April 2021||LOMBRIVES CAVE,||15 people spend 40 days in cave, lose sense of time||Ever wonder what it would feel like to unplug from a hyperconnected world and hide away in a dark cave for 40 days? Fifteen people in France did just that, emerging on Saturday from a scientific experiment to say that time seemed to pass more slowly in their cavernous underground abode in southwestern France, where they were deprived of clocks and light. With big smiles on their pale faces, the 15 left their voluntary isolation in the Lombrives cave to a round of applause and basked in the light while wearing special glasses to protect their eyes after so long in the dark. “It was like pressing pause,” said Marina Lançon,33, one of the seven female members in the experiment, adding she didn’t feel there was a rush to do anything. Although she wished she could have stayed in the cave a few days longer, she said she was happy to feel the wind blowing on her face again and hear the birds sing in the trees of the French Pyrénées. And she doesn’t plan to open her smartphone for a few more days, hoping to avoid a “too brutal” return to real life. For 40 days and 40 nights, the group lived in and explored the cave as part of the Deep Time project. There was no sunlight inside, the temperature was 10 degrees Celsius and the relative humidity stood at 100%. The cave dwellers had no contact with the outside world, no updates on the pandemic nor any communications with friends or family. Scientists at the Human Adaption Institute leading the $1.5 million “Deep Time” project say the experiment will help them better understand how people adapt to drastic changes in living conditions and environments. As expected, those in the cave lost their sense of time. 30 days, 23 days? “And here we are! We just left after 40 days... For us it was a real surprise,” said project director Christian Clot, adding for most participants, “in our heads, we had walked into the cave 30 days ago.” At least one team member estimated the time underground at 23 days. Johan Francois, 37, a math teacher, ran 10-km circles in the cave to stay fit. He sometimes had “visceral urges” to leave. With no daily obligations and no children around, the challenge was “to profit from the present moment without ever thinking about what will happen in one hour, in two hours,” he said. In partnership with labs in France and Switzerland, scientists monitored the 15 member’s sleep patterns, social interactions and behavioural reactions via sensors. One sensor was a tiny thermometer inside a capsule that participants swallowed like a pill. It measured body temperatures and transmitted data to a computer until it was expelled naturally. The team followed their biological clocks to know when to wake up, go to sleep and eat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/15-people-spend-40-days-in-cave-lose-sense-of-time/article34409941.ece
26 April 2021||Beirut,||Three killed as Iran fuel tanker attacked off Syria||At least three people died when an Iranian tanker was attacked off Syria’s coast on Saturday, in the first assault of its kind since the war started a decade ago, a war monitor said. “At least three Syrians were killed, including two members of the crew” in the attack that sparked a fire, said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. State news agency SANA, quoting the Oil Ministry, said the fire erupted after “what was believed to be an attack by a drone from the direction of Lebanese waters”. The flames were later extinguished. It was not clear who carried out the attack, the war monitor said. “We don’t know if this was an Israeli attack,” Mr. Abdel Rahman said, adding that “the Iranian tanker came from Iran and was not far from Banias port”. It was also not clear if a drone or a missile was used in the attack, the Observatory said. In a report published last month that cited U.S. and West Asian officials, the Wall Street Journal said Israel had targeted at least a dozen vessels bound for Syria and mostly carrying Iranian oil since late 2019. Hundreds of Israeli air strikes have also struck Syria since the war began in 2011, mostly targeting Damascus regime allies from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah movement and Syrian government troops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/three-killed-as-iran-fuel-tanker-attacked-off-syria/article34409943.ece

26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Endeavour, leadership and the story of a nation||Bangladesh and India both celebrated the golden jubilee of Bangladesh’s Independence recently, alongside the birth centenary of ‘Banghabandu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. There was a predictable outburst of warm sentiments witnessed in Bangladesh on this occasion, but celebrations in India were on an extremely low key. The creation of Bangladesh — from the ashes of East Pakistan — is presumably India’s finest foreign policy triumph till date, and it defies imagination why India has been so reticent in acknowledging this fact.  The architect, India’s stand A plausible reason put forward in certain quarters is that it possibly meant acknowledging the role of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in this seminal event, as she is widely acknowledged to be the real architect of this triumph, notwithstanding claims put forward by many a swashbuckling General and others in uniform. Hopefully this canard is not true, though she is currently being demonised for her so-called sins of commission and omission. It would amount to ignoring historical facts, for without Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, it is difficult to conceive of India pulling off such a triumph.  This may sound like exaggerated praise, but anyone who had an opportunity to witness Mrs. Indira Gandhi’s steely resolve during that period — as for instance when it was communicated to her during a meeting of the War Cabinet, that the U.S. Seventh Fleet (which included the nuclear powered aircraft carrier, Enterprise ) was steaming up the Bay of Bengal, will hardly dispute this fact. Displaying no signs of diffidence, she made it clear that it made little difference to the cause that they had embarked upon.  Few nations across the world can possibly boast of an achievement of this nature. What is even more noteworthy is that while accomplishing this task, India did not claim any ‘spoils of victory’. After Pakistan’s defeat in East Pakistan, India voluntarily and unconditionally, handed over power to the elected representatives of the newly established nation. Such magnanimity is seldom seen in the annals of world politics.  A year of significance Not too many among the current generation would remember that 1971 was a signal year for India. It was in 1971 that India had extended all out support to the Government in Sri Lanka to defeat the group, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in that country. And, 1971 was again the year in which India contributed to the establishment of a new nation, Bangladesh, which was carved out of East Pakistan following a pogrom launched by the military rulers in Islamabad, that was unmatched in modern times. Half-a-century later, India would have done well to highlight and remind the world of these two events, to further embellish its democratic credentials.  While India was busy scripting a new destiny for the people of East Pakistan, millions of refugees from East Pakistan were streaming into India. What was especially striking was that despite such a calamitous situation, and the strain on its resources, the Government of the day acted with extreme circumspection and did not give in to the rising clamour for any kind of premature military intervention in East Pakistan. It was to adhere to this position till Pakistan declared war on India in December 1971.  Meantime, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had been arrested and flown to West Pakistan. Tajuddin Ahmad had been secretly sworn in as the Prime Minister of an independent Bangladesh and installed in Mujibnagar, from where the new government-in-exile operated till the liberation of East Pakistan. India well recognised that before India could legitimately intervene in East Pakistan, the new government-in-exile had to acquire legitimacy, both within East Pakistan and also internationally. All this demonstrated political finesse of the highest order. It was not easy with over five million refugees coming into the country, conveying gruesome tales of untold atrocities.  Coordination and the goal At the diplomatic level, India did not act entirely alone. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s carefully crafted diplomatic dispatches to world leaders had helped create a groundswell of support for the persecuted Bengalis of East Pakistan. The signing of the Indo-Soviet Treaty in August 1971 came as a shot-in-the-arm for India, encouraging it to stay the course. Russia’s action was in marked contrast to the stand of western nations such as the United States which displayed hostility to India’s efforts, viewing it as an encouragement to the forces seeking to dismember the state of Pakistan. Within the country, regular meetings and the constant dialogue with Opposition leaders ensured that India acted in a united manner, notwithstanding the public clamour for immediate action.  India sought to intervene in East Pakistan, only after Pakistan attacked India on December 3, 1971. Three days later on December 6, India made the formal announcement of recognising the new state of Bangladesh, almost nine months after the Peoples’ Republic of Bangladesh had been proclaimed by Sheik Mujibur Rahman. Still later in March 1972, India and Bangladesh signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship (https://bit.ly/3aCCNPr). The events spread over several months that culminated in the emergence of a new nation, became possible only because of close coordination among the various limbs of the Government, which acted in concert to achieve the cardinal objective, viz. , that the struggle of the people of East Pakistan should not go in vain. The West, however, erroneously believed the humanitarian disaster notwithstanding, that it could not let down its ally Pakistan, which was a member of several western-led military alliances. Quite a few other nations, while sympathetic to the plight of the beleaguered population of East Pakistan, were unwilling to extend support fearing the wrath of the U.S.  Operating from the shadows A great deal has been written about the military exploits in connection with the formation of Bangladesh — of the IndianArmy, the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force. Very little has, however, been mentioned about the role of the intelligence agencies. Understandably so, since the intelligence agencies do not publicise their exploits and operate behind an iron curtain. Fifty years after Bangladesh gained Independence, it may, however, be time to give a pat on the back of the two principal intelligence agencies at the time — the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the Research & Analysis Wing (R&AW/RAW). A vast network of agents had been created by the IB well before the organisation was bifurcated in 1968 into the IB and the R&AW, and the latter built on these assets. These agents played a critical role behind the scenes, preparing the ground for the eventual collapse of Pakistani Army resistance in East Bengal. At the risk of violating a cardinal rule of intelligence, it might also be the opportune moment to pay a silent tribute to one of the most outstanding secret agents of recent times, whose name and pseudonym will, however, have to remain a secret, but whose exploits were no less than that of the most celebrated spy of World War II, Richard Sorge. The time has also come to acknowledge the role of the Mukti Bahini — the Army of Bangladeshi irregulars — fashioned by the intelligence agencies which played a key role during the conflict. This seldom happens, but is worth a mention, at least in a newspaper article.  The ultimate accolade for India’s role in creating a new nation is that Bangladesh is today a relatively prosperous country, having made steady progress from the category of a Least Developed Country to a Developing country. Bangladesh “will get time up to 2026 to prepare for the transition to the status of a developing country” (https://bit.ly/3xp8tSc). Few countries across the world expected the new nation to survive, let alone thrive, given that the nascent Bangladesh Government was functioning under an untested leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman; the country had been born amidst widespread and unprecedented violence and upheaval, possessed scarce resources, and was riven with internecine differences.  Bangladesh today Today, Bangladesh is a shining example of what is possible through human endeavour and a wise leadership. It has not allowed itself to be drawn into the vortex of foreign influences, and maintains an independent foreign policy. Relations with India are excellent today, though there have been periods when relations were not all that cordial. Currently, Bangladesh’s annual GDP growth exceeds that of its erstwhile parent, Pakistan. Women empowerment has been a major catalyst in Bangladesh’s progress, and this is largely responsible for transforming the country.  India’s achievement in enabling the people of East Pakistan to carve out a separate destiny for themselves and achieve full freedom from Islamabad, well mirrors what can be achieved when the political, diplomatic, military, intelligence and civil segments act in a coordinated manner under a firm and far-sighted political leadership. This is the acid test for any future eventuality of this nature. M.K.

26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||A case for judicial federalism||In comparison to the legislature and the executive, what the judiciary can deliver in the realm of socio-economic rights is limited. Courts cannot build better health infrastructure or directly supply oxygen; neither are they functionally bound to. Courts often lack the expertise and resources to decide social rights issues. What they can do is to ask tough questions to the executive, implement existing laws and regulations, and hold the executive accountable in various aspects of healthcare allocation. In Parmanand Katara v. Union of India (1989), the Supreme Court underlined the value of human lives and said that the right to emergency medical treatment is part of the citizen’s fundamental rights. As such, constitutional courts owe a duty to protect this right. In the face of a de facto COVID-19 health emergency, the High Courts of Delhi, Gujarat, Madras and Bombay, among others, have done exactly that. They considered the pleas of various hospitals for oxygen supply. The Gujarat High Court issued a series of directions, including for laboratory testing and procurement of oxygen. The Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court was constrained to hold night sittings to consider the issue of oxygen supply. It directed immediate restoration of oxygen supply that had been reduced from the Bhilai steel plant in Chhattisgarh. The Delhi High Court directed the Central government to ensure adequate measures for the supply of oxygen. It cautioned that we might lose thousands of lives due to lack of oxygen. Transfer of cases On April 22, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognisance of the issue in ‘Re: Distribution of Essential Supplies and Services During Pandemic’. It said, “Prima facie, we are inclined to take the view that the distribution of these essential services and supplies must be done in an even-handed manner according to the advice of the health authorities” and asked the Central government to present a national plan. In addition, it issued an order asking the State governments and the Union Territories to “show cause why uniform orders” should not be passed by the Supreme Court. The court thus indicated the possibility of transfer of cases to the Supreme Court, which it has done on various occasions before. Under Article 139A of the Constitution, the Supreme Court does have the power to transfer cases from the High Courts to itself if cases involve the same questions of law. However, what make the court’s usurpation disturbing are two well-founded observations regarding its contemporary conduct. One, the court has been indifferent to the actions and inactions of the executive even in cases where interference was warranted, such as the Internet ban in Kashmir. Two, where effective remedies were sought, when activists and journalists were arrested and detained, the court categorically stayed aloof. It acted as if its hands were tied. Lawyers will find it difficult to recall a significant recent case of civil liberty from the court where tangible relief was granted against the executive, except for rhetorical statements on personal liberty. These features, coupled with the unhealthy characteristics of an executive judiciary, makes the court’s indication for a takeover disturbing. On April 23, presumably due to widespread criticism of the court’s move, especially from a section of the legal fraternity, the court backtracked and simply adjourned the case. The matter might be heard by the Supreme Court in the coming days. Significantly, the developments so far offer some crucial lessons for judicial federalism in India. The very fact that many from different High Court Bar Associations spoke up against the move to transfer the cases from the High Courts to the Supreme Court is a positive signal that underlines re-emergence of internal democracy within the Bar. Navroz Seervai, a noted lawyer from the Bombay High Court, critiqued the views of the top court saying that they reflected “arrogance of power” and “rank contempt for and disregard of the High Courts in the country, and the extremely important and vital role they play in the constitutional scheme”. In the Supreme Court, the judges sit in Benches of two or more. The purpose of this practice is to encourage deliberation on the Bench to have a higher level of deliberative justice. This necessarily presupposes dissent. A characteristic feature of the apex court in the recent years is general lack of dissent in issues that have serious political ramifications. This deficit occurs not only in the formally pronounced judgments and orders; dissenting judges on the Bench are rare, and the hearing on the COVID-19 case was no exception. According to the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, public health and hospitals come under the State List as Item No. 6. There could be related subjects coming under the Union List or Concurrent List. Also, there may be areas of inter-State conflicts. But as of now, the respective High Courts have been dealing with specific challenges at the regional level, the resolution of which does not warrant the top court’s interference. In addition to the geographical reasons, the constitutional scheme of the Indian judiciary is pertinent. In L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997), the Supreme Court itself said that the High Courts are “institutions endowed with glorious judicial traditions” since they “had been in existence since the 19th century and were possessed of a hoary past enabling them to win the confidence of the people”. Even otherwise, in a way, the power of the High Court under Article 226 is wider than the Supreme Court’s under Article 32, for in the former, a writ can be issued not only in cases of violation of fundamental rights but also “for any other purpose”. This position was reiterated by the court soon after its inception in State of Orissa v. Madan Gopal Rungta (1951). Autonomy is the rule Judicial federalism has intrinsic and instrumental benefits which are essentially political. The United States is an illustrative case. Scholar G. Alan Tarr of Rutgers University hinted, “Despite the existence of some endemic and periodical problems, the American system of judicial federalism has largely succeeded in promoting national uniformity and subnational diversity in the administration of justice”. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor rightly said in a 1984 paper that the U.S. Supreme Court reviews “only a relative handful of cases from state courts” which ensures “a large measure of autonomy in the application of federal law” for the State courts. This basic tenet of judicial democracy is well accepted across the courts in the modern federal systems. The need for a uniform judicial order across India is warranted only when it is unavoidable — for example, in cases of an apparent conflict of laws or judgments on legal interpretation. Otherwise, autonomy, not uniformity, is the rule. Decentralisation, not centrism, is the principle. In the COVID-19-related cases, High Courts across the country have acted with an immense sense of judicial responsibility. This is a legal landscape that deserves to be encouraged. To do this, the Supreme Court must simply stay away. Kaleeswaram Raj and Thulasi K.

26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||The road ahead in India’s augmented vaccination drive||India is presently battling an aggressive second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. India launched its vaccination drive in mid-January, starting with the vaccination of priority groups. The central government has announced a slew of policy measures to expand the eligibility bracket of vaccinees and to deploy more vaccines for domestic use. These policy interventions coupled with the availability of vaccines in the open market are expected to further intensify India’s anti-COVID-19 battle. Interventions into action The decision to open up vaccination for all individuals above 18 years of age and to make available vaccines in the open market and vaccines approved in other countries is a welcome move, especially when the country is facing a surge in COVID-19 cases. With more than 300,000 cases being reported across the country on a daily basis over the last three to four days, with health facilities getting overwhelmed, and with vaccine shortages, the new policy interventions for accelerating the vaccination drive need to be quickly translated into action. India is presently vaccinating more than three million people per day and has administered more than 140 million doses of the vaccine as of April 25, 2021. What is important, however, is the vaccinated versus total population ratio. Only about 22.3 million people, which is roughly 1.63% of India’s population, have been fully vaccinated, against a requirement of 70%-75% for achieving herd immunity. The corresponding figures for the United States and the United Kingdom are 28% and 18%, respectively, while it is 55% for Israel (https://bit.ly/3aEPVDP). By realistic estimates, India may need to administer about two billion doses of vaccines to reach herd immunity levels. India’s current daily vaccination figure, although impressive in itself, may not be adequate to reach the target in the quickest possible time. The need of the hour is, therefore, an uninterrupted supply of vaccines for the proposed accelerated and augmented vaccination drive. The import relaxations announced for COVID-19 vaccines and the recent guidelines issued by India’s drug regulatory authority for restricted use in emergency situation of vaccines which are already approved for restricted use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the European Medicines Agency, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency Japan have eased the introduction into India of the newer generation mRNA vaccines and other vaccines effective against the variants and mutant strains of the virus. Despite the regulatory nod, the full-fledged roll-out of these vaccines may be delayed in view of the time requirements for the mandatory bridging trials and safety assessments of the first 100 recipients of these vaccines. As time is of the essence, can some of these requirements be short-circuited, with weightage given to data from the trials conducted abroad? Would it not be possible to extrapolate data pertaining to Indian-origin recipients of the Pfizer or Moderna or other vaccines and determine the suitability of these vaccines for domestic use in India? Issue of ethics The ethics in prioritising target populations for vaccination were hotly debated globally, prior to the launch of the vaccination campaign. Prioritisation was done based on the number of infections that could be prevented, the number of lives that could be saved, the probability of survival, the length of survival and the ‘utility’ of the lives saved (in terms of life years gained and in quality of life improved). Top priority was assigned to health care and other front-line health workers, which satisfied the doctrine of benefit maximisation. While choosing 60-plus and those with co-morbidities as the third priority group, the guiding principle was the protection of the most vulnerable. Relaxation of age-limit for deciding on the eligibility for vaccination has twin advantages, the first being the expansion of the vaccination net and the second being the freedom of the individual to exercise options for selecting the vaccine of her choice. The younger lot of the economically active population group and students attending college and university can get themselves vaccinated from May 1. This has the widest impact from the health economics point of view, as the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) saved through vaccination of the 18-plus age-group would be the highest. Allowing students of the outgoing and incoming Class XII into the vaccination net, sooner than later, seems prudent, although with DALY as the sole criterion, they may not qualify. Class XII is the gateway to higher education. These students have already had one academic year of online studies, which too had been dogged by equity and accessibility concerns, besides psychological stress and tensions. A comprehensive strategy to vaccinate students in the 16-plus age-group, in the next phase merits consideration, as has been approved by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccine pricing The decision to keep the 18 to 44-year age-bracket under the ‘other than Government of India channel’ may discourage the socially and economically disadvantaged people such as labourers and daily wage workers from seeking vaccination, as they may not be able to procure the vaccines at determined prices. The silver lining, nevertheless, is that State governments can take a call on providing the vaccine to this age-group free of cost. This may perhaps be a financial strain on cash-strapped State governments. Despite the financial burden, States such as Kerala have already committed to providing vaccines free of charge to all eligible people. The differential pricing regime announced by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech for supply of their vaccines to the central government and State governments and the private sector is, however, a matter of concern. A rethink on the pricing strategies of these companies is called for. Furthermore, it would be equitable if those who can afford to pay for their own doses opt to do so. Flattening the COVID-19-curve and its downward trajectory eventually rest on judicious vaccination deployment plans and the pace of vaccination. The proposed augmented and fast-tracked vaccination drive with a wider population base and a bigger basket of vaccines should facilitate the health system in this ongoing battle against COVID-19.

Vivek Bendre, a very valuable colleague whose photographer’s eye captured both the glories and the pitfalls of post-liberalised India without a voyeuristic gaze, also lost his battle against COVID-19. There are reports from across the country about the lack of availability of oxygen in hospitals. When countless patients are literally gasping for air, why am I spending my time talking about trust in the media? Undermining democracy Last week, I flagged off one of the conundrums before journalists — the difference between what they perceive as legitimate work and the perception of a section of readers. A really powerful section uses seemingly benign language to silence the spirit of inquiry and notions of accountability. This narrative undermines the wellspring of democracy. For instance, they ask media to refrain from reporting anything that is negative. I get mails from this section often asking me what prevents journalism from concentrating on positive developments. We are living at a time when there seems to be a convergence of interest between different institutions to undermine constitutionally guaranteed rights. Constitutional lawyer, Gautam Bhatia, who looks at the legal framework from a philosophical outlook, wrote a blog about the tenure of the recently retired Chief Justice of India, S.A. Bobde, titled “Evasion, Hypocrisy, and Duplicity: The Legacy of Chief Justice Bobde”. Paraphrasing Francis Bacon’s wish that judges must be ‘lions under the throne’, Mr. Bhatia explained the new low we have reached today: “Think of a mouse under the throne, who sometimes squeaks, and sometimes ventures out to bite the toes of anyone coming before the ruler... a judiciary on its way to becoming a mouse under the throne is a sad sight indeed.” I am not venturing to comment on the acts of omission and commission of the Election Commission of India over the last decade, as it has been documented elsewhere. When the rules of modern journalism evolved from the days of Benjamin Franklin, journalists took his wise words seriously: “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail”. If the idea of journalism is to function as an integral estate of democracy, and if its mandate is to empower citizens, then it not just needs to provide credible information but also needs to enjoy the trust of the population. Citizens should direct questions towards influential voices such as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale who said that by using the present COVID-19 emergency, “destructive and anti-Bharat forces” could create an atmosphere of negativity and distrust. Mr. Hosabale must realise that endorsement is neither journalism nor is it in public interest. Isn’t it obvious that we are in the midst of a terrible second wave because we failed to prepare? History will not be kind to the judiciary and to a section of the media for their complacency that led to perpetuating this misery. While political scientists expect the judiciary to be “lions under the throne”, they expect a much more modest role from responsible news media: to be a watchdog. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization declared May 3 as the World Press Freedom Day when the Windhoek Declaration on “promoting an independent and pluralistic African press” was unanimously adopted at Windhoek, Namibia, on May 3, 1991. It is rather disturbing that journalists need to reiterate the principles once again after 30 years. On April 22, the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism released its latest report that confirmed the divergence in the world view between those who are in the news business and those who consume news. It revealed that editorial standards and journalistic practices may be less important for trust in news than audience impressions about brand reputations and the look and feel of how information is presented. The study urges news organisations to realise that it may not be enough for brands to establish trust merely on the basis of their journalism or the transparency of their methods. When a majority of the citizens, as the study points out, are either unaware or uninterested in what makes one news source distinct from their many competitors, foregrounding media literacy is the only way to establish trust. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/failing-to-prepare-is-preparing-to-fail/article34409928.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||What Israel wants in Syria||Ten years since the outbreak of the crisis in Syria, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad seems to have won the civil war. If in 2015, before the Russian intervention, Mr. Assad’s area of influence had shrunken to the largely Alawite-populated region stretching from Damascus to the Mediterranean coast, his troops now control most of Syria — except Idlib and the Kurdish territories. The Kurds enjoy autonomy in the border region with Turkey, but have bought a delicate peace with Damascus. In effect, Idlib, controlled by jihadists and rebels, and some towns on the border that are held by pro-Turkey militias are the only parts of the country that lie outside the sovereignty of the Syrian government. Mr. Assad’s victory, however, seems to have locked Syria in a prolonged geopolitical contest. The Syrian army turned around the war with help from Russia, Iran and several Iran-backed Shia militias, including the Lebanese Hezbollah. They are all still in Syria, which shares a border with Israel. This means the civil war has intensified the Iran-Israel conflict. Changing tactics When the Syrian crisis unfolded in 2011-12, Israel took a ‘wait and watch’ approach, primarily because it preferred a stable regime in Damascus to the post-revolutionary chaos — despite the absence of a formal peace treaty, the Israeli-Syrian border has been largely uneventful since the 1970s. But when Iran deployed militias and military assets in Syria in defence of Mr. Assad, it changed Israel’s calculus. Across Israel’s northern border, the Hezbollah has already established a formidable presence. Both Israel’s 1982-2000 occupation of southern Lebanon and the 2006 war on Lebanon were resisted by Hezbollah. Israel would not like to have more Iran-backed Shia militias across the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War and which has been the de facto border between the two countries ever since. So, Israel changed its tactics. It first started helping anti-Assad rebels in the Golan region by reportedly providing cash and medical aid. The plan was to create a buffer between the Golan Heights and the rest of Syria so that the pro-Iran militias could be stopped from coming face-to-face with Israeli troops. Later, after the tides turned in the civil war and Iran deepened its presence in Syria, Israel started bombing Iranian positions inside Syria. Since September 2015, the Syrian air space has practically been controlled by the Russians. But Russia looked away when Israel stepped up its bombings and Israel has been careful not to hit Russian positions in the overcrowded Syrian battlefield. Three goals Israel had three key goals: disrupt Iranian supplies for Hezbollah and other Shia militias; stop the militias advancing towards the de facto border; and by continuously targeting them, weaken Iran’s presence in Syria. In the last three years, Israel has carried out dozens of aerial attacks in Syria. In retaliation, Syria has often fired anti-aircraft missiles. In February 2018, Syria shot down an Israeli war plane. Last week, an anti-aircraft surface-to-air missile, purportedly fired by the Syrian army, landed near Israel’s secretive nuclear facility in Dimona. In response, Israel carried out a round of bombing in Syria. For the Syrian government, support from Iran was a lifeline. While Russia provided air power in the civil war, Iran supplied ground troops. So, Mr. Assad did nothing to prevent the sprawling Iranian influence in his country despite Israeli attacks. And Iran’s response to Israeli attacks has been only to deepen its footprints. As a result, Syria has emerged as a new theatre in the Israel-Iran geopolitical contest in West Asia, which could outlive the Syrian civil war. Already, the conflict has spilled from Syria into the Mediterranean and Red Sea waters where both sides target each other’s ships. With Israel determined to contain Iran’s growing influence in the region, at a time when the U.S. and other Western powers are reaching out to Iran to revive the 2015 nuclear deal which could leave it more powerful economically, the Israel-Iran contest is set to intensify further. stanly.johny@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/what-israel-wants-in-syria/article34409929.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Viral load||Hovering around 3.5 lakh daily infections, India’s current wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is still some distance from the peak. Some experts fear that it could hit a million daily infections in May, with daily deaths nearing 5,000. It is a different matter that the story these numbers tell is itself only a tiny fragment of the misery enveloping the country. The health-care infrastructure is stretched to breaking point in most parts of the country. Given this situation, more restrictions cannot be avoided. At the end of a week-long lockdown, Delhi extended it by another week on Sunday. After months, Chennai came under a complete Sunday lockdown with increased restrictions during the week; Kerala had the whole weekend in shutdown. A national lockdown was a sledgehammer approach last year and its memories still haunt. The Centre, once bitten and twice shy, has conveniently left any decision on lockdowns to the States. The learning from the first lockdown should not be that it is a political hot potato that is to be passed around; but that it could serve as a smart instrument in combating the outbreak. It is meaningless to calculate the reduction in the spread of the virus attributable to lockdowns. In Delhi, the test positivity rate has reportedly come down from 36%-37% at the start of the lockdown to around 30% in a week, but that is besides the point. The challenge is in managing the pandemic with the least required and unavoidable disruption in economic activity. The lesson from the first lockdown that put the burden almost entirely on the poorest is that a better design for restrictions is essential. At the heart of managing any disaster is reliable information and trust in the government. Both seem to be deficient currently. The Centre appears to be eagerly watching and unhesitatingly intervening in some streams of information to deflect public attention from its own performance. However, there is little engagement with the States, the Opposition parties and the media. The Centre has viewed them with suspicion while the Opposition views the government as inept. All this is a replay of the responses last year, suggesting little learning. Lockdowns themselves cannot erase the pandemic, but they could give the government the breathing space to prepare. Ramping up of the health infrastructure must be taken up on a war footing. Going in for a shock and awe lockdown would cause more harm than good; but equally bad is the abdication of responsibility by the government. The Centre must work together with the States and the Opposition to design a flexible and phased scheme of restrictions that takes into account specific requirements and concerns of various places, and sectors of the economy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/viral-load/article34409916.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||A green partnership||The U.S.-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership raises expectations that the coming decade will see sustained financial and technological cooperation between the two countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions. At the Leaders Summit on Climate organised by U.S. President Joe Biden, the world’s attention was focused on countries responsible for the highest carbon emissions. India ranks third, behind the U.S. and China, although its per capita CO2 emissions are less than 60% of the global average, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed out. There is little confidence in a pandemic-stricken world, however, that future growth pathways will be aligned away from fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency, in fact, expects a dramatic rise in emissions as countries race to shake off the impact of the coronavirus, as they did after the 2008 financial crisis. Yet, the years to 2030, as President Biden put it, are part of a “decisive decade”, and action to scale up funding and innovation can help all countries move closer to keeping global warming well below 2°C or even 1.5°C, as the Paris Agreement envisages. There are many aspects to the bilateral pact that could be transformative for energy-intensive sectors in India, starting with renewable power expansion to 450 GW. With open source technologies, India could incorporate innovative materials and processes to decarbonise industry, transport and buildings, the biggest emitters, apart from power. Many developed countries tend to view India’s reluctance to commit to a net zero emissions target as recalcitrance, but the climate change crisis originated not here but in the industrialised world, which has used up much of the world’s carbon space. A forward-looking policy should, therefore, envision green development anew, providing funding and green technologies as compensation for the emissions space lost by poorer countries. This is a win-win game, since it would aid sustainable development, boost employment, clean up the environment and, crucially, help all countries emerge healthier from the pandemic. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who announced enhanced ambition at the summit for Britain to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035 over 1990 levels, advanced the agenda by calling for climate funding by rich nations to exceed the decade-old goal of $100 billion. For the India-U.S. agreement to yield results, Mr. Biden would have to persuade industry and research institutions at home to share knowledge and subsidise transfer of technologies. He has won commendations for steering America around from the science-deprived Trump years and announcing enhanced ambition: cuts in emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030 over 2005 levels. But much of his climate effort will rely on executive authority, rather than bipartisan support. With political will on both sides, the engagement with India can become a model.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-green-partnership/article34409915.ece

Extensively, it seeks to spread far and wide over the country and carry to the humblest in every home and hamlet the Congress message of courage, hope and freedom. Intensively, it works to enlighten the people at large on the ultimate sovereignty of their collective will in the governance of the country, to create in them a sense of the supreme dangers involved in co-operating with a system repudiating this primary principle and to awaken in them the truly national outlook in the several aspects of their daily life. Thus the source of its greatest strength and difficulty lies in that its success depends upon the intelligent response of every individual, high and low, man and woman, to the nation’s call for self-reliance, self-sacrifice and self-emancipation. Swaraj, as has often been pointed out, is really born of the nation’s soul by a purging of the national psychology of all paralysing fear, helpless dependence and suicidal self-distrust.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/congress-work-in-villages-from-an-editorial/article34409925.ece

The Pakistan Government is working itself up into such a masochistic mood that it is not prepared to respect even its basic obligations under the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations. The Government of India to-day demanded a categorical assurance from Pakistan that, in asking India to close down its mission in Dacca it will adhere to the provisions of the Vienna Convention and respect the diplomatic privileges and immunities of the Indian personnel until they leave Pakistan territory, provide adequate facilities for the transfer of the mission’s archives and documents, and allow India to entrust the custody of the premises of the mission to a third country acceptable to Pakistan. But Pakistan is in no mood to discharge its international obligations in this respect and is evidently determined to retaliate to the point of treating the personnel of the Indian Deputy High Commission in Dacca as hostages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/condition-for-closing-dacca-mission/article34409926.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||ASK US||Q.I would like to know the pros and cons of investment options such as capital guarantee and high-return plans. As a 23-year-old newbie to IT industry, can you suggest a good way of saving for the future? JSK A.Other than government schemes, there is no capital guarantee, in the real sense, anywhere. There are money-back plans in insurance, and they are not quite great ‘investment plans’ most of the time. Any other guarantees anybody offers, you will likely be mis-selling. Do not fall for them. High return equals high risk which equals high probability of losses. If you get this maxim, them consider investing for the long term (7-plus years) in products such as equity mutual funds and stocks which can improve your chances of getting ‘better returns’ than FDs. There are no short cuts to high returns and even if you do taste such success, they are unlikely to be sustainable. As a young investor, you can go one step at a time into quality regulated products and take some calculated risks. Outside of your EPF, you can also open a PPF account for tax saving. For long-term investments, consider equity index funds such as Nifty 500. You can also use short-term debt funds such as banking and PSU debt to start investing along with the index funds. Read up on these products and know their risk-reward profile. Q.I'm planning to invest in stock markets. What are the key criteria to keep in mind while opening trading and demat accounts? Nidhi Dinani A.Given the convenience of transacting online, look for a broker will full fledged online service. Look for their track record, brokerage licenses and compare their brokerage structures. Cost is the key differentiating factor. Some broking structures work well for traders and not so much for long-term investors and vice-versa. Hence, make the comparison based on how frequently you intend to invest. Short-term investors may have to check and compare the margin facility available. Check their ability to provide research and advisory service and whether they can help you review your portfolio, especially if you are new to stock investing. Support service is also important. Use their demo service or a trial to see how seamless the user experience is on web and mobile. Check if you will get necessary reports (including capital gains) whenever you need them. Practically speaking, if the decision is too hard to take, simply go with what your banker (if it is among the large banks) provides as you will at least have them all in one place until you are more comfortable to experiment newer pastures. Q.My daughter, 40, is employed as teacher in UAE Government School and living with family there. Her husband works in a private hospital. Her daughter is in class 9. She wants to invest in a pension scheme with no risk so that she can get monthly pension about Rs. 30,000-Rs. 40,000 when they return to Kerala after her daughter’s higher studies. Her plan is to invest Rs. 10 lakh every year. Please advise. Mathew Kutty A.Since your daughter has at least 5-10 years before her child completes higher education, she can consider investing in NRE deposits. While current rates are low, she can lock in for 12-18 months and reinvest at higher rates. When she comes back, she can purchase an immediate annuity plan. She can also invest in RBI Floating Rate Bonds (if available then) to get regular income once she is a resident. This way, she will likely allow her money to grow better than regular pension plans. If she will take some risks, then about 10-15% of her annual investment can be invested in equity index funds based using monthly SIPs. These are low cost and will deliver market-linked returns.  Q.I am 22 and recently joined an IT firm. My salary is Rs. 28,000 a month. Please suggest ways of getting Rs. 1 lakh by the end of the year?  Mohit Menaria A.Consider investing about Rs. 8,500 per month in a recurring deposit of any large bank assuming a 5% interest rate. This is the best you can do as your time frame is truly short to take any other risk.

26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Hurricane Jadeja blows away Royal Challengers, lifts CSK to the top||Ravindra Jadeja was Chennai Super King’s demolition man. His onslaught in the last over was brutal; much like the force of nature. ‘Hurricane’ Jadeja, his mind calm at the ‘death’, terrific bat speed, clean swing of the willow, and the ability to pick the length early to innovate and create, blasted seamer Harshal Patel for five sixes and a mind-boggling 37 runs in the last over. And then he bowled his left-arm spin with control, and fielded with typical brilliance, to stamp his authority and take CSK to the top of the table. Marquee clash It was Jadeja’s day out in the park in this marquee IPL clash at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium on Sunday as Royal Challengers Bangalore, falling short by 69 runs, suffered its first defeat. The left-handed Jadeja’s pulse-pounding unbeaten 28-ball 62 catapulted Chennai Super Kings to a combative 191. Then, after vibrant Sam Curran had Kohli caught behind off a slower delivery and consumed the fluent Devdutt Padikkal on the pull, it was all Jadeja. The ball gripped for Jadeja and he took out the RCB big guns, Glenn Maxwell and A.B. de Villiers. Maxwell swinging across, was foxed by a slower delivery. And then he bamboozled de Villiers with a beauty, the ball drifting and pitching on leg and turning to hit the middle. In between, Jadeja, swooping on the ball, scored a direct hit to catch Dan Christian short. It was all over for RCB. What an over! Earlier the 20th over of the CSK innings was a story in itself. The manner Jadeja cleared his front leg gave him room to free his arms. The first ball was sent soaring between long-on and mid-wicket for a six. Harshal then missed a yorker and was bludgeoned for another six. Then came the third straight six, off a no-ball, the sphere dumped into the mid-wicket stands. Incredibly, a fourth successive six arrived, Jadeja clubbing a slower ball outside off. Then after a brief respite Jadeja, who raced to his 50 off only 25 balls, timed Harshal over long on for the maximum. The rampant Jadeja missed a sixth six by a whisker, just failing to clear the square-leg fence, for a four. Earlier, CSK, without Moeen Ali who is nursing a hamstring strain, chose to bat. Soon the openers were motoring along. The busy Faf du Plessis stroked off both feet, cleared the ropes. Ruturaj was impressive too. He has the gift of timing and footwork. But then, Ruturaj could not kick on and du Plessis fell for 50. Then the Jadeja storm swept RCB away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hurricane-jadeja-brings-royal-challengers-crashing-down/article34410011.ece

The performance rubbed off on the mixed pair duo of Atanu Das and Ankita as they bagged a mixed pair bronze, upsetting top seed USA 6-2 with yet another fightback. Returning to the World Cup after almost two years, the Indian team, which is yet to clinch an Olympic team quota, trailed 2-4 after the third set. Perfect composure But the trio of Deepika, Ankita Bhakat and Komalika Bari showed perfect composure to bounce back in the fourth set before clinching the issue 5-4 (27-26) in the shoot-off en route to its first women’s recurve team gold since 2014. In the shoot-off, Ankita started off with a nine, while the 19-year-old Komalika drifted away with an eight before Deepika’s perfect shot. Aida, needing a nine to prolong the shoot-off, shot eight. This was India’s fifth recurve women’s team gold in World Cup having won it previously in Shanghai-2011, Medellin-2013, Wroclaw-2013 and 2014 with Deepika winning her fifth yellow metal. “It feels good to win a gold medal after seven years,” Deepika said after the win. Confident “I was nervous but thankfully I managed to do well. I’m sure this confidence will help us seal a team quota in Paris,” Komalika, the reigning under-18 world champion, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/perfect-deepika-nails-indias-gold/article34410494.ece
26 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Long breaks are a major irritant: Praneeth||World badminton championship bronze medallist B. Sai Praneeth is concerned about the breaks by way of quarantine before a major tournament in the current scenario. “The problem is we have been training for long without any events. So, now if you look at the Malaysian Open starting from May 25 and then the Singapore Open, we are supposed to be in quarantine for one week and then have only two days of training before the tournament,” the 28-year-old Praneeth told The Hindu . “After all the efforts to obtain peak form for the tournaments, these sort of long breaks are a major irritant. As far as training is concerned, all the singles and doubles players are practising separately. Missing competition “Earlier, we used to train for four weeks and then play a tournament. Now we are missing real competition,” he said. “Personally, the fact that I am assured of being there for the Tokyo Olympics is a motivating factor even as some of these events are cancelled. But think of others who are keen to play in the Olympic qualifiers. “I am optimistic that the Olympics will be on as extreme precautionary measures are being taken in Tokyo. This shows the organisers are keen to conduct the Games as per schedule. “This phase without tournaments is also helping me fine-tune my game, like working on my defence and all-round game,” said Praneeth. Adjustments “The main focus has always been fitness. Reaching the desired level is something different and sustaining it for a longer period is a real challenge. “I am not trying anything new in my game. I am comfortable with my strengths as my coaches are helping me out in making the minor adjustments, if needed,” added Praneeth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/long-breaks-are-a-major-irritant-praneeth/article34410056.ece

26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Capitals squeeze past Sunrisers in Super Over||Delhi Capitals (DC) held its nerve to edge out Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in an exciting IPL encounter decided in the Super Over, at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Sunday. SRH could score only seven runs off spinner Axar Patel in the Super Over. In reply, DC captain Rishabh Pant reverse-swept Rashid Khan for a four in the third ball to ease the pressure. Shikhar Dhawan and Pant scrambled through for a leg-bye in the last ball to secure a DC win. In regulation play, SRH needed 16 runs in the last over bowled by fast bowler Kagiso Rabada. Kane Williamson (66 n.o., 51b, 8x4) found the boundary with a clever scoop, before J. Suchith (15 n.o., 6b, 2x4, 1x6) smashed a six over deep mid-wicket. SRH required a manageable four from three balls at this stage. Rabada, under the pump, did well to find the right lengths to force a stalemate. Chasing 160 on a slow pitch, SRH stayed in contention through good knocks from Williamson and Jonny Bairstow (38, 18b, 3x4, 4x6). Williamson shouldered the bulk of the responsibility, as the rest of the middle-order faltered. It took a double strike from Axar in the 17th over to halt SRH’s progress. Axar (two for 26), playing his first match after recovering from COVID-19, had a good outing. Avesh Khan dismissed Jonny Bairstow to provide a major breakthrough. After electing to bat, Delhi Capitals rode on a 81-run opening run partnership between Prithvi Shaw (53, 39b, 7x4, 1x6) and Shikhar Dhawan (28, 26b, 3x4) to put up a respectable total. Rashid, brought into the attack only in the ninth over, gave the side the breakthrough. Rashid forced Dhawan to play all over a length ball that turned in and disturbed the stumps. Shaw was the more fluent of the two, hitting shots to all parts of the ground. Shaw’s dismissal, which came through a needless run-out, shifted the momentum to SRH. DC found it tough to accelerate after Shaw was sent back. Pant managed one six in his 27-ball 37, but he was nowhere near his usual destructive self. Steve Smith (34 n.o., 25b) struggled to middle it, before one sweet maximum in the last over bowled by Khaleel Ahmed served as partial redemption. SRH was not helped by shoddy fielding, with Kedhar Jadhav, Khaleel Ahmed and Siddharth Kaul guilty of dropping catches. Pacer Kaul picked up two wickets, while left-arm spinner Suchith — playing his first match of the tournament — finished with a tidy economy rate of 5.25.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/capitals-squeeze-past-sunrisers-in-super-over/article34410007.ece

26 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vidit holds World champion Carlsen||Vidit Gujrathi held World champion Magnus Carlsen while debutant R. Praggnanandhaa stunned Jan-Krzysztof Duda and Sergey Karjakin in scoring an impressive three points from five rounds of the New in Chess Classic rapid online tournament on Saturday. Vidit and Praggnanandhaa shared the fourth spot behind leader Teimour Radjabov (4 points) and second-placed duo of Alireza Firouzja and Carlsen (3.5 each). Unbeaten after five tough rounds, Vidit drew in contrasting ways with two Norwegians, Aryan Tari and Carlsen. He was in trouble against Tari and flawless against Carlsen. In between, Vidit defeated another Norwegian Johan Sebastian Christiansen. In the day’s last round, Vidit came out unscathed against Hikaru Nakamura for an extremely satisfying day’s work. Stunning start Praggnanandhaa started by stunning Duda, famous for ending Magnus Carlsen’s record unbeaten streak in classical chess. He drew with Englishman Gawain Jones before losing to Wesley So, the most successful player on the Tour so far. In the next round, he proved equal to Mamedyarov before pulling off another sensational win over Sergey Karjakin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vidit-holds-world-champion-carlsen/article34410058.ece
26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Knight Riders desperate for a turnaround against Punjab Kings||Lost. Lost. Lost. Lost. That is what Kolkata Knight Riders has done in its last four matches. Eoin Morgan’s men wouldn’t want to make it five in a row in IPL-14 when it faces Punjab Kings on Monday. Change of venue KKR would be hoping the change of venue — the round of matches at the Narendra Modi Stadium at Ahmedabad kicks off with this one — could bring a change in its fortune, too. And for inspiration to put an end to a sequence of defeats, the team needn’t look far. Punjab had registered three losses on the trot before it scored an impressive nine-wicket win over reigning champion Mumbai Indians in its last match. K.L. Rahul and his men would be keen to continue from where they left off in Chennai. That victory was set up by their bowlers; the captain led the chase of the modest target with his third fifty in five innings. Chris Gayle’s unbeaten 43 would have also gladdened the team management. Punjab needs its ‘Universe Boss’ to fire. Improved bowling The bowling looks sharper with the entry of leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi who took two crucial wickets against Mumbai in his first match of the tournament. Pacers Mohammed Shami and Arshdeep Singh have been shouldering the bowling responsibilities commendably. Pat Cummins was expected to do that — and more, perhaps — for KKR, but it is his batting that has hit headlines (30 runs off a Sam Curran over). It will be interesting to see if the Aussie quick’s trans-Tasman neighbour Lockie Ferguson gets a look in. Batting worries Batting remains a worry, too. The poor form of Shubman Gill and Morgan — neither has touched 40 in 10 innings between them — has been one of the reasons for the Kolkatans’ poor show. While Andre Russell has delivered with the ball, more is required from his bat. KKR needs to step up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/knight-riders-desperate-for-a-turnaround-against-punjab-kings/article34410016.ece
26 April 2021||HARARE,||Pakistan wins series||Mohammad Rizwan struck an undefeated 91 off 60 balls as Pakistan defeated Zimbabwe by 24 runs to win a Twenty20 International series 2-1 at the Harare Sports Club here on Sunday. Pakistan captain Babar Azam opted to bat and the tourist made 165 for three in 20 overs as it sought redemption after a shock 19-run loss in the second match. The batting of Rizwan and Babar (52) and the bowling of the recalled Hasan Ali (4/18) ensured Pakistan would not suffer the humiliation of losing twice to minnow Zimbabwe within three days. In the process, Babar became the fastest batsman to reach 2,000 runs in T20Is. He has taken 52 innings, four less than Virat Kohli. Australian skipper Aaron Finch (62) and New Zealand’s Brendon McCullum (66) are at the third and fourth place respectively.

26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Unborn One is born||The Supreme One is described in Purusha Suktam as ajAyamAna, that is One without birth. But the Purusha Suktam also describes Him as bahudhA vijAyate — that is the One who is born in many forms. How can He be both the One who is never born, as well as One who appears in many forms? It seems contradictory. But it is to be understood as referring to the fact that the Lord is not born due to karma, elaborated M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. So He is ajAyamAna. But He does take many forms in His different avataras, a boar in Varaha avatara, or half man half lion in Narasimha avatara. So He is definitely bahudhA vijAyate. Nammazhvar says that Krishna came because of the prayers of the devas. But he uses the words, vendi devar vandu irakka. Both vendi and irakka mean the same thing. So here again it seems as if we have a repetition of words. But again, as in the case of the Purusha Suktam, we have to carefully interpret the words. Vendi refers to the devas praying to Him. But He too wanted to be born. So He appeared as Krishna not only because of the devas’ request, but also because He wanted to take the avatara. This is what is also indicated by ajayamana and bahudha vijayate. He could have remained just the unborn. But He, of His own accord, decided to be born. Pillai Lokachariar talks of the nine connections we have with the Lord in his work ‘Nava vidha sambandham.’ The pramana sloka in this work begins with the word “pitha,” indicating that the Lord is the father of all. So Vasudeva and Nandagopa were His children. But He chose to be born to one and to grow up as the other’s son. His simplicity despite His Supremacy needs no further proof. He was born with His weapons, but showed His simplicity by obeying Devaki and hiding them at once.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/unborn-one-is-born/article34409974.ece

26 April 2021||April 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Navigating the uncertainty||First, the facts: For Class 10 students, the CBSE, ICSE and IB have cancelled the board exams. For IGCSE students, the exams were done in March but deferred exams have all been cancelled. For Class 12 students, the CBSE has postponed the board exams indefinitely, the ICSE also announced postponement with new dates to be announced in June, and IB has cancelled and will go the non-exam route for assessment. What does it mean for students? Class 10 Is there something to worry about? Well, the impact of Class 10 board marks is typically only on college admissions, as they are used to evaluate students in the U.S., the U.K, and in liberal arts colleges in India. This may put students on the back foot when CBSE’s much-awaited marks algorithm is issued. Of course, one can clarify that this was a COVID-19 year. “Class 10 is not a high-stakes examination, and thus the cost of cancelling the exams is not high,” says Vishnu Karthik, Director of The Heritage Group of Schools, Delhi-NCR.  What students can do:  Once the excitement settles, treat Class 11 like you would have treated Class 10 and start preparing for the SAT or ACT, whether you’re going to apply to colleges abroad or in India. These are accepted as additional inputs by most colleges and a good SAT score will certainly support your academic profile. For those applying abroad to competitive colleges in the U.S., U.K., Canada or Singapore, take the Advanced Placement (AP) exams relevant to your course. Work on your self. Join a summer school, do an online course, write a blog, lead a social project, do research and move closer to your dreams. Colleges tend to ask what you did last summer. Class 12 It is hard to spend your last year of school at home, and miss out on all the fun and leadership opportunities. Studying at home has not been easy, and the uncertain application year has been a bumpy ride. Now, the endless wait for the board exams is the last straw… Some schools had anticipated this and planned their responses. “We created a comprehensive assessment framework that catered to the needs of a range of learners,” says Nooraine Fazal, co-founder and CEO of Bengaluru’s Inventure Academy. This included Summatives and Formative, which comprised group presentations, research-based assignments, quizzes, open book tests and case studies, besides others. Cancellation is not really possible for students following Indian syllabi, though. “It would be unfair to thousands of students and impact their college admissions, especially for those looking to go abroad or to different states,” says Karthik. Universities from the U.K. and Canada that have made conditional offers are waiting and watching the situation with no change in their plans so far. In response to queries, the U.K.’s Universities and College Admissions Service posted on its official Facebook page: “Most universities will ask the conditions of an offer be provided by the end of August but students should contact the University directly to confirm when they expect the students’ conditions to be met.” This means that students with conditional offers will not get a clear decision, and may be tempted to take offers with May deadlines UCAS also clarified that “Clearing” admissions (seats still open after students have accepted their offers) will be available from July 5 until October “for applicants who have already received their results. If a student wishes to use Clearing before their offer is confirmed, they could look at making a reply swap, changing their firm (and insurance) choice to decline in order to use Clearing.”  What students can do:  Most students responded by taking a break from studying till dates are announced. Those getting back can focus on tough subjects and leave the ones they usually perform well in for later. Accept at least one unconditional offer that you will be happy with to reduce the stress of waiting. For those applying to colleges in India, focus on applications and entrance tests. Go for upcoming deadlines in May, and double down on entrance exam preparation. All tests are available online. Write a journal/ blog/ lockdown diaries. This is one summer when you don’t have to align your activities to college applications. Yes, you can’t go for summer camps, but you can watch your favourite movies, and pick up a new hobby. Make a film, set a running goal, learn to sing your favourite songs, pick up some dance moves. In other words, try to chill a bit. However, overwhelming this looks, it too, shall pass.

26 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers remain steadfast to their cause||Five months into the agitation and amid a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, protesting farmers remained determined to not shelve the movement. Neither the sharp spike in the number of COVID-19 cases across the country nor the restrictions imposed by several State governments would derail the protest in any manner, they asserted. The agitation, which began at several borders on November 26, has largely flouted COVID-19 protocol. Neither do most wear masks nor do they strictly stick to social distancing norms. But when asked, some of them at the protest sites would deflect the attention to political rallies being held without adherence to COVID-19 protocol in poll-bound States. Double standards Gurmeet Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Moga district, said: “Look at what is happening in other parts of thecountry. The government has allowed the Kumbh Mela to take place with lakhs of people visiting. Political leaders are conducting full blown rallies. But apparently, the novel coronavirus is only going to reach the Delhi border and affect farmers. What kind of double standards is this? This is only an excuse made by the government to end the agitation.” Several others maintained that despite a spike in the number of cases in Punjab and the fact that the farmers were visiting the borders on a rotational basis, the protest site had been clear of COVID-19 cases. Amardeep Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Patiala district, said: “The movement will continue as it is currently going on. The farmers are not affected by the virus because they work in extreme conditions, which have helped in building the immunity.” That too, most of them at the protest sites are senior citizens, he pointed out. “Currently there are mostly senior citizens at the Singhu border as the younger ones are busy with the harvest season. If there was any threat of the virus would they risk their lives out here? In Punjab, it is mostly the urban areas which are seeing a spike and not the rural areas,” said Mr. Amardeep. Last-gasp resort Maninder Singh, another farmer who has been a regular at the Singhu border said, “The government has run out of methods to end this protest. So now they are citing the virus. But people should know that the virus is not going to affect our movement in any manner whatsoever.” He emphasised that the movement is so resilient that, they would not flinch at any cost. “The Central government has repeatedly failed to do what is good for the people. After one whole year, we are back to the same situation, facing a shortage of hospitals and facilities. We are aware that instead of concentrating on what is required they will continue to target the farmers’ agitation. But we are not ready to take a step back. In any case, we are going to die if the laws are implemented, so if it’s the virus instead, then so be it,” said Mr. Maninder.  In a bid to increase precautionary measures, 5 Rivers Heart Association (5RHA), an NGO that has been involved with the agitation since November last year, wrote to the Chief Ministers of Punjab and Haryana seeking a vaccination drive for the protesting farmers on April 15. “We have been educating people about COVID vaccination and the virus by visiting from trolley to trolley and will continue to do that. However, we are still concerned about the health and well being of our farmers as there are visitors coming from Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. Farmers might pick the virus from places outside the protest,” the letter said. One of the organisation members, Swaiman Singh of 5RHA, said they have been seeking vaccines for more than a month. “Even though most of the farmers are aware of the protocol, they are not willing to wear masks because of incidents like people infiltrating the protest sites. While the vaccine is important, people have lost their trust in the government as they also see the duplicity in the manner the political leaders are functioning elsewhere,” he explained. Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij had on April 22 said that the health department was prepared to vaccinate the protesting farmers following discussions with the union leaders. Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s Darshan Pal seconded Dr. Swaiman’s observations: “The farmers have kept themselves and the movement strong in every season and under all circumstances. We appeal to the farmers to follow the necessary norms and guidelines like wearing masks and doing their bit to stop the spread of the virus. At the same time, we also request the government to fulfil its responsibility by starting vaccination centres and providing necessary facilities at protest sites.” On Sunday evening, the SKM said that camps for vaccination had been set up at the Tikri border. They added that masks and other essential items were also distributed at the Singhu border.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farmers-remain-steadfast-to-their-cause/article34410240.ece
26 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi hospitals short of breath amid rising demand for oxygen||Tension regarding supply of oxygen continued in the Capital on Sunday with several hospitals raising alarm that they had supply to last only for a few more hours. The Delhi government scrambled to rush reserve supplies to ensure that no more deaths occurred in the Capital due to lack of oxygen. While hospitals like Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, which had made frantic requests late on Saturday, received oxygen in the wee hours, Lok Nayak Hospital received supply within hours of raising an alarm on Sunday morning. The Jaipur Golden Hospital that reported 20 deaths amid shortage of the life-saving gas on Friday, raised an alarm yet again to help for its 205 patients, out of which 60 were in a critical condition on Sunday evening and emergency supply reached within a few hours. The head of Shri Ram Singh Hospital and Heart Institute, also posted a video message on social media, requesting an oxygen refill for his 100-bed healthcare facility in east Delhi. The Saroj Super Speciality Hospital said that it had been allocated 2.5 MT of oxygen every 24 hours against its requirement of 4.5 MT daily. Sir Ganga Ram Hospital received oxygen supply at 4.15 a.m. after raising an alarm on Saturday night that it had enough oxygen for its 130 patients in the ICU, including 30 on invasive ventilation for only an hour more. A little past midnight, the hospital received one metric tonne of oxygen that saw them tide through the night. A hospital spokesperson said, “Five metric tonnes of oxygen was received at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital at 4.15 a.m... supplied by INOX. It should last for 11-12 hours. Oxygen running in full pressure after a long time.” The Lok Nayak Hospital also said that they had received cryogenic tanker at around 10 a.m. with oxygen. The hospital added that it had been running on back-up stocks that would have lasted only two more hours when the tanker arrived, an official said. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who is the nodal minister for COVID-19 management in Delhi, urged hospitals in Delhi not to raise alarms unnecessarily over oxygen shortage and appealed to the media to verify claims before reporting. He said that such acts hamper efforts to provide help to hospitals that really need assistance. “This morning, I got an SOS call from a hospital that had 18 kilo litres of oxygen in stock,” he tweeted. The hospital requires 4.8 kl a day and has a storage capacity of 21 kl, meaning it still has three days of supply left, the Mnister said. He added that another small hospital raised an alarm, but it was later found that it had been given 30 cylinders, out of which 20 were still to be used.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-hospitals-short-of-breath-amid-rising-demand-for-oxygen/article34410235.ece
26 April 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan CM announces free vaccine for all above 18 years||After a prolonged tussle with the BJP government at the Centre, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday announced free COVID-19 vaccination for the people above 18 years, while affirming that the State government would be forced to slash the budget for its development works and social security schemes in order to allocate funds for inoculations. “There are about 3.75 crore people in the age group of 18 to 45 years in Rajasthan. The State government will spend Rs. 3,000 crore on their vaccination,” Mr. Gehlot said. Orders were being placed with the vaccine manufacturing companies, he added. The Chief Minister said it would have been better if the Centre had agreed to incur the cost of vaccination for the 18-45 age category, as it did in the case of those above 45 and 60, because it would have saved the State’s budget from getting disturbed. Mr. Gehlot had raised the issue of free vaccination during a video-conference meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. While demanding uniform pricing for COVID-19 vaccines and free inoculations to all those above 18 years, Mr. Gehlot had warned that the “youths' resentment” against the Union government would increase on not getting free vaccine. Though the Centre has announced vaccination of every person above the age of 18 years from May 1, the inoculations in Rajasthan will depend on the availability of shots. Medical & Health Minister Raghu Sharma said the Serum Institute of India, which manufactures Covishield, had informed the government officials that the vaccine was not available. Mr. Gehlot said Rajasthan had occupied first rank among big States, and second in the country, in vaccinations by inoculating over 1.20 crore people so far. “We are developing Rajasthan as a State with zero-cost health system through our free medicine and diagnostic tests schemes as well as the Chiranjeevi health insurance scheme launched recently,” he said.  ‘Cut vaccine price’ The Chief Minister said the Centre should ask the vaccine manufacturing companies to reduce the prices of vaccines being supplied to the States.The vaccine should be made available at a uniform price of Rs. 150 to the Centre and the States, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-cm-announces-free-vaccine-for-all-above-18-years/article34410049.ece
26 April 2021||Patna,||Nitish appeals to people for support||Facing acute shortage of doctors, paramedic staff, oxygen cylinders and anti-viral drugs in Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has made an appeal to the people for support at the time of “most serious problem on the mankind”. Mr Kumar also ordered for early “walk-in interview” recruitment of doctors and paramedical staff in all district government hospitals. “We’re facing the most serious problem on mankind ever because of corona. The government is taking all necessary steps with full commitment to get over this (pandemic). Your support is important in this war. Please be aware and alert, have positive thinking, follow doctors advise and guidelines”, tweeted Mr. Kumar on Saturday. He has been holding marathon meetings almost every day with top officials to review the situation arising out of surge in COVID-19 cases in the State, which is facing breakdown of medial infrastructure. Long queues of patients could be seen outside overcrowded government and private hospitals, medical shops and oxygen cylinder go-downs. Most of the time, the packed hospitals and medical shops turned away the hapless patients citing lack of beds, medicines or oxygen cylinders. Similarly, long wait for dead bodies have become a regular feature at crematoriums in Patna. Ambulance services are charging exorbitant fares to ferry patients from one hospital to another.  Ambulance charges Amid such reports of exorbitant charges, the Patna District Magistrate had recently held a meeting with ambulance service providers to fix charges. “In the district government and private hospitals the situation is even worse. No one is there to care for COVID-19 patients as hospitals are facing dearth of doctors, anti-viral drugs, oxygen cylinders and paramedic staff”, said West Champaran-based journalist Abhay Mohan Jha. “People are dying uncared, unnoticed”, he added.

26 April 2021||LUCKNOW,||People queue up for hours for oxygen at refilling stations in U.P.||It was after standing in the queue for almost eight hours through the day that Prashant Trivedi, an associate professor of sociology, managed to refill an oxygen cylinder at a gas agency in Bakshi ka Talab on the outskirts of the Uttar Pradesh capital. Mr. Trivedi was appalled by the big crowd gathered at the refilling station with little regard for physical distancing. He fears the refilling stations, where kin of patients are turning up in large numbers and standing in queues for several hours, could serve as hotspots in further spreading COVID-19. “These are people who have family members who are positive, admitted in hospitals or in isolation. I myself wondered if I was taking a risk by going there to get a cylinder refilled for my mother,” said Mr. Trivedi. Naturally, Mr. Trivedi, like hundreds of people in the State desperately seeking oxygen for their loved ones, had little choice. Mr. Trivedi has three patients under home isolation; his wife, daughter and mother. His mother’s oxygen levels are depleting. After some hospitals reported depleting levels of oxygen supply, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asserted that there was no shortage of oxygen supply in any COVID-19 hospital, private or government-run, but that the actual problem was blackmarketing and hoarding. Patients under home isolation as well as those getting treated at private hospitals, however, reported difficulty in securing oxygen, especially in purchasing empty cylinders. Outside oxygen agencies, one could see long queues of people waiting with their cylinders in anticipation. Neetu Batra’s family ran from one agency to another in search of an empty cylinder but could not find anything for her aunt (76), who passed away on Friday allegedly due to lack of timely and proper oxygen. Though the family did manage to borrow a small cylinder from a friend but it did not have the required flow to last her through the night. “We drove her in an ambulance to different hospitals but did not get admission anywhere. Her RT-PCR was negative but she had all symptoms of COVID-19,” said Ms. Batra. Her aunt had finally managed to get a bed at a government-run hospital but she died moments after arriving. While people have to wait long hours to get their cylinders refilled, there is also the unavailability of fresh oxygen cylinders. Those who manage to find cylinders are asked to pay much exorbitant rates. Praveen Singh, who runs a stationery shop, said he was asked to pay Rs. 70,000 for a filled cylinder and Rs. 45,000 for an empty one, while one could refill an empty cylinder for Rs. 500-600 but would have to wait for several hours in the queue. “But not everyone has 12 hours in hand,” said Mr. Singh, whose friend’s mother needed the oxygen urgently.  Friend saves the day With options running out, Mr. Singh’s day was saved by a friend who on Sunday offered to lend him his cylinder as he no longer needed it after having tested negative. Many people said that at the refilling stations, the agencies had started prioritizing private hospitals after a directive by the government making it harder for individuals to get regular supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/people-queue-up-for-hours-for-oxygen-at-refilling-stations-in-up/article34410054.ece
26 April 2021||GURUGRAM,||Gurugram health system crippled amid COVID crisis||“Columbia Asia, Max, Metro and Artemis... I have tried all hospitals in the city. It is not possible to get a bed without a good connection,” says Arvind Chandola, who has been running from pillar to post for 72 hours to desperately secure a bed for his 77-year-old mother Nirmala, a COVID-19 patient. Ms. Nirmala, a resident of Sector 22, had tested positive for COVID on April 23. A diabetic with a high blood pressure, the elderly woman has been struggling to keep healthy oxygen levels. His son managed to procure a gas cylinder through a contact, but that too exhausted on Sunday morning. “I have the cylinder, but no more gas. Can you at least arrange gas for me?,” Mr. Chandola pleaded with this correspondent. With the number of COVID-19 cases soaring in the Millennium City, touching a record high each day, the health infrastructure in the city has miserably failed to keep pace with the growing demand. Though 40-odd hospitals in the city have majority of general and ICU beds reserved for COVID-19 patients, none is vacant. Adding to the patients’ woes, the web portal supposed to show the availability of beds on a real-time basis too misleads at times. The mad rush at the hospitals and the scramble for beds has forced many to quit without even making an attempt.   The administration now mulls to augment the beds converting hotels and community centres into makeshift hospitals to tackle the rush.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/gurugram-health-system-crippled-amid-covid-crisis/article34410232.ece
26 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Villagers join search for abducted ONGC worker||Some 500 villagers in Nagaland’s Mon district have joined the security forces in searching for the last of the three employees of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) abducted on April 21. Members of the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) had abducted Junior technician Mohini Mohan Gogoi and Ritul Saikia and junior engineering assistant Alakesh Saikia from the ONGC’s Lakwa oil rig in eastern Assam’s Charaideo district. A combined team of Army, Assam Rifles and Nagaland police rescued Mr. Gogoi and Alakesh Saikia from a jungle near Totokchingnyu village in Mon district on Friday night following a gunfight with the abductors comprising members of ULFA-I and the Yung Aung faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN). “More than 500 villagers of the area, acquainted with the terrain, are helping the security forces to locate the missing ONGC employee,” a district official said. The area where the two employees were rescued is about 25 km from the border with Myanmar, where they were being taken. The ULFA-I operates out of the hideout of the NSCN (Yung Aung) across the border in the Sagaing Division of Myanmar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/villagers-join-search-for-abducted-ongc-worker/article34410535.ece
26 April 2021||GURUGRAM,||4 die at Rewari hospital due to oxygen shortage||Eight COVID-19 patients died at two hospitals in Haryana on Sunday, amid allegations of short supply of oxygen. While four died at Virat Hospital in Rewari, another four succumbed to the virus at Kathuria Hospital in Gurugram. Separate committees have been set up by the respective district administrations for inquiry into the incidents. A staffer of Virat Hospital, speaking to the local media, claimed that three patients died in the ICU and one in the general ward. He claimed the supply to the hospital was not provided on time despite repeated requests. “We had been flagging the shortage of oxygen since 9 a.m. but the supplier said that oxygen would be supplied only after permission from the Chief Surgeon, who continued to be in the meetings. We have 114 COVID-19 patients, the highest in the city, and the daily consumption of oxygen is 300 cylinders,” he said. Former Haryana Minister Ajay Yadav claimed that he also spoke to Chief Surgeon and senior officials in Chandigarh regarding the urgent need for oxygen at Virat Hospital, but the administration did not swing into action. “While there are no facilities at the government hospital, the local administration has failed to support even the private hospitals treating patients,” alleged Mr. Yadav. Panel formed “Deputy Commissioner Rewari has constituted a panel headed by Additional Deputy Commissioner Rewari to inquire into the matter which will submit its report in 48 hours,” said a statement from the office of District Information and Public Relations Officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/4-die-at-rewari-hospital-due-to-oxygen-shortage/article34410230.ece

He asked if any of them were involved in using or producing oxygen and could help with transporting oxygen in cryogenic tankers. It could come to the aid of Delhi in time of need. “As you are aware, there is a severe shortage of oxygen in Delhi. Delhi does not produce any oxygen. Due to an unprecedented rise in COVID-19 cases in the last few days, many hospitals have run out of oxygen.

26 April 2021||Guwahati,||Mizoram seeks IAF’s help to control major wildfire||The Mizoram government has sought the help of the Indian Air Force to control a major wildfire that has affected an area of 20 sq. km in Lunglei district. “The IAF is deploying two Mi-17V5 helicopters, equipped with Bambi buckets, on the requisition of the Mizoram government for dousing the fire in Lunglei district and adjoining areas,” Shillong-based Defence spokesperson Wing Commander Ratnakar Singh said on Sunday.  ‘People not affected’ Deputy Commissioner Koluthungan A. said the fire broke out on Saturday. “It is spreading fast due to wind and temperature, suddenly flaring up from time to time. We are using all local resources to contain it,” he said, adding that the fire had not entered any human settlement.
