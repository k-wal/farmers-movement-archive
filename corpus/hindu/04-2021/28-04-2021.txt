28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||After HC rap, ECI bans victory processions on counting day||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday banned victory processions after the declaration of Assembly election results in Assam, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, West Bengal and Kerala on May 2 in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision came a day after the Madras High Court expressed its displeasure with the Commission for failing to enforce COVID-19 protocols during campaigning in the five States. The court blamed the Commission for the second wave of the pandemic in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. “In view of the surge in COVID-19 cases throughout the country, the Commission has decided to make more stringent provision to be followed during the process of counting, in addition to exiting broad guidelines dated 21st August, 2020,” the Commission said in a letter to the Chief Electoral Officers of all States. It said no victory processions would be allowed after the counting of votes and only a maximum of two people would be allowed to accompany the winning candidate or their authorised representative to receive the certificate of election from the Returning Officer. The Commission had issued guidelines for elections in August last year and then reiterated them during the latest Assembly elections. After finding that political parties and candidates had been flouting the COVID-19 guidelines, the Commission had issued warnings before banning campaigning from 7 p.m. to 10 a.m. and extending the silence period before polling from 48 hours to 72 hours on April 16. However, the decision came after the polling was over in Kerala, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and three of the eight phases were remaining in West Bengal. High Court order On Monday, the Madras High Court held that though polling was by and large peaceful in Tamil Nadu, the “Election Commission could not ensure the political parties adhered to the COVID-19 protocol at the time of election campaigns and rallies”. The High Court observed that in light of the ongoing surge in cases, the counting of votes on May 2 should not result in a further spike. “Public health is of paramount importance and it is distressing that Constitutional authorities have to be reminded in such regard,” the High Court order said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/after-hc-rap-eci-bans-victory-processions-on-counting-day/article34426891.ece
28 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Across India, a desperate hunt for COVID-19 care||As COVID-19 positive cases keep rising steeply across the country, in many States, patients and their relatives are put through the wringer literally, as they hunt for oxygen, beds, ventilators and ICUs. Hospitals which have mild and moderate COVID-19 patients but no ventilators or ICU services, are also in a fix if the health condition of the patient deteriorates. Delhi, the national capital region and most parts of northern India continued to reel under the shortage of beds, oxygen and essential drugs necessary to deal with the situation, on Tuesday. At Apollo Hospital in Delhi, angry relatives attacked hospital staff, after a patient died, while waiting for an ICU bed. People could be seen attacking hospital security guards with sticks. At least 45 people are known to have died in two city hospitals on account of oxygen-supply linked issues. In Bihar, a woman was seen on camera outside a private hospital in Patna pleading with a media person to arrange an oxygen cylinder. The hospital had earlier discharged her husband due to lack of oxygen supply in the hospital but when she didn’t get a bed in the other COVID-19 designated private hospitals of the city, she was forced to return to the same hospital. The district administration has designated 90 registered private hospitals in Patna for treatment of COVID-19 patients but most of them were forced to turn away patients by Tuesday, citing lack of oxygen or beds. Futile wait in U.P. In Uttar Pradesh, which recorded 265 new deaths and 32,993 new cases according to the State Health Department, the desperate hunt for beds and oxygen continued. In Agra, Priya Singh could not find a bed for her father, 57, whose oxygen level was falling. “We desperately need a hospital. He is unable to even move. We are returning home now as his condition is getting worse standing on the road,” Ms Singh said. In Kanpur, the second worst-affected district, Amit Tiwari has been waiting more than a day to get his mother admitted in a private hospital with ventilator facilities due to a delayed COVID-19 test result. In Gorakhpur, Sanjeev Singh's family was also desperately seeking help to admit him to an ICU bed since Sunday. As an urgent measure, Sanjeev Singh was admitted to a government hospital but his oxygen levels continued to drop as it was not equipped with the necessary facilities. Situation was similar in Gujarat. Faced with acute shortage of oxygen, hospitals in Surat, including government hospitals, have threatened to stop admitting new patients if the supply is not restored. The two main government hospitals in the city refused to admit new patients. On Monday, representatives of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Surat, urged Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to immediately increase the supply to save 4,000 patients in various hospitals. More than 50 patients have reportedly died in Navsari, Surat, Banaskantha and Rajkot due to shortage in oxygen in last 10 days. Overwhelmed in Pune Pune, in neighbouring Maharashtra, has nearly one lakh active cases and has reported more than 12,500 deaths while witnessing an average daily spike of more than 10,000 fresh cases for over three weeks now. The district’s overburdened health infrastructure is cracking under the strain of the ‘second wave’, with all major hospitals overwhelmed with frantic calls for critical care beds. Almost all of the 1,400-odd ICU with ventilator beds were occupied till Monday. Almost every affected family has a horror story to tell.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/across-india-a-desperate-hunt-for-covid-19-care/article34426895.ece
28 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Touts enter the fray amid bed shortage||Uday Kumar, a resident of Rajajinagar, was desperately trying to find an ICU bed for his friend who was suffering from COVID-19. He got the same answer from every private hospital he called: “There are no ICU beds available at this moment.” As his search for a bed grew more frantic, someone sent him a number that was doing the rounds on social media. “When I called up the number, a man picked up the phone and assured me of bed and even an ambulance to pick my friend from his house. He wanted Rs. 25,000 for the service. I was willing to pay, but ultimately did not take it, as we finally got an ICU bed through the system,” he said. Uday’s recent experience is not unusual. Many people in their hunt for oxygenated or ICU beds — a commodity that is proving to be as rare as oxygen supply — are encountering touts, who are successfully taking care of hospitalisation for them at exorbitant rates. Dr. H.M. Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA), acknowledged the problem and said he had received similar complaints from the Jigani area in Bengaluru Rural district where touts were charging Rs. 5,000 to find a bed. While beds under the government quota are almost full, there is no transparency in the private quota, and touts are taking advantage of the situation. Officials acknowledge that a centralised database of bed availability in the private sector is one way to put an end to middlemen cashing in on a grim situation. PHANA is set to roll out such a database in the next few days. But touts may even be blocking beds, jeopardising parity of bed availability in the city, say industry insiders. “They seem to have blocked some beds in certain private hospitals, mostly the smaller ones that are not well-known. The involvement of staff working at such hospitals cannot be ruled out,” said a senior doctor who did not wish to be named. The State government has accused private hospitals of not giving the assigned 50% of the beds to government quota. “While at the peak of the pandemic last year, they had given 4,500 beds to the government. This year, to date, they have handed over only 3,500 beds,” said Health Minister Dr. K. Sudhakar on Monday. The government has now ordered 75% of the beds to be brought under the government quota.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/touts-enter-the-fray-amid-bed-shortage/article34427353.ece
28 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||CM says situation unpredictable||The government is enhancing the health infrastructure to give proper COVID-19 care to as many people as possible in the weeks ahead when the patient load in hospitals is expected to rise several fold, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. The government would increase the availability of beds with oxygen in all hospitals and at COVID First Line Treatment Centres (CFLTCs), Mr. Vijayan said here on Tuesday. As the situation was unpredictability, there should be adequate buffer stock of oxygen in all institutions, he said. Beds in hospitals under the ESI Corporation would be converted as oxygen beds. Private medical college hospitals have also been asked to set aside 75% of their beds for COVID care. A coordinated ambulance team will be readied at taluk-level to transfer referral patients from domiciliary care centres and CFLTCs to higher centres. Active caseload had gone up by 255% in just two weeks. Mr. Vijayan said the government was doing everything possible to enhance the surge capacity, however, if the number of patients continued to go up at this rate, the health system would buckle under pressure. Shortage of human resources was a huge issue and the government wanted more people, including doctors and nurses. It was up to the people themselves to be aware of the crisis that is evolving. All disease containment measures should continue and people should exercise maximum vigil and follow COVID protocols to ensure that disease transmission levels does not go up further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-says-situation-unpredictable/article34427073.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||SC allows Vedanta to produce oxygen at its Tamil Nadu plant||The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed Vedanta to operate its oxygen production unit on its Sterlite Copper premises in Thoothukudi as an extraordinary measure to tide over the national shortage of oxygen amid the second wave of COVID-19. “The nation must stand together in this moment,” a Special Bench, led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, noted. The top court made it clear that it would not supplant the role of the High Courts in monitoring the crisis. The High Courts had a unique role to play. “Supreme Court will supplement the work of HCs [High Courts]. The apex court will not remain a mute spectator at the time of a national crisis... We intend to play a complementary role to HCs. HCs have a valuable role to play,” the Special Bench said. The court said there should be no political bickering over oxygen generation by Vedanta as the country was facing a national crisis. The court said the Tamil Nadu government had met stakeholders extensively, both at the executive and political levels, and decided to let Vedanta operate the plant, which would be able to produce up to 200 MT of liquid oxygen within 10 days. With this, the State overcame its initial objections to the reopening of the Vedanta premises, which were closed in 2018 due to environmental problems. “We are inclined to allow Vedanta’s prayer to operate the oxygen plant as a standalone unit. The order is passed only in view of the national need for oxygen. The order will not create any equity in favour of Vedanta,” Justice Chandrachud noted. The Bench asked the Tamil Nadu government to form a committee to monitor Vedanta, which will include the District Collector, Tuticorin; SP Tuticorin; District Environmental Engineer; Sub Collector Tuticorin; and two government officials with knowledge of the affairs. Vedanta will not be allowed to enter and operate the copper smelting plant under the garb of this order. It is in the nature of an oversight panel. The committee will work in tandem with local community members and address their concerns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-allows-vedanta-to-produce-oxygen-at-its-tamil-nadu-plant/article34426944.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||The system has failed: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday cautioned the city government to put its “house in order” over its failure to check black marketing of oxygen cylinders and chaos in oxygen supply to hospitals reeling under heavy patient load. “If you can’t manage it, tell us. Then we will ask the Centre to take over. We can’t let people die,” a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said, adding: “The system has failed.” “The Delhi government has to pull up its socks on distribution of liquid oxygen to larger hospitals, but also supply of oxygen cylinders in nursing homes and smaller hospitals,” it said. During the hearing, Batra Hospital told the court that 21 COVID-19 patients died because it ran out of oxygen. The High Court has directed the Delhi government to collect data from all nursing homes and hospitals regarding deaths due to shortage of oxygen, and submit a status report within four days. “We have to compensate these patients who are dying due to lack of oxygen. It is the responsibility of the State,” the HC said. Contempt notices The court also questioned the Delhi government on how an oxygen refiller firm, with around 20 metric tonnes of oxygen available with it, was not included in the list of oxygen suppliers for hospitals.  The HC has issued contempt notices to the Delhi government on the issue. “The manner in which black marketing has been dealt with... our confidence is shaken. Are you aware of black marketing? It is not the time to become vultures,” said the Bench. It also ordered the government to submit an affidavit by Wednesday on oxygen stock with the gas refillers and suppliers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/the-system-has-failed-delhi-hc/article34427407.ece
28 April 2021||HUBBALLI,||Notice to three hospitals for not following norms||Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil has issued show-cause notice to three hospitals in Dharwad district for not adhering to the government’s direction on earmarking 50% of beds in private hospitals and for giving wrong information on COVID-19 patients. According to a press release issued by the Deputy Commissioner, in a meeting on April 15, all private hospitals in the district had been asked to earmark 50% of beds for treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, three hospitals of Hubballi, Shakuntala Memorial Hospital and Research Centre, Hubballi Super Specialty Hospital and Tatwadarsha Hospital, had violated the government order, he said. Consequently, these three hospitals had been issued show-cause notice under the provisions of Epidemic Disease Act 1897 and Disaster Management Act 2005 seeking reply within 24 hours, he said. Shakuntala Memorial Hospital had informed the district administration that it had earmarked 75 beds for COVID-19 patients and that 31 COVID-19 patients were being treated. However, when the District Health Officer visited the hospital on April 25, it was found that only six such patients were being treated and the remaining 25 were being treated as COVID-19 patients though they had not tested positive for the infection, he said. Similarly, in the Hubballi Super Specialty Hospital, where 26 beds have been earmarked for COVID-19 patients, only six COVID-19 positive patients were being treated instead of 26 patients as the district administration had been informed. In Tatwadarsha Hospital, 75 beds have been earmarked for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, in-patients had been admitted as COVID-19 patients without having proper test reports, Mr. Patil said in the release. The Deputy Commissioner has said that as per the government direction, the hospitals should display tariff board for COVID-19 treatment. However, when the District Health Officer visited these hospitals, clear violation of the government direction was noticed and these hospitals had given wrong information to the district administration on the number of positive patients being treated, Mr. Patil said in the release. Through the notice, the district administration has sought complete details of COVID-19 positive patients and also sought a reply on non-display of tariff for the information of the public. Failure to provide proper reply would result in legal action, the Deputy Commissioner said in the notice served to the three hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/notice-to-three-hospitals-for-not-following-norms/article34427034.ece

28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||COVID-19 cases: SC refuses to interfere in work of HCs||The Supreme Court cannot remain a “mute spectator” in the face of a national calamity. However, the top court will not interfere in the work done by the various High Courts to monitor and manage life-saving COVID-19 management amid a second wave of the pandemic, a Special Bench, led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, made it clear on Tuesday. The Bench, also comprising Justices L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat, sat for almost the whole day, grilling the Centre, the States and the authorities on the various aspects of COVID-19 management in a suo motu hearing called, ‘In re distribution of essential supplies and services during COVID-19’. “During a national crisis, the Supreme Court cannot be a mute spectator. The role of the Supreme Court is complementary in nature. The court will examine issues which travel beyond the boundaries of States and have national repercussions,” the Bench assuaged apprehensions that the top court would derail the ongoing work of the High Courts. Over 11 High Courts are hearing COVID-19 related cases and passing orders on a daily basis. “High Courts are best suited to make an assessment of ground realities in each State and find flexible solutions for problems faced by citizens. No need to interfere in the work of the High Courts,” the Bench observed. Vaccine pricing The Bench questioned the Centre about its vaccine pricing policy. It asked why different manufacturers were rating their vaccines differently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/wont-interfere-in-hc-work-on-covid-19-crisis-says-sc/article34426893.ece

The order states that the additional posting is following directions of Governor Vajubhai R. Vala. It was on March 31, when COVID-19 positive cases had started to spike in Bengaluru, that the State government appointed Mr. Gupta, who was then posted as BBMP’s administrator, as the Chief Commissioner. Mr. Prasad was posted as Principal Secretary, Revenue Department. Highly placed sources in the BBMP stated that the present COVID-19 condition had put forth numerous challenges that would be best addressed with as much support as they could muster. Over the past few weeks, the civic body has been struggling with increasing mortality rate, shortage of ICUs and ventilators, private labs not following protocols and most importantly, getting the private hospitals to hand over beds under government quota. “Despite several meetings and warnings, many of these problems persist.

28 April 2021||MANGALURU,||Seven arrested on the charge of kidnap, extortion||The police have arrested seven persons on the charge of kidnapping a businessman and his friend and extortion and recovered lethal weapons as well as cars from them. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar told reporters here on Tuesday that the accused kidnapped businessman Ahmed Ashraf from K.C. Road near Talapady and his friend Javid from Hosangadi near Manjeshwar in neighbouring Kerala on April 22. They demanded from Ashraf’s family Rs. 25 lakh in cash, documents of 60 cents of land and gold ornaments for their release. Acting on a complaint from Ashraf’s wife to Ullal Police, the police arrested the accused and got the two released. Mr. Kumar gave the names of the accused as Ahmed Iqbal (33) of Machchampadi in Manjeshwar now residing in Attavar in Mangaluru, M. Yakub (33), Naushad (27) and Ummar Navaf (25) from Machchampady, Shamsheer (30) from Bandyod, Syed Muhammad Kausar (41) from Mangalpady and Sheik Muhammed Riyaz (25) from Uppala. Three cars, two talwars, one dagger, 120 gm gold ornaments, property documents and 10 mobile phones were recovered from the accused. The main accused Ummar Navaf tested positive for COVID-19 during medical examination and is now under treatment. The others were produced before the jurisdictional court. Iqbal had reportedly invested up to Rs. 27 lakh in Ashraf’s MCT Trading Company, MCT Toll Deal, Cryptocurrency and FOREX trading business with the latter promising returns worth three times. Though Ashraf had paid Rs. 10 lakh to Iqbal, there was delay in paying the balance and as such, the latter planned the kidnap, Mr. Kumar said. After being unable to engage a henchman from West Asia, Iqbal hired Navaf to execute the task who kidnapped Ashraf from K.C. Road at 1.30 p.m. on April 22 and later, Javid from Hosangadi. The two were kept in a building under construction at Paivalike, before the police swooped down on the accused. Navaf is facing cases in Ullal, Manjeshwar and Kasaragod in Kerala for several offences, including murder, attempt to murder, dacoity and extortion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/seven-arrested-on-the-charge-of-kidnap-extortion/article34427527.ece

Ravi, nodal officer for genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said, “All the 20 cases had a travel history to Maharashtra and are a part of the clusters reported from these two cities,” he said. The NIMHANS lab received the cluster samples in late March and the sequencing was completed by April 15. “We reported this to the Centre and it has been announced now. So far, 778 cases of double mutant have been reported in the country. A majority are from Maharashtra (427), West Bengal (124), Madhya Pradesh (52), Delhi (75), and Chhattisgarh (34),” he said. “There are two mutations (L452R and K484Q) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that have not been reported together earlier and this is referred to as double mutant in India. Studies are still on to check if this variant is more infectious. Like all viruses, the Coronavirus keeps changing in small ways as it passes from one person to another. A vast majority of these mutations are inconsequential and do not alter the way the virus behaves,” said Dr. Ravi. “We know that the U.K., South Africa and Brazil variants are more infectious. But this double mutant of India is under investigation. One study from NIV Pune has shown that those who have been vaccinated with Covaxin are able to neutralise the double mutant,” Dr. Ravi explained. Over 3 lakh active cases Meanwhile, the number of active cases in the State breached the three lakh mark, touching 3,01,899 on Tuesday. Of these 2,063 are being monitored in ICUs of various hospitals. What is worrisome is that over one lakh active cases have been added in the last four days. From 2,14,311 on April 23, active cases have shot up to 3,01,899 on Tuesday. With 2,06,223 active cases, Bengaluru contributes to over 68% of the total caseload. While Karnataka continues to be in the third place in terms of active cases after Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, Bengaluru Urban has the highest number now. On Tuesday. Karnataka reported 31,830 new cases taking the total to 14,00,775. Of these, 17,550 cases are from Bengaluru Urban alone. With 180 deaths, the toll rose to 14,807. The State has vaccinated 90,83,705 people so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/20-double-mutant-cases-detected-in-karnataka/article34427033.ece

Four injections, including two doses that had expired, and a cash of Rs. 2.32 lakh, was recovered from them. The accused, natives of Krishna district, worked as medical distributors and representatives for different companies. Police are trying to trace a few others involved in the racket, said Police Commissioner B. Srinivasulu. Central Zone Assistant Commissioner of Police Y. Srinivas Reddy said a police team led by Patamata inspector R. Suresh Reddy arrested medical distributor Sivanath and medical representatives Srinivas, Mohan Krishna, Anantha Reddy, Raju, Tharun and Naresh. The police said the accused supplied two injections of Remdesivir to G. Hitesh Kumar of Mangalagiri, who needed them for his father, and charged Rs. 70,000 from him. But when the buyer realised that the medicine had expired, he returned the vials to the accused who reportedly did not return any amount to him. Instead, they sold two more injections and charged another Rs. 1.4 lakh from him, Mr. Srinivas Reddy said. “We are trying to find out whether the gang has links to any hospitals or pharmacies and if any other gangs were involved in the malpractice,” the Police Commissioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/7-held-for-selling-remdesivir-vials-in-black-market/article34426887.ece

28 April 2021||New Delhi,||Aid pours in from the world||Nearly 15 countries, including the U.S., Russia, France and the U.K., are rushing critical emergency use equipment to help India counter the COVID-19 second wave. A compilation from the External Affairs Ministry showed that countries are sending hundreds of oxygen concentrators, respirators and large quantities of liquid oxygen to help ease the difficult situation. Out of the promised international assistance, a large chunk is expected from the U.S., following President Joe Biden’s telephonic conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 26  An important part of support from the United States will include raw materials required for production of the vaccines here.  Vaccine manufacture Under the Quad Vaccine Initiative, the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is funding a substantial expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE, a vaccine manufacturer in India. It is expected that BioE may produce 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by 2022. Assistance from the leading economies of the world is expected to reach in multiple phases with France this week sending eight large oxygen generating plants and items such as respirators and electric syringe pushers. The French government is on track to send five liquid oxygen containers next week. Germany will make an oxygen production plant available for three months along with 120 ventilators and protective gear such as KN95 masks. Australia announced on Tuesday that it will send 500 ventilators, 1 million surgical masks, 5,00,000 P2 and N95 masks, and other protective items for frontline health workers. The Hindu had earlier reported citing official sources that Delhi is looking for oxygen-related items. Accordingly, four cryogenic oxygen containers were sourced from Singapore. Saudi Arabia has sent 80 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen which is currently en route via sea. Thailand and the United Arab Emirates have sent four and six cryogenic oxygen tanks respectively. As many as 800 oxygen concentrators were sent by Hong Kong. Ireland is on track to send 70 of this equipment. The international campaign to support India appeared to intensify with more countries joining the effort by late Tuesday. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has also received calls from Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau and Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Ahmed Nasser Mohammed Al Sabah offering support. Both countries discussed ways to strengthen efforts to deal with the second wave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aid-pours-in-from-the-world/article34426833.ece
28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Enforcing COVID-19 rules is State responsibility, says ECI||The Election Commission of India said on Tuesday that the enforcement of COVID-19 protocols under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 was the responsibility of the State authorities, a day after the Madras High Court said the ECI was unable to ensure political parties followed the rules while campaigning for the Assembly election. In its oral observations, the Madras High Court blamed the ECI for the second wave of COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, where polling was held on April 6 and counting of votes is scheduled for May 2. In a statement, the ECI said on Tuesday that “the statements being attributed to the Hon’ble High Court in certain sections of media do not find mention in the order finally passed”. The ECI said it would comply with the directions of the court and apprise it of the steps taken to ensure safe elections. “The enforcement under the 2005 Act has to be ensured by the SDMA [State Disaster Management Authority] concerned and notified authorities under the Act. The Commission has always emphasised in its 21.8.2020 and all subsequent instructions that the State authorities shall ensure COVID-19 compliance in the matter of public gatherings, etc. for campaign purposes. At no occasion, the Commission takes over the task of SDMA for enforcement of COVID-19 instructions,” it said. It added that the campaign for the Tamil Nadu polls ended on April 4 and “fortunately, the second wave of COVID-19 was yet to be visible fully by that time.” The ECI said polling was conducted while following COVID-appropriate measures. It added that Tamil Nadu ordered lockdown restrictions due to the second surge from April 20, 16 days after the campaign ended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/enforcing-covid-19-rules-is-state-responsibility-says-eci/article34426802.ece
28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||States have 1 crore doses: Centre||A day ahead of when India opens vaccine registration for all over 18, figures from the Health Ministry show that relative to stocks, Tamil Nadu reported a high percentage of vaccine wastage of nearly 8.83%. Only Lakshwadeep had a higher wastage ratio of 9.76%. Assam, Manipur and Haryana ranked after Tamil Nadu in wastage of vaccines at 7.7%, 7.4% and 5.2%, respectively. Over 1 crore vaccine doses remain in stock with the States. An additional 80 lakh will be made available to them in the next three days, the Health Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. U.P. on top Uttar Pradesh had the most available doses, about 1 million, followed by Maharashtra with 9,00,000 doses and Bihar which has 7,50,000 doses. Maharashtra led the table of vaccines administered with 1.4 crore doses followed by Rajasthan (1.3 crore), Uttar Pradesh (1.23 crore) and Gujarat (1.21 crore). These were also the States that had so far received the most number of doses, again in that order. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Mizoram, Odisha were the States that had reported no vaccine shortage. The cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the country on Tuesday touched 14.5 crore. These include 93,24,770 healthcare workers who have taken the first dose and 60,60,718 in that category who have taken the second dose, 1,21,10,258 (first dose) and 64,25,992 (second dose) frontline workers, 5,05,77,743 first dose and 87,31,091 second dose beneficiaries aged over 60 and 4,93,48,238 first dose and 26,92,376 second dose beneficiaries aged 45 to 60.

As many as 19,73,778 beneficiaries were vaccinated across 22,797 sessions for the first dose, and 12,00,910 beneficiaries received the second dose of the vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-have-1-crore-doses-centre/article34426817.ece
28 April 2021||Bolpur,||Once an abode of peace, now hub of political row||On April 5, hundreds of Trinamool Congress activists gathered at the sub-divisional office in Bolpur, Birbhum. They brought along with them brass bands and vehicles decked with balloons as State Minister Chandranath Sinha filed his nomination for Bolpur. All COVID-19 safety norms were cast aside even as scores of police personnel stood outside the SDO office. The pomp and show at the nomination centre, where a few hours later the BJP candidate also arrived, was in sharp contrast to the rural elections held three years ago when no candidate of the Opposition was able to file nomination papers in the area. What prevented the candidates of the Opposition to file nomination papers in 2018 was unnayan [development by the Trinamool government] in the words of Trinamool district president and strongman Anubrata Mondal. Almost 48 hours before the 11 seats of the district are going to the polls on April 29, the Election Commission ordered a strict surveillance of Mr. Mondal by the executive magistrate and the Central forces. He will be videographed, the EC said. Mr. Mondal, known to speak in political innuendos, said “such surveillance will not hamper his game”. It was Mr. Mondal who first raised the slogan “ Khela Hobe (game on)” that was adopted by the ruling party. What makes Birbhum one of the sensitive areas is the regular incidence of political violence. On April 6, one person was found dead in Dubrajpur area of Birbhum and local people clashed with the police when the forces tried to take the body for the medico-legal processes. On April 10, a huge cache of crude bombs was recovered and defused in the Nanoor area. Several incidents of violence have been reported in the district, where in 2018 the State’s ruling party had won the highest number of panchayat seats without any contest as the Opposition was not allowed to field any candidate. On one occasion during the campaign this month, a local Trinamool leader threatened sitting MLA and Samyukta Morcha Candidate Shyamali Pradhan and her supporters that their hands would be “chopped off” if she campaigned in a particular village. In the 2016 Assembly election, the Trinamool won nine of the 11 seats in Birbhum — the remaining two went to the Congress and the Left; but by the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the scenario changed, and the BJP was seen leading in five Assembly segments, while the Trinamool was ahead in six. The district which borders Murshidabad has about 37% minority population and along with the surge of the BJP, the Trinamool has to deal with infighting. Bolpur in Birbhum, where Rabindranath Tagore set up the Visva-Bharati University, provides a sharp contrast to the culture of political violence. Santiniketan, which means abode of peace, can also be described as being the cultural heart of Bengal where attempts are made to live by the ideals of universal brotherhood. Tagore’s abode of peace, however, has witnessed a lot of unrest over measures taken by the Visva-Bharati administration. The university’s plans to erect a boundary wall and suspend a professor of the 100-year-old university have created a lot of resentment. Despite the attempts by the BJP leadership to appropriate the legacy of Tagore with Prime Minister Narendra Modi often quoting the poet and Union Home Minister Amit Shah visiting the university, there is resentment among the local academic circles and the ‘ashramites’ against the varsity administration. The BJP candidate from Bolpur, Anirban Ganguly, has tried to distance himself from the Vice-Chancellor of the university. Mr. Ganguly harps on plans of “resurrecting and rejuvenating” the glory of West Bengal including the Santiniketan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/once-an-abode-of-peace-now-hub-of-political-row/article34426808.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||The system has failed: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday cautioned the city government to put its “house in order” over its failure to check black marketing of oxygen cylinders and chaos in oxygen supply to hospitals reeling under heavy patient load. “If you can’t manage it, tell us. Then we will ask the Centre to take over. We can’t let people die,” a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said, adding: “The system has failed.” “The Delhi government has to pull up its socks on distribution of liquid oxygen to larger hospitals, but also supply of oxygen cylinders in nursing homes and smaller hospitals,” it said. During the hearing, Batra Hospital told the court that 21 COVID-19 patients died because it ran out of oxygen. The High Court has directed the Delhi government to collect data from all nursing homes and hospitals regarding deaths due to shortage of oxygen, and submit a status report within four days. “We have to compensate these patients who are dying due to lack of oxygen. It is the responsibility of the State,” the HC said. The court also questioned the Delhi government on how an oxygen refiller firm, with around 20 metric tonnes of oxygen available with it, was not included in the list of oxygen suppliers for hospitals. The HC has issued contempt notices to the Delhi government on the issue. “The manner in which black marketing has been dealt with... our confidence is shaken. Are you aware of black marketing? It is not the time to become vultures,” said the Bench. It also ordered the government to submit an affidavit by Wednesday on oxygen stock with the gas refillers and suppliers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-tells-delhi-govt-to-put-its-house-in-order/article34427189.ece
28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Timely support important: Rawat||Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) Gen. Bipin Rawat on Tuesday called upon the armed forces to rise to the occasion and support the civil administration in creating COVID-19 mitigation facilities in a time-bound manner. “Timely support at this juncture is important,” Gen. Rawat said in a message to the forces. “Our men and women in uniform have the will and dedication to break barriers and walk the extra mile, always and every time,” he said. “We can and we will. Well done and carry on. We still have long distances to travel.” The Services have pressed in personnel and resources to assist the civil administration in dealing with the pandemic. Reviewing the situation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, Gen. Rawat said oxygen cylinders available with the armed forces at various establishments will be released for hospitals. The IAF has deployed heavy transport aircraft to transport cryogenic oxygen containers from several countries which have been procured as part of commercial agreements and transfer oxygen containers within the country. On Tuesday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh approved temporary hiring of additional contractual staff in 51 high pressure Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme(ECHS) polyclinics to cater to veterans and their dependants, the Defence Ministry said. “The contractual staff, including one each of medical officer, nursing assistant, pharmacist, driver and chowkidar for identified ECHS polyclinics, will be hired through station headquarters for night duty, beyond normal working hours, for three months, the statement said. The validity of this sanction is up to August 15, 2021,” the Ministry statement said. Navy’s oxygen express The Navy too had launched an oxygen express via the sea to transport cylinders and other supplies to Lakshadweep. The second consignment as part of this was sent on Tuesday. The Navy’s IN LCU 55 arrived in Port Blair on Monday with oxygen cylinders and Multi feed Oxygen Manifolds, manufactured by the Naval Dockyard, Vizag.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/timely-support-important-rawat/article34426822.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||Leaders call for House panels’ meet||Jairam Ramesh, Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, and IT committee head Shashi Tharoor appealed to Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla asking them to allow virtual meetings of the parliamentary panels. With the country in midst of a virulent second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, there has been no meeting of the standing committees for more than a month now. Important issues “I am requesting this once again for the umpteenth time. Speaker Lok Sabha @ombirlakota and Chairman Rajya Sabha @MVenkaiahNaidu, please allow virtual meetings of Standing Committees. There are so many issues of utmost public importance that need to be discussed urgently,” Mr. Ramesh wrote in a tweet. Last year, when the pandemic first hit, BJD leader heading the Labour committee B. Mahtab, IT committee chairperson Shashi Tharoor, Home committee chairperson Anand Sharma and others had demanded that the meetings be held virtually. After much back and forth between the committee heads and Mr. Birla and Mr. Naidu, the permission was declined citing the confidentiality clause. It was argued that it was difficult to maintain the confidentiality of the meetings in a virtual environment. Meet cancelled Mr. Tharoor echoed Mr. Ramesh’s plea. The last meeting of the IT committee he called on April 16 had to be cancelled for lack of quorum. “I agree strongly. @Jairam_Ramesh and I had made the same request last year. We are stymied because virtual participation is not allowed and physical meetings are impossible in the present circumstances,” Mr. Tharoor tweeted. The critical parliamentary panels such as that of Health last met on March 17, when the Budget session of Parliament was still on. The session also had to be curtailed due the growing number of COVID-19 cases and ended on March 25 instead of going on till April 8 as per the schedule. The standing committee meetings are often referred to as a mini-Parliament, holding the government accountable on micro-issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/leaders-call-for-house-panels-meet/article34426810.ece
28 April 2021||Chennai,||COVID-19 death toll crosses 2 lakh; case tally almost 1.8 cr.||With 3,306 new deaths registered until 11 p.m. on Tuesday, India’s recorded COVID-19 death tally crossed the 2-lakh mark. It was also the first instance when the daily deaths crossed the 3,000 mark since the beginning of the pandemic The country’s cumulative fatalities stood at 2,01,186. Only the U.S. (5.7 lakh), Brazil (3.9 lakh) and Mexico (2.15 lakh) have registered a higher toll. As of Monday, India surpassed Brazil’s average number of new deaths to become the country with the most daily fatalities. As many as 3,62,723 new cases were also recorded in the country on Tuesday, taking the total infections to 1,79,88,603. Maharashtra reported 66,358 infections on Tuesday, followed by Uttar Pradesh (32,993) and Kerala (32,819). Maharashtra also recorded 895 new casualties, followed by Delhi (381) and Uttar Pradesh (265). As many as 2,59,542 new recoveries were recorded on Tuesday, taking the total to 1,48,05,207. The figures do not include cases and deaths from Ladakh. The data are sourced from covid19india.org, an independent aggregator of daily figures. As many as 16,58,700 samples were tested on Monday (results of which were made available on Tuesday) in India, 2.56 lakh more than what was tested on Sunday. The number of tests conducted daily to find a positive case has reduced sharply in April. The metric measures whether the country is testing enough relative to the size of the outbreak. A low number of tests per confirmed case suggests that the true number of cases is much higher, and that testing needs to be increased.

28 April 2021||Srinagar,||Kashmir doctors say many young adults are dying of COVID-19||J&K recorded more than five COVID-19 deaths in the age group of 20 to 49 in the past two days, triggering an alarm among experts on the virus taking a toll on the younger population. The Srinagar administration imposed Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in Srinagar on Tuesday, as J&K recorded the highest 3,164 cases pushing the active cases to 22,283. Sringar recorded the highest 1,144 in the Union Territory (UT) in the past 24 hours. The Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) fears that delayed admission of patients could be the reason for the spike in the deaths. “Coronavirus patients arrive at hospitals only when their condition worsens. We receive patients with critically low oxygen saturation levels — as low as 50-60%. The delay is proving fatal and is contributing to the high mortality,” said DAK president and influenza expert Dr. Nisar ul Hassan. He said silent hypoxia, where patients with extremely low blood oxygen levels show no signs of difficulty in breathing, is a worrying trend. “By the time such patients feel trouble breathing, they are already dangerously sick and need to be put on ventilators. Most of them die,” he said. Lung inflammation Dr. Shams Ifran, a physician working at the Jawahar Lal Nehru Memorial hospital, said: “Five to eight percent young unvaccinated people are having COVID-induced multisystem inflammation, especially in lungs. It was seen earlier in the U.S. too. The coronavirus does play havoc in some cases and the virus still remains unpredictable.” At least three people among the 25 who died on Tuesday were aged less than 49. Officials said the number of active cases in Jammu and Kashmir has swelled to 22,283 — 13,436 from the Kashmir division and 8,847 from the Jammu division. “In view of the massive spurt in positive cases in Srinagar and after due deliberations, Section 144 is imposed hereby within the municipal limits of the district to contain further spread of the epidemic. Assembly of five or more persons is banned with immediate effect,” Mr. Asad said. The move comes as the recovery rate is far lower than the admissions witnessed in hospitals daily of late.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kashmir-doctors-say-many-young-adults-are-dying-of-covid-19/article34426836.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC denies making plea for COVID-19 facility in hotel||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday took strong exception to media reports that on its request the Delhi government has ordered that 100 rooms at Ashoka Hotel — a five star facility, be set aside for Covid Health Centre (CHC) for judges and judicial officers of the court and their family members. “This is very misleading. The High Court has not made any such request for allocation of any beds in any five-star hotel. There was absolutely no communication in this regard,” a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said. “We have made inquiry from the Registrar General of this Court as to whether a request for setting aside rooms in the Ashoka Hotel or any other hotel had been made to the GNCTD... We are informed that no such request has been made in respect of any hotel, much less Ashoka Hotel,” the court remarked. “It appears that the GNCTD, on its own, has proceeded to issue the order dated April 25 purporting to set up and set aside 100 rooms at Ashoka Hotel,” the court said while issuing notice to the Delhi government. The High Court also issued notice to “Ms. Geeta Grover, Incident Commander/SDM, Sub Division Chanakyapuri, who has issued the order”. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi government, submitted that this was not the only hotel which has been converted to extended COVID-19 hospital. “There are 25 other hotels which has been converted,” Mr. Mehra said. The Bench, however, remarked that the issue was with regard to April 25 order which says that the hotel was being converted to extended COVID-19 hospital “at the request of the High Court”. As per the order, the Primus Hospital will run the COVID Health Centre facility at Ashoka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/have-not-made-any-request-for-covid-19-facility-in-5-star-hotel/article34426813.ece
28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Submit Kappan’s medical records, says SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Uttar Pradesh government to submit the medical records of journalist Siddique Kappan who was arrested last year. The Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) alleged that Kappan had been chained to a cot in the hospital he was admitted to after falling in the bathroom and later testing positive for COVID-19. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the State government, to file the medical records on April 28. Mr. Mehta objected to the habeas corpus petition filed by the journalists’ union, saying Kappan was under judicial custody. Advocate Wills Mathew, appearing for the KUWJ, said that on April 20, Kappan fell in the bathroom and on April 21, he tested positive for COVID-19. He added that besides the relief being sought, Kappan should also be allowed to talk to his mother via video conference. Kappan’s wife recently wrote to CJI Ramana seeking his immediate release from the hospital, alleging that he was being “chained like an animal in a cot” there. Raihanath Kappan claimed in the letter written to the CJI that her husband received injuries on April 20 after falling in the jail bathroom and was reported COVID-19 positive a day later. She said he was shifted to KM Medical College, Mathura, on April 21, where he is presently “chained like an animal in a cot of the hospital, without mobility, and he neither could take food nor could go to the toilet for more than four days, and is very critical.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/submit-kappans-medical-records-says-sc/article34426819.ece
28 April 2021||Mohali,||Eight chargesheeted for terror killing in Punjab||The NIA on Tuesday filed a chargesheet against eight terrorists of the outlawed Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) for their alleged involvement in killing Shaurya Chakra winner Balwinder Singh Sandhu at the direction of their Pakistan-based handlers, an official said. Sandhu, who fought terrorism in Punjab, was shot dead in October last year in Tarn Taran district. The chargesheet, according to which Sandhu was killed by the KLF terrorists, was filed before a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Mohali under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Inderjit Singh of Tarn Taran; Sukhraj Singh, Sukhdeep Singh, Gurjit Singh and Sukhmeet Pal Singh of Gurdaspur; Ravinder Singh, Akashdeep Arora and Jagroop Singh of Ludhiana have been named in the chargesheet, the NIA official said. The case relates to the killing of Sandhu at his residence-cum-school in Tarn Taran by two unidentified people. The NIA investigation has revealed that he was executed with the intent to strike terror in the minds of the people of India and especially those opposed to the Khalistani ideology, the official said. The transnational conspiracy in the crime was hatched by Pakistan-based self-styled chief of the KLF Lakhvir Singh Rode and top foreign-based KLF terrorists who provided arms/ammunition and funds to the accused, according to the NIA official. Further, a well-oiled terrorist-narcotics-criminal nexus, wherein narcotic drugs along with weapons were smuggled by Pakistan-based entities from across the international border into Punjab for generation of funds for executing terrorist acts, has also been unearthed, the official said. The NIA had earlier investigated eight similar incidents of targeted killings/attempted killings by the KLF between January 2016 and October 2017, wherein seven people belonging to specific communities were killed, the official said. The foreign-based KLF leadership had recruited, financed and armed local gangster Sukhmeet Pal Singh and tasked him to execute the killings through his associates, the NIA official said. After the reported killing of Harmeet Singh, a Pakistan-based operational chief of the KLF in Pakistan in January 2020, Sukh Bikhariwal was directed by Lakhvir Singh Rode and other KLF operatives to kill Sandhu, according to the NIA official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/eight-charged-for-shaurya-chakra-winners-murder/article34426797.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||Vedanta can produce O2 at its Tamil Nadu plant||The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed Vedanta to operate its oxygen production unit at the Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, as an extraordinary measure to tide over the national shortage of oxygen amid the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The nation must stand together in this moment,” a Special Bench, led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, noted.  ‘No political bickering’ The top court made it clear that it would not supplant the role of the High Courts in monitoring the crisis. The High Courts had a unique role to play, it said.   The court said there should be no political bickering over oxygen generation by Vedanta as the country was facing a national crisis. The court said the Tamil Nadu government had met stakeholders extensively, both at the executive and political levels, and decided to let Vedanta operate the plant, which would be able to produce up to 200 MT of liquid oxygen within 10 days. With this, the State overcame its initial objections to the reopening of the Vedanta premises, which were closed in 2018 due to environmental problems. “We are inclined to allow Vedanta’s prayer to operate the oxygen plant as a standalone unit. The order is passed only in view of the national need for oxygen. The order will not create any equity in favour of Vedanta,” Justice Chandrachud noted.  The Bench asked the Tamil Nadu government to form a committee to monitor Vedanta, which will include the District Collector, Tuticorin; SP Tuticorin; District Environmental Engineer; Sub Collector Tuticorin; and two government officials with knowledge of the affairs. Vedanta will not be allowed to enter and operate the copper smelting plant under the garb of this order. It is in the nature of an oversight panel. The committee will work in tandem with local community members and address their concerns. The order will hold ground till July 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vedanta-can-produce-o2-at-its-tamil-nadu-plant/article34427426.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||Kin attack hospital staff after death of patient||About seven to eight hospital employees, including doctors, of Apollo Hospital in Sarita Vihar were injured after being attacked allegedly by relatives of a COVID-19 patient, following a patient’s death, the hospital said. “The patient was brought to the hospital and needed ICU, but we didn’t have ICU beds and we informed them that. We gave the patient oxygen and emergency care, but the patient passed away. The relatives then started attacking the staffers,” a spokesperson of Apollo Hospital said. No serious injuries None of the hospital staffers is seriously injured or admitted at the hospital. The hospital received the woman in a critical condition at the emergency in the early hours of Tuesday. “Immediate medical attention appropriate to her condition was given. Given the paucity of beds, the family was advised to shift the patient to another facility with available beds. Unfortunately, the patient died at around 8 a.m., post which the patient’s family members resorted to vandalism, destruction of hospital property and assault on our doctors and staffers,” the hospital said in a statement said. The situation was brought under control by hospital security staffers and the police. “While the hospital deeply condoles the death of the patient, it is deeply shocked at the behaviour of the patient’s family against doctors and healthcare workers who are providing untiring services amidst the pandemic,” the statement said. The hospital has not filed a police complaint till Tuesday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/relatives-attack-hospital-staffers-after-patient-dies/article34427116.ece

28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||IMA case: chargesheet filed against ex-Minister||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a supplementary chargesheet against former Karnataka Minister Roshan Baig and others in the I Monetary Advisory (IMA) case. Among those arraigned are Mr. Baig’s company, Danish Publications; Mohammed Mansoor Khan, managing director of IMA-Bengaluru; and its other directors. The IMA group has also been named. The agency has alleged that the former Minister received several crores from the IMA for election-related expenditures. He allegedly used the funds for day-to-day expenses, including the salaries of his firm’s employees. According to the CBI, Mr. Baig also spent the IMA funds for various social and cultural activities in his constituency to increase his popularity. IMA funds to the tune of Rs. 4,000 crore was raised from about one lakh investors on false premises. While a part of the funds was diverted to Mr. Baig, a significant portion was used to acquire properties, besides paying bribes. The competent authority has attached several such properties under the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishment Act. The CBI has registered four cases in connection with the alleged scam. The agency had earlier filed three chargesheets and three supplementary chargesheets against 33 accused persons, including revenue and police officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ima-case-chargesheet-filed-against-ex-minister/article34426803.ece

28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Government hits out at Australian paper||Facing a barrage of criticism from a number of international newspapers for its handling of the coronavirus crisis, the government hit out at The Australian newspaper for reproducing an article that portrayed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a poor light, accusing him of “leading India” into a “viral apocalypse”. In a letter addressed to the Editor of the Australian newspaper Christian Dore, the Indian High Commission in Canberra said that the article sought to “undermine” the Modi government for its approach to the pandemic, which the government said had been “universally acclaimed”. “It is astonishing to see that your respected publication has chosen to reproduce a baseless malicious and slanderous article without bothering to check the facts of the case with any authorities in the Government of India,” said the rejoinder, signed by India’s Deputy High Commissioner, who claimed that last year’s lockdown, the ongoing vaccination drive, an upgradation in diagnostics and treatment facilities, as well as India’s “Vaccine Maitri” initiative, where it exported 66 million vaccines to 80 countries (now 95 countries), were counters to the article’s assertions. The High Commission also said that it was unfair to blame the current coronavirus surge, that has seen new cases in India rise to record levels, on what it called a “restricted” election campaign by Mr. Modi, and “one religious gathering”, referring to the organisation of the Kumbh Mela at Haridwar in April that saw millions of devotees gather over the past month at the Ganga. It is unclear why the government chose to respond to the article in Canberra, given that it had been reproduced from the original article in The Sunday Times , in the U.K. previously, and is one of the several scathing columns written internationally about the government’s response. On Monday, The Sydney Morning Herald also published a piece, written by the former High Commissioner to India and board member of the Australia India Institute John McCarthy that said that Mr. Modi’s government “has not distinguished itself” by allowing the Kumbh Mela and going ahead with massive rallies as the coronavirus pandemic spread. “Demonstrating both the government’s desperation and its regrettable inclination towards autocracy, over the weekend it banned on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, social media posts critical of its handling of the pandemic,” he added, referring to the Ministry of Information Technology’s reported requests for social media posts to be taken down. Other major dailies including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Economist, and Financial Times have also carried similar pieces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/government-hits-out-at-australian-paper/article34427337.ece

The court said the government was trying to paint a rosy picture while the reality was different. A Division Bench, hearing the suo motu public interest litigation on the COVID-19 situation, noted that people were dying outside hospitals as there were no doctors to attend the patients and the entire system lacked “transparency.” Though the Bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia noted that the lockdown was not a solution as it would affect the livelihood of the poor, it asked the State to take steps to combat the virus. “We are not saying that the government is not doing anything, but the manner in which it is being done is not satisfactory, not transparent, and therefore all these problems are arising,” said the court. “These untimely deaths or unfortunate deaths that are taking place outside hospitals because of non-attendance by doctors should not happen,” the court told Advocate General Kamal Trivedi, who contended that that the State has taken all steps possible amidst the challenging situation.  “What is going to happen on May 1 when the number of patients doubles? Everyday there is an increase. Are you ready for it? “What are the steps you are going to take?” the court asked.

With the daily case load having crossed 30,000 in Karnataka, the desperate search for drugs, beds and oxygen remains unabated, while the government has imposed a lockdown to stem the spread of the virus. Finding an ICU and ventilator beds in Hyderabad has turned into anguish for family members. While the State Health department claimed that the website health.telangana.gov.in, displays real time status of beds availability, patients strongly contested that. According to the website, out of 9,428 ICU or ventilators beds in the hospitals, 3,526 were vacant on Tuesday evening. However, the desperate messages for bed and ventilators on social media belie the claims. Unaffordable in A.P. Though the Andhra Pradesh government has permitted more private hospitals to treat COVID patients and increased bed capacity in Government hospitals, getting admitted to one was still a tough task. While most government facilities are full, treatment at private hospitals has been unaffordable for a majority. According to officials, there are over 40,000 beds for COVID treatment in the state apart from the Covid Care Centres set up in every district to treat patients with mild symptoms. However, as per the COVID dashboard there are 33,922 beds in 398 hospitals. Officials said there was no scarcity of oxygen and the demand of 320 tonnes per day was being met. In Chennai, a 64-year-old woman who tested positive is being treated in a government hospital for nearly 10 days. While they will continue to keep her, they have told her son that she needs high pressure oxygen flow that is available only in an intensive care unit, which they are currently unable to offer. Jaheer Hussain of TOSH Hospital, explained: “We are a mid-range orthopaedic hospital converted to a COVID centre, and can admit patients with mild to moderate complications, with SPO2 up to 85. If their oxygen saturation falls below this range we have to refer them to bigger hospitals.” In Odisha, again, people say the situation is worse than government claims of available beds. All major private hospitals in the capital Bhubaneswar are turning patients away citing unavailability of beds. In Jammu and Kashmir, there is rare good news, as leading government-run hospitals in Srinagar and Jammu have a bed occupancy rate between 70 to 90%, officials said. According to data from districts, bed occupancy is still around 50%. Kerala had doubled the number of ventilators (3,776 both public and private) and ICU beds (9,735 both public and private) in the State; and increased the oxygen production. Hospital bed and ICU bed capacity was enhanced over two times in many government medical colleges, while all private medical colleges have been asked to give up 75% of the beds for COVID patients. “But every surge capacity has a limit. If the case graph continues to rise the way it has this past week, our system too may not hold up ,” says Mohammed Asheel, Executive Director, Kerala State Security Mission.

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Draupadi’s surrender||Faith in the supremacy of the omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent God is of utmost significance in each one’s life. This is nowhere so explicitly manifest than in Draupadi’s fervent appeal with tremendous faith in Krishna, pointed out Sri B. Damodhara Dikshitar in a discourse. Her plight is unique for though she is in the presence of the Pandavas and the worthy elders such as Bhishma, Drona and others to whom she appeals for justice, they are only silent spectators and unable to help. In this state of mind she cries out to the Lord. She is aware that when in times of great danger, nothing except complete surrender to the Lord can help us. She thus concentrates on the Lord and forgets all else. She gives up all attempts to protect her from humiliation. With folded palms and eyes closed she utters her prayer to the Lord. She makes it clear to the Lord that He alone is the sole refuge for all those who are helpless. He alone is the soul of the universe. Then a miracle happens to affirm the truth of divine grace, ‘the illustrious dharma that prevails while yet remaining unseen.’ She is covered with robes of various hues and the vastra flow is as continuous as the waves in the ocean. The whole assembly is struck at this marvel and the people feel reassured of God’s presence and protection. They realise that when the Lord chooses to help, it can come in countless ways. No one can ever fathom about how and in what manner help will reach the seeker. In fact at a later occasion, Krishna confesses that He had not helped Draupadi at the time of her distress. It was Govinda Nama that Draupadi had chanted with faith that had taken care of the situation and protected her. Hence, the Lord feels He is ever indebted to her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/draupadis-surrender/article34426831.ece

On Monday, leading doctors and representatives of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Surat urged the Chief Minister and other officials to immediately increase supply, as otherwise the lives of around 4,000 patients in various hospitals would be jeopardised. “Over 4,000 patients are in around 400 private hospitals in the city.

The medical body, in its representation to the Surat Municipal Commissioner and District Collector, has also warned of a law and order situation arising in the city if the supply was not restored as relatives of the patients were venting their anger at doctors and medical staff in hospitals. Owing to the oxygen shortage, two prominent government hospitals in the city refused to admit new patients on Monday. The civil hospital and SMIMER hospital run by the municipal corporation on Monday did not take in new patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/surat-hospitals-face-acute-oxygen-shortage/article34427109.ece

28 April 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra unsure about jabs for those below 45||The Maharashtra government is unsure about being able to start COVID-19 vaccination of all above 18 years from May 1 due to uncertainty over availability of vaccines. “We cannot say whether the State can commence the vaccination of those above 18 years. This is because there is a question mark on the availability of vaccines,” Public Health Minister Rajesh Tope said on Tuesday. Mr. Tope said that the State had written to Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech seeking to know the availability of vaccines and the cost per dose. “Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been informed by SII that all vaccine doses till May 20 have been booked by the Central government. However, we are yet to receive any official reply from these two companies,” he said. The minister further said that Maharashtra needed 12 crore vaccine doses for the population in the 18-45 age group, which was estimated at 5.71 crore. Mr. Tope clarified that no decision on free vaccination had been taken yet and when decided it would be announced by the CM. “We will be discussing the technicalities of vaccination in the State Cabinet, which include how to go about the drive and any social sectors, or all would get free vaccine jabs,” he said. Mr. Tope added that there were a number of corporates and rich government organisations like CIDCO and MMRDA who could pay for the vaccination of their employees. The State has crossed 1.5 crore vaccinations and has set a target of eight lakh vaccinations per day through its over 4,500 centres. At present, 1,615 metric tonnes of oxygen are being used every day across Maharashtra and hospitals have been instructed to use the available oxygen efficiently for which a Nandurbar district model of oxygen nurse, where one nurse is appointed for 50 patients to observe oxygen use, has been recommended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-unsure-about-jabs-for-those-below-45/article34426814.ece
28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Modi, Shah working on augmenting oxygen supply’||The government has informed the Supreme Court that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah are “directly involved” in augmenting the oxygen supply on a “war-footing”. An affidavit spanning over 200 pages said the Centre, with “the active and constant supervision and direct involvement of the Honourable Prime Minister and the Honourable Home Minister, is augmenting the oxygen supply on a war footing evolving and implementing innovative measures.” “Resultantly, more and more medical oxygen is generated and is being made available every day, keeping not just existing requirements but potential future requirements,” the Centre claimed. The affidavit also said that efforts are being made to import oxygen not only through diplomatic channels but also “personal intervention of political executive.” The affidavit listed several steps to increase oxygen production, which includes issuing licences to industrial gas manufacturers to manufacture medical oxygen; enhancing production in steel plants and other initiatives through Ministry of Steel; enhancing production of medical oxygen from other manufacturers; restricting industrial use of oxygen; augmentation in availability of tankers; and commissioning of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-shah-working-on-augmenting-oxygen-supply/article34426820.ece

Ms. Vadra has asked the State government to announce a comprehensive financial package for all health and frontline workers. Setting up oxygen storage facilities in district headquarters, giving ambulance status to oxygen tankers and roping in anganwadi and ASHA workers to distribute medical supplies in villages are among the suggestions.

28 April 2021||Mumbai,||HC refuses to pass order allowing hospital that caught fire to function again||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday refused to pass an order allowing Sunrise Hospital at Dreams Mall in Bhandup, where 11 patients were killed in a fire on March 25, to function again. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a petition filed by Privilege Healthcare Services Private Limited that owns the hospital. The plea challenged an order passed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) revoking its provisional occupation certificate. It also sought permission to start the hospital running again. The petition said the hospital had 250 beds with oxygen supply for COVID-19 patients. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, representing the BMC, strongly opposed the plea and said after the incident on March 25, the no-objection certificate from the BMC’s fire department and the nursing licence of the hospital had also been cancelled. “Electricity supply to the whole building has been cut off and the building has been sealed by the police. An FIR has been registered against the owners of the mall and the directors of the petitioner company,” he said. Senior advocate Aabad Ponda, appearing for Privilege Healthcare, said that the fire started on the first floor of the mall and not in the hospital. He said 11 patients in the hospital lost their lives due to suffocation and not from getting charred in the blaze. The court, however, said it was a fact that 11 patients died in the fire, and posted the petition for further hearing in June. “We will not pass any order today allowing this hospital to function. This can wait,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-refuses-to-pass-order-allowing-hospital-that-caught-fire-to-function-again/article34426837.ece

28 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 tests for all counting agents||The Chennai district election office will on Wednesday conduct RT-PCR tests on the counting agents of all political parties, ahead of the counting of votes scheduled for May 2. Agents who test positive for COVID-19 will not be allowed into the counting halls. According to district election officials, the tests will be conducted at the offices of the returning officers. “The aim is to prevent the infected persons from visiting the three counting centres in Chennai. The political parties have been advised to keep a reserve list in the event of agents testing positive,” says an official. More exhaust fans The counting centres at Queen Mary’s College, Loyola College and College of Engineering, Guindy, Anna University, have been fitted in accordance with the standard operating procedures. The district election office has installed more exhaust fans for copious ventilation. The Greater Chennai Corporation has written to the Tangedco Chairman, urging for uninterrupted power supply on May 2 and 3. The civic body has said the CCTV surveillance of the centres would be affected in case of any disruption in power supply, leading to suspicions among the parties. The Tangedco has also been asked to appoint officials to ensure uninterrupted supply on these days. Officials expect the counting to take longer this time because of the increase in the number of candidates as well as polling booths in the Assembly constituencies of Chennai district. The counting is expected to be completed first for T. Nagar because this constituency has the least number of candidates. Officials say the number of counting tables will be 14 in each counting hall, but the counting process will take at least 12 hours. As a result, the process is expected to be completed only at night. The district election office will distribute face masks and gloves to all counting agents. A meeting is expected to be held on Wednesday to discuss all aspects of the process.  The number of counting tables will be 14 in each counting hall, but the counting process will take at least 12 hours||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-tests-for-all-counting-agents/article34427369.ece

28 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Scientific evidence helps HC convict man in Coimbatore rape and murder case||Despite several gaffes made by the police in investigating the rape-cum-murder of a six-year-old girl in a village near Thadagam in Coimbatore district during the 2019 Parliament election campaign, the Madras High Court relied upon the scientific evidence to confirm the conviction imposed on a 36-year-old aluminium fabricator K. Santhoshkumar. The court, however, commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment and ordered that the imprisonment should not be commuted or remitted for 25 years. Justices P.N. Prakash and V. Sivagnanam upheld a direction given by trial judge S. Radhika to the police to conduct further investigation in the case to find out the second adult whose semen and spermatozoa were also found in oral and cervical swabs and smears taken from the body of the victim. The court ordered that the Coimbatore Superintendent of Police should appoint an efficient woman investigating officer to conduct further investigation and nab the other accused. The Division Bench further directed the trial court to hold an inquiry to find out whether the Thadagam police station (PS) was empowered to register a First Information Report (FIR) on March 25, 2019 on the basis of the ‘girl missing’ complaint lodged by the victim’s mother. It was the claim of Sub Inspector of Police Boopathy that the government had not empowered Thadagam PS to register an FIR at the time of the incident and hence he had asked the complainant to approach Thudiyalur PS. Since defence counsel Kingsley Paul Robinson, whom the Bench appreciated for conducting the case meticulously despite having been appointed by the Legal Services Authority for a meagre fee due to the indigent circumstances of the convict, had asserted that the Sub Inspector had lied and was liable to be prosecuted for perjury, the High Court directed the trial court to conduct an inquiry under Section 304 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and initiate further action against the Sub Inspector. The Division Bench also directed the Director General of Police (DGP) to appoint an officer in the rank of Deputy Inspector General of Police to find out the officers responsible for the discrepancies in the First Information Report (FIR) which read as if it was registered at Thudiyalur PS on March 25, 2019 on the basis of a complaint lodged by the victim’s mother on the same day, though the complaint was actually dated March 26, 2019 and read that the complainant’s daughter went missing a day earlier. Though the judges refused to set aside the conviction on the basis of the discrepancy highlighted by the defence counsel and said that it would not come in the way of the overwhelming scientific evidence available against the convict, they ordered that the DGP should fix the responsibility on the officers concerned, initiate departmental action against them and submit a report to the court within six months. They ordered that the DIG should also inquire as to how the police allowed the media to access the scene of crime. Shocked to find that a television channel reporter had visited the spot and recorded the entire scene of crime in the presence of the police besides narrating the reported confession given by the appellant to the police even before the latter could be produced for judicial remand, the judges ordered that the DGP should initiate suitable action against the police officials who had allowed the media to meddle with the scene of crime. The judges refused to believe the prosecution's case that the appellant had voluntarily surrendered before two revenue officials on March 31, 2019 and confessed to have committed the crime alone. Nevertheless, such disbelief would not lead to the convict being given a clean chit, they said. Though the appellant, on the other hand, had claimed that the police had picked him up from his residence on March 28 and obtained his spermatozoa forcibly on March 31 , the judges refused to believe his claim too since the swabs and smears had been sent for DNA analysis much before March 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/scientific-evidence-helps-hc-convict-man-in-coimbatore-rape-and-murder-case/article34427010.ece
28 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Incomplete roadwork in Chennai leaves two-wheeler riders at risk||Hundreds of motorists particularly two-wheeler riders are finding it difficult to navigate roads which have been left unattended for weeks after milling in several areas, including Anna Nagar and Velachery. Greater Chennai Corporation had proposed to re-lay several roads, including bus route roads and street roads, in various parts of the city before the Assembly election. The roads have been scraped at the top using milling machines a few weeks ago and have been left unattended by the contractors causing inconvenience to the motorists. The poor condition of such roads poses threat to the two-wheeler riders. T.K. Pandian, a resident of Anna Nagar V Block, said several roads in Anna Nagar, including the 3rd Avenue, have not been repaved though the road had been milled till Shanthi Colony junction. Complaining about the delay in repairing these roads, Mr. Pandian said a little bit of foresight should have gone into executing milling work on these roads. Similarly, top portion of the Velachery Main Road has been scraped and left incomplete for more than a fortnight from Kannigapuram to Guindy. Interior streets in Velachery and Adyar have suffered a similar fate. The residents’ welfare associations have been requesting the local officials to speed up the repaving work but to no avail. A senior official of the Corporation said the milled roads had not been re-paved because of the announcement of night restrictions. He said normally roads would be paved only at night because of thin traffic. Citing several roads, which need to be relaid, he said the civic body had written to the State government and the Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority seeking relaxations and setting guidelines for allowing important civic work to be carried out so that the common people were not affected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/incomplete-roadwork-leaves-two-wheeler-riders-at-risk/article34427380.ece

With a built-area of about 600 sq. ft., the single-storey home has a functional space comprising a single bedroom, hall, and kitchen, with the entire ensemble being designed, developed, and realised by Tvasta’s ‘Concrete 3D Printing’ technology. Using this technology, the overall construction cost can be reduced and even the time of building can be cut down. And it brings down the related carbon footprint. The particular house within the IIT campus was developed in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity’s Terwilliger Center for Innovation in Shelter. Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman, who inaugurated this project virtually, pointed out that India needed such solutions which did not require much time. Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Director, IIT Madras, said, “This technology is the first to be beneficiary-led in the construction industry. The machine for constructing this house can be rented, like borewells rented by farmers. It provides for large-scale, high quality and also, price assurance for the customers.” Adithya V.S., Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Tvasta Manufacturing Solutions, said, “This technology can enable deep personalisation of construction for the ultimate target segment – the individual.” Co-founded by three IIT Madras Alums of the 2016 Batch — Adithya V.S., Vidyashankar C. and Parivarthan Reddy, Tvasta is part of the new incubator of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs established at IIT Madras called Asha Incubator.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/3d-printed-house-built-by-iit-m-start-up/article34427382.ece
28 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Veteran writer Pe. Su. Mani no more||Pe. Su. Mani, Tamil writer-historian, died on Tuesday evening at his residence in New Delhi after a brief illness. He was 87. He is survived by two daughters. His wife died in 2017. Born on November 2, 1933, in Pennathur of Tiruvannamalai district, Mani had a modest academic background and did not pursue beyond school education. He had worked in the postal department and retired as a supervisor. In his youth, he got attracted to eminent Tamil scholars Ve. Swaminatha Sarma, an author of a number of Tamil works on European social and political philosophers, and M. P. Sivagnanam (also known as Ma. Po. Si.), who ran a political group, ‘Tamilarasu Kazhagam’. He had worked as a leader of the group’s West Mambalam unit in Chennai. After realising that Tamil Nadu’s contribution to the freedom struggle had not been given the attention it deserved, Mani took to writing biographies of a number of nationalists hailing from the State, such as G. Subramania Iyer, V.V.S. Iyer and P. Varadarajulu Naidu. The writer, who visited Sri Lanka thrice in the 1990s on the invitation of the government and the Ramakrishna Math, wrote a book on the history of the math in the neighbouring country. He also wrote in detail about rare journals of the 19th century. He was a recipient of several awards. In 2001, he received the Bharati award, instituted by the State government. Three of his works, including those on Subramania Bharati, Subramania Siva and Ramakrishna Paramhamsa, bagged the awards. Thiruppur Krishnan, editor of a Tamil journal, ‘Amudhasurabi’, observes that Mani specialised in three broad areas — history of the freedom struggle, spiritualism, and Bharati. Pointing out that he followed the idea of nationalism propounded by Ma.Po.Si., former head of Tamil Department at the University of Madras, V. Arasu describes Mani’s book on Brahma Samaj as an important work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/veteran-writer-historian-pe-su-mani-no-more/article34427385.ece

28 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||U.S. citizen undergoes fusionless scoliosis surgery in Chennai||A 42-year-old person from the U.S., who was suffering from idiopathic scoliosis since young age, has undergone a fusionless scoliosis surgery at Apollo Hospitals here. Daniel Fry, a counsellor, said she was diagnosed with scoliosis, a curvature of the spine, when she was 11. A physically active person who ran marathons, Ms. Fry said that initially it was more a discomfort than pain. “As a child, I was told that the curvature will not progress once I stopped growing,” she said. However, the condition worsened with increased pain and therapeutic care stopped being helpful. Although she was aware of the standard fusion surgery, she was unwilling to undergo it as the procedure will severely restrict her mobility. “I got to know about fusionless scoliosis surgery and found out that only three surgeons in the U.S. were performing that for adults. However, I got to know that my insurance will not pay for the surgery,” she said. Later, she found that Sajan K. Hegde, chief spine surgeon and clinical director, Institute of Robotic and Complex Spine Surgery, Apollo Hospitals, was doing this procedure and got in touch with him. Dr. Hegde said that Ms. Fry’s curvature of the spine was unusual and resulted in extreme pain. “She was not treated properly when she was young and hence it worsened,” he said. “Fusionless scoliosis surgery takes minimal time. It is less invasive and less expensive and preserves motion and function in patients.” “This technique can now be used in idiopathic scoliosis where the deformity can be corrected using a flexible cable. No fusion of the operated portion of spine is performed. Therefore, patients can return to normal life faster,” he added. “She is undergoing physiotherapy now. She must be able to run a ten miler in a few months,” he said. Preetha Reddy, vice-chairperson, Apollo Hospitals, said the procedure done for the first time on an adult showed the hospital’s commitment to world-class outcomes. Stating that she was happy that Ms. Fry and her family managed to travel during the pandemic to get the procedure done, she expressed hope that the woman would resume all her activities once she went back to the U.S.  It is less invasive and less expensive and preserves motion and function in patients  Sajan K.

28 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rotary Club donates equipment worth Rs. 1 crore to fight COVID-19||The Rotary Club of Madras has donated equipment worth Rs. 1 crore to the government to preserve in cold chain and transport COVID-19 vaccines across the State. It has donated two 14-ft refrigerated trucks with a capacity to carry 4,500 litres of vaccine (44 lakh doses) and two 8-ft refrigerated trucks with a total capacity of 2,000 litres (20 lakh doses) to transport the vaccine from the central vaccine depot to zonal depots. The Rotary has also donated 15 ice-lined refrigerators to store 10 lakh doses of vaccine in district depots and 1,000 vaccine carriers that can be used to vaccinate up to 30 lakh people at a time. The donors including Cookson, Godrej, SRF, Vinakaya Mission Foundation,Omega Healthcare, Rotary Clubs of Madhavaram, IT City besides Rotary Club of Madras, participated in the event held on Tuesday. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, who received the donation, said the Rotary Club had been involved in the State’s health programmes since 1985. “We have an MoU with the RCM. We have only two forms of protection. Using mask and preventive medicine. Though the vaccine is given free of cost, there is vaccine hesitancy in the State. Rotary’s help is a big relief. We have inter-district challenges,” Dr. Radhakrishnan said. “These include transporting vaccines to districts that are facing a shortage. At such times these vehicles will help,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rotary-club-donates-equipment-worth-rs-1-crore-to-fight-covid-19/article34426974.ece
28 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Weekend lockdown has broken the spread: Health Secy.||The total lockdown on Sunday has broken the spread of COVID-19, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said on Tuesday after inspecting the Communicable Diseases Hospital at Tondiarpet. “As far as COVID-19 is concerned, due to the lockdown on Sunday, there is a break. This is a good signal. If we continue to wear masks and do not go to public places unnecessarily, we will soon be able to prevent the spread of the contagion,” he told reporters. With the cases falling in the last two days, “we can plateau or reduce” the number of infections, if people cooperated. Dr. Radhakrishnan urged people not to come out of their homes over the next few days and follow the restrictions. At many shops, air-conditioners were switched off. “In Tamil Nadu, we should be careful. We do not have such a high number of infections as in neighbouring States, but people should be careful because 30% of those diagnosed require hospitalisation,” he said. He said many people went directly to hospitals but the government followed the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization to triage patients. The procedure involved identifying people with symptoms and testing them. The Chennai Corporation had arranged for vehicles to transport people for testing. “The benefit is that when people get X-ray and blood profile done at one of the 12 screening centres in the city, they are segregated according to the severity of their condition. Please make full use of the screening centres,” he said. At a function organised by the Rotary Club of Madras at the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality on the Omandurar Government Estate to donate vehicles and equipment to store and transport vaccines, Dr. Radhakrishnan said the State had taken the “revolutionary” decision to sell Remdesivir directly to patients to prevent its sale on the black market from Gujarat to hospitals in the city. The drug is administered to patients who are on oxygen support. On complaints that there was a shortage of the drug, Dr. Radhakrishnan said it was sold only the basis of some documents issued by hospitals and the patient’s family. Furthermore, the Union government had given the State 59,000 doses for the period from April 21 to 30. The State had also written to the Centre, seeking more doses.  IMA’s appeal The Indian Medical Association’s Tamil Nadu State Branch has thanked the government for easing the procurement of Remdesivir. It has appealed for immediate arrangements for the sale of the drug in Tiruchi, Coimbatore, Madurai, Tirunelveli, Salem, Hosur, Nagercoil, Vellore and Dindigul.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/weekend-lockdown-has-broken-the-spread-health-secy/article34426977.ece

In a letter, Mr. Haasan urged party cadres to find out the needs of local hospitals and primary health care centres and extend help. He also said that people should not hesitate or fear to get themselves vaccinated. ‘No side effects’ “I have taken two doses already. I did not have any side effects. Reduce going out in public as much as possible and send young people in the house to buy essentials.

Mr. Haasan urged people not to share unsubstantiated reports on social media and support small businesses during this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/take-vaccines-without-fear-kamal/article34427016.ece

28 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||27-year-old recovers after sudden, near fatal cardiac arrest||Doctors at Kauvery Hospital have managed to help in saving the life of a 27-year-old, who suffered a cardiac arrest and was brought to the hospital beyond the window for return of spontaneous circulation. A release by the hospital said the young man, who suffered intense chest pain at home followed by a cardiac arrest, was brought to the hospital after 20 minutes with no signs of life. Highlighting that a sudden cardiac arrest generally resulted in irreversible damage to the brain and fatality if not treated within three to five minutes, the doctors said the team tried desperately to revive the person despite the grim prognosis. While receiving vigorous and continued cardiac resuscitation, he was put on ECMO (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenator) support to take care of the functions of the lung and heart and maintain blood flow to vital organs, said Manoj Sivaramakrishnan, senior interventional cardiologist at the hospital. With the patient remaining on ECMO support, angioplasty was successfully done to recanalise a 100% blocked artery and thereby restoring normal flow to the heart. “ECMO support was removed after three days and the young man sprung back to a normal conscious state with no trace of brain defect or paralysis,” he said. Though the patient suffered another heart attack after four days, it was successfully treated. “This gratifying outcome is very rare, and extremely challenging to cardiologists and emergency care physicians as every second delayed will lead to severe brain damage that will cause the patient to either remain in a state of coma for the rest of the life or die,” he said. He added that the case highlighted that timely resuscitation and ECMO supported resuscitation were crucial. “None should be sent away without immediately initiating life support resuscitation when brought with a history of a short period of unresponsiveness,” he added. Congratulating the doctors and the medical team, Aravindan Selvaraj, co-founder and executive director, Kauvery Hospital, said the case was a high benchmark to be achieved in the field of medicine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/27-year-old-recovers-after-sudden-near-fatal-cardiac-arrest/article34427383.ece
28 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A worrying signal from the Secretariat||An increase in COVID-19 cases among the employees of the Secretariat has become a cause for concern. A section of them wonders why the government has not deployed the staff in rotation as it did during the first wave last year. “Last year, when there was a spurt in the cases, the government decided to allow only 50% of the staff to go to offices. This year, a huge number of cases are reported every other day, but the government is yet to decide [on the rotation],” said G. Venkatesan, former secretary of Tamil Nadu Secretariat Association. Fresh cases among employees should be reported daily, he said. “The Health Department is issuing a bulletin [on the number of cases] every evening. Should not that be sufficient? The government should act before it is too late.” Mr. Venkatesan has submitted a representation to the government for deployment of the staff in rotation. An officer of the rank of Deputy Secretary at the Namakkal Kavignar Maaligai died of COVID-19 on Monday. This added to the employees’ anxiety. An official said: “About half of the fresh cases reported daily are from Chennai and neighbouring districts from where most of our employees commute to work.” Some of the departments at the Secretariat are cramped, and it will be a challenge to enforce physical distancing norms. “The Finance Department is a great example wherein one cannot reach his/her seat without coming in contact with others,” another official said. An Under-Secretary says that unlike other government offices, those at the Secretariat are important and wonders what will happen if a majority of the employees of a department test positive. In a communication sent on Monday to the authorities, Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan insisted that the standard operating procedure for offices would have to be followed strictly. “The SOP is only on paper. The government should implement it by opting for rotation of workers...,” an employee said. Public Department officials were not available for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-worrying-signal-from-the-secretariat/article34426972.ece

He was 53. The filmmaker was known for his films like Rettaisuzhi and Aan Devathai. Thamira, whose original name is Sheik Dawood, is survived by three sons and a daughter. Thamira began his career by assisting filmmakers K. Balachander and Bharathiraja. He made his directorial debut in 2010 with Rettaisuzhi , and cast both his mentors in the film in important roles.

Ramadoss on Tuesday criticised the Tamil Nadu government for keeping the Tasmac liquor stores open and demanded that the liquor stores be shut down to control the spread of COVID-19. In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said that liquor stores continue to be a major reason for the increase in infections and demanded its closure. “Puducherry has closed liquor outlets despite the fact that the sale of liquor is important for its economy. It is a daring decision. “Tamil Nadu government should also take similar measures and close liquor stores immediately,” he said. Dr. Ramadoss said that the night and Sunday lockdowns haven’t delivered results in the Tamil Nadu’s fight against the spread of COVID-19, which has resulted in shutting down of more businesses such as salons, restaurants, malls, cinemas, gyms and other places. “However, the liquor stores continue to function. It is not right for the government to think that COVID-19 will be spread in gyms and restaurants but not through liquor stores. It could be easily spread in the crowd. This should be avoided,” he said. Dr. Ramadoss said that keeping liquor stores open would lead to poor people spending money to buy liquor at a time when the economy is stumbling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-wants-all-liquor-outlets-closed/article34427012.ece

28 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Meet T.N.’s oxygen demand first’||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that the oxygen produced by the Sterlite Copper smelting factory in Thoothukudi was supplied to Tamil Nadu to fully meet the State’s requirements to treat COVID-19 patients. In a statement in Chennai, he said since the Supreme Court had given the Centre the responsibility of sharing oxygen, Mr. Modi should pay attention to the issue and ensure Tamil Nadu’s needs were fulfilled. “The Prime Minister’s office should issue guidelines to the officials of the ‘caretaker government’ [in Tamil Nadu]. No injustice should be caused to the State at the time of pandemic,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the demand for oxygen would increase as Chennai and other areas were recording more and more COVID-19 cases. “Other states should be given oxygen only after Tamil Nadu’s requirement is met,” he said. The DMK leader alleged that the Supreme Court had handed over the responsibility to the Centre because the State government had failed to argue before the court the decision taken in the all-party meeting. Mr. Stalin said the factory had been allowed to function only to manufacture oxygen and not for any other purpose. “Once the DMK is elected to power, the factory will be sealed after the period of temporary operation [to produce oxygen] is over,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/meet-tns-oxygen-demand-first/article34426970.ece

28 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Keep COVID-19 victims’ bodies in a secure facility’||A section of people working in the mortuary of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) have alleged that bodies of COVID-19 victims’ are often kept in the open at the back of the building. This may pose risk to the medical and non-medical staff, kin of deceased who come to receive body, and others who visit the premises, they say. A person, who works at the mortuary, told The Hindu that bodies of COVID-19 victims are kept on the floor at the backside of the building. As this is a common area from where bodies are loaded into ambulances, kin of persons who died of COVID-19 and other reasons come to the place. “We appeal to the administration to make arrangements to keep the bodies of COVID-19 victims in a secure facility and despatch them with more care. Entry of people to the despatch area should be restricted,” said the person on conditions of anonymity. Other than mortuary staff, doctors and kin of the deceased, the mortuary premises are often frequented by ambulance drivers. Police personnel also visit the place in the case of deaths involving medico-legal cases. A senior official of CMCH, however, differed with the charges and claimed that bodies of COVID-19 victims were kept in a secure place at the morgue. When the charges were taken to her attention, CMCH Dean A. Nirmala said that arrangements will be made for secure storage of the bodies of COVID-19 victims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/keep-covid-19-victims-bodies-in-a-secure-facility/article34427398.ece

The volunteers have so far helped to bury or cremate over 2,170 persons of different faiths. “Our volunteers helped in the burial or cremation of 1,820 persons who died of COVID-19 till March 31. More than 350 bodies were handled in April alone, till Monday,” says M. Mohamed Rafi, joint secretary of the medical wing. The TMMK started the service, seeing the reluctance of people to perform the last rites of their beloved ones who died of the contagion. The volunteers do not charge for their service. But the cost of the personal protective equipment they use and the cremation and burial charges are borne by the families of the deceased. “If a family is unable to bear these expenses, volunteers try to source money from sponsors,” Mr. Rafi says. The volunteers transport the body from the hospital to the burial ground or cemetery or crematorium. Religious rites are arranged by the kin of the deceased. In the case of cremation, they take the body to the crematorium and hand it over to the staff there. And in the case of burial, the volunteers themselves do the work. In the month of Ramzan, they are working in two shifts. Around 50% of the volunteers have taken the COVID-19 vaccine, Mr. Rafi says. Efforts are being made to get the others vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/public-service-in-times-of-fasting/article34426979.ece

The takeaway volume is not much as people visit star-rated hotels mainly for the ambience. With reduction in flight service and high number of cases, very few guests stay at hotels. The cost of maintenance is high as wages and electricity bill should be paid. Some hotels are also spending huge amounts on COVID-related precautions. Some of them have asked the back office staff to work from home. This is one of the sectors that is closed first when restrictions are announced and there is no government support too.

As of April 26, the city had 3,943 active cases – 2,962 in various hospitals or COVID Care Centres and 981 in home isolation. Given the wave, the number could go up in the city in the next few days and perhaps weeks, the sources said and added that though the district administration and Coimbatore Corporation was fully equipped to dealt with emergencies, the only way to control the spread was for people to follow COVID appropriate behaviour like wearing mask, washing hands and maintaining physical distance. The Corporation on its part had stepped up vaccination drive and sample collection. On Monday, it recorded 1.07 lakh take vaccine and collect 4,816 samples. It would continue to step up sample collection and hold more fever clinics, the sources said and appealed to people to attend camps if they experienced influenza like infection symptoms, take vaccination and follow all the State government guidelines.

Its president N. Murugesan said in a press release that major weaving centres, including Biwandi, Ichalkaranji, Malegaon, and Surat, are unable to procure yarn as the demand was very poor. Hence, stocks were piling with the mills for the last 20 days. “We request the government to liquidate our stock or facilitate us to liquidate all our yarn stocks,” he said.

28 April 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 restrictions hit sales at Gani market||The spike in COVID-19 cases and restrictions laid down by the State government to prevent spread of COVID-19 have led to shops witnessing poor sales at the E.K.M. Abdul Gani Textile Market (Gani Market) here on Tuesday. The market is visited by merchants from across the State as 740 shops function from Monday evening to Tuesday night while 320 shops function on all days. Brisk business Brisk business is usually witnessed before festival seasons as merchants purchase garments and other textile items in large quantities and sell them at retail rates in various districts. Due to the spread of COVID-19, the Corporation banned the functioning of weekly shops as merchants from other districts would visit in large numbers. Livelihood K. Selvaraj, president, Erode Gani Market Weekly Textile Trader’s Association, said closure of shops affected shopkeepers, merchants, vehicle operators and loadmen as they all had lost their livelihood. He said normal business was yet to be restored after last year’s lockdown and closing the shops again was causing huge losses to them. Though daily shops functioned as usual, sales was very low as only a few customers visited the shops and made purchases. “The spike in cases in the past four days is causing panic among people who are postponing their purchases,” said a trader. Also, the night curfew, fear of crowds and new restrictions were forcing people to stay indoors, the trader added. “Less than 20% sales took place on Tuesday,” a trader said. Shopkeepers said that they feared that the worst was yet to come which would be in the form of a total lockdown and wanted assistance from the government to overcome the loss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-restrictions-hit-sales-at-gani-market/article34427021.ece

28 April 2021||HOSUR,TAMIL NADU||With Karnataka going into lockdown, people return to T.N. on foot||The inter-State border at Zuzuvadi here on Tuesday saw a trickle of people walking in with their belongings before the total lockdown came into force in Karnataka. Two young women hailing from Tirupathur and employed in an information technology company at Whitefield decided to return home instead of spending money on their PG accommodation. “We have been working from home for the last one week. But with the lockdown, we will have to continue working from home. It made sense to go home to our parents rather than stay in Bengaluru and spend on food and accommodation,” said one of them, Shanti. However, fearing a rush out of Bengaluru, they packed their luggage and found a bus from Whitefield to Athibelle. With only a few buses running to Tamil Nadu and the last set of buses being subjected to the mandatory limit on the number of passengers, the two women had to walk a few kilometres from Athibelle into Tamil Nadu. Bus stand deserted The Hosur bus stand wore a desolate look, with hardly any bus to ferry people back from Karnataka. The various divisions of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation have already curtailed their services to Karnataka, making it difficult for the Tamil Nadu employees to return home.  ‘Rs. 750 for 3 km’ “There is physical distancing on buses, and no standing passengers are allowed. We were dropped off at Athibelle, and no buses would stop. Taxis were demanding Rs. 750 for 3 km, autorickshaws were charging Rs. 250. We had no choice but to walk,” said Shanti. On the border, autorickshaws and taxis overcharged commuters, leaving them with no option but to walk. With no town bus services arranged by the district administration to ferry the commuters from the border, the highway was dotted with people walking in with their luggage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/with-karnataka-going-into-lockdown-people-return-to-tn-on-foot/article34426967.ece
28 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TAMIL NADU||Novel antibody product cleared for clinical trials||‘VINCOV-19’ — a novel therapeutic antibody engineered product, which is a collaborative effort of the University of Hyderabad (UoH), CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and Vins Bioproducts Ltd, has got approval from the Drugs Controller General of India for clinical trials to test against COVID-19, on Tuesday. VINCOV-19 is an antibody product obtained after immunisation of horses with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in combination with adjuvants. The development of antibodies triggered in horses are purified and further processed to generate highly pure antibody fragment-based product — Fab2. Results have indicated this product has a high neutralising capacity against SARS-CoV-2. Since neutralising antibodies could block the internalisation of SARS-CoV-2 to lung cells, it is postulated that their passive administration should render maximum clinical benefits if applied at an early stage, said a spokesman of UoH. Pre-clinical trials for VINCOV-19, which began in October last year, were highly successful, showing potent virus neutralising capability. The next phase of trials will involve over 300 COVID patients across the country for examining the safety and efficacy of the antibodies. The clinical plan is to administer VINCOV-19 to patients with moderate to severe disease according to the published COVID-19 treatment guidelines as soon as they are detected positive. This reinforces the idea that the therapeutic strategy, with equine antibodies, will play a significant role in managing COVID, said the release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/novel-antibody-product-cleared-for-clinical-trials/article34426844.ece

28 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Demand for oxygen, beds up||There has been a rise in demand for oxygen support for COVID-19 positive patients during the second wave as compared to last year. Data obtained from the health department shows that nearly 40% beds in government hospitals and 28% beds in private hospitals with oxygen support have been occupied as at 8 p.m. on April 26. Doctors say that they could see more positive patients with lung involvement due to the coronavirus infections. This increases the requirement for oxygen support, they say. Government Rajaji Hospital Dean J. Sangumani said that there was sufficient quantum of oxygen available at the hospital. Last year, initially the hospital had an oxygen capacity of 6,000 litres. It was increased to 20,000 litres last year. "Currently, the hospital has the capacity to store up to 26,000 litres of oxygen," he said.At present, around 10,000 litres of oxygen is used in the hospital every day. Dr. Sangumani said that a separate committee has been formed in the hospital to monitor the availability and usage of oxygen by the patients. The hospital even has a high-flow nasal cannula to provide oxygen support to the patients, he added. There are a total of 44 private hospitals in Madurai that were treating COVID-19 positive patients. The data shows that 203, out of 706 beds with oxygen support available in private hospitals were occupied by patients as at 8 p.m. on April 26. Varun Ramamurthy, Consultant Intensivist, Corona Care team, Velammal Medical College Hospital and Research Institute, said that the oxygen requirement in the hospital has increased by three times to 2,000 litres per day.

28 April 2021||PERAMBALUR,TAMIL NADU||Maintain COVID-19 protocols during these difficult times, Chief Justice tells legal fraternity||Chief Justice of the Madras High Court Justice Sanjib Banerjee on Tuesday inaugurated the District Munsif -Cum-Judicial Magistrate Court at Kunnam in Perambalur district through video conference from Chennai. In his presidential address, Justice Sanjib Banerjee said the Bar and the Bench were the two sides of the same coin. There was a physical aspect to access to justice that was being fulfilled by creating the infrastructure. “But, the more wholesome access to justice was how we deal with the litigants and others who we are to serve,” Justice Sanjib Banerjee observed. When the number of cases at a particular court complex exceeded, new courts had to be created in due course amid burgeoning population and with people realising their rights. Investigation was a specialised field. In several cases, the judiciary had to let off criminals despite there being a perception that the offence might have been committed by the person because of inadequate investigation or inadequate material. “When we criticise the police for not bringing adequate material, it must also be realised the lack of resources and the difficult constraints in which they function,” he further observed. These were difficult times and public health was of paramount importance. It was only the people at the bottom who suffered and perished when natural calamities struck. He appealed to lawyers to cooperate and work together with the bench during these difficult times and ensure “how we could deliver justice to everybody”. He appealed to the participants to maintain COVID-19 protocols during these difficult times. Special addresses were delivered by Justice T.V. Thamilselvi, Judge, Madras High Court and Portfolio Judge for Perambalur district and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana, Judge, Madras High Court and Portfolio Judge for Perambalur district.

28 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Focus shifts to early hospitalisation of patients||The administration is redoubling its efforts to ensure early hospitalisation of COVID-19 patients to reverse the rising mortality graph that has seen 43 deaths being reported in a span of just four days. Since April 15, there have been 73 COVID-19 deaths in the Union Territory, of which 43 have occurred in the four days since April 22. While between April 15 and 23, the Union Territory had been averaging between one and five deaths every day, the highest single-day fatalities came on April 27 (13), April 26 (10), April 25 (11) and April 24 (9). To illustrate how quickly the fatality count has risen, consider that the cumulative toll in the Union Territory, which stood at 699 on April 15, has swelled to 771 in less than two weeks. “We have directed the PHCs to ramp up the field presence of ASHA workers and ANMs to detect and triage symptomatic patients to make a determination between hospitalisation and home isolation,” said T. Arun, Health Secretary. Age, co-morbidity and late diagnosis and hospitalisation were still the primary drivers of a majority of COVID-19 deaths in the Union Territory, he said. “Unlike in some other States, we fortunately have adequate admission capacity, including ventilators and oxygen beds. We are also putting on standby about 20 medium-sized private hospitals and nursing homes to cope with a situation of higher hospital admissions,” Mr. Arun said. This would make available 837 beds, 845 oxygen beds, 34 ventilators and 67 ICU beds, in addition to the 200 oxygen beds that six private medical colleges have been asked to earmark for COVID-19 patients. Case count The administration has also ramped up focused testing around hotspots and micro-containment zones to increase detection rates.  On Tuesday, Puducherry accounted for all the 13 deaths reported in the Union Territory, even as fresh cases touched a new single-day high of 1,021. With this, the cumulative toll in Puducherry rose to 620, followed by Karaikal (90), Yanam (48) and Mahe (13). The new cases, which were confirmed from 6,502 tests, were reported from Puducherry (781), Karaikal (108) and Mahe (59). No new case was reported from Yanam. The test positivity rate was 15.70%, the case fatality rate 1.40% and the recovery rate 84.38%. With 690 patients recovering in the last 24 hours, the active cases aggregated 7,828. Of these, 1,522 were in hospitals and 6,306 in home isolation. The cumulative caseload stood at 55,047, of which 46,448 patients have recovered so far. The bed occupancy position was: JIPMER (254), IGMCRI (315) and COVID Care Centres (721). Of an estimated 7.73 lakh tests conducted till date by the Health Department, over 6.95 lakh returned negative. Meanwhile, 195 healthcare workers, 90 frontline staff and 784 members of the public took their first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine in the last 24 hours. The aggregate of persons vaccinated in the Union Territory stood at 1,87,641, including 31,491 healthcare workers, 18,473 frontline personnel and 1,15,536 members of the public. “The enthusiasm for vaccination among people above 45 years of age seems to have tapered off in recent days. We are looking to motivate more volunteers for vaccination as that is the only weapon against the pandemic,” a health official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/focus-shifts-to-early-hospitalisation-of-patients/article34427597.ece
28 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Take action against those illegally selling Remdesivir at high price, demands CPI(M)||The CPI(M) has urged Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to initiate steps to stop the fleecing of critically ill patients, who require Remdesivir, by some private institutions. In a memorandum, R. Rajangam, CPI(M) secretary, said that Remdesivir which is an essential drug in treating COVID-19 to reduce mortality rate in critical patients for which the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority had reset the prices from Rs. 2,800-5,400 to Rs. 899-3,490 for a single dose. “We observe that Remdesivir is stocked at the required levels in designated public health institutions in Puducherry. However, their accessibility to patients at private healthcare facilities is limited. This has resulted in an artificial shortage of the life-saving drug leading to the creation of a ‘black market’ for this drug,” Mr. Rajangam said. The CPI(M) leader also complained that the price of this drug outside of official channels was around Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000 or more for a single dose. As per expert recommendations, around 5-6 doses of this drug are required for every patient in need of the drug, thus leaving the price at Rs. 45,000 to Rs. 60,000 for full course when obtained through unofficial channels. “This is nothing short of extortion by the private healthcare institutions. We demand the Lt. Governor to take all necessary action to immediately stop and prevent the sale of Remdesivir and all COVID-19 related medicines through unofficial, illegal channels,” the memorandum said. Though there is a procedure through which every patient at private healthcare institutions can avail of the life-saving drug from public healthcare institutions at the prescribed price, the general public and critical care patients are not aware of this route in Puducherry.  ‘Popularise procedure’ The leader urged the Lt. Governor to take action to create awareness among the people on the prescribed prices for Remdesivir via all possible communication medium and of the due process required to avail of the medicine from public healthcare institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/take-action-against-those-illegally-selling-remdesivir-at-high-price-demands-cpim/article34427595.ece

28 April 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Salem GH to increase bed strength for COVID-19 treatment||The Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital is planning to increase bed strength for COVID-19 treatment. The hospital is the tertiary care centre for COVID-19 treatment and the hospital also caters to patients from neighbouring districts like Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Kalakurichi. At present, it has 650 beds for COVID-19 treatment and is working on increasing bed strength, considering the increase in the number of patients. R. Murugeshan, dean of the hospital said, “There is sufficient bed strength at the hospital and it has not filled up yet. As many as 650 beds have been arranged in which 550 beds have oxygen supply and over 70 beds have ventilator facilities. However, considering the increase in cases, 300 beds are being set up additionally. Oxygen supply for these beds will be ensured through portable cylinders.” Dr. Murugeshan said there was sufficient medical oxygen supply for the hospital and there was not any shortage at present. A 35,000-litre medical oxygen plant was installed by the end of 2020 at the hospital, ensuring supply of medical oxygen for COVID-19 treatment. According to doctors, the tank was filled once the stock drops to 40% and considering the current scenario, 70% stock was always maintained at the plant. The hospital had also stocked oxygen cylinders for COVID-19 treatment. He also said in the second wave, compared to the first, a significant number of young persons were getting affected and advised the public to adhere to COVID-19 safety protocols.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/salem-gh-to-increase-bed-strength-for-covid-19-treatment/article34427023.ece

28 April 2021||Staff Reporter UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Fire breaks out in Ooty dumpyard||A fire broke out at the Theetukkal dumpyard in Udhagamandalam on late Monday night, leading to a haze of acrid smoke hanging around the dumpyard and surrounding residential areas. According to officials from the fire and rescue service in Udhagamandalam station, it was believed that the fire was caused by malfunctioning of the incinerator used to burn hazardous waste at the dumpyard. The fire broke out at around 8 p.m. on Monday and quickly spread around the dumpyard, with the fire visible from many parts of Udhagamandalam town. Two fire tenders and ten water trucks were pressed into service along with more than a dozen firemen to battle the blaze. Fire-fighters battled the fire throughout the night to bring it under control. G. Ravi Kumar, Station Fire Officer, Udhagamandalam, said that the fire had finally been brought under control on Tuesday. “We managed to save lakhs worth of equipment due to timely action,” said Mr. Ravi Kumar. Local residents living near the dumpyard said that smoke from the fire meant that many people were reporting breathing difficulties. “For years local residents have demanded that the dumpyard be permanently closed down. Though there is considerably less open dumping of waste at the dump yard for the last few years, it remains a hazard to local residents and to wildlife living in the forests surrounding the dumpyard,” said M. Banumathi, a resident of one of the houses located near the dumpyard. Officials from the fire department said that there were no injuries reported as a result of the fire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fire-breaks-out-in-ooty-dumpyard/article34427387.ece
28 April 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||Theni has sufficient oxygen in hospitals||Oxygen is sufficiently available at the hospitals and there was no need for panic, said Collector H. Krishnanunni here on Tuesday. Presiding over a review meeting, attended by Superintendent of Police E Sai Charan Tejaswi, DRO K Ramesh, Sub-Collector D Sneha, he said that the containment zones required high surveillance by the officials. ‘We have to ensure that the people in the containment zones stayed indoors,’ he said. Farmers’ markets would be shifted to spacious locations.

28 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Researchers find two damselfly species||Never ceasing to surprise, the biodiversity-rich Western Ghats has thrown up more odonate species. Researchers from Thiruvananthapuram and Mumbai have collaborated to discover two damselfly species from Satara district in Maharashtra, which forms part of northern Western Ghats. The new endemic damsels, Euphaea thosegharensis and Euphaea pseudodispar , belonging to the genus Euphaea , were discovered by a team comprising Sriram Bhakare, Pratima Pawar and Sunil Bhoite from Mumbai and Kalesh Sadasivam and Vinayan Nair representing the Thiruvananthapuram-based Travancore Nature History Society. The specimens were spotted by Dr. Bhakare in May 2020 at Thoseghar in Satara district. Prior to the findings, only three endemic species of Euphaea were known from Western Ghats. These include Euphaea fraseri, a very common species in the forested foothills of Western Ghats and is found from Kanyakumari to Maharashtra; Euphaea dispar, which is restricted to the north of the Palakkad Gap from South Kanara and Coorg to Nilgiris; and E uphaea cardinalis, a montane species found south of the Palakkad Gap in Anamalais, Palnis and Agasthyamalai Hills. Superficial similarity  Euphaea thosegharensis is similar to Euphaea cardinalis , while Euphaea pseudodispar is similar to Euphaea dispar but can be easily separated by its colouration and morphology. They are restricted to the high elevation streams and riparian patches of Satara district around Thoseghar and Kaas lake in Maharashtra. The discoveries have been published in the recent issue of Journal of Threatened Taxa . According to Dr. Sadasivan, the species could have been overlooked for long due to their superficial similarity to other Euphaea species. Dr. Bhakare, whose keen eye led to the discovery, called for more systematic surveys of odonates in northern Western Ghats.  Prior to the findings, only three endemic species of Euphaea were known from Western Ghats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/researchers-find-two-damselfly-species/article34426861.ece

Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order) Jayant Murali has camped in Thoothukudi, along with other police officers, to monitor the security provided in the district, especially near the Sterlite Copper premises in the SIPCOT Industrial Complex and the Collectorate and in the villages whose residents had taken part in the protests. “Around 600 policemen have been deployed, along with water cannons and tear-gas vehicles,” said a police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thoothukudi-comes-under-tight-security/article34426942.ece
28 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||No decision yet on ‘work from home’ option for government school teachers||Teachers of government and government-aided schools continue to register their attendance at their institutions, much against popular opinion in the wake of government instructions on keeping the schools closed for students. Now that the practical exams have been completed for Plus Two students, only teachers register their attendance on a daily basis, and are required to sit through the entire day and reach out to students of lower classes by phone to ensure their viewing of the teaching sessions on bridge-course telecast through the Kalvi TV channel, run by the school education department. “here is no instruction from the government as yet on whether the teachers could work from home,” an official said. Citing the rise in COVID infection among their fraternity, teachers' associations approached government authorities for permission to work from home, but were reportedly told that their request could not be complied with since they had remained at home for most part of the academic year. Those handling higher secondary classes are trying their best to keep the students engaged through online classes, the official said. Last year, the Department of School Education, in its guidelines for digital/ online education, has mentioned the requirement for computer/smart phone/smart TV for fully online mode; availability of computer/smart phone even without regular Internet connectivity for partially online mode; and television and radio as offline mode for those in places where the bandwidth is very less for operating smart devices. The concept ofVeetupalli(school at home) envisages telecast of video lessons as per time table through Kalvi TV run by the School Education Department. For students of Plus Two, the video lessons prepared by SCERT have been transferred to their laptops through hi-tech labs in schools to facilitate learning at home. Video lessons are also made available through private TV channels from last August. Teachers, as per the guidelines, are required to have individual rapport with students. School heads are expected to conduct an informal survey to identify ICT facilities at home for each child, for analysis by teachers in order to create differentiated plans, official sources said. School heads are also expected to facilitate ICT infrastructure for teachers, but they seldom do that, a representative of a teachers' association complained. Class-wise instant messaging groups have been formed for smooth communication with teachers, parents and students. For lower classes, the parents communicate on behalf of students. Rather than rushing for the sake of completing of syllabus, focus on consolidation of learning has been advocated, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-decision-yet-on-work-from-home-option-for-government-school-teachers/article34426951.ece

Our focus is on not just on contract tracing but also bringing all patients to COVID care centres,” says S. Ram Ganesh, Deputy Director, Health Services, Tiruchi. As far as Thottiyam is concerned, a temple festival held in a village about 14 days ago has become a reason for the spread of the virus to the people of a few villages. About 30 persons tested positive from a cluster. Some of the persons, who tested positive, have gone to neighbouring villages in Namakkal district to escape hospitalisation. However, most of them have been traced and brought to COVID care centres. The cases will further go up for a few more days as testing has been increased. A total of 5,700 samples have been lifted on Monday. It will be increased to 6,000 a day. For every 1,000 samples, 60 to 70 persons are turning out to be positive, Dr. Ganesh said.

28 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Tirunelveli records 690 cases||The district, for the first time ever since the pandemic outbreak in March 2020, clocked 690 cases on Tuesday. The district has so far lost 230 lives to the viral infection. Only about 40% of the people properly wear masks and maintain physical distancing while coming out of their houses. “The number of teams booking violators should be increased. Only stringent enforcement of laws can check the increase in cases. The present fine of Rs. 200 for not wearing mask should be increased five times. Only then the violators will start following the norms,” said a Sub-Inspector of Police. Following the sharp rise in COVID-19 positive cases in the past few days, the corporation indefinitely closed the weekly cattle market at Melapalayam, which would be held on every Tuesday to witness a sale of cattle to the tune of several lakhs of rupees. The authorities, who tied a flex banner announcing the indefinite closure of the market, asked those who had brought cows, bulls, goats, sheep and country chickens to leave the place. “Since the people coming to the cattle market for buying or selling the cattle never wear masks or maintain physical distancing, the weekly market has been closed indefinitely. It will start functioning again only when the situation improves substantially,” said officials. Thoothukudi Collector K. Senthil Raj has announced that everyone entering the counting centre on May 2 should have undergone the test for COVID-19 within 72 hours and submit the certificate for getting entry passes.

28 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Plan to distribute food packets||The corporation, which fed over 700 homeless during the complete lockdown on April 24 after preparing the food in its ‘Amma Unavagam,’ has planned to cover more number of people during the lockdown on coming Sunday also. “This number includes the patients undergoing treatment in the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital and their attendants,” said G. Kannan, Corporation Commission. Though the corporation’s finances are not so healthy, it fed the homeless during the complete lockdown between April and June last year until ruling AIADMK’s Tirunelveli district secretary N. Ganesa Raja took the responsibility of giving free ‘food tokens’ of Amma Unavagam to the roofless until the situation improved. When the government announced about the lockdown on Sundays, the corporation, sensing the predicament of the homeless, prepared food for around 700 persons and took them in a few autorickshaws to all the places under its jurisdiction in search of the homeless. “Wherever we could find the homeless sitting on the roadside or in the bus-shelters, we stopped the autorickshaw and served them food, water and some biscuits. We’ve planned to continue the exercise during all Sundays whenever lockdown is imposed,” said Mr. Kannan.  Since all the eateries around the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital remained closed during the lockdown on last Sunday, the food served by the Corporation became a much-needed solace for the in-patients of TVMCH, mostly COVID-19 positive cases and their attendants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plan-to-distribute-food-packets/article34426985.ece
28 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Kin of youth killed in prison demand CBI probe||Demanding a CBI probe into the murder of remand prisoner Muthu Mano inside Palayamkottai Central Prison on Thursday last and registration of a murder case against prison staff “for failing to prevent the crime”, the family of the deceased continues the protest at his native place Vagaikulam near Moontradaippu along with members of various Dalit outfits. “Until our demands are met, we’ll not accept the body,” said the protesters, who observed a fast on Tuesday. Muthu Mano and his associates A. Chandrasekar, 22, and M. Murugesan, 19, both from Pottaiyadi, and S. Kannan, 23, of Bethania were arrested on April 8 for allegedly attempting to murder an 18-year-old boy from a village near Panagudi and his elder brother in a secluded place near Kalakkad after the boy’s girlfriend asked the duo to come to the spot with Rs. 25,000. The girl was also booked by the police in this case. The police seized country-made bombs and four machetes from the foursome. After being remanded in judicial custody, they were lodged in Srivaikundam sub-jail from where they were shifted to the Palayamkottai prison on Thursday. Even as they were being sent to their cells after the formalities were completed at the prison entrance, a group of prisoners attacked Muthu Mano and the others. While Muthu Mano, who is already facing criminal cases registered in Kalakkad, Murappanadu and a few more police stations, sustained a grievous head injury and was rushed to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, the others received treatment at the prison hospital. As Muthu Mano suffered a severe blood loss, he died at the hospital in the evening. Subsequently, Perumalpuram police arrested seven prison inmates – Jacob, Ramamurthy and Maharajan of Thazhaiyoothu, Madasamy and Kumar of Pallikottai and Kannan and Arunkumar of Velloor near Srivaikundam – for allegedly murdering Muthu Mano. Prison staff Sankarasubbu, Gangadharan, Sam Albert, Vadivel Murugaiah, Anantharaj and Sivan were placed under suspension for failing to prevent the crime. The relatives of Muthu Mano and the members of Dalit outfits who are participating in the sit-in protest and hunger strike in Vagaikulam said the police should also name Palayamkottai Central Jail officials present near the scene of crime as ‘accused’ in the murder of an inmate. “Since the CB-CID probe will not bring out the truth and the circumstances that led to the murder of Muthu Mano inside the prison, we demand a CBI probe,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kin-of-youth-killed-in-prison-demand-cbi-probe/article34427642.ece

28 April 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Pandya-era stone structure with inscriptions found in Udumalpet||Archaeological enthusiasts from Tiruppur recently discovered in a small temple near Udumalpet a Pandya-era stone structure containing inscriptions, which is estimated to be over 700 years old. A team from Virarajendran Archaeological and Historical Research Centre, led by its director S. Ravikumar, found the stone structure at Ganapathipalayam village near Udumalpet on April 14. Mr. Ravikumar said the stone structure bore the image of Sundarar, one of the 63 Nayanars, which was evident as a crocodile was seen sculpted below his image. The crocodile denotes the folklore of Sundarar praying to Lord Shiva at Avinashi to save a boy, who was stuck in the mouth of a crocodile, he said. The inscription on one of the four sides of the structure had 15 Tamil lines, Mr. Ravikumar said. Based on consultations with senior historians Y. Subbarayalu and R. Poongundran, the team deciphered the inscription, which referred to the Ganapathipalayam village by its older name ‘Perur Karuva Nallur’ and warned that misuse of ‘devathana’ or properties donated to temples would amount to a sin that would plague seven generations, he said. The third side of the structure bore the royal insignia of Pandya dynasty – two upright fishes and a hook in between – and the fourth side had a trisulam (holy trident). Based on the inscription, it was estimated that the structure must have been sculpted in the later part of the 13th Century. “Back then, this stone structure must have been the equivalent of a government order,” Mr. Ravikumar said. The structure could have been placed at the given location after the Pandya kings donated a piece of land to the Lingeshwarar Temple at Avinashi.

Innocent Divya handed over vegetables and provisions to roadside vendors, who have been hit by the new restrictions, here on Tuesday.

As a first step towards assisting them, vegetables as well as other essential items for the household were handed over to 100 vendors. “The vegetables were given voluntarily by local farmers, while residents can come forward to voluntarily donate provisions that will be handed over to people who have been hardest hit by the new restrictions,” said the Collector. Pradeep, one of the beneficiaries, said that many vendors were afraid that the ban on tourism would lead to long-term effects on their livelihoods. “We have been appealing to the government to help financially.

28 April 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||VCK slams SC nod for oxygen production at Sterlite plant||Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) president Thol. Thirumavalavan on Tuesday said the Supreme Court verdict permitting production of medical oxygen at Vedanta’s sealed Sterlite Copper plant was against the interest and welfare of Tamils. Speaking to reporters in Villupuram, Mr. Thirumavalavan said State government had also failed to project its actual requirement of medical oxygen before the apex court. All the details the government had furnished to the Centre were not placed before the Supreme Court, he said. “The Centre on the one hand was claiming that there was no shortage of oxygen as it had sufficient stock. Then why did it come forward for the production of oxygen in the closed Sterlite plant? This must be properly explained to the people,” he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said the State government had been contending that its requirement was 450 tonnes of oxygen while the production was 400 tonnes, resulting in shortage of 50 tonnes. The government convened the all-party meeting in a hurried manner only to ensure that the DMK was also made a party to the decision, he charged. ‘Disappointing verdict’ The Supreme Court had also announced that the Centre would constitute a committee to monitor the whole production process. This was disappointing as the committee members would be nominated by the Centre, he said. “The production of oxygen could have been entrusted to major public sector undertakings including the NLCIL, and the BHEL. “Further Vedanta had its plants in several parts of the country. But why did the company prefer Tamil Nadu for producing oxygen in a factory that has remained closed? “The discrepancies in the approach have exposed the inner motive of the Centre and the State government,” he said. The Centre was planning to divert the oxygen from the State to the Central pool. The State government had also remained mum without raising its voice, he charged. So this was going to cause immense hardship to the people and the State, he added. Villupuram MP D. Ravikumar was present at the conference. Free vaccines Meanwhile, at a press meet in Chennai, the VCK leader said the Union government should provide vaccines free for all and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take responsibility for the deaths due to shortage of oxygen, medicines and lack of medical infrastructure. “Free vaccines should be available to all and Union government should ensure it. The cost of vaccines makes it inaccessible to the poor and selling it at differential price are the reason why more people are not coming forward to vaccinate themselves,” he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan charged that Union government had paved the way for pharma companies to earn ‘massive profits’ by creating an artificial shortage and demanded that steps be taken to ensure vaccines cost the same across India. He said transporting oxygen through cylinders and vehicles was the problem and demanded that Tamil Nadu be prioritised for the oxygen produced in Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vck-slams-sc-nod-for-oxygen-production-at-sterlite-plant/article34427014.ece

The move assumes importance in the wake of a steep rise in number of positive cases in Tiruchi over the last three weeks. The management of Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam, which owns the facility situated on 6.40 acres, has made it available to quarantine, asymptomatic and mildly infected patients. After the city campus of Bharathidasan University at Khajamalai and Government College of Engineering at Sethurapatti, which served as COVID care centres in March last, were converted ino care centres again, opinion was divided on using Yatri Nivas, a popular pilgrim guest house, for treating COVID-19 patients. However, according to sources, the steep surge in cases has forced the district administration to bring the facility under its control to accommodate patients again. The move is perceived as a compassionate and much-needed step in protecting the lives of people against the COVID-19. Yatri Nivas has been handed over to the district administration to accommodate patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19, S. Marimuthu, Joint Commissioner, Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam, told The Hindu . A portion of the facility, mainly dormitory block, has been opened for patients. It can be used until the situation improves. “We as temple administrators cannot shy away from our responsibility when people are facing an unprecedented crisis. Hence, the facility has been opened up for mildly infected patients,” Mr. Marimuthu said. A group of staff members, including electricians and plumbers, have been posted to offer help. Online and offline booking have been suspended from April 25. Pilgrims, who have booked rooms for the next three to four months, have been intimated about the new arrangements and they will be refunded. A senior revenue official says the guesthouse will start admitting patients from Wednesday. All arrangements have been made, including 500 new beds, for patients. The facility has sufficient number of toilets as well as facilities for visitors. A 20-member group, including doctors, nurses and paramedical staff members, have been allotted duty at Yatri Nivas. Tiruchi Corporation will take care of the maintenance of the premises. Two Tahsildars have been posted for duty at the venue. The Yatri Nivas, built at a cost of Rs. .47 crore on 6.40 acres on Panchakarai on the banks of the Kollidam, was inaugurated by then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in 2014. It can accommodate about 1,000 devotees. The facility has 612 single rooms, 98 double rooms and 24 family cottages. It was aimed at providing budget accommodation to devotees visiting Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple from across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/srirangams-yatri-nivas-turns-into-covid-care-centre-again/article34426953.ece

The canal always enjoys priority when it comes to maintenance and release of water for irrigation from Grand Anicut. Maintaining that they are not protesting or condemning the department’s ‘affinity’ towards Grand Anicut Canal, members of Vennar-Vadavar Protection Association have demanded that the Public Works Department exhibit similar interest in protecting the river system, which remains the lifeline for around 15,000 acres along the 29-km-long Vadavar. ‘Prepare DPR’ In a memorandum submitted to the Executive Officer ofVennar Basin Division here on Tuesday, the association has called upon the Public Works Department to prepare a detailed project (DPR) report for desilting and renovation of the river system and construction of check dams at Melakalakkudi, Annathottam, Thennansolai and other villages to help improve groundwater level. Vadavar is being used as a drain for sewage generated in Thanjavur town.

28 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Shanmukhappa Sidnal, former MP, passes away||The former Lok Sabha member from Belagavi Shanmukhappa Basappa Sidnal died in Belagavi on Tuesday. The four-time MP died of age-related causes, his family sources said. He was 86. The veteran Congressman represented Belagavi in the Lok Sabha from 1980 to 1996. He was a trusted follower of the former Prime Minister late Indira Gandhi and a close friend of veteran leader B. Shankaranand.

28 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Provide financial aid to people hit by lockdown’||TheOpposition Congress on Tuesday demanded the immediate announcement of a relief package for those adversely affected by the lockdown, as well as a waiver of interest on loans of up to Rs. 10 lakh and moratorium on repayment of loans for two years. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar said the government should announce a financial package and deposit money in the accounts of the poor who will be hit with no sources of income during the 14-day period. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah held both the Union and State governments responsible for the rise in COVID-19 cases and demanded that the State government provide 10 kg of rice and Rs. 10,000 in cash to all those affected. Mr. Shivakumar and 50 other senior leaders of the State Congress held a virtual conference with All-India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in charge of Karnataka, Randeep Surjewala, and decided to establish a State-level COVID-19 centre in Bengaluru. Mr. Surjewala suggested to Mr. Siddaramaiah and Mr. Shivakumar to write to the Chief Minister demanding the immediate announcement of a financial package for the poor and needy. For establishing the COVID-19 centre, the party would involve its leaders who have been running hospitals in different districts, the KPCC chief said. Senior leaders such as G. Parameshwara, M.B. Patil, and Shamanur Shivashankarappa have been running hospitals in different districts. The Congress had opposed the lockdown since it would affect the livelihood of lakhs of people such as daily wage workers, garment workers, and street vendors. Though experts had alerted the government about the likely arrival of a second wave of COVID-19 last November, the government turned a deaf ear to their suggestions and did not show any preparedness for pandemic management, Mr. Siddaramaiah said. ‘Citizens abandoned’ During the interaction, Mr. Surjewala criticised the B.S. Yediyurappa-led BJP government for creating an “alarming situation” in Bengaluru city, which has been facing a shortage of beds, ICU beds, and medicines for COVID-19 patients. “The BJP government has abdicated its responsibilities and abandoned the people of Bengaluru and Karnataka,” he said. He also asked the State Congress leaders to open a helpline for providing support for patients and to distribute food packages to the poor, PPE kits for doctors, and hand sanitisers to small shop owners. He told leaders to ensure the availability of a team of doctors for providing consultation to patients over telephone. During the interaction, Mr. Shivakumar blamed the government for not supplying oxygen and Remdesivir to private hospitals run by the Congress leaders. The government has been controlling the supply of drugs and oxygen, he alleged. Senior leaders M. Mallikarjun Kharge, K.H. Muniyappa, Jairam Ramesh, S.R. Patil, Dinesh Gundu Rao, M. Veerappa Moily, Margaret Alva, B.L. Shankar, Ramalinga Reddy, and others participated in the discussion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/provide-financial-aid-to-people-hit-by-lockdown/article34427063.ece
28 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Doctors divided over use but scramble for Remdesivir continues||The scramble for Remdesivir, the anti-viral drug used in COVID-19 management, is increasing by the day even as doctors are divided on its use. While a few doctors are of the opinion that not all require this drug, many say it hastens recovery and helps bring down the viral load if given early. With demand exceeding supply, families of patients admitted in private hospitals are under great distress. While the government is supplying the drug to patients admitted under government quota, many hospitals are asking the families of others to procure it on their own. Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) president H.M. Prasanna said that the helpline set up by the government is of little use. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said nearly 85% of positive patients do not require Remdesivir. Pointing out that the drug helps in reducing viral load, he said there is faster clinical improvement and hospital stay is also reduced. “But there is no mortality benefit. According to treatment guidelines, this drug is not advisable for mild cases. However, there is a growing feeling among people that every patient needs this. Most doctors are prescribing this due to pressure from patient families,” Dr. Manjunath said. Consultant pulmonologist at Apollo Hospitals Ravindra Mehta, who is part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said panic is unnecessary as not all require this injection. “Only those with moderate and severe infection wherein the oxygen saturation drops below 93 within the first nine days of illness are eligible for Remdesivir. It is only an add-on therapy and can help in improving the patient’s condition. While the WHO says it does not impact mortality, previous literature has shown that it can hasten recovery and reduce hospital stay,” he said. The demand can be reduced if it is given to only those who require it, he added. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the war room with helpline (8951755722) set up for Remdesivir and oxygen supply is now being scaled up with up to 50 staff and will operate 24/7 in three shifts. Guidelines for use “The Union Health Ministry in association with AIIMS and ICMR has formulated new guidelines for clinical management of COVID-19 patients. These guidelines recommend usage of Remdesivir only in certain cases and stage of severity. To create awareness, we have conducted an online workshop for all doctors through RGUHS. I urge all doctors to go through these guidelines and avoid indiscriminate prescription and use of Remdesivir,” the Minister added.  Only those with moderate and severe infection wherein the oxygen saturation drops below 93 within the first nine days of illness are eligible for Remdesivir. It is only an add-on therapy and can help in improving the patient’s condition.

28 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC asks RTCs to expeditiously decide on employee appeals||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the four public road transport corporations (RTCs) in the State to expeditiously decide on the appeal against the suspension of over 3,000 employees in connection with the recent strike. The court allowed the Karnataka State Transport Employees’ League (KSTEL) to file common appeals for each division of the RTCs on behalf of the suspended employees of that particular division. It asked the RTCs to ensure that the appellate authorities decide on such appeals within two weeks. In the case of dismissed employees, the court said the appellate authorities should decide on the pleas against their dismissal within two months. On those transferred to different divisions following the strike, the court said the employees and the league can submit representations against the transfer and they should be decided on within 10 days. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the direction after the State government and the RTCs said they were prepared to consider sympathetically if the suspended employees were to file appeals against suspension. In the case of dismissed employees, the RTCs told the court that appeal against dismissal required proper proceedings as some of the employees were dismissed on serious charges such as assault and preventing other employees from attending to duty, and not on the basis of mere participation in the strike. On the demands of the KSTEL, including wage revision as per the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations, the court said it would not go into the legalities of these issues at present and might refer the issue for mediation by appointing a retired judge of the High Court if the government, the RTCs, and the union were not able to resolve the issue. Earlier, the Advocate General told the court that the government had almost made it clear that it was not possible to pay wages in terms of the Sixth Pay Commission, and the issue was pending adjudication under the Industrial Disputes Act. On the other hand, the RTCs told the court that a group of employees had resorted to the strike when a reconciliation process was under way as per the law.

28 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Early start for liquor shops||Perhaps for the first time in Karnataka, liquor vending units will officially be kept open from 6 a.m. from Wednesday till May 12. Till now, liquor outlets were allowed to open only at 10 a.m., even though several of them operated illegally early in the morning, Following the implementation of strict restrictions during the curfew period, the liquor outlets, along with stores dealing with essential commodities, will be open for a four-hour window in the morning. On Tuesday, the government issued orders allowing liquor outlets to open for takeaway between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. The Karnataka State Beverages Corporation, which supplies liquor, has been asked to function accordingly. “In my four decades of liquor business, this is the first time that the government has officially allowed liquor outlets to open at 6 a.m.,” said Govindraj Hegde, Karnataka secretary of the Federation of Wine Merchants Associations. Though the liquor industry expects business to be dull for a while, industry representatives have a heaved a sigh of relief. “Something is better than nothing for the industry, which was completely shut for more than 40 days during the last lockdown. This will help the government maintain its revenue more than the license holder doing good business,” he said. As per the order, the outlets will be open only between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. for takeaway, and bars will be allowed to sell sealed bottles at MRP rate. Wine taverns and wine boutiques are allowed to sell sealed bottles. The microbreweries have been allowed to sell their beer in steel, glass, or ceramic containers of two litres capacity or lower. Restaurants attached to bars are allowed to provide takeaway services. However, pubs vending draught beer have not been allowed to function. The ease in restrictions is not applicable to liquor outlets in malls and supermarkets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/early-start-for-liquor-shops/article34427068.ece
28 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Anything to escape from city||Scenes reminiscent of last year's lockdown were repeated as the countdown to the 14-day lockdown in Karnataka began. For reasons ranging from not wanting to be in the city, which is the COVID-19 hotspot, to anticipating an extension of the lockdown, people had their answers to justify their decision to leave Bengaluru. Ashik A. and her family decided to travel back to their hometown Kodagu on Tuesday. “Young children feel suffocated in the apartment as they can't go out and play. There is no school either. At least back home, there is enough space to play without worrying about coming in touch with anyone. It is safer for us too. As my father is a senior citizen, we didn't want to risk having him in Bengaluru,” she said. Sanjana Shetty travelled to her hometown Mangaluru just before the announcement of the lockdown. “My in-laws are both patients. We were afraid we would not be able to travel to be with them if they needed us during the lockdown. So we decided to travel and stay with them for a while. For us too, it seems like a better option given that we live in an apartment and there are cases being reported,” she said. On Ballari Road, a group of people from Nepal were seen waiting for a private bus to go back home. “Going by bus is more safe compared to going by train. Availability of seats is difficult to predict in trains,” said one of them. Ajay (name changed) travelled to his wife’s hometown in Rajasthan for similar reasons. Uday K., an engineer working in a private firm, said that his family anticipated a lockdown as there was a steep spike in COVID-19 cases across Karnataka. “Hence, we decided to come to Mysuru, my native, which is relatively safer. Earlier, I was not allowed to go out of station as I am in the crisis management team. This time, I got prior permission and left for Mysuru a few days before the lockdown. Many in my team also left for their native places as cases started to soar in the city,” he said.

28 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Severe paucity of Tamiflu, anti-virals has patients and familes on edge||Oxygen, beds and Remdesivir are not the only essentials in the city’s arsenal against COVID-19 that are in short supply. Families and friends of patients who develop severe symptoms are finding it increasingly difficult to get their hands on antiviral medicines like Tamiflu/Fabiflu. Software engineer Deepak S. spent two days scouring pharmacies in the city before he could get his hands on 20 tablets of Fabiflu that a doctor had prescribed for his elderly COVID-19 positive mother, who is currently isolating herself at home. “I may have called or visited over 50 pharmacies before I could find the tablets through a friend who is a doctor,” he said. The emand for antibiotics and anti-parasite drugs prescribed for COVID-19 patients has picked up over the last one month, which the chemists are able to meet adequately. “However, there is a severe paucity of supply of Tamiflu/Fabiflu tablets making it impossible to match the demand, creating a large gap,” said M. J. Ravindra Kumar, secretary, Bengaluru Chemists and Druggists Association. ‘Not prepared’ “Even two weeks ago, these flu tablets were relatively easier to procure, but that is no longer the case,” said a regional manager with a pharmacy chain. “Pharmaceutical firms also did not expect the enormity of the second wave and had scaled down production after cases dropped,” said a senior official in the State’s COVID-19 war room. What is adding to the panic is that several hospitals are shifting the onus of purchasing ‘tough to procure drugs’ onto family members, sending them on the hunt, while their loved ones are fighting for their lives. Remdesivir, also in short supply, is today completely regulated by the government and allotted to hospitals on a priority basis, making it hard to come by. However, several hospitals are asking patients to procure them. “I had to pull strings, call people in the medical fraternity and the bureaucracy to get Remdesivir. But I had the resources to do this. What about others,” questioned a COVID-19 patient, who did not wish to be named. The city police have busted several rings selling Remdesivir in the blackmarket for as much as Rs. 22,000 a vial. Life-saving drugs like Tocilizumab and Itolizumab that are administered to critical COVID-19 patients in an attempt to prevent cytokine storms — when the body starts to attack its own cells — are “impossible to procure”. “I have been trying to procure one of these drugs, said to be in the range of Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 50,000 for my brother who is on ventilator support. I have been told there are no stocks of the two drugs anywhere in India. A shipment of Tocilizumab is said to have been imported to Mumbai on Monday. I am hoping against hope that I will get a vial,” said Suneel Kumar, a software engineer. Here, too, there is a blackmarket for these drugs, where an injection was recently procured for as high as Rs. 2.5 lakh, sources said. Standard run-of-the-mill tools like oximeters, nebulisers and inhalers are also scarce. “My maid asked me to get an inhaler for her, but when I went to three pharmacies, I was told there were none available. Her husband procured one from a chemist in another part of the city but had to pay double the price,” said Beena Deshpande.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/severe-paucity-of-tamiflu-anti-virals-has-patients-and-familes-on-edge/article34427051.ece
28 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Small private hospitals getting only 50% of oxygen: PHANA to HC||The Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) on Tuesday alleged before the High Court of Karnataka that the government is supplying only 25% of the Remdesivir injections of the total requirement to private hospitals treating COVID-19 patients. While claiming that private hospitals and nursing homes, particularly medium and small ones, are able to procure only 50% of the oxygen required to treat COVID-19 patients through private suppliers, PHANA has said that a war room, created by the government to ensure supply of oxygen, is not providing any help to the hospitals. These submissions were made by H.M. Prasanna, president of PHANA, before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar during the hearing of PIL petitions on issues related to COVID-19. To a query by the Bench, Dr. Prasanna said that the government has huge stock of Remdesivir but it is not supplying them to private hospitals and due to this, the hospitals were rationing the injections by providing it to patients with severe COVID-19 conditions though both medium and severely infected patients require it. To a query on oxygen supply, Dr. Prasanna said that hospitals are able to get 50% of oxygen while clarifying that there is no oxygen supply network set up either by the State government or the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike in the city. “A war room for oxygen supply is unresponsive and they have not provided any help,” he said, while pointing out that an IAS officer heads this war room. Terming the situation alarming, the Bench asked the government to respond on these issues while noticing from the its statement that requirement of oxygen for COVID-19 patients in the State on April 30 would be 1,471 MT per day and the Centre has agreed to allocate 802 MT per day. The State has capacity of producing oxygen of 812 MT/ per day domestically, the government informed the court. Meanwhile, the Bench directed the Union government to inform the HC on accommodating COVID-19 patients in hospitals of the Armed Forces in the city while noticing that Command Hospital has declined to allot any bed citing that it is treating COVID-19 patients of the Armed Forces from Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/small-private-hospitals-getting-only-50-of-oxygen-phana-to-hc/article34427053.ece
28 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||PHANA to launch portal that allows monitoring of bed availability||The Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) is set to roll out its database that will allow citizens to monitor availability of beds in real-time. While there is a spreadsheet that gives updated information on bed available in the government quota, there is no such centralised database for the private sector, a gap that the city’s civic body and the State government have been trying to plug. This opacity in bed availability in private hospitals is one of the reasons for the presence of touts who are guaranteeing hospitalisation to desperate families at exorbitant costs. According to officials, the lack of information is adding to the panic. Once PHANA’s portal becomes live, bed availability in the private sector will be in the public domain, and the system will be streamlined, said Dr. H.M. Prasanna, president, PHANA. “The situation is so bad that, as president of the association, I myself don’t know where beds are available. So we have brought most of the private hospitals on board for the portal, something the Association wanted to do last year, but never could,” he said. The BBMP had been pushing for such a system for a while. In a story published in The Hindu last week, BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta had pointed out that a common booking system may help COVID-19 patients and prevent them from going to multiple hospitals in search of beds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/phana-to-launch-portal-that-allows-monitoring-of-bed-availability/article34427058.ece
28 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Paralysed without oxygen||The State government may have allowed industries to function during the two-week lockdown, but a significant section — between 30% and 40% — is paralysed without oxygen. In light of the medical emergency and shortage of oxygen, the Centre has banned its industrial use across the country. Subasish Guha Roy’s Universal Air Products Pvt. Ltd. office at Peenya II Stage, a key supplier of oxygen to hospitals across the State, was recently mobbed by industrialists trying to get some oxygen supply. “We understand that human life is more important, but we are asked to open shops but can’t work. How do we pay salaries?” asked Jagannath, who runs a cutting and fabrication unit in Peenya. There are over 300 such cutting and fabrication units in Peenya Industrial Area, which cannot function without oxygen and have thus been shut for days. This has had a cascading effect as many other industries are also dependent on these units. “The cutting and fabricating of metal are key basic processes in the industries here. While these units have closed down, thosewith in-house facilities for the same are also not able to carry these processes out because of the lack of oxygen. Essentially, in most industries, one cannot make any finished product without these processes. We hope the pandemic situation improvesand oxygen supply to industry is resumed soon,” said Srinivas Asranna, a past president of Peenya Industries Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/paralysed-without-oxygen/article34427069.ece

The agency also named the Minister’s firm, IMA managing director Mohammed Mansoor Khan, and other directors in the supplementary chargesheet, filed before the special CBI court. Mr. Baig had allegedly received several crores from the IMA funds for election expenditure. In the supplementary chargesheet, CBI officials have claimed that when he used the money to host social and cultural activities in his constituency to increase his popularity. It is further alleged that the accused had been utilising the funds for daily expenditure as well as to pay the salaries of the employees of his firm, Danish Publications. The funds of IMA were unauthorised deposits raised from the innocent public. It ran to the tune of approximately Rs. 4,000 crore from around one lakh investors, according to CBI officials. As part of its investigation, the CBI has registered four cases to date and filed three chargesheets against 33 accused, including revenue and police officers. It has also filed three supplementary chargesheets. Mr. Mansoor Khan and the other directors are accused of cheating the public by failing to repay the principal as well as the promised returns. “These funds were diverted for acquiring properties, paying bribes to officials later charged in the case,” said the CBI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ima-scam-supplementary-chargesheet-against-baig/article34427071.ece

People started rushing to shops and business establishments on Monday hours after the government announced the lockdown. There were many buyers at grocery stres. The same situation continued on Tuesday as well.  Police harassment “Fearing that it would be difficult to move around during the lockdown, people purchased essential items in bulk. Most people are afraid of the police, who sometimes beat them up without enquiring why they had come out during the lockdown,” said Shivaram, a resident of K.R. Puram Extension. During the earlier lockdown, people had witnessed such police harassment. A person was assaulted by policemen while he was taking his sick child to a clinic. “Many people will have to visit hospitals to get their second dose of the vaccination. In the absence of public transport, they may have to depend on private vehicles. The police should be people-friendly,” said Govinda Raju of Vidya Nagar. The administration has allowed the shops that sell groceries, food and milk products to stay open till 10 a.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hundreds-return-to-hassan-from-across-the-state-ahead-of-lockdown/article34427177.ece

28 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Immediate help sought for those deprived of jobs||“As the State is facing a second lockdown, although projected as partial, it has thrown light on the sheer apathy of the government towards the plight of the commoners and the working class who are again getting deprived of their livelihood,” Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) has said. In a statement, SUCI(C) district secretary Ramanjanappa Aldalli said the State government is more concerned about the interests of the capitalists, while it has turned a blind eye towards commoners and the working class whose livelihood is being snatched away through the lockdown. Mr. Aldalli said the Union and State governments are solely responsible for the forced second lockdown as they failed to take precautionary measures despite being warned about the second wave. “While the State government is engrossed in internal bickering and sleaze CD row, the Centre, led by Prime Minister Modi, is engrossed in snobbery of having won against the pandemic, elections and Kumbh Mela. Due to the negligence of both these governments, we find ourselves in the same pathetic situation as in the last year,” he said. He said that instead of mitigating the sufferings of the common people, the State government has reduced the quantity of foodgrains being supplied under the Public Distribution System, and has increased the tax burden on citizens. Demands Mr. Aldalli urged the State government to immediately strengthen health infrastructure and make alternative arrangements to provide timely treatment to COVID-19 patients and also fill all vacant posts and recruit additional health staff. It should immediately provide financial aid to street vendors, autorickshaw and taxi drivers, garment workers, house maids, workers, small businessmen and also those who earn on a daily basis. They should be given a monthly assistance of Rs. 7,500 till the situation improved, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/immediate-help-sought-for-those-deprived-of-jobs/article34427057.ece

Rajendra said here on Tuesday that those holding marriages during the lockdown period need not obtain pass or any permission for hired vehicles to reach the venue of the marriage. Replying to a question at a press conference, Dr. Rajendra said that the names of those travelling in the hired vehicle, except the driver, should be among the 50 approved by gram panchayats or urban local bodies concerned to attend a marriage. The travellers should also produce a copy of the invitation of the marriage during checking. No other permission to hire the services of the driver or the vehicle is required. The Deputy Commissioner said that if people are travelling to private hospitals to receive vaccination against COVID-19, they should get an appointment from the hospital concerned and show the confirmation message received on their mobile phones to get the vaccine on the particular day. The district administration is making a micro plan to enable people to get vaccination in government primary health centres, sub-centres and area sites. People are advised to get themselves vaccinated in such centres of their locality. The field staff of the government has been sensitised enough to handle the travel issues relating to vaccination carefully. Some stray cases of opposition and confusions might arise. If such incidents are brought to the higher-ups, they will be addressed immediately, Dr. Rajendra said. The Deputy Commissioner said that building contractors should make proper arrangements for taking construction workers to the work sites. If not, arrangements should be made for stay on construction sites. It will be their responsibility. Referring to the migration of workers, Dr. Rajendra said that the district administration will open community kitchens if needed to prevent any migration during the lockdown. CREDAI and industry associations have also been instructed to set up community kitchens. The Joint Director of Industries and the Labour Department will look into those issues if any. Dr. Rajendra said that monitoring all marriages being arranged in homes, especially in rural areas, is a challenging task.

28 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Action will be taken if private hospitals fleece patients’||In a warning to private hospitals not to collect hefty charges for COVID-19 treatment, Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar on Tuesday said the private hospitals have so far allotted 20% to 50% of beds for COVID-19 patients. The government will not allow them to charge more for the treatment and action will be taken if they fleece patients, he warned. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, Mr. Somashekar clarified that there was no shortage of oxygenated beds as of now across the district and added that more such beds are being increased in the State-run K.R. Hospital soon. Not all COVID-19 positive patients need oxygenated beds but all patients were expecting such beds for their treatment. Doctors will decide who needs an oxygenated bed and accordingly the beds will be allotted, he said, adding that oxygenated beds and ICU beds will be increased in the days ahead. Mr. Somashekar, who visited JSS Hospital, said the hospital has allotted 411 beds to the government and added that the hospital had been requested to allot 100 more beds. There is no oxygen shortage at the hospital, he replied. The Minister later visited Sri Suttur Mutt and urged Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami to consider giving more beds to the district administration in JSS Hospital for the treatment of COVID-19 patients referred by the government. The hospital is run by the Mutt. Mr Somashekar made an appeal to the Seer for setting aside 500 beds, especially oxygenated beds, for the treatment. During his meeting with the seer, a discussion was also held on making use of the services of the final-year MBBS students of the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute and the JSS Medical College in COVID-19 treatment. Meanwhile, the Minister held a meeting with the representatives of private hospitals of Mysuru and sought their support in the fight against the resurgent COVID-19. “In this hour of health crisis, join hands with the government and help fight the pandemic,” he said, assuring all help from the government to the hospitals, including medical oxygen supplies and life-saving drugs. At the meeting, he said there was no dearth of drugs and the private hospitals would get them in a few days’ time. “There is no need to panic on the supplies,” he said. One of the reasons why Mysuru stands first in vaccination coverage was the private hospitals’ support in providing free vaccination to the eligible population on the call from the district administration, he said, complimenting them for this stand which happens to be one of its kinds in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/action-will-be-taken-if-private-hospitals-fleece-patients/article34427169.ece
28 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Fake Remdesivir: One more medical representative held||The Mysuru city police, which recently unearthed a racket of fake Remdesivir, an investigational drug used for treatment of severe COVID-19 cases, has arrested one more medical representative on charges of selling the fake medicine. Last week, a special team of the City Crime Branch (CCB) stumbled upon a large quantity of fake Remdesivir in the house of Girish K., 34, a staff nurse employed in a private hospital in Mysuru. Along with Girish, the police arrested Prashant, 42, an employee in a medical shop, and Manjunath, a medical representative. The police now managed to arrest Sujay, 34, a medical representative, who was also reportedly part of the racket. Sujay was picked up from Sathgalli bus stand on Sunday and interrogated by the police. Sujay would procure fake Remdesivir injections from Girish and sell them to medical stores and individuals. The police had constituted a special team of CCB in the wake of growing complaints of black marketing of Remdesivir. After arresting Girish and his associates and booking a case in Nazarbad police station limits, city Police Commissioner Chandragupta had told reporters that Girish, residing in Vidyanagar, collected exhausted bottles of Remdesivir from different hospitals and refilled them with an antibiotic and saline water before selling it to gullible buyers at a high price. Girish was assisted by Shivappa, security personnel at a private hospital, and Mangala, a house keeper at a COVID Care Centre. While the repackaging of the bottles costed no more than Rs. 100, the fake medicine was sold for more than Rs. 4,000 a piece, a police official said. Mr. Chandragupta said the police were trying to trace the supply chain of the fake medicine. The accused, who were active for about three months during the peak of COVID-19 last year and for the last two to three months, claimed to have sold about 800 to 900 bottles so far. Hence, a deeper investigation was necessary to ascertain not only the fate of patients, who had received the fake medicine, but also the supply chain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fake-remdesivir-one-more-medical-representative-held/article34427173.ece

Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) officials said that more than 70,000 people travelled from Majestic to various destinations on Tuesday. A majority of the passengers travelled to Raichur, Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Bidar and Ballari. “Compared to Monday, passenger footfall at Majestic and other stations was higher on Tuesday. KSRTC operated 2,000 buses till 9 p.m. Buses having reservation tickets were operated after 9 p.m.,” said a KSRTC official, adding that most of the buses were non-AC. As per protocol, only 50% of the seats were filled. A majority of the people were migrant workers. However, the crowds were nothing like the exodus the city witnessed during the national lockdown in 2020. As the government has not imposed a ban on construction sites, labourers – for the most part – have chosen to stay back. People from other sectors, as well as those working from home, had started leaving the city over the last week itself in anticipation of a lockdown. Other than RTC buses, passengers were seen waiting for inter-State private buses opposite Esteem Mall on Ballari Road and other areas with luggage. Pile-up at toll gates Vehicular movement at toll gates increased. At the toll gate near Nagasandra metro station on Tumakuru Road, people were seen travelling in vans and one group even in a tractor to reach their village. A garment worker travelling in a tractor to Tumakuru said, “ Due to government order, our factory will remain closed during the lockdown. So we are going home. It is always safer to be in villages than living in Bengaluru.

The helpline was set up to assist citizens with all kinds of COVID-19 related queries, testing centres, vaccination centres, medical advice on symptoms, and direct assistance on hospital bed blocking and admission, CCC bed blocking, availing BBMP’s ambulance and home isolation support. The control room works round-the-clock and is operated from Bescom’s call centre. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the helpline is connected to the zonal war rooms. Registration for vaccination Citizens aged above 18 years may register for the COVID-19 vaccine on the COWIN portal (www.cowin.gov.in). Vaccination will be provided free of cost in 141 primary health centres and government hospitals from May 1. Private medical establishments are required to procure vaccines directly from pharmaceutical companies at rates fixed by the government. Funds Meanwhile, the civic body has released funds for the procurement of safety equipment to all the 141 PHCs in the city. According to information made available, each PHC gets Rs. 2 lakh while medical officers of each Assembly constituency get Rs. 25 lakh each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/inundated-with-calls-1912-helpline-gets-400-lines/article34427355.ece
28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Notices to 20 private labs||One phone number was given as the contact for as many as 600 samples collected for RT-PCR test by a private laboratory. Another laboratory informed citizens that they had tested positive for COVID-19 without uploading the information on the ICMR portal, while others are not keeping to the 24-hour deadline. These are just a few examples of private laboratories not following COVID-19 protocols. The civic body, taking cognizance of these issues, has issued notices to around 20 private laboratories. So far, four labs have been sealed – three (Aarati Diagnostics, Medall and R.V. Metropolis) on Monday and one (R.L. Labs) on Tuesday. These errors are making contact-tracing a nightmare for the BBMP. Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta told The Hindu that over the past two days, civic officials conducted a review to ascertain whether the errors were happening during swab collection or data entry. “We found that there were more problems in walk-in cases in private labs and hospitals. There are a lot of discrepancies in data because of which we cannot contact the right persons (who have tested positive), trace contacts, monitor home isolation,” he said. BBMP Special Commissioner (Health) P. Rajendra Cholan said with labs not uploading results on the ICMR portal, BU numbers could not be generated. “The labs were directly informing those who had tested positive, who in turn began frantically searching for beds. But beds cannot be allotted without a BU number. Citizens were suffering due to the failure of private labs,” he said. The BBMP will give the labs until Wednesday to respond to the show cause notices. “If we do not hear from them, we will seal all of them,” he stated. Overcharging  Though Karnataka has capped the cost of RT-PCR test at Rs. 500, many citizens have reported that private labs were charging them upwards of Rs. 1,000 per test. Mr. Cholan said the civic body would take action against such labs if citizens lodged complaints. Minister for Revenue R. Ashok told reporters on Tuesday that the BBMP would depute data entry operators to various labs to prevent delays.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/notices-to-20-private-labs/article34427357.ece

28 April 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Kuttanad paddy farmers in dire straits||Delay in the procurement of harvested paddy has put farmers in Kuttanad in distress. Farmers of three paddy polders under the Kavalam Krishi Bhavan, where harvest was completed several days ago, said the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) and rice mills were not ready to procure their produce. They said that despite the threat of rain, harvested paddy was being kept in polders itself. Agitation Apart from Kavalam, farmers in Ramankary, Kainakary, Thalavady, Veeyapuram, Cheruthana, Pallipad, Haripad among other places in Kuttanad and Upper Kuttanad regions are facing procurement delays. On Monday, farmers staged an agitation in front of Thalavady Krishi Bhavan demanding speedy procurement of the harvested crop. Farmers in the region alleged that mills were demanding more wastage citing high moisture content in the harvested paddy. “Rice mills are trying to take advantage of the situation. They are demanding more wastage knowing farmers are desperate to sell produce due to rain threat among other factors. Some of the agents are demanding wastage up to 15 kg per quintal of paddy. The sad part is the officials concerned remain a mute spectator to all this,” said a paddy farmer from Kainakary. Paddy farming has been undertaken in around 28,913.655 hectares in Alappuzha district in the ‘puncha’ crop season (first crop), a major portion of which is in Kuttanad. The Supplyco has so far procured 1.10 lakh tonne of paddy from around 24,000 hectares in Alappuzha in the ‘puncha’ season. Rest 5,000 hectares are expected to go under combine harvesters in the coming days. Alini Antony, Principal Agricultural Officer, said that 5,200 tonnes of harvested paddy had been awaiting procurement. The procurement of the harvested paddy would be completed in a week. Earlier this month, several farmers who cultivated paddy had suffered huge losses after summer rain destroyed harvest-ready crops in large tracts in different parts of the district. Besides, the rain-drenched several tonnes of harvested paddy stored in paddy polders for shifting to rice mills. Postponed Meanwhile, the district administration has postponed the opening of the shutters of the Thanneermukkom bund due to a delay in the completion of harvest and procurement in Kuttanad. Earlier, authorities decided to open 31 of the 90 shutters of the bund on April 27. Officials said the shutters would now be opened in a phased manner from April 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kuttanad-paddy-farmers-in-dire-straits/article34427127.ece

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath seeking the latter’s immediate intervention for ensuring better medical care for journalist Siddique Kappan, an under-trial prisoner, who has been undergoing treatment in a hospital in UP since last week. “It is a shame that the UP government has shown scant regard for the fundamental rights of a journalist like Kappan ever since his arrest by the UP police on October 5, 2020. Now, it has been learned from his family members that though Kappan has been admitted to Mathura Medical College Hospital after he fell unconscious in a Mathura jail, he is denied even basic facilities in the hospital,” Mr. Ariff said. In the letter, the Alappuzha MP said after testing positive for COVID-19 a few days ago, the journalist’s condition had turned critical and he was battling for his life. “It’s shocking that the UP government has not heeded the demands of the family for transferring him to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi to provide better treatment to save his life. In this context, I request you to give immediate instruction to jail authorities to make possible his admission to AIIMS, New Delhi, without further delay upholding the principle of natural justice and constitutional propriety,” he said.

28 April 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Tribal hamlets in Idukki bar outsiders, and COVID||Tribal councils (Oorukoottom) at times land in controversy since they hand out punishments such as social boycott (Ooruvilakku) to families for violating the norms of the community. However, a decision by the tribal council in Edamalakkudy, the only tribal grama panchayat in Kerala, has drawn attention since it has managed to keep COVID-19 at bay. When the pandemic broke out last year, the tribal council decided that outsiders would not be allowed to enter the hamlet. The residents too were asked not to leave the hamlet. No case has been reported from the grama panchayat till date. Georgekutty, a former employee of the grama panchayat, said the decisions taken by the council are always abided by the residents, most of whom are Muthuvan community members. Emergency Moreover, they prefer to stay in their settlements unless there is an emergency. Edamalakkudy is in the Munnar forest division, bordering Tamil Nadu. The nearby town is Munnar, at a distance of 30 km. The Eravikulam National Park (ENP) is the entry point to Edamalakkudy. Now, emulating Edamalakkudy, other tribal hamlets in the district too have decided to ban outsiders. Job J. Neriyamparambil, ENP range officer, said the ‘Oorumooppan’ of Parappyarkudy had already asked the park officials not to allow outsiders to the hamlet. Marayur range officer M.G. Vinodhkumar said hamlets under the forest division decided on Sunday to bar outsiders. He said that in Koodalkattukudy, where nearly 600 tribespeople live, no COVID-19 cases have been reported. “An outbreak will go out of hand in tribal settlements due to their community living and high social interaction,” he said.

The police said Prashob, a CPI(M) activist from Mundathode, had made the bomb, which was used to spread terror on the day of the murder. They also recovered weapons from Prashob’s house.

28 April 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Shortage of vaccines hits drive in Kannur||The health department is groping in the dark as it is unable to meet the demand for vaccination due to a shortage in the supply of COVID-19 vaccines. While the requirement for a day was around 40,000 doses in the district, the supply was far short, a senior health official told The Hindu . On Tuesday, 5,000 doses of vaccine were brought from Kozhikode. However, there were no doses left for Wednesday, he said. Even though 20,000 more doses had been allotted to the district, which would reach here on Wednesday, it would suffice for only the next two days, he said. The vaccines received by the district had to be supplied to 25 private institutions in the district. These institutions were yet to receive 13,500 doses for which they had already made the payment, the official said on condition of anonymity. He said that the district had 105 COVID vaccination centres spread across 71 panchayats. They were able to vaccinate 36,000 persons in a day. But due to the sudden surge in COVID-19 cases, more people were registering online, putting a strain on the system. Now, the situation was such that it was getting difficult to vaccinate those who required the vaccination immediately. Due to the shortage in supply, there was a break in giving vaccines to the centres on an everyday basis, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shortage-of-vaccines-hits-drive-in-kannur/article34427086.ece

28 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Pandemic triggers anxiety disorders||Ever since the second wave of the pandemic hit the district, a retired teacher in her 60s from Thripunithira had been suffering from sleeplessness and gastro issues, the treatment for which has brought little respite to her. Eventually, she was found suffering from psychosomatic illness where the person develops symptoms of a disease while not actually having it. “It turned out to be a classic case of gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], cases of which have increased considerably since the resurgence of the pandemic. It is a manifestation of anxiety and stress, and the symptoms include heartburn, indigestion, lack of appetite, and sleeplessness. In severe cases, it could even lead to depression,” said V. Sudarshana Manoj, counselling psychologist. According to her, anxiety-driven issues have surged of late, especially among aged people who constantly live in fear of death. “That they [the elderly] are restricted to their homes with little social interaction and are active on social media that is bristling with pandemic-related forwards do not help. Television channels and newspapers painting an explosive situation also trigger their anxiety,” Ms. Manoj said. Media critic Sebastian Paul felt that a clear separation had to be made between social media and conventional media. “While the former is throbbing with misinformation, the latter has by and large done a commendable job. In a pandemic situation, there needs to be a constant flow of credible and verified information, the absence of which could have disastrous consequences like what had happened during the Bengal famine. I don’t fully agree with the observation that media reporting has triggered anxiety,” he said while reminding the media to be judicious about the choice of words used in reporting. Mr. Paul added that the reportage of the pandemic would only improve as the media evolved a code on their own as it did in the eighties when the phenomenon of AIDS exploded. The media adopted a code on protecting the privacy of the infected. “Any such code should be evolved out of experience rather than imposed by the government, which could turn out to be disastrous,” he observed. S.D. Singh, a senior consultant psychiatrist at a city-based private hospital, said the government should adopt a mental health screening programme to avoid suicides and a flurry of emotional breakdowns finding reflection in increased domestic violence and excessive dependence on alcohol. “Those not mentally healthy but on treatment are better coping with the pandemic situation with a slight rearrangement of their medication, while the same cannot be said about those who are not mentally healthy but are yet to be diagnosed. A mental health programme alongside the fight against the pandemic will serve the twin purpose of identifying those with mental health issues while reaching them the benefits of treatment without stigmatising them,” he said. Dr. Singh urged qualified mental health professionals to join hands with the government to enhance mental health alongside the battle against the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-triggers-anxiety-disorders/article34427502.ece

28 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||KMRL probing ways to increase metro footfall||Faced with daily loss skyrocketing to approximately Rs. 1 crore, Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) is probing ways to attain operational break even, including by offering fare reduction to regular commuters and others in a bid to woo them to use the system of mass rapid transport. The metro agency is considering a few short and long-term proposals in this regard, including restructuring of fares, aimed at wooing commuters to Kochi metro once the resurgent pandemic subsides. Its director board has to vet and ratify the proposals and suggestions from various quarters. A decision is awaited after the Assembly poll results are announced, informed sources said. A substantial reduction in fare and allied offers had resulted in footfall crossing the 1-lakh mark, in 2019 end. This in turn lessened congestion on roads beneath the metro corridor.  Win-win situation As a preliminary step, KMRL has envisaged integration of autorickshaws, buses, shared bicycles and the 23-strong Water Metro ferry fleet in the Kochi-1 card that is awaiting upgradation, it is learnt. This is expected to be a win-win situation for the metro, other modes of commute and commuters who have been yearning for seamless integration among different modes of public transport. Back in 2017, an opinion survey conducted among 1,484 commuters by a city-based consultancy firm had shown that they wanted lowering of fares, season tickets and students’ concession (31% of commuters then were students), to enhance patronage for the metro which was then limited to the 12-km Aluva-Palarivattom corridor. Sixty-one per cent of them said they wished to travel in the metro every day. It was also found that only 3% commuters were daily-wage earners (who are very conscious of the fare structure) unlike in most other metros in the country where their number is more. KMRL is also learnt to have mooted multi-level parking amenities in Aluva and Edappally, where it has spare land, in a bid to attract more passengers. Their technical and economic feasibility have to be studied. Regular passengers and those who avail of monthly pass might even be offered discounted parking charges, it is learnt.  Alternative sources With revenue from ticket sale nosediving due to the pandemic, KMRL is probing ways to augment alternative revenue sources. The pandemic has resulted in less than expected response to expression of interest (EOIs) floated to garner revenue from land and commercial/retail space available with the metro agency. A strategy in this regard is being worked out. Work on the ambitious Bliss City project mooted in 17 acres government land in Kakkanad too is a non-starter due to this reason. The lull in patronage due to the pandemic and inadequate footfall even before it struck has thrown a spanner in the metro agency’s plans to mop revenue from non-ticketing sources, including from station naming rights and advertisements in trains and at stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kmrl-probing-ways-to-increase-metro-footfall/article34427509.ece

As majority of the migrant workers belong to the 18-45 age group, they will turn eligible for vaccination on May 1. The 101 Assistant Labour Officers (ALOs) across the State have been deployed for helping the migrant community to register for vaccination on the Co-Win portal. “We are exploring the scope for special centres for the vaccination of migrant workers. This will depend on the availability of vaccine and the practicality of such centres. Else, they will be vaccinated along with others in the common centres,” said S. Chithra, State Labour Commissioner. Information about the free vaccination is being disseminated in Assamese, Odiya, Bengali, and Hindi on social media groups of migrants and special call centres set up for them. Action plan “The Labour Department has also drawn up an action plan for migrants during this pandemic and it will be submitted for the approval of the government soon.

28 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Move to appoint non-teaching staff in academic role opposed||The inclusion of a proposal in the agenda of the Syndicate meet of the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit on Wednesday to consider librarians having qualifications prescribed by the University Grants Commission as academic staff has come under criticism. Syndicate member P.C. Muraleemadhavan has alleged that the move is against the norms as it amounted to appointing a non-teaching staff in an academic role. This is part of the continuing efforts by the varsity authorities to accommodate a librarian, who is a leader of a Left organisation, in an academic role before his retirement on April 30, he said on Tuesday. Prof. Muraleemadhavan, who is also a member of the Syndicate sub-committee on academic affairs, stated that the proposal has not been placed before the committee. The varsity authorities were now trying to introduce a Department in Library Science to realise the appointment of the library staff, he said. He pointed out that the posts, if any, in this stream have to be notified as per the UGC rules. The scrutiny of applications has to be carried out and the selection process should be strictly based on the norms prescribed by the UGC. The varsity cannot bypass all these regulations by including it as an agenda in the Syndicate meet, he said. Vice Chancellor P.K. Dharmarajan rejected the allegations as baseless. However, he admitted that the proposal figured in the agenda of the Syndicate meet on Wednesday. “This was a proposal pending for long. There was also a proposal to start a Department in Library Science,” he said. Prof. Dharamaraj said that a few persons in the varsity library having doctorate degrees had submitted a request to consider them as academic staff. The appointment of R. Ninitha, wife of M.B. Rajesh, former MP of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), as assistant professor in the Department of Malayalam had sparked a controversy in February after one of the subject experts on the interview board alleged irregularities in the selection process.

28 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||HC stays university decision||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday stayed the decision of Kannur University to conduct online interviews for the selection of candidates to the post of assistant professor in the UGC- Human Resource Development Centre in the varsity. Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas passed the stay order on a writ petition filed by Bindu M.P. of Chavussery, Kannur, challenging the process adopted by the university to fill the post. The petitioner alleged that the university was taking hasty steps to appoint Sahala, wife of A.M. Shamseer, CPI(M) MLA, violating all the selection norms. The method adopted by the varsity while applying the principles of reservation in the process of recruitment was totally arbitrary and unconstitutional. With the imposition of the model code of conduct, the varsity should not have made appointments during the period. Despite that, the university had scheduled the interview. The university was in utmost haste to fill the post as it wanted to facilitate the appointment of the MLA’s wife. On an earlier occasion too, the MLA’s wife was illegally appointed to the university, and it was later set aside by the High Court, added the petitioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-stays-university-decision-to-hold-online-interviews/article34427074.ece
28 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Several directives issued to corpn. on waste management, says PCB||The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) has denied the position taken by the Kochi Corporation that it had not received any directions to practice source-level treatment of waste. The board observed that the contention by the corporation that it had not been reminded about the mismanagement of solid waste was nowhere near the facts and it amounted to utter negligence towards the directions of the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management constituted by the National Level Monitoring Committee. The Secretary of the Corporation had mentioned in a recent reply sent to the board on the issue of unscientific treatment of solid waste that no directions were ever given to the civic body to practice source-level treatment of waste. The minutes of the SLMC meetings clearly showed that the corporation was advised to manage solid waste irrespective of the facilities that they had proposed for its management. The civic body was bound to comply with the Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2000 till 2016 and the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 afterwards. It was pertinent to note that the corporation was not able to practice scientific management of solid waste at Brahmapuram though the board had issued specific directions based on the orders issued by the Principal and Southern Benches of the National Green Tribunal, it said. On the claims by the corporation that the septage treatment plant at Brahmapuram was functioning, the board clarified that an inspection held in May last year by a surveillance team representing its regional office had revealed that only a limited quantity of effluent was reaching the plant as per the official records. The plant was not functioning even during the visit of the chairman of the SLMC. The untreated effluent was being discharged to a nearby area, which is close to Chitrapuzha, identified as a critically-polluted stretch by the Central Pollution Control Board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/several-directives-issued-to-corpn-on-waste-management-says-pcb/article34427503.ece

The interrogation will continue on Wednesday by the end of which police expect to make breakthroughs in some as yet unexplained aspects of the case and verifying potential discrepancies in his statements till now. The presence of alcohol in the victim’s body remains a mystery as the accused, while having even confessed to the murder of his daughter, has not admitted to having given her alcohol.

The team recovered the car he had sold at Coimbatore allegedly to fund his life on the run. He was also taken to the temple town of Kollur where he had stayed for days before slipping away without footing the bill. It was the CCTV footage from Kollur that eventually led to his arrest.

The youngster set a model worth emulating when he donated the money he got from parents and relatives during Vishu to the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF). Media reports about the hiccups in vaccination are what moved him to donating his meagre saving of Rs. 2,000 towards the vaccine challenge. CM’s press meet “I simply felt like doing it after watching the news about corona and the Chief Minister’s press conference urging people to join the vaccine challenge,” said Kashinath. Ratheesh, Kashinath’s father, said his son regularly read newspapers and watched news channels and kept track of current affairs. “He shared the idea of contributing to CMDRF when I returned from work on Monday evening.

Elangovan. While all the three units of KMML performed exceptionally, the Titanium Sponge Unit registered a record production volume of 260 tonnes and profit of Rs. 50 lakh. According to managing director J.Chandrabose, mineral separation unit also did well by recording a profit of Rs. 3.44 crore. While the renovation and diversification projects enabled the company to achieve the feat, the dip in production and export to countries like China turned out to be an added advantage. Various projects KMML had spent around Rs. 120 crore for various projects including the implementation of froth floatation system used for the separation of individual minerals. Switching from LPG to LNG helped the company to reduce production cost and the scarcity of raw material was addressed by transporting mine ral sand from Thottapally. With the commissioning of the modern 70 tonne per day oxygen plant, the company could save around Rs. 10 crore a year that was earlier used to buy oxygen from other manufacturers. The plant that started functioning in October 2020 has so far supplied over 1,029 tonnes of medical oxygen also. The company officials are hoping to supply 200 tonnes of oxygen for medical needs every month. Technology renovation in mineral separation unit, modern fire safety measures, bag filter system, package boiler, DCS system and new R&D building also helped the company to scale new heights. At present various projects to the tune of Rs. 30 crore are being implemented at KMML. The works of the pipeline for transporting fuel from Kochi, cooling tower, liquid nitrogen storage facility, brine chiller compressor, renovation of acid regeneration plant, new boiler plant and energy efficient tickle preheater are currently under way.

Raghavan, MP, has sought the immediate intervention of the Centre to solve the issue of Gulf-bound Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), especially from Kerala, stranded in Nepal. In a memorandum submitted to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan on Monday, Mr. Raghavan said thousands of Indians who had planned to travel to the Gulf via Nepal had been stranded in the country. The NRIs had opted transit through Nepal as many Gulf nations had restricted travel of passengers from India. Many of them were worried that they would lose their jobs, he said. Except Qatar and Bahrain, he said the remaining Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait had banned the entry of Indians to those countries. However, exemptions were given to passengers if they underwent quarantine for 14 days in a third country. RT-PCR tests Adding to their woes, Mr. Raghavan said Nepal had regulated RT-PCR tests for foreigners. The Ministry of Health and Population in Nepal had issued a circular restricting the tests for COVID-19 detection to six centres. Nepal also faced a crisis with mounting COVID-19 cases. Thus many Indians were unable to take the RT-PCR tests that have become mandatory to enter the Gulf nations. They also had to shell out at least Rs. 50,000 for quarantine facilities, the MP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/centres-intervention-sought-to-help-nris-stranded-in-nepal/article34427079.ece

28 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State registers a new high at 32,819 cases||The State has been registering an exponential rise in COVID-19 graph which was 11,000 to 13,000 cases a day last week to the 32,000 cases reported on Tuesday. When the results of 1,41,199 samples analysed in the past 24 hours came in, the State added 32,819 new cases to its tally. The average test positivity rate rose to 23.24%. The active case pool of the State now has 2,47,181 patients. ICU admissions continue to rise and as on Tuesday, the State has 1,506 critically ill patients who are being cared for in ICUs, while those requiring ventilator assistance has risen to 488. The cumulative case burden of the State now stands at 14,60,364 cases. The number of COVID patients currently being treated in hospitals in the State rose to 21,460, with 3,645 persons being newly admitted on Tuesday. Though the number of new hospital admissions are rising by the day, even now, only about 9% of the active cases are getting hospitalised, which is one silver line amidst all the gloom At present, 5,06,202 people are in home or institutional isolation in the State. Highest recovery The number of recoveries reported on Tuesday was 18,413, the highest number to have been reported in a single day. The total recoveries till date is 12,07,680.

28 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||20,000 Covishield doses arrive||The district vaccine store received 20,000 Covishield doses late Tuesday, enabling health authorities to sustain the vaccination drive for more days. However, the vaccination programme will be confined to 28 public health institutions alone on Wednesday. Three of these will provide Covaxin doses. The rest are likely to receive the remaining stock of nearly 5,000 doses. Of these, over 2,000 will be released for the five vaccination sessions that will be held at the Jimmy George indoor stadium. The new batch, which will be distributed on Thursday, will be supplied through all of the 100-odd public health institutions, including primary and community health centres in the district. While priority will be ensured for government hospitals, private institutions are unlikely to receive allocation in the new batch. The dwindling vaccine stock in the private sector has began to disrupt the ongoing drive. Normalcy restored Following a day marked by chaos, the vaccine supply at Jimmy George indoor stadium was conducted in a smooth manner on Tuesday with the authorities adopting a strict policy in time-slot management. Vaccine seekers were granted entry on the basis of their allotted time alone. Special tahsildar and vaccination camp nodal officer N. Balasubramanian said some people, who turned up much ahead of their slots, were directed to wait outside the stadium and permitted entry only close to their allotted time. Besides, a pandal that was erected on the parking area prevented people from standing in the sun. While the centre was intended to supply 2,000 doses, as many as 2,335 were administered the vaccine until 5.30 p.m. there. Similar to what had transpired the previous day, several people managed to secure appointments via the Aarogya Setu application. The parallel booking facility, in addition to the Co-WIN portal, has posed difficulties for health officials in allocating doses for centres beforehand. While 400 had booked for vaccination at General Hospital through the Co-WIN portal, nearly 30 gained appointments through Aarogya Setu. The overbooking also led to the automatic cancellation of bookings for several people early in the day. In all, a total of 15,189 people received vaccination on the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/20000-covishield-doses-arrive/article34427629.ece
28 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Pandemic situation perilous: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said the pandemic situation in the State was perilous. Only a relentless and pre-emptive vigilance against the COVID-19 pestilence could forestall a “more severe lockdown,” he said. “What we see in other States could happen in Kerala if we drop guard against the disease,” he warned. Active COVID-19 cases had registered a 255% increased in the last 14 days. The infection graph continues to climb. Exotic and mutant strains of the virus have spawned new cases. The virus threatened to overwhelm the State’s finite health resources. The rising tide of infections can cause the COVID-19 death rate to spike, he said. Mr. Vijayan requested citizens to postpone social events, including weddings. Celebrations could spell sorrow if held now, he said. Precautions People should wear masks, ensure physical distancing and shun crowds. A momentary drop in guard could spell danger. The Chief Minister read out the grieving social media post of a person who had lost his mother to the virus. “The writer repented that he had inadvertently given his mother the infection,” Mr. Vijayan said. The government would strictly enforce the curbs on social life. The government has ensured the adequate availability of oxygen beds and supplemental oxygen. The government would distribute vaccine free to migrant workers. Sectoral magistrates and police would ensure their welfare, he said. The State was walking a tightrope between protecting life and preserving livelihood. Strict adherence to the pandemic protocol would help the delicate balancing act, he added. Mr. Vijayan pegged the strength of the State's “COVID Brigade” at 13,625 persons, including doctors and nurses. He urged citizens to join the voluntary force and fulfil their “historical destiny.”  Use N95 masks Mr. Vijayan said that given the high transmissibility of mutant variants, public health experts had recommended the use of N95 masks or double masking. He said persons who disseminated fake news about the situation would face prosecution. In the past 24 hours, the police had detected 20,214 violations of the mask mandate. They booked 8,132 persons for breaking the physical distancing norm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-situation-perilous-cm/article34427154.ece

With the department named an essential service, the guidelines are expected to help various services reach the people unimpeded. Rotation basis For the next one month, employees would report for work on rotation basis while also ensuring there are adequate number of them so that COVID-19 prevention and functioning of first- and second-line treatment centres (FLTCs and SLTCs) and domiciliary care centres are not affected. In each office of the department, an employee not below the rank of junior superintendent or head clerk should be deputed as COVID-19 protocol officer. If grama panchayats need more employees for pandemic prevention or functioning of COVID-19 care centres in any circumstance, the panchayat deputy director can deploy more staff from the performance audit wing through a special order. An assistant secretary, head clerk, or junior superintendent should be in charge of supervision of FLTCs, SLTCs, and DCCs started under the panchayats. Pandemic protocol Employees on duty must follow physical distancing, masking and sanitising protocol strictly. They are required wear N95 or surgical masks properly and sanitise equipment before use. They should sanitise hands every two hours. Hand-shakes should be avoided as also sharing of food and utensils. Employees attending telephone calls should ensure that hands are properly sanitised. The public should be made aware of the need to send applications to panchayats through email. Office mail id and website address should be published. Services should be provided only through the front office. It must be ensured that COVID-appropriate behaviour is followed by those visiting the offices. In panchayats where the test positivity rate (TPR) is high, only urgent services should be provided to emphasise disease prevention. Duties should be rearranged to suit employees who are COVID-19 positive. Precautions at home After duty, employees should take precautions as per COVID-19 guidelines when they reach home. If they develop any disease symptoms, they should follow the Health Department’s guidelines and inform their superiors.

28 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Lending timely succour in the time of pandemic||Jhansi Thomas’ five-member Kudumbashree micro-enterprise (ME) unit Samjees supplies tea, breakfast, lunch and dinner to 50 people at the COVID-19 first-line treatment centre (FLTC) in the Pettah Railway Hospital. Samjees, set up five years ago, functions from a rented accommodation at Muttada. The women work in stretches in the kitchen, only two of the five are engaged in cooking at a time. Of course, if the orders are large, say for a large function or event, the rest too chip in. For the Pettah FLTC, the women cook the food and pack the parcels, while two men help with the delivery. This is not the first time Samjees is supplying food to those affected by COVID-19. Last year, they initially supplied tea to the COVID-19 cell at the District Collectorate. During the lockdown, they prepared food for those who had no means of filling their stomach. Ready to serve more Then, when the FLTCs opened, they sent food to Poojappura Panchakarma Hospital, ACE College of Engineering at Thiruvalla, Chelsa Hospital, Cordova and Rosa Mystica schools at Poonthura and Vizhinjam, Beema Maheen Hospital at Beemapally and so on. They also prepared food for the destitute housed at Fort school and Priyadarsini Hall. All the orders together would come to more than 500 a day, says Ms. Thomas, who is ready to serve more people in this second wave of the pandemic. Already, Samjees is providing tea and snacks to those thronging the Jimmy George Indoor Stadium for vaccination, says Ms. Thomas. As more FLTCs open in the district, Kudumbashree ME units have begun supplying food to those under treatment. Four ME units – Vigneswara, Sruthi, Samjees and Prathyasa – are providing food to 500 people in FLTCs set up at the Institute of Management in Government, Poojappura, Peroorkada ESI Hospital, Pettah Railway Hospital, Ayranimuttam , Vattiyurkavu and Manvila in the city. Auxiliary support Besides food, the Kudumbashree is pitching in to support the battle against COVID-19 in other ways. It has provided manpower through 100 people on daily wages for cleaning operations at government medical college hospital here, besides 30 people to other hospitals through the National Health Mission. It has also made available 20 people who have completed BSc Nursing to the medical college hospital. Its disinfection teams are sanitising government and private offices and institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lending-timely-succour-in-the-time-of-pandemic/article34427128.ece

Shylaja here on Tuesday night to review the oxygen availability in the State decided to set up oxygen audit committees at district and State levels for the optimal usage of oxygen in hospitals. The meeting was called in anticipation of a possible crisis ahead in oxygen supply, now that the number of daily new patients crossed 32,000. The meeting reviewed the daily oxygen production in the State and usage and the anticipated increase in demand in the coming weeks. At present, about 220 metric tonnes of oxygen was available in government hospitals and the daily requirement (for both COVID and non-COVID care) is about 100 metric tonnes. Buffer stock After meeting the daily demand, the oxygen production plant in the State has a buffer stock of 510 metric tonnes. The meeting discussed the feasibility of increasing the buffer stock to 1,000 metric tonnes, which would help the State face any exigency. District Collectors who participated in the meeting pointed out the possible increase in oxygen requirement, in proportion to the increase in patient load. As part of the steps to be taken for the optimal utilisation of available oxygen, it was decided to coordinate the training of the personnel handling oxygen cylinders so that oxygen leakage can be minimised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/oxygen-audit-panels/article34427630.ece

The data are to be submitted as weekly updates, according to an April 20 letter sent by the Ministry to all State governments, Power Department officials said. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), which employs 33,000 people, has asked its field offices to provide weekly updates on vaccination coverage among employees above the age of 45 who have received the first dose and those who have received both doses. The KSEB has also asked its Accounts Rendering Units (ARU) under the circle offices to provide weekly data on employees testing positive and recoveries. The KSEB has not reported alarming levels of COVID-19 among its employees so far, an official of the State-run power utility said. While the country's power sector is listed as an essential service, the employees have not been treated as a priority category for inoculation, officials said. The KSEB, in fact, had written a letter to the State government in this regard, given the nature of work carried out by the KSEB staff and the need to provide 24x7 power. With the State grappling with the second wave of the pandemic, the State-run power utility had rolled out a set of guidelines last week for ensuring uninterrupted power supply while keeping the employees safe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/centre-seeks-data-on-infections-in-power-sector/article34427614.ece
28 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Getting to know nuances of space economy||From that first sounding rocket launch from Thumba in 1963, the Indian space programme has come a pretty long way, contributing vastly to the growth of science and technology and the economy. But exactly how big is the country’s space economy? Now, two premier institutions in Thiruvananthapuram are attempting to capture a realistic picture of this critical aspect of India’s spacefaring experience. The Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), under the Department of Space, and the Centre for Development Studies (CDS), Ulloor, are collaborating on a research project to map the contours of the country’s evolving space economy. The decision is viewed as coming at the right time, not less for the fact that Central policies envision an expansion of the space sector with private participation. This, along with the emergence of private firms and start-ups involved in space tech-based products would make it the proper time to track the space ecosystem, IIST director V.K. Dadhwal said. Attempts in this direction had been made in the past, such as the work by U. Sankar (The Economics of India's Space Programme). But the times were different then and the space economy was not evolved as it is today, Dr. Dadhwal said. Methodologies Under the research project, the institutions would seek to map the size of the country’s space economy using internationally-accepted methodologies and determine its impact on the socio-economic fabric, CDS director Sunil Mani said. In the long run, it would aid the formulation of policies on evidence-based data and realistic comparisons with other space economies, he said. The space economy went beyond the annual budget of the Indian Space Research Organisation, and encompasses the direct and indirect economic benefits accruing from the use of space technology in multiple sectors, pointed out Shaijumon C.S., Associate Professor of Economics, IIST, who initiated the project. “'We are trying to measure it, and how it has developed the economy.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/getting-to-know-nuances-of-space-economy/article34427615.ece

PETA India wants the Act to be, at minimum, less speciesist (i.e. less exploitative of animals) than it is now. Other recommendations include increasing penalties for cruelty to animals to a range between Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 1 lakh and up to five years of imprisonment. For a cognisable offence or a second non-cognisable offence, the group also recommends seizure of the person’s animal and preventing him or her from owning or working with any other animal. PETA India suggests prohibiting the caging of aerial birds, stopping the use of animals in circuses, eliminating all dissection of animals for teaching and training, ending the use of captive elephants for performances, banning the sacrifice of animals, and expanding consideration of types of cruelty to include sexual abuse of animals, among other reforms, to prevent suffering. Modern society “This 60-year-old legislation is being considered for revision for the first time, and it must reflect modern society’s concern for animals,” says PETA India chief executive officer Manilal Valliyate. “It’s vital that efforts should be made to update the Act to match scientific knowledge that animals are thinking, feeling beings who do not want to be caged, chained, harmed or killed.” On 15 April, the AWBI organised an online stakeholder consultation inviting suggestions regarding amendment to the PCA Act in recognition of the increasing incidences of cruelty towards animals and the demand from society to enhance the meagre penalties for animal abuse. Members of Parliament have requested amendments in this regard, two private Bills were introduced in Parliament and the Supreme Court (SC) has observed the necessity of an amendment as well. As presented by the AWBI, the government’s major considerations for amendments include determination of penalties, cognisability of offences and the establishment of State animal welfare boards as per the direction of the SC. The AWBI had advised the stakeholders to submit their comments, if any, by April 25.  The changes proposed also include replacing the pronoun “it” with “he” or “she” when referring to animals||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/peta-india-urges-anti-speciesist-approach-in-act-revision/article34427076.ece

28 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Revised pay scales for employees to take some more days||It will be some more days for the employees and pensioners of the State government to take home their revised salaries which saw a significant hike. The government is yet to complete some formalities pertaining to fixation of the salary structure of employees in different categories for preparing salary bills which will be submitted to treasury/Pay and Accounts Office. The process starts with upgradation of service records of employees with new pay scales and this will be followed by preparation of reports by drawing and disbursement officers in different departments. The employee-wise lists prepared department-wise will thereafter be sent to the treasury offices or pay and accounts office. Once these details are recorded after due verification by the officials concerned, the government will be in a position to prepare salary bills of employees. Procedure has to be followed in the revision of pension too, but the process is said to be much easier as it would be done at the level of pension payment offices with the available software. The procedure however is said to be delayed as the formal orders announcing the pay revision of different categories of the staff are not issued. The draft guidelines of the revised salaries had been prepared by the departments concerned, but the final orders are yet to come out. As the deadline for submission of the new salary bills ended after third week of this month, the government was understood to have sent bills with old pay scales to the offices concerned. Senior officials said the process would be initiated after formal orders on the pay revision are issued. “Once the file is approved, from that point it will take two weeks,” a senior official told The Hindu . It may be recalled that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announced 30% fitment to employees who had been awaiting implementation of the pay revision for almost three years. The 30% fitment hike announced by the Chief Minister is significant in that it was announced after the Pay Revision Commission headed by retired bureaucrat C.R. Biswal recommended 7.5% hike with an estimated additional expenditure of over Rs. 2,200 crore annually on the State ex-chequer. Moreover, the Chief Minister made the announcement at a time when the State was facing severe financial crisis following drop in revenues on account of COVID pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/revised-pay-for-staff-to-take-time/article34427496.ece
28 April 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Former PCC chief MSR passes away||Former PCC president and senior Congress leader M. Satyanarayana Rao (MSR) breathed his last early on Tuesday in the city due to age-related issues. He was ailing for some time. The 88-year old former Parliamentarian, popularly known as MSR, is survived by wife, two daughters and two sons. Hailing from Vedira village in Ramadugu mandal of Karimnagar district, MSR was elected a Parliament member thrice. He actively participated in the 1969 Telangana movement and was jailed for several months. During the agitation days, he was elected to Parliament on the Telangana Praja Samiti (TJS) ticket. After the party was merged with the Congress, he was elected twice to Parliament and headed various parliamentary committees. MSR was a strong proponent of Telangana even in the new millennium. MSR started his political career during his student days in Karimnagar and continued when he joined the Osmania University for Law course. He was also part of the Youth Congress and went on to serve as PCC president in the combined Andhra Pradesh from 2000 to 2004 when Telugu Desam Party N. Chandrababu Naidu was at his peak. After the Congress came to power in 2004, he served in the Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddy cabinet from 2004 to 2007 and as chairman of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) from 2007. His political clout in New Delhi was enormous given his association with Congress leaders since Jawaharlal Nehru days. He was feared as well as respected by Andhra Pradesh leaders given his openness in appreciation or criticism. His provocation of Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief and Karimnagar MP K. Chandrasekhar Rao to resign to prove the popularity of Telangana sentiment was considered a key moment in the Telangana agitation. Responding to his challenge KCR resigned and contested again winning with a huge majority giving a major fillip to the Telangana agitation that was considered on the wane under YSR government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/former-pcc-chief-msr-passes-away/article34426850.ece

This is the first time that the birds, which are found mainly in South America and in Africa south of the Sahara, were spotted at the water body. The grey-headed gulls have red bills and legs and the underwings are dark grey in colour with black wing tips. They lay two to three eggs each in nests prepared in bushes on floating grass in the waters. Speaking to The Hindu , Divisional Forest Officer (DFO-Wildlife Management) C. Selvam said the Forest Department staff sighted the grey-headed gulls in the lake bed villages, which was rare. The birds migrate depending on the feed available in the wetlands, he said. “Grey-headed gulls are found mostly in wetlands in marshes, lakes and water bodies. We have records that these gulls roost and brood in Coringa sanctuary. This is the first time we sighted the migrant birds in Kolleru area,” the DFO said. “The South America and Africa breed birds prey on small fish, insects and snails. These birds migrate to other water bodies during the winter, and make noises like that of a crow,” Mr. Selvam said. “We noticed six to eight grey-headed gulls with other migratory birds in the lake. These gulls were sighted in Kikkisa grass and bushy areas at Pandillapalli Gudem, Gummalapadu, Atapaka, Pedda Kottada, Alapadu, Penchikalamarru and other lake bed villages,” said an official. The DFO said Kolleru was filled to the brim after many decades, and this year, many migratory birds arrived at the lake to roost while some lakhs of birds have flown off from the lush-green villages with their young ones. “Over five lakh birds were sighted at the lake, particularly at Atapaka Bird Sanctuary, also known as Pelicans’ Paradise. Along with pelicans, painted storks, common teals, stilts, large whistling teals, black tailed godwits, northern pintails and many other were birds were counted in our survey conducted at the lake,” Mr. Selvam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/grey-headed-gulls-spotted-at-kolleru-lake-for-the-first-time/article34426910.ece

Assistant public prosecutor Geoffrey George Joseph said the court would separately pronounce the verdict on Biju Radhakrishnan, first accused, as he had sought exemption from hearing the verdict following his quarantine. A third accused, B. Manimon, was acquitted. Deputy Superintendent of Police Jaison K. Abraham probed the case and submitted the chargesheet against them in December 2013. The case The prosecution case is that Saritha approached the victim as Lakshmi Nair, zonal manager of the company, while Biju introduced himself as K.B. Nair or Biju Nair. Saritha and Biju were running a firm called Team Solar Renewable Energy Solutions on Chittoor Road in Kochi. Saritha was found guilty under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code ( IPC). She was awarded one-year RI and fined Rs. 10,000 each in Sections 406, 471 and 419 and three-year RI and Rs. 10,000 in Section 420. The sentences would run consecutively. The court had to adjourn the verdict after Saritha failed to turn up. In February, the court issued an arrest warrant against Saritha and others for not showing up in court to hear the verdict in the case. Last week the Kasaba police arrested Saritha from her house in Thiruvananthapuram. She was also remanded in judicial custody in Kozhikode. She now would be shifted to the prison in Kannur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/saritha-nair-sentenced-to-6-years-ri/article34426846.ece

In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Anand Babu said that the farmers dependent on Sangam Dairy would be badly hit due to the government’s thoughtless activities. It was unfortunate that neither Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy nor his Cabinet colleagues had concern for the farmers. Farmers hardly benefited under the YSRCP rule during the last two years. Instead of encouraging Sangam Dairy to do more farmer-friendly activities, the ruling party leaders had attacked it in order to settle political scores, he alleged. The YSRCP leaders had promised to give a special bonus of Rs. 4 per litre, but after coming to power, they did nothing about it, the former Minister said. For decades, Sangam Dairy had been taking up many novel activities to give a better deal to farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-harming-farmers-tdp/article34427579.ece

A 41-year-old man, who was undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at CSR Block of King George Hospital, allegedly ended his life by jumping from the fourth floor of the building here on Tuesday. The deceased was identified as A. Venkat Rao, a resident of Punjab Hotel Junction. The police said that Venkat Rao was suspected to have been depressed after being infected with the virus. “According to the KGH officials, he fell from the CSR block terrace. We are yet to ascertain whether he had jumped to end his life or is there any other reason,” said the police.This is second suspected suicide in the CSR block of KGH. Earlier, on April 15, a 50-year-old patient Venkata Ramani from Anakapalle, had reportedly jumped to her death. In another incident, a 48-year-old man, V. Venkata Satyanarayana, was found dead in Mudasarlova reservoir on Monday. According to reports, Venkata Satyanarayana had left house and ended his life by allegedly jumping into the reservoir. In his suicide note, he had reportedly stated that he had been suffering from health issues for the last one week, apart from financial issues, as reasons behind taking the extreme step. “His body was sent for post-mortem. COVID-19 test would also be conducted,” said the police. Since the pandemic, the district has recorded 593 deaths. In this month so far, 47 persons succumbed to the coronavirus. Experts say many people, who are infected with the virus, especially during the second wave, have been facing tremendous mental pressure leading to depression and suicidal tendencies. “The virus has both short and long-term effects on the body. But it is the short-term effect that is creating fears in the minds, which are generated from various apprehensions,” said psychiatrist N.N. Raju. According to him, messages on social media are playing a key role in creating apprehensions among patients. The fear on financial viability and recovery is creating suicidal tendencies, said Prof. Raju.  Counselling centres Support from family and setting up of counselling centres at hospitals and tele-counselling can reduce the risk of suicidal tendencies among the patients, he said. Those who are in distress can contact the police helpline no. 100.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/amidst-surge-in-covid-cases-vizag-sees-3-suicides-in-10-days/article34427647.ece

28 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jalandhar Reddy’s surrender a big blow to Maoists in AOB||The surrender of M. Jalandhar Reddy alias Krishna, a senior member of the CPI (Maoist) Andhra-Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC), is a big blow to the Maoist movement in the border region. The Maoist leader who had a bounty of Rs. 20 lakh on his head, was said to be a trained military strategist and had played a key role in many ambushes, including masterminding the Balimela ambush in 2008 that left 38 Greyhound commandos dead. He was among the committed leaders in the region with RSU (Radical Student Union) background . According to a senior police officer, he was regarded for his organising and leadership skills and had the potential to rise to the level of the Maoist Central Committee. Most importantly, especially after the wiping out of the almost entire MKVB (Malkangiri-Koraput Visakhapatnam Border) division leadership in the 2016 Ramaguda encounter, he was calling the shots in the AOB region along with Aruna. As per sources in intelligence units, with him gone, now the leadership of AOB rests with Aruna. Sources say that the secretary of AOBSZC Gajarla Ravi alias Uday is sick , and he and Central Committee Member Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna , have been operating from Chhattisgarh for some time now. Terrain knowledge It is said Krishna had a good knowledge of the terrain and culture of the adivasis on Galikonda on the Andhra side and Gumma in the cut-off area on the Odisha side. As per a few seized documents, Krishna and Aruna were overseeing the revival of the movement in Galikonda region, where they were losing grip. But, forced by the aggressive movement of security forces on both sides of the border, Krishna had made Gumma his base. Krishna himself claimed that recruitment had been drying out, his surrender is being considered as a big blow to the movement in the AOB region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jalandhar-reddys-surrender-a-big-blow-to-maoists-in-aob/article34427569.ece

28 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Focus on pandemic rather than demolishing buildings: former MLA||The State government should focus on the pandemic, which is raging across all the districts, including Visakhapatnam, rather than demolishing buildings belonging to Opposition leaders, said former BJP MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju. “There is no availability of vaccines and about 1,700 persons, known to me, who have taken Covaxin as the first dose have been waiting for over 10 days for the second dose, but the State government is unable to provide them the second dose,” he alleged. “The medical stores are running short of drugs and common man is not getting beds in government hospitals. They are unable to approach private hospitals because of the exorbitant rates, but the government is not addressing these issues. Instead of focussing on these requirements, they are busy demolishing houses by engaging the GVMC officials,” he alleged.  Night curfew The former BJP MLA was also critical of the night curfew. “What is the use of imposing night curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.. Instead they can do it from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. for better effectiveness,” he said.  ‘Delay in test results’ He alleged that there was extraordinary delay in obtaining the RT PCR test results. “A common man has to wait for three to four days for the test results and is missing out on treatment during the critical initial days, due to delay in getting results. The government should see that the results are given within 24 hours, as private labs function, by employing more lab technicians and experts,” said Mr. Vishnu Kumar Raju. He also also urged the State government to review the pandemic situation at least a week before the board examinations and then take a final call. Mr. Raju said that the government should make drugs such as Remdesivir available to private hospitals also which are not registered as COVID hospitals, but treating coronavirus patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/focus-on-pandemic-rather-than-demolishing-buildings-former-mla/article34427658.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked the District Collectors to ensure that beds are allotted to coronavirus patients within three hours of making a call. He said that the Collectors should be vigilant on the spurt in the infections, with a focus on the measures to check the spread of the virus. During the weekly meeting on the grievance redressal programme ‘Spandana’ on Tuesday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the COVID-induced lockdown had dealt a blow on the lives of commoners and that the battle against the pandemic could be won with a concerted action plan. “Lockdown had dealt a blow on the people and the economy of the State, resulting in a loss of Rs. 20,000 crore to the exchequer. But, people in the State had suffered a loss of Rs. 80,000 crore,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, adding that vaccination was a sure way of combating the pandemic. Vaccination drive Around 11.30 lakh people above the age of 45 years have been administered two vaccine doses while 45.48 lakh people have got the first jab. The government will vaccinate all in the age group of 18-45 years free of cost. “Ensure that 104 services and the call centres are functioning properly. It should be a one-stop solution for all the queries relating to COVID-19,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Reviewing on the availability of beds at the COVID Care Centres, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that 355 hospitals had been identified with a bed capacity of 28,377, out of which 17,901 beds had been occupied. COVID Officers Among the major decisions taken during the meeting included appointment of Joint Collectors, WS/VS and Development as COVID Officers. The Joint Collectors have been delegated the power to inspect all hospitals, COVID Care Centres, helpdesks, and Aarogyasri hospitals and etc. The Chief Minister also asked the Collectors to ensure that 59 COVID Care Centres with 33,327 beds in the State are functioning properly. “Ensure that people feel at home in the COVID Care Centres,” he said. He also asked the Collectors to divide the COVID hospitals into clusters and appoint in-charges for them. Flying squads should be appointed to check the hospitals. “Ensure that all the medical staff and paramedics are appointed within 48 hours. COVID appropriate behaviour is a must in all public events. We must not allow more than 50 people to be assembled at one place,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy.

28 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||History will not forgive if we lose more vaccines: Eatala||Criticising the allotment of medical resources to State governments, Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender has said that asking States to buy and distribute vaccines against COVID-19 is “narrow-minded”. Stating that every rupee spent by the governments is tax money paid by the people, Mr Rajender pointed out that the vaccines are sold at Rs. 150 to the Centre while the rate changed to Rs. 600-1,000 for State governments. He said States will have to cough up more if they are to buy the vaccine directly from manufacturers. Requesting the Centre to assess requirement across the country and buy vaccines from wherever it is available, he added, “Or, support the manufacturers, take vaccines from them and be on the job of giving it to the people of our country. Companies were permitted to sell wherever they wanted to, at a profit. Vaccines produced here have already gone to other countries. History will not forgive if we lose more”. At a press conference held in Hyderabad on Tuesday evening, the Health Minister spoke about oxygen requirement, procurement and their plans to increase oxygen bed and also explained the reasons why some private hospitals are facing shortage of Remdesivir, an anti-viral drug. At another press conference held on April 18, he had criticised the Centre for taking control over the supply of Remdesivir. Oxygen supply The State is alloted to get liquid oxygen from Bhilai in Madhya Pradesh, Angul in Odisha and Bellary in Karnataka, among other places. While Bhilai is over 750 km from Hyderabad, Angul is 1,040 km far. Mr Rajender and senior officials from the Health department had earlier said that getting oxygen from the two places takes a lot of time, a luxury that cannot be afforded in the peak of the pandemic. Tanker shortage Besides, there is a shortage of tankers. So even if more oxygen can be procured, they have to wait for tankers to return from one place and then send them to another place. The department had earlier requested the Central government to allot a major part of the requirement from Bellary which is around 360 km from Hyderabad. From the earlier allotment of 20 metric tons, the allotment has been increased to 90 metric tons. Telangana’s current requirement is around 300 metric tons per day and is expected to rise to 400 metric tons. Stating that there is no shortage of oxygen at government hospitals and major corporate hospitals, Mr Rajender said the State is allotted 400 metric tons. Of the total, he said that 160 metric tons is produced here and a few more by small scale companies. Around 90 metric tons is coming from Bellary. Indian Air Force aircraft are being used to airlift tanker vans to other places. He said that five Liquid Oxygen Tanks are established in five government hospitals including Gandhi Hospital and Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and 12 more would be placed under the initiative. The Health Minister said that they would make available 3,010 more oxygen beds at government hospitals across the State in a week. The works have begun in this regard.  Companies were permitted to sell wherever they wanted to, at a profit. Vaccines produced here have already gone to other countries.

28 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Ambulance shortage grips city||Ambulance drivers in the State capital are stressed for COVID-19 related emergencies now, as there are only about 500 private medical vehicles and the requirement keeps going up. On the one hand, there are complaints that ambulances are not responding on time for emergencies, and on the other, the ambulance drivers are unable to attend the family members of patients managing to get admission at hospitals due to lack of beds. While patients wait for ambulances, these emergency vehicles are caught up in making rounds of hospitals with patients and their family members, who keep turning them away. This is leading to oxygen shortage in ambulances, as an oxygen cylinder meant to serve many patients is getting exhausted in serving only two or three patients in a day. Another major issue for drivers is that suppliers are charging five to six times the regular price of oxygen cylinders, so ambulances are having to charge patients much more to avoid losses. While denizens continue to complain about sky-rocketing prices of all things related to COVID-19 these days, ambulance drivers are stuck between a rock and a hard place, Greater Hyderabad Private Ambulance Owners’ Association president M’ Suresh told The Hindu . For instance, earlier, an ambulance charged Rs. 1,000 for shifting a patient from Gandhi Hospital, Secunderabad, to Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences, Panjagutta, and another Rs. 200 for oxygen supply, the current charges are about Rs. 3,000, three times higher. Mr. Suresh said that this was because the drivers are having to procure and wear PPE kits, and purchase oxygen cylinders at a much higher price, sanitise the vehicles, and in much higher volumes. One compact oxygen cylinder of six litres that used to cost Rs. 200 is now costing more than Rs. 1,000. Plus, the drivers are having to go to Katedahn, Balanagar or Cherlapally oxygen plants and wait for hours in this heat to get their cylinders, as the requirement and shortage are both on the rise. “Of course there is a shortage of ambulances in the city. On the one hand, COVID cases are going up exponentially, and on the other hand, so many private companies have leased ambulances for their use, leading to even more shortage of ambulances for the common public,” he said. Machiraju Sudhakar, a resident of Kukatpally, said that last week he paid Rs. 4,000 to shift his maternal uncle to a private hospital in Gachibowli. “It was an emergency. We were in a helpless state, and were forced to agree to the price he quoted. The driver was not ready to bargain,” he said. Drivers avoiding home While people continue to suffer from paucity of hospital beds and ready ambulances, ambulance drivers are staying away from their families as they are increasingly exposed to COVID patients. “To protect our family, we are sleeping in the vehicles or renting rooms on a shared basis, but avoiding home at all cost,” said one. ‘Deaths more than data’ The government’s official numbers for COVID cases and deaths are frightening, but the real scenario on the ground can be much worse. Ambulance drivers say they witness more than 60 deaths at Gandhi Hospital and about 20 more at TIMS every day for the last few days, whereas the official number of deaths reported on Tuesday was 52.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ambulance-shortage-grips-city/article34427480.ece
28 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||What is the step beyond night curfew, asks High Court||Observing that it was “not at all satisfied” with the information furnished by State government on COVID-19 situation in the State, Telangana High Court on Tuesday sought to know from the government: “What is the next step beyond night curfew”. “Telangana government has to take a call beyond night curfew”, observed a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy. The night curfew imposed by government comes to an end by Friday. Hearing a batch of PIL pleas on COVID-19 related matters, the bench noted that most of the issues raised in its previous 17-page order were not answered by the government. The bench earlier instructed the government to ensure private hospitals did not insist on RT-PCR report for admitting patients. But Advocate General B.S. Prasad failed to present any Government Order (GO) or notification from government on this point, the CJ observed. The bench reminded the AG of the letter from Union Home Secretary to all Chief Secretaries of the States for enforcing containment framework and restrictions in places witnessing high incidence of coronavirus. The letter clearly indicated that more than 60% of the patients would require oxygen or Intensive Care Unit beds if COVID-19 positivity rate was 10% or more. Referring to a newspaper report on alleged fleecing of patients at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS)-Gachibowli by the staff, the CJ said that it was “very unfortunate that people were being fleeced at government hospitals”. In such situation, it was better for people to approach private hospitals. “Please look at the hardships of the individuals being faced at TIMS”, the bench said. The report said ambulance drivers were exploiting families of COVID-19 patients. “A patient was asked to shell out Rs. 15,000 for shifting him from Narepally to TIMS hospital in Gachchibowli,” the CJ said, noting that it was like vultures living on flesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/what-is-the-step-beyond-night-curfew-asks-high-court/article34427493.ece
28 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Has the govt. window-dressed COVID-19 death figures?’||Telangana High Court on Tuesday wondered if the State government was resorting to “window dressing” over number of deaths due to COVID-19. Referring to the figures of death in the report submitted by the government before it, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said the numbers were far below the number of bodies piling up at crematoriums and burial grounds in the State. “If the State furnished fudged figures of deaths due to coronavirus, then people would not fear deaths due to the virus. it will be more damaging and harm public,” the Chief Justice observed. Clear information on the matter would drive people to get vaccinated and keep themselves safe. The bench directed Advocate General B.S. Prasad to ensure a proper record of the number of bodies cremated at various crematoriums and burial grounds was maintained. These figures should match with the deaths declared by the government, the bench said. Hearing a batch of Public Interest Litigation petitions on COVID-19-related matters, the bench issued notices to State Election Commission to furnish an action plan for managing crowds during the polls to urban local bodies to be held on Friday in five districts of the State. Gathering of people during the polls could turn out to be super spreaders of coronavirus, the High Court said. Directing the government to crack down on hoarders of oxygen cylinders, the bench remarked that “oxygen requirement was for the desperate purposes and not for luxury”. The bench stressed the need to supply oxygen at affordable rates to the needy patients. It directed the government to make available sufficient number of body bags at government and private hospitals for wrapping up bodies of persons who died of coronavirus. The dead patients deserve dignity in death, the court said citing media reports that a large number of unwrapped bodies were lying unattended at crematoriums and burial grounds. Perusing the status report of the Director-General of Police (DGP), the bench said it was “surprised that only four cases were booked for not maintaining social distance”. “It is a joke. If police can check a car parking place randomly, they can find a minimum of 15 cases,” the Chief Justice said. The court noted that the figures furnished by the Director-General of Police were laughable. Referring to two cases registered for large gatherings, the court remarked that the police were not doing their duty. The court directed the DGP to sensitise local police on norms of wearing face masks. Police personnel should counsel people when the latter were found not wearing masks properly. “Any violation should be dealt with strictly”, the bench said The bench expressed dissatisfaction over the DGP report not mentioning about vaccination of inmates of prisons, orphanages. “Taking these people from their places to centres of vaccination would make them vulnerable to COVID-19”, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/has-the-govt-window-dressed-covid-19-death-figures/article34427492.ece
28 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Private hospitals warned against exorbitant billing||Desperate to save their loved ones gasping for breath, family members are forced to shell out anywhere between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 1 lakh for immediate admission of COVID-19 patients into ICUs. There are several tragic accounts of people spending their lifetime savings on treatment at corporate and private hospitals. In some cases, they are forced to do this as major government hospitals are full. The exorbitant charges by private hospitals was called out by Health Minister Eatala Rajender at a press conference here on Tuesday evening. He reminded that charges for treatment decided by the State government are still applicable, including charges for COVID-19 tests. Stuck in a helpless situation, anxious and angry, people who spent lakhs of rupees questioned what action will be taken against the hospitals charging exorbitant amounts. Besides, several families were informed by private hospitals that they have to pay Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1 lakh before admitting a patient. They were also asked to clear the bills daily. According to the government order issued on June 15, 2020, charges for treatment in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) without ventilator support is Rs. 7,500 per day. The charges are Rs. 9,000 per day if a patient is provided with ventilator support in ICU. However, some services or products are excluded from the capped prices such as medicines and diagnostic tests. On December 21 last year, the State had capped prices of RT-PCR tests at lab at Rs. 500, and Rs. 750 for sample collection at home. However, many private hospitals and labs are not sticking to the prices. There is heavy demand for the tests at private labs too. To lodge complaints, the Health department has advised people to call ‘104’ or contact on WhatsApp at 9154170960. However, highly placed sources in the department said that the charges are not practical for corporate hospitals considering the quality of services provided there. Mr Rajender said though they can send teams and lock hospitals violating norms, they do not follow this strategy. Rather, he said that harassing people for business will not be tolerated in these tough times. “We have a duty to save lives,” he said, adding that some resources are being provided to private hospitals too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/private-hospitals-warned-against-exorbitant-billing/article34427470.ece
28 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||A war room that attends to COVID emergency calls||At 1.40 p.m. on Tuesday, a volunteer at Cyberabad COVID control room received a call for an ambulance to shift a 66-year-old COVID patient to a hospital. The ambulance reached the patient by 1.55 p.m., and she was shifted to Nature Cure Hospital in another 30 minutes. In another emergency, an elderly couple was shifted to a private hospital at Somajiguda from their residence in Old Bhoiguda in less than one hour on Tuesday afternoon. Both aged 66 and 58 years, got infected with the virus and were experiencing breathlessness when the control room received the emergency call at 3.02 p.m. This free ambulance service is provided by the Cyberabad police for COVID patients. Currently, the Commissionerate has 16 ambulances, which ply round-the-clock in the State capital for shifting patients from their houses to hospital, and vice versa. The first-of-its-kind and the only-run COVID control room by any police unit across the country has functioned as a ‘war room’ for the last one year now, attending over 200 calls from the twin cities every day. “This control room is functioning on a war footing now. We are glad to have helped out so many patients and their families who were in distress. This will continue as a yagnam as we are prepared to be available for people to the maximum extent that we can,” Commissioner Vishwanath Channappa Sajjanar said. Stating this as a true example of people-friendly initiative, a concept widely promoted by the Telangana Police, Mr .Sajjanar said that apart from their daily investigation duties, their personnel are doing their best to help COVID-19 patients. “Nowhere in the country, there is a control room run by the police for arranging plasma, blood, hospital beds, ambulances, and attend any medical emergency,” the officer said. According to ACP G. Hanumantha Rao, who coordinates with the volunteers at the control room, they get more than 200 calls for plasma, ambulances and other medical services, daily. “After getting data from the hospitals, our volunteers are convincing the recovered COVID warriors to donate plasma and save lives,” he said. There are even calls from Guwahati, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, and Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-war-room-that-attends-to-covid-emergency-calls/article34427482.ece
28 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Proud to serve society by driving O2 tankers’||Ferrying thousands of passengers in city buses for years was a different experience than bringing in oxygen tankers from Odisha, say drivers of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC), who drove back the tankers carrying medical grade liquified oxygen to the State, which is also called gold these days and is saving thousands of lives during the pandemic. On Thursday night, 10 experienced Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) drivers from the Greater Hyderabad Zone were hand-picked to drive back the tankers loaded with liquid oxygen from Angul, Odisha. They were taken to Begumpet Airport, and on Friday morning flown in two Indian Air Force transport aircraft along with the empty tankers to Odisha. On Tuesday the RTC sent eight more drivers to fly along with empty oxygen tankers to bring in liquid oxygen from Odisha. “They were mobilised in a span of one hour. Our drivers have done a great service to society by getting oxygen tankers to save thousands of lives in Hyderabad and across Telangana,” Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) Managing Director Sunil Sharma told The Hindu . M. Babaiah, who on a regular day drives suburban service 218 (Koti-Patancheru-Koti), drove the liquid oxygen tanker for more than 18 hours and reached Hyderabad on Monday evening. “My family and I are proud to serve society in this way. We had no time to waste, so drove the vehicle continuously and reached the city on time,” he said. “Until we reached the city, I forgot the meaning of sleep. I was transporting a precious material which saves the lives of many,” 45-year-old Babaiah, who works at Musheerabad-I depot said. Another driver, P. Narender, who boarded a flight for the first time ever, said that he was happy to do his bit and help society in saving human lives during the coronavirus pandemic. “The journey from Angul to Hyderabad gave me immense satisfaction, both personally and professionally,” he said. As the tanker company driver reported sick on Thursday, Mr. Narender along with N. Malla Reddy, an RTC driver from Midhani depot, drove back the oxygen tanker to the city. “It was a non-stop journey of 30 hours,” he said. All the drivers, who were sent to Angul, had the experience of driving vehicles carrying hazardous material before joining the Corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/proud-to-serve-society-by-driving-o2-tankers-from-odisha/article34427495.ece

28 April 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||‘TRS resorting to coercive tactics’||Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy lashed out at the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), accusing it of trying to win the municipal elections at all cost by “flagrantly misusing power” and resorting to “coercive tactics.” Ahead of the April 30 elections to Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) around 750 votes were found enrolled from an educational institution and a hostel attached to it, owned by a TRS elected representative in Khammam, he charged, alleging that as many as 900 votes were found registered from a boy’s hostel and its surrounding few houses in the KMC limits. “On what basis have such a large number of votes been registered from the specific addresses,” he asked, alleging that the ruling TRS leaders were making a mockery of democracy for electoral gains. Mr. Reddy was speaking to mediapersons here on Tuesday after participating in a road show to garner support for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidates on the concluding day of the electioneering for the KMC elections. “The TRS government ignored the concerns expressed by all political parties over conduct of the municipal elections during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said accusing the TRS regime of exerting pressure to hold the civic polls heedless of the severity of the pandemic. He alleged that the TRS dispensation failed to fulfill its promises to shelterless poor people, unemployed youths and others. “Not even a single teacher, lecturer and professor post was filled nder TRS regime,” Mr Reddy pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-resorting-to-coercive-tactics-says-kishan/article34427500.ece

According to sources, a person who came for testing at the district headquarters hospital died while standing in the queue. It is not clear whether the deceased had already tested positive. In another case, the body of an unidentified person wrapped in cloth was sent out from the hospital in the afternoon. The third was the death of a 45-year-old woman from Marx Nagar in the town, who developed COVID symptoms and tested positive. She was admitted to a private hospital initially, but as her condition worsened and she needed oxygen support, doctors suggested to get her admitted to a hospital where it is available. However, by the time her relatives could get her admitted to the government hospital, she breathed her last. “She might have been saved had she got admission in the government hospital,” said a family member on condition of anonymity. No mention in bulletin As usual, these were not reflected in the bulletin released by the officials. In a related development, TRS leaders — Cane Development Corporation former chairman Vijayender Reddy, ATMA chairman Srinivas Reddy, party town secretary Nagaraju, Srikanth Goud and others — met Additional Collector Rajarshi Shah and urged him to take steps for better treatment to COVID patients at the district hospital and start using ventilators kept unused for long.

The portal also can indicate a particular time slot instead of allowing people to select morning or forenoon so that all need not crowd at same time as per slot opted. Moreover, since the target age group is eased now, it would good if vaccination centres can be categorised as those giving first dose and those giving second dose. Vaccine should be available freely more than attempting to give it for free. N Nagarajan, Hyderabad    I am a senior citizen and took the first dose of Covaxin on March 18. I was due for the second dose on April 16, but was told that the vaccines are in shortage and my request might be considered in a week’s time. However, it has still not happened. Now that the Chief Minister has promised to monitor the vaccination programme personally after recovering from COVID-19 in a couple of days, I wish him a quick recovery and hope to get the second dose shortly. K.Seshagiri Row, Hyderabad    It is painful to note that the governments have allowed vaccine manufacturers to jack up the prices in the middle of the pandemic. There should some kind of social responsibility during these trying times, more so because these firms benefitted with the government’s support in various ways. I request the judiciary to intervene suo motu and fix the vaccine rate at Rs. 150 throughout the country. T.Kailash Ditya, Hyderabad    I took my first dose of vaccine at a corporate hospital duly paying the requisite amount but am yet to receive any intimation regarding the second jab. I tried to contact the hospital through e-mail and phone to find out the schedule for second dose but there was no response at all. When I went to another centre, I was stunned to learn that my first dose has not been recorded on the government’s Co-Win portal. Similar may the experience of many. A thorough review of the work done by vaccinating agencies is required. K.V.P.Rao, Hyderabad    It will be of great help if hospitals inform about the availability of the second dose of the vaccine when stocks are available rather than make us run around or call them multiple times. I feel it would also be advisable to segregate 45-60 years persons from those above the age of 60 years at the waiting hall of a vaccination centre. B. Rajendra Prasad, Hyderabad    I urge health authorities to initiate home vaccination for senior citizens considering the second wave of the pandemic and the risk of exposure to infection considering the number of people gathering at centres for the jab. The elderly have been running around for the last few days for the second dose and waiting endlessly for intimation about the availability. Kumar Shastri, Hyderabad    I had taken both doses of Covishield in two separate private hospitals at Nizampet and Kukatpally. I am happy to write that at both the places, the staff were courteous, registered my documents, took down my vital parameter readings and ensured that the vaccination process as well as observation period was smooth.

28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Kin line up to get oxygen refill as patients gasp for breath||A helpless Shobha (32), a resident of Paharganj, was stopped by security officials outside an oxygen-filling plant in west Delhi’s Naraina on Tuesday morning. She cried and pleaded with the officials to let her go and at least try. The guards belonging to the Delhi police and CISF, however, told her “ Madam, log kal raat se khade hain.. unka number bhi nahi aaya hai abhi [People have been standing since last night and they’re yet to get their cylinders refilled]”. However, seeing her cry inconsolably while carrying the heavy cylinder on her shoulder, they let her go. Shobha’s 40-year-old sister was at home gasping for breath after getting infected by the virus and she had been running around since morning looking for oxygen as there were no hospital beds available. A few steps ahead of the barricades, a long queue of people standing with their empty oxygen cylinders waited for their turn. Jitender Kumar, a resident of Paschim Puri, said he had been standing in the queue since 4 a.m. to get the cylinder filled for his brother-in-law because he doesn’t want to lose his third relative. “We have already lost two people to COVID-19 because we couldn’t get a bed in a hospital. I am standing here trying to save the third person,” he said. Irritated with the situation, he said that the officials have conveyed that they will only cater to the needs of hospital. “There are no beds available in hospitals and they are saying they won’t give us oxygen tomorrow. Where will we go? There’s no value for people’s lives outside hospitals,” he asked. Shankar Gehlot, 65, an administrator at a Jaipur hospital, who had come to Delhi to help his daughter, a resident of Pitampura as his son-in-law is infected and his oxygen dropped to 80. “I have been standing here since 7 a.m. and it’s over five hours now and I don’t know whether I’ll get oxygen or not. I am just waiting for my turn,” he said, finding it tough to breathe easy himself. Narender and Virender, residents of Paschim Vihar, had come to get oxygen for both their parents and were in queue since 5.30 a.m. This wasn’t their first. Virender said that on Sunday, he came at 11.30 a.m. and was only able to get the oxygen at 12.30 a.m. On Monday, they claimed to have spent nine hours to get oxygen. “Both our parents are infected and their oxygen levels are very low. We don’t know what’s going to happen,” Virender said. Crying outside the plant was 25-year-old Sachin, resident of Uttam Nagar, who had reached at 11.30 a.m. and saw no hope of getting the oxygen as people had already been waiting for hours. “I have tried five hospitals since morning. My mother’s oxygen has dropped to 40 and I don’t know what to do,” he said. “We’ve won a war today,” said Pawan who got oxygen at noon after standing in queue all night, for his 38-year-old nephew. At Mayapuri oxygen-filling plant, barricades and police officers welcomed people who came inquiring. “People come here after seeing viral messages but in reality, this plant has not been entertaining people for at least two days now. Initially, they had even given oxygen for free but people started misusing,” a police officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/kin-line-up-to-get-oxygen-refill-as-patients-gasp-for-breath/article34427186.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||Two Lok Nayak Hospital nurses succumb to virus||Two nurses working at Lok Nayak Hospital, the largest Delhi government hospital, died on Tuesday, according to Delhi State Hospitals Nurses Union. While one nurse was tested positive and was under home isolation, the other nurse had “COVID-19 like symptoms” and had been admitted at a private hospital. The association demanded compensation for family members of both the nurses, considering them as “COVID warriors”.   Under home isolation Ravinder Kaur, 55, who worked in a COVID-19 ward was tested positive on April 17 and was under home isolation. “She was not having heavy symptoms. She had breakfast in the morning and had talked to one of our staffers also. But she then said that she was not feeling well and died suddenly,” said Shoukat Ali, vice president of the association. Ravinder was unmarried.  The second nurse, Elizabeth Joseph, 45, is from Kerala and is survived by her husband and two children. She was working in the pediatric department of the hospital, which was a non-COVID treatment facility. “Though it was a non-COVID facility, she also had high chances of getting virus from there as there are a lot of bystanders and attendants who come in there and are not tested for COVID-19. Also, she did not wear PPE kit to work as it was a non-COVID ward,” Mr. Ali said. “She had fever from April 15 but was tested negative. Her condition worsened and since she was negative and our hospital was a COVID facility, she was admitted at a private hospital. Scans had shown white patches in her lungs, which is a COVID-19 symptom. Her condition worsened and she passed away on Tuesday,” he said. Elizabeth had SLE disease and doctors had advised her not to take the vaccine, the association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/two-lok-nayak-hospital-nurses-succumb-to-virus/article34427434.ece

Singh said several companies in India were manufacturing the medicine and millions of vials of the drug must have been exported, “but we do not have enough to cater to our own patients”. Change in guidelines “Statistics show that shortage of the drug in Delhi is acute,” the High Court said as it directed the Centre, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) whether there has been any change in the guidelines with regard to administering Remdesivir. The court also asked the Central government on what basis it was deciding how much of the drug was to be allocated to Delhi and whether anyone can directly approach the manufactures or suppliers for buying the medicine. The court was hearing a plea by a lawyer who is suffering from COVID-19 and was able to get only three out of the six doses of Remdesivir required by him. Acting on the lawyer’s plea, the court directed the Delhi government to ensure the lawyer gets the remaining three vials of the medicine by 9 p.m. tonight. The court will hear the case again on April 28.

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Doctors need an audience with CM to address crisis’||D.K. Baluja, medical director of Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi where 20 patients died on Friday due to a shortage of oxygen, says uncertainty in supply of oxygen continues to be an hour-to-hour struggle that is coming in the way of treating patients. Excerpts from an interview.  What is the current situation at the hospital with regards to oxygen supply?  We received oxygen overnight from the Delhi government as well as other sources and are in a comfortable position. However, what we need to highlight, apart from the shortage, is the uncertainty of supply. It is the uncertainty of supply that is killing me. If the government tells me that this is the amount you will get every four hours or six hours, I can plan much better. If you assure me my quota and then not deliver the promised amount, I cannot plan the treatment of my patients. This needs thorough and accurate planning of how to use resourced during a shortage. The Delhi government announced a portal that will be updated every two hours on the need that hospitals have and the amount of oxygen available with manufactures and suppliers. Do you think this will help? That they have already done on April 22 and have issued a notification via the special secretary of Family Health and Welfare fixing my quota of oxygen. But my promised quota never came. When the tragedy happened in my hospital, my quota never came. It was delayed by 7.5 hours. In a hospital, this is a long time when we are battling to save lives every minute. When it finally arrived, we were able to save many patients, but the critically ill patients did not make it as the pressure of oxygen was low. Even while refilling, it takes time for the pressure to build up. We are promised a supply every 24 hours but when it does not arrive what can we do? Where does the buck stop in such a situation? What do you suggest is the way forward? I would suggest that the government immediately call an audience with the CMOs of the top hospitals in the city, preferably with the Chief Minister. Share with us the problem as we are the people at the receiving end and hear our views on how to combat the situation. We are professional people and have enough experience to find a solution. However, they make us coordinate with some secretary or the other on an hourly basis trying to arrange our supply. The CM needs to take us onboard to ensure that this crisis is not repeated everyday instead of making us go through various secretaries to reach him. Do you feel that red tapism is coming in the way of handling the crisis? My appeal to the Chief Minister is to have a videoconference with us and try to listen to the problems at ground zero. Only when they understand the problems on the ground that they will be able to develop a system during this crisis. We have the best infrastructure at our hospital but if something like oxygen, that is not in our control, does not arrive, we will not be able to save lives. Have you had the chance to speak to the families of the patients who died due to the shortage of oxygen? I have not had the chance to speak to the families of all the 20 patients, but I have spoken to about four-five families as the crisis was still going. I had only 40% of my requirement and I was still fighting the situation to save the lives of the other patients admitted in the hospital.  When the tragedy happened in my hospital, my quota never came. It was delayed by 7.5 hours Jaipur Golden Hospital medical director||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/doctors-need-an-audience-with-cm-to-address-crisis/article34427188.ece

He said if former Cabinet Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu wants to contest against him then he is free to do so but that would only lead to the latter losing his security deposit. In an interview, the Chief Minister challenged Mr. Sidhu to clearly spell out whether he is a member of Congress party or not? “If yes, then his continuing rant against his Chief Minister and the government amounts to gross indiscipline”, said Captain Singh, adding the Congress dissident ought to choose the side he was on. He also said indulging in breaking the discipline of the party, BJP won’t take him back and as far as the Shiromani Akali Dal is concerned, they are also peeved with Mr. Sidhu. The Chief Minister also lauded the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Sunil Jakhar and said the latter is doing a good job and discharging his responsibility well so, there is no question of Mr. Sidhu being appointed in his place. On the issue of Cabinet Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Sunil Jakhar tendering their resignations, the Chief Minister said he had rejected the same.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/punjab-chief-minister-hits-out-at-sidhu/article34427459.ece

28 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Across India, a desperate hunt for COVID-19 care||As COVID-19 positive cases keep rising steeply across the country, in many States, patients and their relatives are put through the wringer literally, as they hunt for oxygen, beds, ventilators and ICUs. Hospitals which have mild and moderate COVID-19 patients but no ventilators or ICU services, are also in a fix if the health condition of a patient deteriorates. Delhi, the national capital region and most parts of northern India continued to reel under acute shortage of beds, oxygen and essential drugs on Tuesday. At Apollo Hospital in Delhi, angry relatives attacked hospital staff, after a patient died while waiting for an ICU bed. People could be seen attacking hospital security guards with sticks. At least 45 people are known to have died in two hospitals on account of oxygen-supply linked issues. In Bihar, a woman was seen on camera outside a private hospital in Patna pleading with a mediaperson to arrange an oxygen cylinder. The hospital had earlier discharged her husband due to lack of oxygen supply in the hospital but when she did not get a bed in the other COVID-19 designated private hospitals in the city, she was forced to return to the same hospital. The district administration has designated 90 registered private hospitals in Patna for treatment of COVID-19 patients but most of them were forced to turn away patients on Tuesday due to lack of oxygen or beds. Futile wait in U.P. In Uttar Pradesh, which recorded 265 new deaths and 32,993 new cases according to the State Health Department, the desperate hunt for beds and oxygen continued. In Agra, Priya Singh could not find a bed for her father, 57, whose oxygen level was falling. “We desperately need a hospital. He is unable to even move. We are returning home now as his condition is getting worse standing on the road,” Ms. Singh said. In Kanpur, the second worst-affected district, Amit Tiwari has been waiting for more than a day to get his mother admitted to a private hospital with ventilator facilities due to a delayed COVID-19 test result. In Gorakhpur, Sanjeev Singh’s family was also desperately seeking help to admit him to an ICU bed since Sunday. As an urgent measure, he was admitted to a government hospital but his oxygen levels continued to drop as it was not equipped with the necessary facilities. The situation was similar in Gujarat. Faced with acute shortage of oxygen, hospitals in Surat have threatened to stop new admissions if the supply is not restored. The two main government hospitals in the city refused to admit new patients. On Monday, representatives of the Indian Medical Association, Surat, urged Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to immediately increase the supply of oxygen to save 4,000 patients in various hospitals. More than 50 patients have reportedly died in Navsari, Surat, Banaskantha and Rajkot due to shortage of oxygen in the past 10 days.  Overwhelmed in Pune In Maharashtra, Pune has nearly one lakh active cases and has reported more than 12,500 deaths while witnessing an average daily spike of more than 10,000 fresh cases for over three weeks now. The district’s overburdened health infrastructure is cracking under the strain of the second wave, with all major hospitals overwhelmed with frantic calls for critical care beds. Almost all of the 1,400-odd ICU with ventilator beds were occupied till Monday. Almost every affected family had a horror story to tell. Tanay Jadhav says four of his close relatives, including his in-laws tested positive on April 17. “However, we did not receive their test reports until April 21... we are under constant pressure from the hospital, where my mother-in-law has been admitted, to secure a ventilator bed for her somewhere else so as to make room for less critical patients who are waiting,” he said. With the daily case load having crossed 30,000 in Karnataka, the desperate search for drugs, beds and oxygen remains unabated, while the government has imposed a lockdown to stem the spread of the virus. Finding an ICU and ventilator beds in Hyderabad has turned into anguish for family members. While the State Health department claimed that the website health.telangana.gov.in, displays real time status of beds availability, patients strongly contested that. According to the website, out of 9,428 ICU or ventilators beds in the hospitals, 3,526 were vacant on Tuesday evening. However, patients and relatives claim that the real situation is far removed from this, and took to Twitter to post bed/ventilator requirements.  Unaffordable in A.P. Though the Andhra Pradesh government has permitted more private hospitals to treat COVID patients and increased bed capacity in Government hospitals, getting admitted to one was still a tough task. While most government facilities are full, treatment at private hospitals has been unaffordable for a majority. According to officials, there are over 40,000 beds for COVID treatment in the state apart from the Covid Care Centres set up in every district to treat patients with mild symptoms. However, as per the COVID dashboard there are 33,922 beds in 398 hospitals. Officials said there was no scarcity of oxygen and the demand of 320 tonnes per day was being met. In Chennai, a 64-year-old woman who tested positive is being treated in a government hospital for nearly 10 days. While they will continue to keep her, they have told her son that she needs high pressure oxygen flow that is available only in an intensive care unit, which they are currently unable to offer. Jaheer Hussain of TOSH Hospital, explained: “We are a mid-range orthopaedic hospital converted to a COVID centre, and can admit patients with mild to moderate complications, with SPO2 up to 85. If their oxygen saturation falls below this range we have to refer them to bigger hospitals,” he said. In Odisha, again, people say the situation is worse than government claims of available beds. All major private hospitals in the capital Bhubaneswar are turning patients away citing unavailability of beds. In Jammu and Kashmir, there is rare good news, as leading government-run hospitals in Srinagar and Jammu have a bed occupancy rate between 70 to 90%, officials said. According to data from districts, bed occupancy is still around 50%. Kerala had doubled the number of ventilators (3,776 both public and private) and ICU beds (9,735 both public and private) in the State; and increased the oxygen production. Hospital bed and ICU bed capacity was enhanced over two times in many government medical colleges, while all private medical colleges have been asked to give up 75% of the beds for COVID patients. “But every surge capacity has a limit. If the case graph continues to rise the way it has been this past week, our system too may not hold up ,” says Mohammed Asheel, Executive Director, Kerala State Security Mission.

28 April 2021||Ghaziabad,||Dog gnaws at body of COVID victim in Hindon||Adding to the misery of a family of a 51-year-old man — who died due to COVID-19 — his body kept in a queue at the Hindon crematorium was gnawed at by a stray dog. The man, who was employed as an orderly in the district judge’s court of Ghaziabad, had tested positive on Thursday. After he developed breathing problems, he was admitted to the civil hospital. Triloki Singh, a colleague, said the patient was under treatment but his condition deteriorated, and he was referred to Santosh Medical College on Saturday. He showed signs of improvement and his oxygen level reached 80 from 40. But within a few hours, his oxygen level again fell to 30. At 1 a.m. on Sunday, he suffered a cardiac arrest and doctors declared him dead. The hospital handed over the body to the family. The body was wrapped in a PPE kit as per COVID protocols. “We were trying for an ambulance since 1.30 a.m. and finally managed to arrange one. We then reached the Hindon cremation ground at 8 a.m. At the site, we were told that token will be given at 10 a.m. because they already have bodies in the queue,” said Mr. Singh. The family said they kept the body in a queue and went to stand under a shade nearby as they were told that their turn would come by 6 p.m. “Around 2 p.m., a passer-by informed that a dog was gnawing at a body kept in the queue. Many at the spot rushed to see what had happened. We found that a dog had torn through the PPE kit of the body and had eaten a part of the face. We immediately raised the matter with the district administration staff at Hindon. We managed to cremate the body at 3.30 p.m,” said a relative. After the incident, many staged a protest at Hindon. Later, a senior official said they would fence the area to prevent the entry of stray animals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dog-gnaws-at-body-of-covid-victim/article34427421.ece
28 April 2021||Mumbai,||Sonia asks Thorat to ensure speedy vaccination in State||Even as the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government double thinks on free vaccination in Maharashtra, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday directed senior party leader and State Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat to ensure speedy completion of vaccination in the State. Mr. Thorat has already said that the party’s stand is to ensure free vaccination in the State. Ms. Gandhi had spoken to Mr. Thorat to take stock of the situation in Maharashtra, which is one of the worst-affected States due to COVID-19. “She was satisfied that the MVA government in Maharashtra is transparently handling the COVID-19 situation. She took information about the measures taken and expressed satisfaction about the efforts of the State government,” Mr. Thorat said. Two days after Nationalist Congress Party leader and Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik said that the government would provide free vaccination to those in the age group of 18 to 45, the government seems to be rethinking on this strategy. According to sources, many in the government believe that blanket free vaccination announcement should not be made and instead those who can afford should be asked to pay for it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sonia-asks-thorat-to-ensure-speedy-vaccination-in-state/article34427122.ece
28 April 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Leak occurs in oxygen plant at Panvel hospital||A minor oxygen leak occurred at the sub-district hospital in Panvel on Tuesday morning. While the leak was being controlled, the patients were provided oxygen from Dura cylinders. Teams from the fire brigade, police, and Panvel City Municipal Corporation rushed to the hospital. “After learning about the leak at the four metric tonne oxygen plant around 11 a.m., we deployed staff to spray water for 24 hours. We immediately arranged oxygen for patients from an alternative source: Dura cylinders. The leak which originated at the valve was very minor and was controlled in a few hours. Subsequently, the oxygen supply through the pipeline continued,” Deputy Municipal Commissioner Sanjay Shinde from Panvel City civic body said. Of the 20 Dura cylinders available for Kalamboli and Panvel hospitals, six were immediately shifted to the Panvel sub-district hospital, he said. “There were 168 COVID-19 patients of whom 126 were on oxygen support and none of them faced any issues,” Mr. Shinde said. Raigad Guardian Minister Aditi Tatkare visited the oxygen plant. After the Nashik oxygen leak incident, three staff have been stationed at the oxygen plant and they noticed the leak on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/leak-occurs-in-oxygen-plant-at-panvel-hospital/article34427119.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi govt. not giving correct data of COVID deaths, say civic bodies||North civic body Mayor Jai Prakash on Tuesday alleged that the Delhi government is not providing “correct figures” of COVID deaths in the Capital. “The Delhi government never gives correct figures for reasons best known to them. The last rites of those losing their lives to COVID are happening almost around the clock at Nigambodh Ghat, which is one of the most utilised facilities under the North body — 260 funerals took place despite its capacity of 152 yesterday [Monday],” Mr. Prakash said. “We compile cremation figures for a particular day till 6 p.m. but bodies keep coming beyond that time as well and are added to the next day’s report. If we changed the format to include last rites till midnight, the daily figures would be substantially higher,” he added. The Mayor, under whose jurisdiction 14 of the 29 funeral venues in the city lie, added that he had written to the Forest Department over the dwindling supply of wood for funeral pyres. He said he had requested the department to provide them with trees that can be used for this purpose before the current stock of wood gets exhausted. Discrepancy in data According to the combined records of the three Municipal Corporations of Delhi, 4,125 cremations and burials were performed between April 19 and till 6 p.m. on April 26. The Delhi government, however, recorded 2,477 COVID deaths over the same period. A Delhi government source said a significant reason for the mismatch of 1,345 bodies, in this case, was due to the deaths of COVID patients who either died on their way to the hospital or under circumstances where they could not secure admission on time. The dedicated capacity for the last rites of COVID patients at 29 funeral venues spread across the 11 municipal zones in Delhi has been enhanced by almost 75% over the last week but is still proving less. In fact, 20 funeral platforms recently created at two adjacent public parks in Sarai Kale Khan will, according to South civic body Mayor Anamika Mithilesh Singh, will be increased fivefold over the coming days. “The lockdown is leading to labour issues but, over the coming days, we will increase the number of funeral platforms from 20, which were just created at two public parks to 100,” she said. East body Mayor Nirmal Jain said funerals at the facilities under his jurisdiction began at 7 a.m. and went on till between 2 a.m. -3 a.m. on a daily basis. “Temporary platforms have been created to augment capacity and we will increase it further as and when required over the coming days,” he said. The capacity at crematoria and burial grounds on April 19 was 505; by April 26 this had been increased to 882 with the maximum increase in capacity, by 109 platforms, affected on Monday to bring it up from 773. The Mayors of the three civic bodies said they have been hoping to ensure that “no one is forced to return home” without being able to perform the last rites of their kin — both for the sake of public health safety as well as on humanitarian grounds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-govt-not-giving-correct-data-of-covid-deaths-say-civic-bodies/article34427555.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘Delhi to import oxygen tankers from abroad’||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that the Delhi government would, with the help of the Centre, import 21 ready-to-use oxygen plants from France and 18 oxygen tankers from Bangkok, to ensure a steady supply of oxygen in hospitals across the Capital. He thanked the Centre for allotting five additional oxygen tankers to Delhi and said that within the next month, the Delhi government will install 44 oxygen plants out of which eight plants will be installed by the Central government. “We are trying our level best to increase the amount of oxygen available in Delhi. It has been noted that the oxygen allotted to us by the Centre is also not reaching us in its entirety. A major issue facing us today in the supply of oxygen is the shortage in the number of tankers,” he told a digital briefing. “Even when we find oxygen, transporting it to Delhi becomes a problem because of shortage of tankers. The Delhi government has decided to import 18 tankers from Bangkok, which will start reaching Delhi starting Wednesday. For this, we have requested the Centre to lend us air force planes,” the Chief Minister also said. Steady supply The 18 tankers from Thailand, he said, will aid the transportation of oxygen and ensure that the amount of oxygen allotted to the city reaches it. Additionally, he said, the Delhi government is importing 21 ready-to-use oxygen plants from France. These will be installed in different hospitals in Delhi ensuring a steady supply at least in those hospitals. Last week, he said, he had written letters and reached out to many Chief Ministers and industrialists in the country asking for aid and had received a positive response from many of them. Most of them, he said, wished to remain anonymous. “This is an example of their nobility, to give with no ulterior aim of seeking the public’s affection. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the people and organisations that are helping us tide over these tough times,” the CM said. “Last week -- Thursday, Friday and Saturday -- was particularly critical for Delhi. Oxygen was running especially low and we were fearful of a major mishap. We spent nights trying to arrange for oxygen to aid COVID-19 patients. However, from then we have seen a major improvement. The number of SOS messages received from hospitals has reduced,” he also said. The Central government, which is also importing a lot of tankers for transportation purposes, had allotted five additional tankers to Delhi. Within the next one month, the Delhi government will install 44 oxygen plants in Delhi, Mr. Kejriwal said. Installation of plants Within this, he said eight plants will be installed by the Central government by April 30 and 36 plants are being installed by the Delhi government, of which 21 are being imported from France and the remaining 15 are from within the country. “Today, I visited the Ramleela Maidan in front of GTB Hospital. We are trying to convert that into an ICU bed centre with a capacity of 500 beds. Around 200 ICU beds are being readied at Radha Soami Satsang Beas,” he said. “A total of 1,200 ICU beds will be ready by May 10, I believe they will relieve the load from the hospitals and aid the people of Delhi,” he also said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-to-import-oxygen-tankers-from-abroad/article34427114.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||Two Lok Nayak Hospital nurses succumb to virus||Two nurses working at Lok Nayak Hospital, the largest Delhi government hospital, died on Tuesday, according to Delhi State Hospitals Nurses Union (LNH). While one nurse was tested positive and under home isolation, the other nurse had “COVID-19 like symptoms” and had been admitted at a private hospital. The association demanded compensation for family members of both the nurses, considering them as “COVID warriors”. Ravinder Kaur, 55, who worked in a COVID-19 ward was tested positive on April 17 and was under home isolation. “She was not having heavy symptoms and was under home isolation. She had breakfast in the morning and had talked to one of our staffers also. But she then said that she was not feeling well and died suddenly,” said Shoukat Ali, vice president of the association. Ms. Kaur is unmarried. The second nurse, Elizabeth Joseph, 45, is from Kerala and is survived by her husband and two children. Ms. Joseph was working in the pediatric department of the hospital, which was a non-COVID treatment facility. “Though it was a non-COVID facility, she also had high chances of getting virus from there as there are a lot of bystanders and attendants who come in there and are not tested for COVID-19. Also, she did not wear PPE to work as it was a non-COVID ward,” Mr. Ali said. “She had fever from April 15 but was tested negative. Her condition worsened and since she was negative and our hospital was a COVID facility, she was admitted at a private hospital. Scans had shown white patches in her lungs, which is a definite COVID symptom. Her condition worsened and she also passed away on Tuesday,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/two-lok-nayak-hospital-nurses-succumb-to-virus/article34427117.ece

The application by Vikram Singh, the former DGP of Uttar Pradesh and also the Chairman of think tank Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change (CASC), has also sought directions to the Centre and the Election Commission to “ensure compulsory home quarantine of persons who campaigned in the last one week of in West Bengal”. Mr. Singh, represented by advocate Virag Gupta, claimed in his plea that “masking rules were flouted with impunity” by the political parties, their leaders and campaigners during the rallies, public meetings and roadshows conducted during the ongoing pandemic. This “unhindered and uncared-for all out campaigning” has resulted in the rise in virus cases in that State where the positivity rate has gone up from 5% to 24%, claimed the application.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/plea-in-hc-for-action-against-political-leaders-for-violating-covid-19-norms/article34427111.ece
28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Help desk at Miranda House college proving handy for those in need||“Hello! Do you want to find out where you can get an RT-PCR test done?” asks Vaishnavi Nandkumar, answering the Miranda House COVID help desk, cutting straight to the point. The help desk that started out as an initiative to help the Miranda House community on April 22 has over the past three days started getting calls from complete strangers calling to seek help with finding hospital beds, oxygen, RT-PCR tests, doctors, plasma, ambulance services, food for patients and psychologists. The task at hand for the students is to verify every lead that they get and update a resource document so that those calling in for help can be directed to a credible source that can help them. Srishti Sensarma, who is heading the operation, says her college principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda came up with the idea and a few students started it to help the college community. But soon, their phone numbers spread like wildfire and phones have been ringing ever since. “On my first day after our numbers got shared outside the college community, I got a call from someone at 6 a.m. who gave me the vital statistics of her 30-year-old son who needed immediate hospitalisation. In these times, it is almost a miracle to find a bed but I made calls to multiple hospitals and finally pleaded with the emergency staffers at GTB Hospital and then directed her to take him there,” she narrated. The mother reached the hospital and got an emergency treatment that saved his life, said Ms. Srishti. “While we can’t arrange beds, we can help point people who are helpless in the right direction,” said the 20-year old student. Ms. Srishti adds that most people call in a state of panic and are unable to process what needs to be done. This is where her team that has grown to over 500 volunteers out of which 50-100 are actively involved step in. The team verifies leads and that come constantly and makes calls to find out if a resource is credible. “If we verify 500 leads from social media, about 5% turn out to be genuine,” she adds. Help in return The students who have helped out people in crisis have also received help in return. “A clinical psychologist who we helped out offered his services pro-bono and some of us have reached out to him to avail his services as the emotional toll is massive. It is tough but we are doing whatever we can to help those in need,” said Ms. Srishti. Ms. Nandkumar says that the members of her team are mostly college students and are not trained to handle such calls. But they are doing their best to guide people who call crying for help. Commenting on the work of her students, Ms. Nanda said that they were showing tremendous organisational skills and putting all their effort into arranging help. “Only 25% of our students are from Delhi-NCR and we are trying to tie up doctors from across the country to help our students if they need help. We have even contacted our alumni and corporates to help out at this time,” she said.

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||China ‘ready to support’ India, offers vaccines to South Asia||China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday offered Chinese vaccines to countries in South Asia to ensure “a more diversified and stable” regional supply and said Beijing was also “ready to provide support and assistance” to India. Mr. Wang was speaking at the fourth multilateral dialogue involving countries in South Asia on coordinating their COVID-19 responses and economic recoveries. The virtual dialogue involving the Foreign Ministers of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka marked China’s stepped up engagement in the region following the pandemic, and was the latest in a series of meetings involving all countries in South Asia barring India, Bhutan and the Maldives. China previously held a meeting of Foreign Ministers with Afghanistan, Nepal, and Pakistan, a dialogue with Vice-Foreign Ministers involving Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, as well as a meeting at the Director General level of the six countries that again met on Tuesday. Assistance to India Mr. Wang said at the meet that China had “extended an invitation to India” and also expressed its sympathy and condolences amid the current COVID-19 surge. He said China is “ready to provide support and assistance to the Indian people at any time according to the needs of India”. The Chinese Foreign Minister called on the six countries to work together in fighting against COVID-19 and said China was prepared to offer its vaccines through flexible arrangements to ensure “more diversified and stable” vaccine supplies for countries in South Asia. China has also raised a proposal of establishing an emergency reserve for supplies for South Asian countries. Mr. Wang called on the countries, all of which are involved in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, to explore “fast channels” to enable exchanges of people and commodities and said China would establish a poverty reduction development cooperation centre for South Asia to share its experiences. Nepal’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali in a statement said the country supported the need for “an enhanced level of regional and international cooperation for COVID-19 response and economic recovery”. Nepal’s Foreign Ministry said China had agreed to provide Nepal “with an additional grant of medical equipment and materials equivalent to 5 million RMB [around Rs 5.7 crore] to complement national efforts in fighting against COVID-19.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-ready-to-support-india-offers-vaccines-to-south-asia/article34426786.ece
28 April 2021||Washington,||USTR discusses COVID-19 relief with vaccine makers||United States Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai met with the heads of vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, on Tuesday and discussed the role of developing countries in addressing global gaps in vaccine production and distribution. There is growing pressure on the U.S. — both at home and abroad —to support an Indian and South African initiative at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) that will waive intellectual property rights temporarily to address COVID-19 related medical shortages. Ms. Tai committed to working with WTO members on global response to the pandemic, including the role of developing countries in addressing gaps in the production and distribution of vaccines, the USTR office said. There was a specific discussion around the COVID-19 wave currently under way in India during Ms. Tai’s meetings (which appeared to be separate) with Pfizer chairman and CEO Albert Bourla, and AstraZeneca U.S. head Ruud Dobber. U.S. government assistance to India and the messaging around it kicked into high gear over the weekend, after about a week of mostly silence, for which the Biden administration has been widely criticised. The White House announce on Monday that it would make some 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine available to other countries over the next few months. The vaccine has not been approved for use in the U.S. Deep sympathy for India During her meeting with Mr. Dobber, Ms. Tai “highlighted the announcement that the U.S. was examining options to share AstraZeneca vaccine doses with other countries as they become available,” her office said. “The Ambassador [Ms. Tai] expressed her deep sympathy for the people of India and reiterated that the Biden-Harris Administration’s top priority is saving lives and ending the pandemic in the United States and around the world,” one of the meeting readouts from USTR said. A group of ten Senators, including some high profile names like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, had written to Mr. Biden earlier in April, asking him to support a waiver of Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) at the WTO. A senior administration official confirmed to The Hindu on Monday that the topic came up “briefly” when Mr. Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a phone call earlier that day. However, beyond saying that the administration was looking at ways to bolster the production of vaccines, including mRNA vaccines (such as those from Pfizer and Moderna), officials did not confirm Mr. Biden’s position on the TRIPS issue. Monday’s USTR statements, however, suggest conversations are under way and a U.S. position on the initiative at the WTO is evolving.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ustr-vaccine-makers-discuss-ip-waiver-aid-to-india/article34426790.ece
28 April 2021||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka Cabinet clears proposal for burkha ban||Sri Lanka’s Cabinet on Tuesday  cleared a proposal to ban all forms of face veils in public places “due to national security concerns”. “The Cabinet has approved the proposal... it will now go to the legal draftsmen and then be brought to parliament,” Cabinet spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella told the weekly media conference. The announcement comes at a time when the government is urging the public to wear face masks — dozens of violators have been arrested — to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and a likely third wave in Sri Lanka. The proposal to ban the burkha was announced in March by Minister of Public Security Sarath Weerasekara, weeks before the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on Sri Lanka. However, the government then clarified that it was only a proposal and there was no move to implement it in a hurry — a position that was widely seen as Colombo’s bid to garner support of Muslim countries that had a vote at the the council. Concerns raised The proposed ban on face veils, seen as targeting the burkha worn by Muslim women, had triggered concern domestically and among international actors. The Pakistani envoy in Colombo in a tweet then said the likely ban “will only serve as injury to the feelings of ordinary Sri Lankan Muslims and Muslims across the globe”. Following the Easter Sunday terror attacks in 2019, that killed nearly 280 people in coordinated serial blasts, Sri Lanka used emergency regulations to temporarily ban the burkha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-cabinet-clears-proposal-for-burkha-ban/article34426788.ece
28 April 2021||DUBAI,||Iran, U.S. warships engage in a tense encounter||American and Iranian warships had a tense encounter in the Gulf earlier this month, the first such incident in about a year amid wider turmoil in the region over Tehran’s tattered nuclear deal, the U.S. Navy said on Tuesday. Footage released by the Navy showed a ship commanded by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard cut in front of the USCGC Monomoy , causing the Coast Guard vessel to come to an abrupt stop with its engine smoking on April 2. The Guard also did the same with another Coast Guard vessel, the USCGC Wrangell , said Commodore Rebecca Rebarich, a spokeswoman for the Navy’s 5th Fleet. Such close passes risk the ships colliding at sea. Iran did not immediately acknowledge the incident. The interaction marked the first “unsafe and unprofessional” incident involving the Iranians since April 15, 2020, she said. However, Iran had largely stopped such incidents in 2018 and nearly in the entirety of 2019, she said. In 2017, the Navy recorded 14 instances of what it describes as “unsafe” interactions with Iranians.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-us-warships-engage-in-a-tense-encounter/article34426792.ece
28 April 2021||Washington,||Biden to sign minimum wage order for federal govt. workers||U.S. President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Tuesday raising the hourly wages of federal government contract workers to $15, a step towards fulfilling his campaign pledge to raise the minimum wage to the same level for all employees. The new order will require “federal contractors to pay a $15 minimum wage to hundreds of thousands of workers who are working on federal contracts,” the White House said. The current minimum wage is $10.95 an hour for these workers, who are not civil servants but work for the federal government through contracting firms. “These workers are critical to the functioning of the federal government: from cleaning professionals and maintenance workers... to nursing assistants who care for the nation’s veterans, to cafeteria and other food service workers who ensure military members have healthy and nutritious food to eat, to labourers who build and repair federal infrastructure,” the White House said. However, they will still have to wait a short while, since the measure will apply only from March 30, 2022 to all new contracts and then gradually to each contract renewal. Inflation linked Hourly wages will then be increased each year based on inflation. The executive order also harmonises the minimum wage for all federal contract workers, removing lower wages for workers who receive tips that bring their salaries up to the minimum wage level, currently at $7.65 per hour. The White House insisted that the wage hike will not be accompanied by increased cost to the taxpayer, and even said the move will improve productivity and reduce turnover as well as related costs. And it said the move will ensure that “hundreds of thousands of workers no longer have to work full time and still live in poverty.” The measure is designed to encourage employers to follow suit. Raising the minimum wage for all workers in the country to $15 by 2025 from the current $7.25 an hour was one of Mr. Biden’s key campaign pledges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-to-sign-minimum-wage-order-for-federal-govt-workers/article34426794.ece
28 April 2021||Washington D.C.,||Indian govt. did not request ready-to-use vaccines, says U.S.||The Biden administration has said the Government of India did not request it ready-to-use vaccines, as pressure has been mounting on the U.S. to give out vaccines to India, which is in the throes of a massive COVID-19 outbreak. A senior official told The Hindu, during a briefing call with reporters, that no specific request for vaccines was made by the Modi government. American lawmakers and other influential voices have been calling for the U.S. to donate its spare vaccines, particularly some of the tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca vaccine. “Just to be clear, right now we have zero doses available of AstraZeneca,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at Monday’s briefing, in which a remarkable amount of time was spent on questions and answers about India. Ms. Psaki said approximately 10 million doses could be released if and when the FDA (Federal Drug Administration) clears those — a process that could be completed in the coming weeks. Another 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca are expected to be ready in May and June. The White House COVID-19 and National Security teams, working with other government departments, are going to assess the needs and requests around the world, she said. Three other vaccines are approved in the U.S. — from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Indian is facing a shortage of vaccines. The Hindu has reached out to the Indian Embassy for comment on why ready-to-use vaccines were not on the list of requests for U.S. assistance. A U.S. official said among India’s requests however were oxygen and related supplies, with COVID-19 patients dying due to a lack of oxygen, as per reports in the media. The official said the Department of Defense (DoD) and the U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) were working on getting oxygen generation systems to India, including by re-routing shipments. The DoD is also looking at field oxygen generations systems, which could support 50-100 beds. In addition, the U.S. is planning to facilitate training in India and technical discussions are under way around whether these devices can be connected to Indian systems. A “strike team” is also being deployed to the U.S. Embassy in India, to work with Indian experts including in laboratory-related services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/indian-govt-did-not-request-ready-to-use-vaccines-says-us/article34426825.ece
28 April 2021||Jerusalem,||HRW: Israel is committing ‘apartheid’||Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday that Israel is committing the crime of “apartheid” by seeking to maintain Jewish “domination” over Palestinians and its own Arab population, an explosive allegation Israel firmly rejected. Currently under investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes, Israel blasted HRW’s accusations as “preposterous and false”, accusing the New York-based group of having “a long-standing anti-Israeli agenda”. Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh welcomed the “remarkable” HRW report and said he hoped it might lead the international community to “bear its responsibilities” and hold Israel “accountable for its crimes.” The report finds that the Israeli government is the “single authority” with primary control “over the area between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea”. The rights group pointed to Israeli policies targeting Palestinians that include movement restrictions, land confiscation, forcible population transfer, denial of residency rights and suspension of civil rights. HRW said the ICC should conduct additional investigations into those “credibly implicated” in committing the crimes of “apartheid and persecution”. Omar Shakir, HRW’s Israel and Palestine director, said there have been warnings for years that “apartheid is around the corner”. “I think it’s quite clear that that threshold has been crossed,” Mr. Shakir said from Jordan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hrw-israel-is-committing-apartheid/article34426795.ece

Russia had planned to supply up to 4,00,000 doses of the anti-viral drug but those plans had run into trouble over intellectual property rights. The Indian government was trying to procure them directly from the U.S. as a consequence, The Hindu had reported. Gilead said on Monday it will provide technical assistance to its seven Indian licencees so they can expand production capacity and donate active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Last week, the Centre had announced that India’s monthly production capacity was being increased from 38 lakh vials to 74 lakh vials. “Gilead is also committed to providing support to voluntary licencees based outside of India to increase their production capacity. Gilead’s planned support will include the donation of API to licencees with a view to accelerate production,” the company said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-pharma-firm-to-donate-remdesivir/article34426843.ece

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||A patently wrong regime||Even an unprecedented pandemic can do little, it appears, to upset the existing global regime governing monopoly rights over the production and distribution of life-saving drugs. If anything, since the onset of COVID-19, we’ve only seen a reaffirmation of intellectual property rules that have served as a lethal barrier to the right to access healthcare over the last few decades. The neo-liberal order, under which these laws exist, is so intractable today that a matter as seemingly simple as a request for a waiver on patent protections is seen as a claim unworthy of exception. Request for waiver On October 2 last year, India and South Africa submitted a joint petition to the World Trade Organization (WTO), requesting a temporary suspension of rules under the 1995 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). A waiver was sought to the extent that the protections offered by TRIPS impinged on the containment and treatment of COVID-19. As we now know, quick and efficient vaccination is the surest route to achieving global herd immunity against the virus. Should the appeal for waiver be allowed, countries will be in a position, among other things, to facilitate a free exchange of know-how and technology surrounding the production of vaccines. The request for waiver has, since, found support from more than 100 nations. But a small group of states — the U.S., the European Union, the U.K. and Canada among them — continues to block the move. Their reluctance comes despite these countries having already secured the majority of available vaccines, with the stocks that they hold far exceeding the amounts necessary to inoculate the whole of their populations. Their decision is all the more galling when one considers the fact that for the rest of the world mass immunisation is a distant dream. Reports suggest that for most poor countries it would take until at least 2024 before widespread vaccination is achieved. A patent is a conferral by the state of an exclusive right to make, use and sell an inventive product or process. Patent laws are usually justified on three distinct grounds: on the idea that people have something of a natural and moral right to claim control over their inventions; on the utilitarian premise that exclusive licenses promote invention and therefore benefit society as a whole; and on the belief that individuals must be allowed to benefit from the fruits of their labour and merit, that when a person toils to produce an object, the toil and the object become inseparable. Each of these justifications has long been a matter of contest, especially in the application of claims of monopoly over pharmaceutical drugs and technologies. A new world order In India, the question of marrying the idea of promoting invention and offering exclusive rights over medicines on the one hand with the state’s obligation of ensuring that every person has equal access to basic healthcare on the other has been a source of constant tension. The colonial-era laws that the country inherited expressly allowed for pharmaceutical patents. But in 1959, a committee chaired by Justice N. Rajagopala Ayyangar objected to this on ethical grounds. It noted that access to drugs at affordable prices suffered severely on account of the existing regime. The committee found that foreign corporations used patents, and injunctions secured from courts, to suppress competition from Indian entities, and thus, medicines were priced at exorbitant rates. To counter this trend, the committee suggested, and Parliament put this into law through the Patents Act, 1970, that monopolies over pharmaceutical drugs be altogether removed, with protections offered only over claims to processes. This change in rule allowed generic manufacturers in India to grow. As a result, life-saving drugs were made available to people at more affordable prices. The ink had barely dried on the new law, though, when negotiations had begun to create a WTO that would write into its constitution a binding set of rules governing intellectual property. In the proposal’s vision, countries which fail to subscribe to the common laws prescribed by the WTO would be barred from entry into the global trading circuit. It was believed that a threat of sanctions, to be enforced through a dispute resolution mechanism, would dissuade states from reneging on their promises. With the advent in 1995 of the TRIPS agreement this belief proved true. As the Yale Law School professor Amy Kapczynski has written, compelling signatories to introduce intellectual property laws like those in the global north was nothing short of a scandal. The follies in this new world order became quickly apparent when drugs that reduced AIDS deaths in developed nations were placed out of reach for the rest of the world. It was only when Indian companies began to manufacture generic versions of these medicines, which was made possible because obligations under TRIPS hadn’t yet kicked in against India, that the prices came down. But lessons from that debacle remain unlearned. Refuting objections Instead, two common arguments are made in response to objections against the prevailing patent regime. One, that unless corporations are rewarded for their inventions, they would be unable to recoup amounts invested by them in research and development. Two, that without the right to monopolise production there will be no incentive to innovate. Both of these claims have been refuted time and again. Most recently, it has been reported that the technology involved in producing the Moderna vaccine in the U.S. emanated out of basic research conducted by the National Institutes of Health, a federal government agency, and other publicly funded universities and organisations. Similarly, public money accounted for more than 97% of the funding towards the development of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Big pharma has never been forthright about the quantum of monies funnelled by it into research and development. It’s also been clear for some time now that its research is usually driven towards diseases that afflict people in the developed world. Therefore, the claim that a removal of patents would somehow invade on a company’s ability to recoup costs is simply untrue. The second objection — the idea that patents are the only means available to promote innovation — has become something of a dogma. But other appealing alternatives have been mooted. The economist Joseph Stiglitz is one of many who has proposed a prize fund for medical research in place of patents. Under the current system, “those unfortunate enough to have the disease are forced to pay the price… and that means the very poor in the developing world are condemned to death,” he wrote. A system that replaces patents with prizes will be “more efficient and more equitable”, in that incentives for research will flow from public funds while ensuring that the biases associated with monopolies are removed. The unequal vaccine policy put in place by the Indian state is indefensible. But at the same time, we cannot overlook the need for global collective action. If nation states are to act as a force of good, they must each attend to the demands of global justice. The pandemic has demonstrated to us just how iniquitous the existing world order is. We cannot continue to persist with rules granting monopolies which place the right to access basic healthcare in a position of constant peril. In its present form, the TRIPS regime, to borrow the law professor Katharina Pistor’s words, represents nothing but a new form of “feudal calculus”.

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Marking the beginning of a green era||One of the lessons learned from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the need for collective action among members of the international community to effectively address global challenges such as pandemics and climate change. The pandemic has created an unprecedented crisis that demands an exceptional global response. Even as countries rightly continue to focus on tackling the immediate health emergency, the need is to have a long-term vision to build a climate-resilient global economy for the future. Progress towards goals Ambition alone cannot attain goals. Good results depend on our ability to act. That is precisely what defines the two recent initiatives launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to combat the threat of climate change — the ‘Saudi Green Initiative’ and the ‘Middle East Green Initiative’. In fact, one of the main pillars of the Saudi G20 presidency was to “safeguard the planet”. The Saudi leadership of the summit highlighted how climate change had negatively impacted the planet, people’s lives and their well-being. The G20 introduced initiatives like establishing a Global Coral Reef Research and Development Accelerator Platform to accelerate scientific knowledge and technology development in support of coral reef survival, conservation, resilience, adaptation and restoration. G20 leaders also acknowledged the Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) Platform as a tool towards affordable, reliable, and secure energy and economic growth. Saudi Arabia is committed to lead regional efforts to address climate change and has been making steady progress in this direction. The Saudi Green Initiative aims to raise the vegetation cover, reduce carbon emissions, combat pollution and land degradation, and preserve marine life. As part of the initiative, 10 billion trees will be planted in the Kingdom. It aims to reduce carbon emissions by more than 4% of global contributions, through a renewable energy programme that will generate 50% of Saudi’s energy from renewables by 2030. With the understanding that the need of the hour is to do more than enough, Saudi Arabia is working towards raising the percentage of its protected areas to more than 30% of its total land area, representing roughly 6,00,000 sq km, exceeding the global target of 17%. As part of the Middle East Green initiative, Saudi Arabia will work with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and regional partners to plant an additional 40 billion trees in the West Asian region. It represents 5% of the global target of planting one trillion trees and reducing 2.5% of global carbon levels. Saudi Arabia has been sharing its expertise and know-how with its neighbouring countries to reduce carbon emissions resulting from hydrocarbon production in the region by 60% and globally by 10%. Saudi Arabia currently operates the largest carbon capture and utilisation plant in the world, turning half a million tonnes of CO2 annually into products such as fertilizers and methanol. It also operates one of the region’s most advanced CO2-enhanced oil recovery plants that captures and stores 8,00,000 tonnes of CO2 annually. Plans are afoot to deploy additional carbon capture, utilisation and storage infrastructure. Saudia Arabia believes that nature-based solutions will play an important role in removing carbon as part of the CCE. We have already joined hands in February 2019 with India when Saudi Arabia joined the International Solar Alliance during the Crown Prince’s state visit to the country, hence promoting cooperation in the renewable energy sector. Later that year, when the Indian Prime Minister visited Saudi Arabia, several MoUs and agreements in key sectors including renewable energy were signed. To ensure momentum and continuity, Saudi Arabia will convene an annual summit called the Middle East Green Initiative which will host leaders from the government, scientists and environmentalists to discuss the details of implementation. The aim is start implementing the plan in the fourth quarter of this year and continue for the next two decades. Saudi Arabia also recognises the scarcity of financial resources to irrigate the terrain. Therefore, in partnership with participating countries, innovative methods will be researched to irrigate from treated water, cloud seeding and other purpose-driven solutions such as planting native trees which requires support for three years to grow and will then be able to survive on their own with natural irrigation. Working towards Vision 2030 In 2016, the Crown Prince unveiled Vision 2030, a comprehensive road map to improve the quality of life of the citizens of the country. As part of this, Saudi Arabia carried out a comprehensive restructuring of the environmental sector and established the Environmental Special Forces in 2019. With NEOM and The Line, Saudi Arabia has already redefined the idea of sustainable habitats. NEOM’s location also gives Saudi Arabia many advantages in the field of hydrogen production. According to the World Bank, for every dollar invested in resilient infrastructure, $4 in benefits are generated. With the Public Investment Fund recently pumping in $15 billion in the NEOM project and another $10 billion in renewable and solar energy projects, it is clear that the pandemic has only strengthened Saudi Arabia’s resolve to realise the goals of Vision 2030 and become one of the major producers of renewable energy with a capacity to generate 9.5 GW by 2023.  Our close friend and strategic partner India has also made remarkable commitments to tackle climate change and is on track to achieve its Paris Agreement targets. India’s renewable energy capacity is the fourth largest in the world. India has an ambitious target of achieving 450 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. We admire India’s endeavour to build a safe and clean environment for future generations. Saudi Arabia hopes that the launch of the Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative marks the beginning of a green era and that these initiatives provide momentum to other countries to unify their efforts to save our planet.

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||A pragmatic approach for COVID-19||The second wave of COVID-19 infections in India has turned into a public health emergency, and it has become difficult for most people to even access the healthcare system. Finding a hospital bed has turned almost impossible in many parts of the country, and if one does manage hospital admission, critical supplies like medical oxygen are hard to come by. Healthcare personnel have been trying to do their best under these trying circumstances, but they are now stretched to the breaking point. Amid this, a plethora of guidelines and lack of concordance across recommendations put forward by different States add to the confusion. Various drug cocktails with unproven or marginal benefits are being used widely. To address the confusion, the India COVID SOS team (www.indiacovidsos.org), a group of volunteers from across the world, including India, has developed clear guidance in various Indian languages to help in home-management of patients. This is not intended to be a substitute for medical care but rather a way to assist people with mild to moderate symptoms safely at home. Moderate illness Starting with the basics, if one develops symptoms of COVID-19, like fever, sore throat, dry cough, headache, body aches, and loss of smell or taste, they should try to get tested. Given the high number of cases in India, if a person has one or more of these symptoms and lives in a highly affected area, they are very likely to have the infection. However, if testing is unavailable, they must assume that they have COVID-19 and should stay home, keep the windows open for ventilation, and follow other tips. Most importantly, avoid panic. It is important to remember that over 90% of people with COVID-19 recover fully without needing hospital care. A pulse oximeter must be used to check oxygen saturation levels three to four times a day, or more often if there is difficulty in breathing. There is some evidence that a steroid inhaler may be helpful for people over the age of 50 years. If available, an inhaled steroid (budesonide) may be used twice a day for five to seven days. If oxygen levels are at or above 92%, hospitalisation, blood tests or a CT scan are not needed. Further, oral steroids, intravenous Remdesivir, or plasma may not be beneficial for such patients. In fact, taking oral steroids at this stage could actually be harmful. In case the oxygen levels are less than 92%, one must reach out to a doctor and follow their recommendations. Our suggestions at this stage apply only if an individual cannot reach a doctor or find a hospital bed. The most important treatments at this point are oxygen and oral steroids. Dexamethasone is the most commonly used steroid medication, usually given at a dose of 6 mg per day for five days. In case dexamethasone is not available, there are several alternatives. If a patient has diabetes, it’s important to monitor their blood sugar while on steroids, and if it is higher than normal, the doctor must be informed. They should also stay in touch with a doctor and seek urgent help if oxygen needs increase to more than four litres a minute. Unproven methods Most other treatments that have been tried for COVID-19 have shown no benefit. This includes widely prescribed treatments such as ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamin supplements, antivirals, and antibiotics. Convalescent plasma has not lived up to its initial promise and several trials have failed to demonstrate significant benefit with routine use. Collecting, testing, and administering plasma adds more strain to an already overburdened healthcare system and uses up valuable resources. Similarly, recent data indicate that Remdesivir has a limited role in COVID-19 treatment, and patients should not seek admission to hospitals solely to receive this drug. Most people will recover completely at home. Staying home if the symptoms are mild will help save hospital beds, oxygen, and other supplies for seriously ill patients. This also means that doctors, nurses, and other medical staff can do a better job of taking care of critical patients. However, worsening symptoms must not be ignored and a patient should not delay going to the hospital if needed. What else can individuals do? Wearing a mask, avoiding crowds, and washing hands are some ways through which people can prevent the spread. Getting vaccinated is the most important step. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from the infection. One can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, but typically, the illness will be mild. The grave humanitarian crisis sweeping through India can be controlled only by large-scale public health measures. Curfews and lockdowns will work if implemented carefully. Mass gatherings should be prohibited. Large-scale vaccination drives are essential. Celebrities from the film industry, social media influencers and sports stars should promote vaccination, the use of masks, and physical distancing. Testing needs to be scaled up and test results should be reported in a timely manner. Medical supplies, including oxygen, should be made available, not just in healthcare settings but also to persons at home. Tools for triage of patients and accessible dashboards listing available resources are the need of the hour. At this point, many of these things are being cobbled together by volunteers. But an organised response would be much more effective. Acknowledging the crisis Finally, much of the reporting of cases and deaths has been coming from media rather than government sources. Indeed, since the beginning of the pandemic, responsible science reporters have been the best sources of information, not just in India but around the world. We need robust data. In order to deal with the problem, it is important to acknowledge the enormity of it. India is facing an unprecedented public health crisis. The number of new cases being reported each day is higher than it has ever been in any country. As bad as the situation is currently, it could get much worse. We have seen that deaths from COVID-19 increase when the healthcare system is overwhelmed. But the damage can be greatly minimised by the measures described above: a combination of prevention and appropriate management. The massive spread can be arrested by following safety protocols and through rapid vaccination. If the vast majority of patients who can be treated safely at home stay home, so that hospital resources can be directed to critically ill patients who truly need them, we will be able to manage the crisis better. All eyes are on India and the actions we take now can help us turn the corner in the next few weeks.

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||The Left’s big battle in Bengal||As West Bengal gears up for the final round of polling for the high-stakes Assembly election, a steady drop in Left votes in the State during the last decade calls for a careful analysis. While the Left’s electoral rule for over three decades in the State is a huge feat, it is difficult to understand how the front, which, despite losing, bagged nearly 41% vote share in the 2011 Assembly election, could manage only around 7% support in the State in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. It is often argued that a major part in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) rise in West Bengal has been at the expense of traditional Left votes. The Left Front’s poll prospects in 2021 may be assessed through the sociopolitical dynamics in the past and also the changing scenario in the State at present. While many political experts explained the Left’s astonishing success story in West Bengal by its organisational coherence, analysts such as Partha Chatterjee and Dwaipayan Bhattacharyya attributed it to the structure of the State’s society, which is visibly different from many other parts of the country. Dr. Chatterjee observed a “political society” in the State formed by a party’s mediation between the government and the population as the magic formula for the Left’s success; Dr. Bhattacharyya argued that the rural situation in the State is “ontologically different from the urban political society”, and “party-society” is “the modular form of political society in West Bengal’s countryside”, whose roots can be traced to the violent class-based movements of poor peasants against the domination of landlords. The “party-society” acted as accepted moral guardians in the public life of the society and the private lives of families, and panchayats intertwined with political parties in their functioning. The dynamics in rural and urban Bengal are different, but rural voters certainly hold the key to political power. The collapse of the Left Front’s long-standing control over Bengal’s party-society, triggered by a pervasive distrust of the moral authority of the mediators, is often presented as an important reason for the electoral debacle in 2011. Though it may now be in decline, the decades-old party-society format could be traced in the Trinamool Congress regime as well, perhaps with a changed style of functioning in the absence of inclusive politics. And that is an added difficulty for the Left’s attempts at resurgence. In sharp contrast to other parts of the country, West Bengal’s politics was built on social justice, and caste played a marginal role. In 1980, Jyoti Basu, the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, said, “Caste is a legacy of the feudal system and viewing the social scene from the casteist angle is no longer relevant for West Bengal.” However, Basu could not foresee Bengal four decades on. It is clear that caste-based identities had just been in a “recessive” state, and have now become a “dominant” feature of the State’s electoral politics. The redefined political arena goes against the Left’s age-old ideology, where it publicly regarded caste as an irrelevant category, and hence, today, the front is bound to find this new domain a difficult turf to play in. A two-party system The Left’s decline over the years can also be partly explained by ‘Duverger’s law’, which says that a first-past-the-post electoral system tends to favour a two-party system. Traditionally, in West Bengal, the two main parties or alliances often get nearly 80% to 90% of the vote share among them. With the emergence of the Trinamool and the BJP as the two major political forces in the State in the current election, the Left would have to portray itself as a key player for its revival. It is widely believed that a section of Left voters “tactically” supported the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. A post-poll survey by Lokniti, however, showed that about 39% and 31% of the traditional Left voters voted for the BJP and the Trinamool, respectively. A study published in the journal Political Behavior in 2013, by Jørgen Bølstad, Elias Dinas and Pedro Riera, used data from before and after the 2001 and the 2005 U.K. elections. It was observed that voting for a party can increase its preference score to the voter, potentially changing the order of preferences over time. Thus, voting, in general, may be more of a matter of habit than ideology. A large percentage of voters of a party are usually ‘floating voters’, who may at most be soft supporters of that party. If the pattern stands similar everywhere, some traditional Left voters in West Bengal who voted “tactically” in 2019 might have already changed their preferences. Still, as a legacy of its 34-year rule, the Left has a strong position in West Bengal. The State’s politics would be shaped by how the alliance’s support base evolves and impacts the Trinamool Congress and the BJP.

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||A ceaseless plight||Ramesh Taba Sosa, an Indian fisherman, is the latest victim of an inhuman and skewed system involving India and Pakistan, in which mortal remains of prisoners are not repatriated for months. Sosa died in a prison hospital in Malir Jail, Karachi, Pakistan, on March 26, 2021, but there is no guarantee when his family in Nanavada, near Kodinar in Gujarat, will be able to conduct his last rites. Sosa was arrested in May 2019 when the fishing boat he was in allegedly entered Pakistani waters. His sentence in the Pakistani prison ended on July 3, 2019. However, not only was he not repatriated, but he was also not given consular access till his death. Sosa’s case is one more statistic in a long story of insensitivity between the two governments that do not implement agreements. More than anything else, it is an issue of basic human rights. India and Pakistan signed the Agreement on Consular Access in 2008. Though the deal has a few lacunae, it was significant. Section 4 of the agreement said, “Each government shall provide consular access within three months to nationals of one country, under arrest, detention or imprisonment in the other country.” Further, Section 5 of the agreement stated, “Both governments agree to release and repatriate persons within one month of confirmation of their national status and completion of sentences.” A long wait More than 300 Indian fishermen remain in Pakistan’s custody in Malir jail. Consular access is an exception. Without it, the nationality of the person is not confirmed and the repatriation process cannot begin. Though the agreement does not state a time limit, there are numerous instances in which both countries have not confirmed nationality for as long as 18 months, during which the arrested men languish in jails. Sosa’s case has many precedents. A shocking case is of Vaaga Chauhan, an Indian fisherman, who died in custody  in December 2015. His mortal remains reached his village in Gujarat only in April 2016. Chauhan’s family went through unimaginable trauma and reached out to every resource for help.  Then, there is Latif Qasim Sama’s case. Hailing from a village in Kutch near the International Border, he inadvertently crossed over to Pakistan in 2018. He was arrested and his sentence ended in April 2019. Latif still does not have consular access. His relative, Ismail Sama, returned from a Pakistan jail in January this year, though his sentence ended in 2016. Sama and Latif are not fishermen, they live near the International Border and inadvertently crossed it. Ismail returned home after 13 years. Worse, his family was informed a decade after his arrest. Fishermen from the Saurashtra region of Gujarat often get arrested when they unintentionally cross over into Pakistani waters. They suffer, and so do their families, who are now even more worried because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sluggish mechanisms Ideally, prisoners should be released and repatriated the day they complete their prison sentence. But this has happened in just one case, with Hamid Ansari, the only person who was released and repatriated on the day of completion of their sentence. Dharam Singh from Kashmir, who had unknowingly crossed over in 2003, spent 18 years in a Pakistani prison. He was eventually sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment, which ended in December last year. But he reached home only this month. In 2007, India and Pakistan set up a joint judicial committee on prisoners comprising four retired judges from each side. The committee used to convene twice a year to meet prisoners. It made unanimous recommendations, including on the release and repatriation of fishermen and women prisoners. Its last meeting was held in 2013, after which it was discontinued. In 2018, efforts were made to revive it, but Pakistan is yet to nominate judges or call for a meeting. The delay is costing lives.

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Right priorities||In a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden said that his government would quickly deploy a number of COVID-19-related supplies to help India battle its current crisis with the pandemic. The move comes after what many saw as a delay in the U.S.’s response to the situation. After a few days, where the Biden administration seemed to dither, making the point that protecting Americans first was in the world’s interest, it appears to have amended its stand, in some part due to pressure from U.S. Congressmen, business chambers and academics. Over the weekend, senior U.S. officials reached out to India and made public comments expressing concern and sympathy for the people affected as India sees over 3 lakh new cases a day and a record number of deaths. In the short term, what India needs from abroad is two-fold: medicines and oxygen-management devices, including containers, concentrators and generators. It is heartening that more than a dozen countries, including the U.S., have promised to supply these within a week, and some of those supplies have already begun to arrive. In addition to the U.S. government’s supplies, the U.S. private sector has also mobilised aid for various COVID-19 resources in India. In the longer term, New Delhi wants Washington to consider a shift in its long-held state policies for the duration of the pandemic, which may be a more difficult proposition as it includes setting aside patent rights for pharmaceuticals produced in the U.S. and supporting the India-South Africa petition at the World Trade Organization for waiving all TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) so vaccines can be manufactured generically for the next few years. The U.S. should consider its assistance to India both in light of their relationship and of the fact that as a key global supplier of pharmaceuticals and vaccines, India’s faltering steps in the fight against COVID-19 will impact the world. There is no denying that the perceived delay in the U.S.’s response to the crisis in India, which is not just a bilateral strategic partner but key to the U.S.’s Indo-Pacific strategy as a member of the Quad, has caused some disappointment in South Block. However, it is unlikely that this will seriously impact the partnership, nor should such matters affect the broader relationship. There is also a kernel of truth in the U.S.’s earlier assertion that the American government has a “special responsibility” to American citizens first and addressing their COVID-19 needs was also in the world’s interests. Instead of chiding the U.S. for its delay, New Delhi would do well to learn from this prioritisation, and complete its vaccination programme for all Indians, even as it uses all its resources and those received from the U.S. and other countries to rescue the nation from the current ravages of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/right-priorities/article34426769.ece
28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||True name||U.S. President Joe Biden has fulfilled a long-pending American promise by recognising the mass killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks in 1915-16 as “an act of genocide”, but the move has clearly infuriated Turkey, a NATO ally. In 2019, both Houses of the U.S. Congress passed resolutions calling the slaughter by its true name, but former President Donald Trump, like his predecessors, stopped short of a formal recognition of the genocide, mainly because of Turkish opposition. Ankara has challenged the “scholarly and legal” basis of Mr. Biden’s announcement and warned that it will “open a deep wound”. Up to 1.5 million Armenians were estimated to have been killed during the course of the First World War by the Ottoman Turks. When the Ottoman Empire suffered a humiliating defeat in the Caucasus in 1915 at the hands of the Russians, the Turks blamed the Armenians living on the fringes of the crumbling empire for the setback. Accusing them of treachery, the Ottoman government unleashed militias on Armenian villages. Armenian soldiers, public intellectuals and writers were executed and hundreds of thousands of Armenians, including children, were forcibly moved from their houses in eastern Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) to the Syrian desert. Many died during this exodus and many others, after reaching the concentration camps in the deserts. Turkey has acknowledged that atrocities were committed against Armenians, but is opposed to calling it a genocide, which it considers as an attempt to insult the Turks. Mr. Biden’s move comes at a time when the relationship between the U.S. and Turkey has been in steady decline. In 2016, Ankara accused the U.S.-based Turkish Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen of being the mastermind of a failed coup, and asked the U.S. government to extradite him, a demand Washington paid no attention to. Turkey’s decision to buy the S-400 missile defence system from Russia, despite strong opposition from the U.S., prompted American leaders to oust Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet training programme and impose sanctions on their ally. When Mr. Biden assumed office, Turkish President Reccep Tayyip Erdogan had sent feelers for a reset, saying Turkey needed help from the West to resolve the Syrian crisis. But Mr. Biden’s move on the Armenian killings appears to have widened the cracks. For Turkey, this overreaction to anyone calling the Armenian massacre a genocide is not doing any good in foreign policy. Instead of being defensive about the crimes of the Ottoman empire, the modern Turkish republic should demonstrate the moral courage to disown the atrocities. It shouldn’t allow the past to ruin its present interests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/true-name/article34426772.ece

It is not possible to draw any other conclusion from the series of outrageous accusations and provocations against India that Islamabad has been mounting ever since the enormity of its heinous crime against the people of East Bengal became known to the whole world. The latest in the series is its holding the staff of the Indian Deputy High Commission in Dacca and their dependants as hostages ... Islamabad is taking the stand that it will let the Indians at Dacca go only if the Government of India sends back all the personnel who were on the staff of its Calcutta mission at the time it unleashed its military terror in East Bengal. Outraged by the Pakistani army’s brutalities, many members of that staff, including the former Deputy High Commissioner, Mr. M. Hossain Ali, severed connection with the Islamabad regime and have decided not to return to West Pakistan. What Islamabad is demanding is that they should all be compulsorily repatriated, a proposition no Government can accept.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cover-up-for-crimes-from-an-editorial/article34426778.ece
28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||ADB sees India grow by 11%, adds caveat||The Asian Development Bank has raised its forecast for India’s growth in 2021-22 to 11%, from 8% earlier, even as it warned that failure to control the resurgence of COVID-19 cases including April’s exponential jump poses a “considerable downside risk to the recovery”. ‘Targeted containment’ In its assessment based on end-March data, the ADB cited this year’s ‘more targeted’ containment measures compared with last year’s ‘large-scale’ national lockdown and said these would prove ‘less costly’ to the economy, which had seen a strong rebound in recent months’ economic indicators after last year’s ‘big recession’. “A stimulus-fuelled surge in the U.S., India’s largest export market, will support the revival, but a severe second COVID-19 wave is threatening the recovery,” the lender said in its Asian Development Outlook report, projecting growth to moderate to 7% in 2022-23, after a 11% expansion this year. Government capex and accommodative financial policies, along with the vaccine roll-out programme this year, would also help, it added. “Risks to the outlook tilt to the downside. The second wave of COVID-19 cases is worrying, especially if vaccine roll-out falters or fails to contain it. Another risk is a further tightening of global financial conditions, which would apply pressure on India’s market interest rates and therefore affect economic normalisation,” the ADB warned, adding that a likely pick-up in private investment could be dented as rising bad loans could discourage India’s banks from undertaking fresh lending. The lender sees India’s average inflation rate slowing to 5.2% this year from 6.2% last fiscal, and reverting to 4.8% (recorded in 2019-20), over the succeeding 12 months. “Inflation is projected to moderate as good harvests and supply chain recovery contain domestic food inflation even as global food prices rise, though oil prices... may exert some inflationary pressure,” the ADB noted, adding that gasoline taxes had spurred fuel inflation last year even though oil prices had been low. “The projections are based on data and information up to March 31, so we were already aware... of the rise in cases,” said Abdul Abiad, ADB’s director for macroeconomic research. “Obviously, throughout the month of April, cases have risen exponentially and that really poses a downside risk. We need to monitor the situation closely; depending on how that evolves and the policies implemented to respond to that, we may have to revise our forecast in July.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/adb-sees-india-grow-by-11-adds-caveat/article34426752.ece

Revenue from operations grew 53% to Rs. 5,322 crore. Two-wheeler sales grew 41% in the domestic market and by 74% in the international market, surpassing the industry growth of 24% and 33% respectively, TVS Motor said in a statement on Tuesday. During March, the company said it achieved a new milestone by selling more than 1 lakh units in the international market. Focused working capital management and improved operating performance helped generate free cash flow of Rs. 1,887 crore in FY21. The funds were used to reduce debt, TVS Motor said. Lean stock with dealers also helped unleash the blocked working capital across the supply chain, the company added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tvs-motor-q4-net-jumps-fourfold-on-higher-sales/article34426747.ece
28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Maruti Q4 net falls 6.14%; ‘COVID has not hit sales’||Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. posted a 6.14% decline in consolidated net profit to Rs. 1,241.1 crore in the quarter ended March, from a year earlier. On Tuesday, the company also said its sales and production had so far not been impacted by the resurgence of COVID-19. Chairman R.C. Bhargava said it was difficult to provide a sales outlook due to uncertainties related to COVID-19 as well as production constraints. The problem was not of demand, but of shortage of vehicles, he said, adding that the firm currently had pending customer bookings of more than two lakh vehicles. The country’s largest carmaker was also ‘keeping a close watch’ on the impact of rising steel prices and government orders limiting the use of oxygen by industries, as well as the continuing shortage of semiconductors, Mr. Bhargava said during a press conference. “We are producing at full capacity... Demand for personal mobility will strengthen further due to the second COVID wave; [demand] is not going to weaken,” he said. Mr. Bhargava said of the about 30,000 employees of the firm, 1,280 were currently infected with COVID-19. However, this has not affected the availability of people working on the lines, he said. ‘MTM loss dents profit’ For the fourth quarter, Maruti Suzuki India’s revenue from sale of products rose 33.6% to Rs. 22,959.8 crore. In a statement, the company said its profit for the quarter was impacted by lower non-operating income owing to mark-to-market (MTM) loss on invested surplus. Maruti sold more than 4.92 lakh vehicles in the quarter, higher by 27.8% from a year earlier. While domestic sales grew 26.7% to 4.56 lakh vehicles, exports rose 44% to 35,528 units. “In Q4 of [FY20], there was a significant decline in the sales... largely owing to COVID-19 lockdown,” it said. For FY21, the company’s consolidated net profit declined 22.7% to Rs. 4,389.1 crore and revenue from sale of products fell 7% to Rs. 66,571.8 crore. It said net profit was lower on account of lower sales volume, increase in commodity prices, adverse foreign exchange movement, and lower non-operating income partially offset by lower operating expenses, and cost reduction efforts. The company’s board has recommended a dividend of Rs. 45 per share for FY21. Replying to a query, Mr. Bhargava said, “So far, sales have not been impacted. And if the situation continues, it should be a decent quarter for us... But there are factors which you have to keep watching... how COVID progresses, what kind of restrictions come, what impact they have.”  Stressing there was a shortage of supply, not demand, Mr. Bhargava said that last year, the company could have sold another 1.2 lakh units, but could not due to output constraints.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/maruti-q4-net-falls-614-covid-has-not-hit-sales/article34426755.ece
28 April 2021||Mumbai,||Mistry’s review petition cites ‘errors’ in SC order||The Shapoorji Pallonji Group has moved the Supreme Court seeking a review of its March 26 judgement that rejected the group’s case against the Tatas, arguing the judgment has “patent errors”, strikes at the core of the Companies Act and is a ‘complete miscarriage of justice’ on minority shareholders’ rights. The reasoning behind the apex court judgement, authored by a three-judge bench headed by the then chief justice S.A. Bobde, is so egregious that it warrants a review, the petitioners said. The judgment is contrary to both the Companies Act, 2013, and the statutes because it justifies the Tata group breaching its own Articles of Association while removing Cyrus Mistry as chairman, they said. The petition, yet to be admitted, seeks to ‘set right the errors... because if these are unaddressed, it will... impact the rights of all other minority shareholders’.

Further, a rating will be considered provisional in cases where certain compliances that are crucial to the assignment of credit rating are yet to be complied with or certain documentations remain to be executed at the time of rating.  “In no case shall a rating, including provisional rating, be assigned by a credit rating agency for an issuer or client evaluating strategic decisions such as funding mix for a project, acquisition, debt restructuring, scenario-analysis in loan refinancing,” SEBI said. On validity period, SEBI said provisional rating will be converted into a final rating within 90 days from the date of issuance of the instrument.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sebi-tightens-rules-for-provisional-debt-rating/article34426760.ece

28 April 2021||Leicester,||Leicester pulls seven ahead||Kelechi Iheanacho extended his career-best scoring form with a blistering winning goal as Leicester rallied to beat Crystal Palace 2-1 in the English Premier League and establish a seven-point cushion in the top four on Monday. The Nigeria striker made it 14 goals in his last 14 games in all competitions and brought Champions League qualification one step closer for Leicester. “When you have confidence in your game, it makes you perform really well,” said Iheanacho, who has 12 goals in his last nine games. Iheanacho’s hot streak could push Leicester over the line in the race for Champions League qualification, too. The win cemented third place for Brendan Rodgers’ team, which is four points ahead of Chelsea in fourth and seven clear of West Ham in fifth. Liverpool is a point further behind, with all four teams having five games to play. Correa’s brace Joaquin Correa scored twice as Lazio beat AC Milan 3-0 in Serie A to boost its chances of qualifying for the Champions League. Correa scored his first after just 77 seconds and doubled his tally in the 51st minute. Ciro Immobile completed the scoring three minutes from time. Lazio closed to within five points of fourth place and the final Champions League berth, having played a match less than the teams above it.  The results: Premier League: Leicester 2 (Castagne 50, Iheanacho 80) bt Crystal Palace 1 (Zaha 12).   Serie A: Torino 0 lost to Napoli 2 (Bakayoko 11, Osimhen 13); Lazio 3 (Correa 2, 51, Immobile 87) bt AC Milan 0.

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Sublime de Villiers the difference for RCB in one-run thriller||Royal Challengers Bangalore edged out Delhi Capitals by one run at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad to move to the top of the IPL points table on Tuesday. The match went down to the wire, with DC needing 14 runs from the last over bowled by Mohammed Siraj. The pacer kept his cool, even as Rishabh Pant (58 n.o., 48b, 6x4) and Shimron Hetmyer (53 n.o., 25b, 2x4, 4x6) fancied their chances. DC required six off the last ball, but Pant could only manage a four to deep point. Tricky target Set a tricky target of 172, DC pinned its hopes on skipper Pant and Hetmyer. It was Hetmyer who pulled DC into contention, blasting Kyle Jamieson for three big sixes in the 18th over. The West Indian made the most of a life gifted by Devdutt Padikkal, who dropped a simple chance when the batsman was on 15. Harshal Patel — the highest wicket-taker of the tournament — picked up the two vital scalps of Prithvi Shaw and Marcus Stoinis. After being put in, RCB relied on AB de Villiers (75 n.o., 42b, 3x4, 5x6) to push the side to a good total. De Villiers came to the crease with RCB having lost the key wickets of Virat Kohli, Padikkal and Glenn Maxwell. Kohli jabbed at a ball from pacer Avesh Khan which was too close to cut, while Padikkal was foxed by a gem from Ishant Sharma. Having predominantly taken the ball away from the in-form Padikkal, Ishant — playing his first match of the tournament — brought one into the left-hander to disturb the stumps. Maxwell looked good in his 20-ball 25 until a failed attempt to slog leggie Amit Mishra proved his undoing. De Villiers and Rajat Patidar (31, 22b, 2x6) steadied the ship with a 54-run fourth-wicket stand. De Villiers was in full flow in the last over bowled by Stoinis, tonking the medium-pacer for three sixes. It was an impossible situation for Stoinis, who was called in to bowl his first and only over of the day against a well-set de Villiers at the death. The risky move by DC skipper Pant proved costly, as Stoinis conceded 23 runs. During the course of his knock, de Villiers became the sixth batsman to cross 5,000 runs in the IPL.  de Villiers became the sixth batsman to cross 5,000 runs in the IPL||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sublime-de-villiers-the-difference-for-rcb-in-one-run-thriller/article34426875.ece
28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Millions of reasons why the IPL needs to rethink priorities||How many of us can watch the IPL without revulsion and guilt? Revulsion, at the insensitivity of continuing with a tournament amidst the pain and suffering in the country. And guilt at contributing, in whatever measure, to its profits by watching it on television. It is easy to confuse IPL with sports, but it is in fact a highly leveraged television serial ideal for selling products where people happen to play a version of a popular game. And television is unlikely to put its golden goose to sleep. There is another month to go — a month when there will be more cases, more deaths and greater anxiety, all matched by the triumphalism and crassness of the tournament being played in a bubble — in more senses than one. What price the 78-metre six or the fast yorker that hits middle stump when around you people are dying in horrific ways and hope is being sucked out of so many lives? Meaningless activity Sport is essentially a meaningless activity which we infuse with significance in normal times. Its artificiality allows us to pour into it the highest qualities we aspire to as human beings: compassion, honesty, fair-mindedness, kindness, respect, empathy, charity, everything that elevates us. But when it displays instead selfishness, indifference, and a lack of concern for the suffering of others, then it is no longer sport, but something that diminishes us. Public celebration (admittedly in near-empty stadiums), pointless statistics and excited commentary make it all so surreal. Even the ‘official’ figures of the dead and suffering in India are frightening. Over a million people are affected every three days. These are now widely believed to be grossly under-counted. To adapt what Bob Dylan said all those years ago: How many deaths will it take till they know that too many people have died? Hospitals are overcrowded, crematoriums too; there is a national medical emergency, yet ‘maximums’ are being hit on the cricket fields. There is something repugnant about this. Teams have arrived in the Capital — surely someone noticed during the drive from the airport that things aren’t normal? That the smoke rising in the distance is not announcing the election of a new pontiff, but the desperation of citizens? Distraction The yea-sayers will insist the IPL is a distraction in troubled times. Yes it is a distraction — from the ineptitude of the authorities who hope that if they close their eyes long enough, the situation will get better. In any case, neither the three-and-a-half lakh people who contract the virus daily nor their struggling families are likely to be interested how many deliveries Virat Kohli took for his latest fifty. Football, said the coach Bill Shankly, is not a matter of life and death, it is more serious. The IPL sees itself as more serious too. A friend sent me this prediction recently: “After playing on and being absolutely silent through the suffering, once the IPL is done, the players and managements will talk of how their heart bleeds and how they will now generously open their purses, via a collective cheque handed over to PM and his fund by Ganguly (since Jay Shah will be too obvious), the pictures being discussed for hours on end in sections of the media, followed by tweets from Sachin, Virat, et al.” The Australian Pat Cummins became the first player known to make a donation, with 50,000 dollars towards oxygen supplies to hospitals in India. “I encourage my fellow IPL players to contribute,” he tweeted. It will be interesting to see how many will. Its own insurance Some players, most recently India’s R. Ashwin, have pulled out, citing personal reasons. The Board of Control for Cricket in India does not see the IPL as a mere cricket tournament. It is a weapon to hold over the heads of players and other cricket boards. Displease the BCCI and there goes your income for the cricketing year! However much individual boards might like to recall their players during the crisis, it is unlikely any of them will do so. The players are only too aware which side their bread is buttered on, and grateful they can earn significant amounts of money when many avenues have dried up. The IPL is its own insurance. Perhaps if players like Kohli and Rohit Sharma decided to withdraw, there might be a cascading effect. But not everyone would want to take on the BCCI, so perhaps not. The IPL has its place in the scheme of things. In normal times, you have the option of turning off the TV if you don’t fancy it. But it’s different now. Turning off the TV will not turn off the feeling of the inappropriateness of its rude health and larger-than-life images being beamed across homes in India when the country is struggling with both health and life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/millions-of-reasons-why-the-ipl-needs-to-rethink-priorities/article34426918.ece
28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Purring CSK up against out-of-sorts SRH||After creaking last season, the rejuvenated Chennai Super Kings is motoring along like a well-oiled machine this season. Its different wheels are moving in cohesion. While the team is consistent, it is also throwing up match-winners such as ‘Hurricane’ Ravindra Jadeja. Versatile outfit CSK has four wins in five games and is looking versatile. Sunrisers Hyderabad, in contrast, has been struggling. It is unable to cross the finish line in close games; SRH has four defeats in five games. The side, undone by injury to yorker specialist T. Natarajan, has been adversely impacted by the lack of meaningful contributions from its Indian cricketers. But then, SRH,which lost a Super Over to Delhi Capitals, has the opportunity to find some form and momentum when it meets CSK in New Delhi’s Feroze Shah Kotla ground on Wednesday. All eyes will be on the pitch. If the past is any indication, the surface should encourage the spinners and pacemen who can send down effective cutters. Dew will be a factor.  CSK is looking hungry and dangerous. Openers Faf du Plessis and Ruturaj Gaikwad are among the runs and the side, with game-changing batsmen, bats deep. Then there is Jadeja. The left-hander is striking the ball like a dream and bowling with control and skill. M.S. Dhoni’s team has a probing attack. Deepak Chahar can seam the new ball to deadly effect. And Sam Curran, apart from batting with gusto, can bowl his left-arm seamers zestfully. SRH is too dependent on its four overseas cricketers, skipper David Warner, Jonny Bairstow and Kane Williamson with the bat, and Rashid Khan with the ball. Among the Indians, Vijay Shankar has bowled capably and shown flashes of batting form but has to finish games. CSK is the favourite but then you can never tell in cricket.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/purring-csk-up-against-out-of-sorts-srh/article34426880.ece

28 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Praggnanandhaa falls short; Carlsen tops league||Prodigious R. Praggnanandhaa’s impressive debut ended with successive draws against Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura and Alireza Firouzja but fell short of earning him a place among the quarterfinalists of the 16-man New in Chess Classic rapid online tournament on Tuesday. For the fifth straight time, Carlsen (10.5 points) led the quarterfinalists in his search for a title on the $1.5 million Champions Tour. Praggnanandhaa (7) tied for the 10th spot with teammate Vidit Gujrathi and Norwegian Aryan Tari. On the last day of the preliminary league, the 15-year-old Indian started with a defeat against Levon Aronian but quickly made amends by beating another debutant Norway’s Johan-Sebastian Christiansen before holding three illustrious qualifiers. Vidit, who ended the second day with two losses, started the final day with as many defeats after running into Sergey Karjakin and Liem Quang Le. He snapped the losing streak with a draw against Leinier Dominguez Perez, beat Gawain Jones and drew the final round with Teimour Radjabov.  Standings (after 15 rounds of preliminaries): 1.

Arif makes it a point daily to be with the 50-odd inmates in different age groups from all over India at the Jwala Gutta Academy of Excellence, set up by G. Jwala in Moinabad near here. “It was difficult to move away from my ‘second home’ Fateh Maidan Indoor Stadium where I coached for more than four decades. But, I just couldn’t say no to Jwala because of the kind of effort she has put in to set up this facility which I feel is the best in India. She insisted that I should be at her Academy,” said Arif. “I just can’t stay away from the badminton court. It gives me so much joy to be with these kids. Honestly, I enjoy every moment out there,” he said. Since November last year when the Academy became functional, Arif has been staying in the hostel sto avoid commuting 60km daily. “We are following all COVID-19 protocols and not allowing anyone from the Academy to go out or let anyone come inside too,” he said. “We stopped training the 20-odd local talent two weeks ago as a precautionary measure,” he added. “The well-planned residential facility with a bio-bubble in place has ensured the kids enjoy the three training sessions daily.” What makes Arif continue coaching? “I would say it is sheer passion and the desire to produce champions.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/arif-continues-doing-what-he-loves/article34426930.ece
28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Keeping fresh is key to success, says de Villiers||Despite having retired from international cricket in 2018, AB de Villiers has continued to find the big runs when he turns up at the IPL. This trend continued on Tuesday, when his unbeaten 42-ball 75 laid the platform for Royal Challengers Bangalore’s one-run win over Delhi Capitals. The South African stated that the key to success is keeping himself fresh. “Once you're in the tournament, it's about managing yourself and keeping fresh for every game. You can't go into the game feeling fatigued. I've done some work at home; we have treadmills in my room. I've done the work, and now it's about being as fresh as I can when I go out to bat,” de Villiers said in the post-match television presentation. De Villiers cited a stunning flat six over mid-wicket, off a fast, short ball from fellow South African Kagiso Rabada, as his favourite hit. Pat for Siraj RCB skipper Virat Kohli praised fast bowler Mohammed Siraj for keeping his cool in the final over of the match. “At one stage, I felt that the match was getting away from us. But the way Siraj started the last over gave us confidence. He finished clinically in the end,” Kohli said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/keeping-fresh-is-key-to-success-says-de-villiers/article34427345.ece
28 April 2021||KOCHI,||KBSA working on leaner ranking tournaments||It has been a long wait for badminton players in Kerala to get back on court for State-ranking tournaments. Many other sports emerged from the coronavirus lockdown and conducted their State championships in the last few months but things were quiet in shuttle sport. “If we have a State-ranking tournament, we will have something like 800 entries and 400 players, that is not easy to manage in these times. I had the opportunity to witness State squash in Thiruvananthapuram... there were 32 entries. “And then we had wrestling trials, the number was just five in one age category. You have to look at the sport and the number of entries involved,” Rakesh Sekhar, secretary, Kerala Badminton (Shuttle) Association, told The Hindu on Tuesday. “Since there were no ranking tournaments last year, if we conduct tournaments now, there could even be 1500 entries.” With stadiums and sports complexes forced to shut down once again in Kerala, the KBSA is now seriously working on conducting tournaments with a limited number of players when competitions are allowed to resume. District-ranking tournaments “We are planning to have State-ranking tournaments with a 32-player draw in singles and with a total of 150 players. And we will ask districts to conduct district-level ranking tournaments so that there will be less travel for players and parents. Probably five or six districts could have one or two ranking tournaments for players from their own districts,” said Sekhar. “And we could select players, probably three or four from each district, for State-ranking events based on their district rankings. The gap has been too long for our players, it’s almost two years since we had ranking tournaments, and this system could be the only way forward. “This was discussed at the KBSA’s Executive Committee meeting in Kollam (on Monday) and it will have to be ratified by the general body.” The KBSA will study the situation for about a month and then decide. If the situation gets better fast, it will get back to the old format. Otherwise, there will plenty of changes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kbsa-working-on-leaner-ranking-tournaments/article34427124.ece

The annual Royal vs St. Thomas’s encounter, originally scheduled for next month, has been indefinitely put off after four players tested positive for Covid-19, a school organiser said. The latest edition of Sri Lanka’s longest-running sporting event was to have been played over three days without spectators. “What would have been the 142nd Royal-Thomian big-match is not likely to be held this year because of the latest Covid wave,” the official said.

28 April 2021||MUMBAI,||BCCI strengthens biosecure protocols||The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has informed all the participants in the IPL that it has beefed up biosecure-bubble protocols in the wake of COVID-19 concerns. Five cricketers, including veteran India spinner R. Ashwin, have left the tournament due to COVID-related reasons, including bubble fatigue. As a result, BCCI interim chief executive Hemang Amin has written to everyone involved in the league. Referring to the first phase in Mumbai and Chennai as a “testament to our collective effort and discipline in these testing times”, Amin offered reassurances about safety. “We understand that there are a few apprehensions and concerns regarding the general situation in India and the withdrawals of certain cricketers. We completely respect the decision taken by the players and extend our support to them... At the same time, we would also assure you that you are totally safe within the bubble,” Amin stated in the email, accessed by The Hindu . “In order to allay any apprehensions and concerns, we are further strengthening our biosecure environments to keep everyone involved in the tournament safe and healthy.” Two-day gap for tests The additional measures include barring food delivery at team hotels and increased testing — a two-day gap between tests instead of the earlier five. Amin’s email underlines that the BCCI is determined to continue staging the tournament despite demands from a few quarters to suspend it. Amin stated that the BCCI “will do everything to ensure that you reach your respective destinations seamlessly”. “Be rest assured that the tournament is not over for BCCI till each one of you has reached your home, safe and sound,” he added. Zampa and Richardson leave for Australia Meanwhile, Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson, who left the Royal Challengers Bangalore bubble, boarded a flight on Tuesday night from Mumbai to Doha, en route Sydney.

That displayed you can play sport while the country is almost in full lockdown.” But he said it was not nice watching what was happening outside the bubble. “We lend our support to everybody who is ill or going through tough times,” he said. “We fight this together, no matter where in the world you are.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-fight-the-pandemic-together-morgan/article34426883.ece

Race weekends featuring the sprint qualifiers will have a tweaked format, with a regular qualifying session based on the fastest single lap after the first free practice on the Friday.

28 April 2021||London,||Gulf-money fuelled teams clash||The Champions League semifinal first leg encounter between Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday is a meeting of two clubs desperate to win the European Cup for the first time after lavish Gulf investment in the teams. Qatar-funded PSG did reach last season’s final, only to lose to Bayern Munich. Abu Dhabi-backed City has only ever made it to the semifinals once, losing in 2016 to Real Madrid before Pep Guardiola replaced Manuel Pellegrini. Winning domestic trophies isn’t a problem for City, which arrives in Paris fresh from winning a fourth straight League Cup win and sixth in eight years. Resumes training PSG is close to full strength, with central defender Marquinhos resuming training at the end of last week after recovering from an adductor injury and midfield schemer Marco Verratti playing the full 90 minutes at the weekend. PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino may consider attack the best form of defence and unleash top scorer Kylian Mbappe — who was declared fit for the match after a minor thigh injury scare — in a pure centre forward role, with Neymar and Angel Di Maria probing from the flanks. Mbappe has netted 37 goals in all competitions so far this season, two less than his career best from two seasons ago and looks certain to hit the 40 mark. Pochettino said on Tuesday that left back Juan Bernat and reserve goalkeeper Alexandre Letellier are the only players missing. Guardiola will be relieved to have playmaker Kevin De Bruyne back to fitness, after he set up the only goal against Tottenham on Sunday from a trademark free kick. “This is the second time we have got to the semifinals, so there is not much history for our club here,” Guardiola said.

28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||A short and sweet catch-22||Those who feasted upon — and still occasionally nibble on — animated feature Soul (which won the Academy Award this year for Best Animated Feature, Best Original Score and Best Sound) starring Jamie Foxx as the ever-patient jazz teacher Joe Gardner and Tina Fey as obstinate soul 22, will be delighted at the dessert offerings of the prequel short film 22 vs. Earth , by which time audiences have already connected with the fiesty character. The editor of Soul (as well as Inside Out and Up ), Kevin Nolting beams from ear to ear — over a video call from his Los Angeles home — as he says becoming a director for 22 vs. Earth boiled down to “being in the right place at the right time”. In under seven minutes, we see the quick-witted 22 (played by Tina Fey) standing up to the rules of ‘The Great Before’ (where souls get training before venturing to Earth as people), and refusing to go to Earth. She recruits a rag-tag team of five new souls but her gang’s activities lead to unforeseen results, and 22’s revolutionary plot may actually lead to a surprising revelation about life. Fond of this storyline and how it has come out, Nolting chats with MetroPlus about directing for the first time and shares his thoughts about a sequel for Soul . Edited excerpts:  Was it challenging directing 22 vs. Earth in that you did not want the film to come across as deleted scenes from Soul ? Yes,it is challenging in that respect as we know 22 and what she is. We don’t have time to explore a whole lot more and we have to be true to the feature film. Because we did not explore 22 as much as Joe in the film, we started talking about what made her this way and the specific incidents that led up to this 22 we see in Soul . The short was a perfect way to explore one aspect of that.  What was it like carrying forward 22’s cynicism, and its personality and legacy into the next generation of souls? I loved exploring how much influence a person like that has on innocent people. You are bound to get one or two along with you, maybe.(laughs) But at the centre of it, we were exploring what made 22 the way she is. In 22 vs. Earth , there is more evolved storytelling as I want to hear the conversations and interactions with her mentors, and still a fun and less complex story to tell. In Soul , we got to see a lot of her one-line gags. While working on Soul , was the concept of 22 vs. Earth already on the makers’ minds? Not at all. We usually do a little short connected to the feature films and in the past it was like a bonus on the DVD feature. So it was always there that this might happen but the specifics we do not get into until the end of the feature film. What was it like working with Tina Fey and Richard Ayoade (as Counsellor Jerry), both great storytellers in their own right? Were there any spontaneous moments during recording sessions that made its way into the films? Actors like that who also write and produce are one step ahead in a sense. They are already thinking and talking about storyline and characterisation in their own ways. And because they had done the characters before, I was lucky in that respect as a first-time director. 22 vs. Earth streams on Disney+Hostar Premium from April 30||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-short-and-sweet-catch-22/article34427100.ece
28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Clicking with customers and vendors||It is a flea market with a difference. Not only is it online but it is meant only for women entrepreneurs. An idea born out of necessity, the popularity of the flea market among buyers and sellers has enthused entrepreneur and flea market organiser Mamtha Pillai. Mamtha, who owns Meraki Home Garden, a niche outlet in Thiruvananthapuram, dealing with plants and planters, like many others, suffered a setback on account of the pandemic and lockdown. “All of us with small businesses suffered a blow because of the restrictions imposed to curb the pandemic. Many of us used to participate in sales, big and small, in Thiruvananthapuram and elsewhere. When all that got cancelled, some of us had no clue what to do with stocks, especially those with perishables like food,” says Mamtha. So, Mamtha came up with the idea of an online flea market on their dedicated Facebook page, Trivandrum Flea Market – An all-Women Initiative’, to help the women entrepreneurs market their products. “Although Instagram would have been a better platform for such sales, I realised that for many first-time social media users, especially senior citizens, Facebook would be an easier platform,” she says. The first one was conducted in July 2020 and the Facebook Live flea market turned out to be a huge hit among vendors and buyers. That boosted their confidence. More than 12 such virtual exhibitions have been conducted and Facebook live sales are organised frequently. “We managed to sell a wide range of products, such as pickles, snacks, cakes, desserts, clothes, handicrafts, home linen, art works, jewellery and so on. That convinced us that this was the way forward during these troubled times. Vendors come from different places in India and they have all found customers,” says Mamtha. Finally, on March 14, they organised their first physical exhibition and sale in a heritage space, House of Roses, in Thiruvananthapuram, which had been renovated by its owner, Cindu Vijay, an architect residing in Kozhikode. Twenty vendors participated in the exhibition and sale. As with their virtual sale, this too turned out to be successful and helped Cindu showcase her space among potential clients. Kasthuri Rajasegaran, a home-cook who specialises in Sri Lankan cuisine and eggless cakes, was one among the vendors at the sale. She says she was quite disappointed with the response to her Instagram account that begun in October 2020. “I participated in the Vishu event on March 14 and since then I have been flooded with orders. It has been a great encouragement because I am completely new to the city and have no friends or relatives here. The flea market has given me a strong helping hand,” she says. With the surge in COVID numbers, the vendors have reverted to sales through Facebook Live sessions and online exhibitions. To coincide with Mother’s Day, Celebrating Mom, a virtual sale will take place on May 7, 8 and 9. “Even after the pandemic is tamed and live exhibitions become popular again, we plan to continue with online events. It has broad-based our vendors and given customers more choices,” says Mamtha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/clicking-with-customers-and-vendors/article34427095.ece
28 April 2021||April 28 2021 00:00 IST,||A wire of safety||As news of the Hathras rape spread in September 2020, anger, grief and helplessness raged across the country. Men and women were united in condemning the increase of crimes against women. Telangana-based artist Maredu Ramu reacted to the news by beginning work on an installation titled My Boundary, which features a blindfolded sari-clad mannequin wrapped in barbed wire. “The woman [in my work] is now choosing this extreme way to remain safe,” says Ramu, explaining the red and yellow circles on which the installation stands, are representations of the kumkum (vermilion) and haldi (turmeric); the two symbols of a married woman in Indian society. “The application of kumkum and haldi (called pasupu ) is celebrated as a symbol of protection but that is a farce,” he says, adding, “Though it hurts her, she’s safer this way, against the lecherous men she has to encounter.” He further points out that the circles could also stand for a bindi.  “The circle has always been celebrated by the great artist SH Raza and more recently Bharati Kher too,” says Ramu. Ramu, who hails from Pedapally village in Telangana, did his MFA at Central University in Hyderabad. Though he works with different mediums, Ramu has expressed himself largely in acrylics of urban landscapes.  My Boundary is currently on show at Kashi Art gallery in Fort Kochi and will travel to Bengaluru in mid-May and also be shown in Mumbai and New Delhi later this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-wire-of-safety/article34427103.ece
28 April 2021||New Delhi,||Passing orders not end of duty, HC tells Delhi govt.||Several city hospitals on Tuesday objected before the Delhi High Court a recent circular of the Delhi government directing that all patients reaching healthcare facilities be attended to within 10 minutes and taken to the triage area. A Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli told the Delhi government that it was unnecessarily complicating the issue. “You think you have discharged your duty with this order? This is nothing more than a paper exercise and satisfying your own conscience,” the Bench remarked. The counsel for Maharaja Agrasen Hospital said hospitals are already full and the order will lead to more legal medical issues later. Delhi government’s senior counsel Rahul Mehra said that the April 25 order was in the nature of an advisory. “Patients were not being attended to. We got a lot of complaints,” Mr. Mehra said. “But this assumes that hospitals without your order are not doing their job. Don’t do this,” the court said. Principal Secretary (Health), Delhi government, said the intent of the order was to sensitise hospitals. To this the Bench said, “You don’t see the other side. Your own hospitals are not achieving this. Are any of them able to to this?” Oxygen shortage Several hospitals also raised issue of oxygen shortage. Shanti Mukund hospital complained that their allocation of oxygen has been reduced. Shanti Mukund Hospital said its allocation was 3.2 metric tonnes but the demand was 4 MT. Now the allocation has been reduced to 2.69 MT, the hospital claimed. Venkateshwar Hospital’s counsel told the court the hospital was running short of oxygen and the Delhi government’s nodal officer was not answering their call. “This is a constant complain. Which means there is truth in it,” the HC noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/passing-orders-not-end-of-duty-hc-tells-delhi-govt/article34426913.ece

In a hard-hitting letter to Delhi Chief Secretary Vijay Dev, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla also claimed that the Delhi government’s efforts to resolve logistical issues for procuring oxygen have “not been up to the mark” at a time when other States and Union Territories have been making earnest and professional efforts on the matter. Mr. Bhalla wrote the letter on April 25.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-rapped-over-oxygen-logistical-problems/article34426916.ece
