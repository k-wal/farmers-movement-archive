23 April 2021||New Delhi,||We expect national plan from Centre on oxygen, drugs: SC||Taking note of the ‘grim’ situation created by the massive surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths, the Supreme Court on Thursday said it expected the Centre to come out with a ‘national plan’ to deal with proper distribution of oxygen and essential drugs for patients. Observing that oxygen to patients infected with the virus was said to be an “essential part” of treatment, the court said it seemed that a certain amount of “panic” had been generated, due to which people had approached several High Courts seeking relief related to the prevailing situation. A Bench, headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde, which took suo motu cognisance on the issue of distribution of essential supplies and services during the pandemic, saidprima facieit was of the view that the distribution must be done in an “even handed manner” according to the advice of the health authorities. “In these circumstances, we direct that notices be issued to the Union government, the State governments /Union Territories and the parties, who appeared to have approached the High Courts to show cause why uniform orders be not passed by this court in relation to a) supply of oxygen; b) supply of essential drugs; c) method and manner of vaccination; and d) declaration of lockdown,” said the Bench, also comprising Justices L. Nageswara Rao and S. Ravindra Bhat. The court said it was of the opinion that the Centre should respond, including on the existence or otherwise and requirement of setting up of a coordinating body to consider allocation of the above resources in a consultative manner (with the involvement of the concerned States and the Union Territories).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/we-expect-national-plan-from-centre-on-oxygen-drugs-sc/article34389104.ece
23 April 2021||MANGALURU,||Pvt. bus operators to stop services during weekend curfew in city||Private bus operators across the State, who initially had planned to shut services during the weekend curfew, are now mulling to stop operating till May 4 in view of the government closing down all non-essential commercial activities and imposing hefty fine for not adhering to 50% occupancy rule on buses. “It is nothing but complete lockdown and goes against what Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier said about being cautious on imposing lockdown,” said Karnataka Private Bus Owners Association president K. Rajavarma Ballal. The association has already decided not to operate buses on two weekends; but Thursday’s government move to close down all non-essential commercial establishments has left the operators with no choice. A final decision will be taken by Monday, Mr. Ballal told The Hindu . Dakshina Kannada Bus Owners Association president Dilraj Alva said that when there is no routine commercial activity and people are forced to remain home, there is no need to operate buses during weekdays. Operators have already decided to stop services during weekend curfew anyway, he added. Mr. Ballal said that the government, which has mandated 50% occupancy on buses, has not waived or given concession in road tax. Operators are already overburdened with loan EMIs and increasing cost of inputs and the latest move will drive them to penury, he rued. The daily savings under the existing operating conditions itself does not cross Rs. 1,000 from which an operator has to bear other expenses, including EMI payment and insurance premium. “We want to surrender permits so that we can avoid payment of tax at least,” he said. Added to these woes, operators are being penalised for carrying more than 50% of the sanctioned capacity of buses. “Does the government make good the operational losses,” he asked. Association treasurer Kuyiladi Suresh Nayak said that the government did not respond to the plea for tax concession or waiver when he met officials on Thursday. In the present circumstances, it is difficult to continue operations as owners do not even recover the cost of diesel. The government which wants no inconvenience to the public did not give any via media to private operators while it supports road transport corporations in a big way, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pvt-bus-operators-to-stop-services-during-weekend-curfew-in-city/article34389704.ece

23 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Police close non-essential establishments in State||Taking traders by surprise, the police in many parts of the State on Thursday afternoon went on a drive shutting down several shops and commercial establishments not dealing with essential services like food, medicine and fuel. Many shopkeepers described it as an “undeclared lockdown” that will remain in force till May 4 that they did not anticipate. Order The ambiguity in the two sets of guidelines issued on Tuesday and Wednesday on COVID-19-related restrictions imposed on the State for the next two weeks had led to confusion. Traders interpreted them as a complete lockdown during weekends and that they allowed non-essential services to function during the weekdays till 9 p.m. However, on Thursday afternoon, police enforced a virtual lockdown, closing all shops not dealing with essential services, catching traders off guard. Traders in Bengaluru, Hubballi-Dharwad, Mangaluru, Mysuru, Tumakuru, Belagavi, among other cities, condemned the sudden change in policy causing chaos. They also rued that a two-week closure will impact trade already reeling under losses from the lockdown last year. Meanwhile, police allegedly forcefully closed down some industrial units and their corporate offices, allowed to function normally as per the guidelines, drawing the ire of industry bodies. CM upset The confusion in guidelines and the resultant chaos has led to some consternation in the government. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa was reportedly upset over the issue. “There was no clarity in the guidelines issued on Tuesday night, promoting an addendum being issued on Wednesday. But that also was not interpreted properly and communicated to either the media or the public, leading to this confusion on Thursday,” said a senior government functionary. Meanwhile, two former Chief Ministers, Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah and JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy, condemned the government’s “fickle policy” and sudden enforcement that has led to harassment of people. Industries to stop work Though most industries function on Saturdays, several managements have decided to stop work on the day on account of the curfew being in place till May 4. In lieu, they have asked workers to compensate for the shutdown by working some other day or adjust from their leaves, which has caused resentment. Trade union sources said that while the guidelines issued by the Chief Secretary on Tuesday were clear about smooth functioning of industrial activities during the curfew period, managements insist on shutting down.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/its-near-lockdown-all-week-as-police-close-non-essential-establishments/article34389233.ece
23 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||CM hints at more curbs as cases spiral||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday said the government might be constrained to impose more restrictions given the upward spiral of COVID-19 cases. The government has called an all-party meeting via videolink on April 26 to weigh the additional measures to retard the virulent second wave of infections. He said mask was mandatory even for persons travelling alone in cars. Shops should close by 7.30 p.m. Border facilitation centres would administer RT-PCR tests to inter-State travellers. The police would prosecute retail traders who violate the pandemic protocol. The government has set up a control room in Ernakulam to ensure the welfare of migrant workers. It has assigned persons with multilingual skills to manage the control room. Mr. Vijayan said family functions, especially funerals, had turned out to be super spreaders. Hence, the government has formed rapid response teams at the municipal and panchayat ward level. The squads would include teachers, Revenue Department officials, police officers, volunteers and the elected local body representative. They would prepare contact lists, monitor social events and conduct household-level visits and checks. The police on Thursday booked 28,606 persons for violating the mask mandate. Kollam district reported the highest number of violations at 4,896. Smooth vaccination Mr. Vijayan said the police should ensure there was no crowding in vaccination centres. They should allow only those who have booked the slots in advance into the centres. The government would conduct Thrissur Pooram as per COVID-19 protocol. It would not allow gatherings. The temple authorities would observe the rituals. The managements have cancelled the Irinjalakuda Koodalmanikyam temple festival. The Pavaratty Church festival has also been called off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-hints-at-more-curbs-as-cases-spiral/article34389267.ece
23 April 2021||New Delhi,||Centre cracks down on curbs to oxygen movement||The Centre invoked the Disaster Management Act on Thursday, making the District Magistrates and Senior Superintendent of Police personally liable to ensure unhindered inter-State movement of vehicles carrying medical oxygen and to not restrict the supply to a particular State where the oxygen plant is located. The order comes hours after Delhi’s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that the governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were blocking the supply of oxygen to Delhi. Delhi procures medical oxygen from neighbouring districts in these States. The Union Home Secretary is the Chairman of the National Executive Committee under the DM Act, 2005. The 2005 legislation was invoked for the first time in March 2020 to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic after it came into being in the wake of the tsunami disaster. The order said, “No restriction shall be imposed on the movement of medical oxygen between the States, and transport authorities shall be instructed to accordingly allow free inter-State movement of oxygen carrying vehicles.” “No restrictions shall be imposed on oxygen manufacturers and suppliers to limit supplies only to the hospitals of the State/UT in which they are located.” The order added that there shall be free movement of oxygen carrying vehicles into cities, without any restriction of timings, while also enabling inter-city supply without any restriction and “no authority shall attach the oxygen carrying vehicles passing through the district or areas for making supplies specific to any particular district(s) or area”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-cracks-down-on-curbs-to-oxygen-movement/article34389088.ece

With active cases shooting up, the health infrastructure has come under severe strain. Warning to doctors The State government issued a stern warning to doctors who were reluctant to join their duties at COVID-19 hospitals. “It is seen that in the present COVID-19 pandemic, which has been declared as a national disaster, a number of doctors temporarily posted for management of COVID-I9 duty in different districts are not joining to their place of deployment; thus putting hardship on district administration,” said Director of Medical Education and Training (DMET) in a letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-a-first-odishas-daily-cases-cross-6000/article34389129.ece
23 April 2021||Pune,||‘Centre allocated Maharashtra just 26,000 Remdesivir vials’||In yet another chapter in the Centre-State blame game over the supply of Remdesivir and oxygen amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said the State, the worst-hit in the country, had been allocated barely 26,000 injections of Remdesivir by the Centre as against its daily requirement of 50,000 vials. Speaking in Mumbai, Mr. Tope said he would write to the Centre to increase the allocation of Remdesivir to Maharashtra. “The State government’s daily requirement is 50,000 Remdesivir injections, but the Centre’s allocation for the next 10 days is just 26,000 injections per day. I appeal to the Centre to allot more injections to Maharashtra as the situation here is grave. I will be writing to the Union Health Ministry in this regard,” he said. The Centre on Wednesday detailed an allocation of 2.69 lakh vials for Maharashtra till the end of this month. This translates to less than 30,000 vials per day. Likewise, Mr. Tope appealed to the Centre to increase Maharashtra’s oxygen allocation quota as well. “The oxygen distribution quota is in the Centre’s hands. I humbly request the Centre to ensure safe transport of the oxygen through a ‘green corridor’ to Maharashtra,” he said. Remarking that the pandemic situation in the State had spiralled out of control, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut urged the Centre to stop according ‘step-motherly treatment’ to Maharashtra in terms of supply of oxygen, vaccines and medicines. “We need 80,000 vials of Remdesivir per day. Yet, why is the State getting less from the Centre? Who are the people who are playing with the lives of the people of Maharashtra?” he said. Meanwhile, the BJP’s Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council, Pravin Darekar, hit back at both the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government leaders, Mr. Tope and Mr. Raut, while remarking that it was high time the State government stopped pointing fingers at the Centre instead of doing something on its own to curb the spread of the virus. BJP slams MVA govt. “It appears that if anything happens, the Uddhav Thackeray government first begins to blame the Centre. The Central government has already raised Maharashtra’s oxygen supply quota to more than 1,600 metric tonnes. Now, whose responsibility is it to get that oxygen for the State? The leaders of the MVA government cannot even arrange for tankers or special flights to procure that oxygen,” he said. Mr. Darekar accused the State government of attempting to cut corners instead of utilising the taxpayers’ money to save lives.

23 April 2021||Belagavi,||Govt. preparing for increased vaccination from May 1||With the Union government allowing all adults to get vaccinated from May 1, the State government is preparing to increase its capacity to store, deliver and administer vaccine doses. For large districts such as Belagavi, this means a 10-fold increase in logistics arrangements. When the Centre fixed the age limit for people to receive the vaccine at 60, the State government fixed a target of 4.4 lakh in the district. But if all adults are to be vaccinated, then the district administration will have to provide vaccine shots to 35 lakh people. Health Department officers say that this is a tall order, as this would be the largest vaccination drive ever taken up in the district. “The biggest vaccination drive till now has been Pulse Polio when around 16 lakh children were vaccinated. The current target would be double that number. We need to work on storage, transport and delivery,’’ a senior health officer said. “As of now, we have 228 vaccination centres across the district. They include 200 government facilities and 28 private hospitals. This means we have one vaccination centre for two gram panchayats. But if we are to vaccinate every adult, we need four vaccination centres for every gram panchayat. We need to set up temporary vaccination centres in primary health centres or the gram panchayats,’’ another officer said. “The most important factor is maintaining the cold chain. In many of the 506 gram panchayats, there is no 24-hour power supply. This means the vaccine will be rendered ineffective. We need temporary power back-up or other arrangements,” he added. On Wednesday, Regional Commissioner Amlan Aditya Biswas and Deputy Commissioner K. Harish Kumar held a meeting with officers on increasing the rate of tests. They also spoke of increasing the capacity of vaccination in a phased manner. Another series of meetings is lined up this week to prepare for mass vaccination from May 1, Mr. Kumar said.  If all adults are to be vaccinated in the district, then the administration will have to provide vaccine shots to 35 lakh people||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-preparing-for-increased-vaccination-from-may-1/article34389226.ece
23 April 2021||Belagavi,||One BJP MLA criticises govt., another defends decision||BJP leader and MLA Abhay Patil has criticised the State government’s move of closing down non-essential shops with a view to containing the spread of COVID-19. “This is not right. This will cause a lot of damage to the economy. The State government should have indicated that the closure of non-essential shops so that traders and the general public could have prepared for it. The government should not take such arbitrary steps,” he told journalists. Earlier, shop owners and shoppers were both shocked when the police closed down all shops selling non-essential commodities in the district. The police went around closing shops, offices and driving away petty vendors. Vegetable vendors with vehicles were allowed to do business. Those who were sitting in one place and selling vegetables were asked to stop doing business. Police Commissioner K. Thiyagarajan said that they had received orders from the State government to close down all shops and establishments that were considered non-essential. He said that shops dealing in essential goods and services were not closed. BJP MLA Anil Benake defended the move saying that it is necessary in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/one-bjp-mla-criticises-govt-another-defends-decision/article34389228.ece
23 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||No response from Centre, State to buy vaccines directly||The State has initiated discussions with vaccine manufacturers to procure adequate vaccine supplies as there has been no response from the Centre regarding the request for additional stocks, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. Addressing the media here on Thursday, Mr. Vijayan said that even while awaiting a reply from the Centre, the State was not in a position to wait interminably for vaccines to arrive. The Chief Secretary, the Finance Secretary and the Health Secretary will lead the discussions with manufacturers on all aspects, including the pricing and quantum of vaccines required, he said. However, the private sector would have to make their own vaccine purchase as the State cannot buy for them, he said. He said the government was taking measures to streamline the vaccine distribution and depending on availability, vaccine sessions would be organised by the health and district authorities. Only those with prior online registration will be administered the vaccine. The government has engaged an expert committee to draw up clear guidelines to administer vaccines to the 1.65 crore population of those in the 18-45 year age group when registrations are to be opened from May 1. Mr. Vijayan said a task force would be set up under the Additional Chief Secretary to monitor and evaluate hospital facilities for COVID-19 care. Fixed treatment cost Private sector hospitals would have to fix their treatment costs on a just and rational manner, and the district authorities would be asked to intervene in keeping treatment costs at a fair level, the Chief Minister said. He said there were complaints about the differential and indiscriminate rates being charged by various private hospitals, ranging from Rs. 2,300 to Rs. 20,000. He said that rationalising treatment costs would be taken up with the representatives of private hospitals at a meeting on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-response-from-centre-state-to-buy-vaccines-directly/article34389269.ece

23 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||GHMC declares 63 containment zones||Rapped by the Telangana High Court over lack of measures to contain the COVID-19 spread, the government has declared a total of 63 containment zones in the city limits, almost evenly spread over all the six zones of GHMC. A list of all the containment zones has been put on display on the GHMC website, where localised measures will be taken to control the spread of COVID-19 infection. Of the total, 12 containment zones are in Charminar, 11 in Secunderabad and 10 each in L.B.Nagar, Khairatabad, Kukatpally and Serilingampally. Fourteen of the total containment zones have been established in residential complexes, all in Kukatpally and Secunderabad zones. Officials have informed that wherever the number of COVID-19 patients are more than five in close vicinity, such areas are being declared as mini containment zones. GHMC is taking up sanitisation activities in all the containment zones, by spraying one per cent solution of the sodium hypochlorite on frequently touched surfaces and frequently visited areas. Fever surveys Besides, in coordination with the Medical & Health department, fever surveys are being conducted in the zones, in order to collect the swab samples and send them for COVID-19 testing, official sources informed. Entry and exit points of the containment zones are not being monitored, nor are the residents being restrained from going out of the zones, they said. During the first wave of COVID-19, the State government, with the involvement of GHMC, Police and Medical & Health officials, had declared vast area around the COVID-19 affected households as containment zones, and enforced strict surveillance near the entry and exit points. Outsiders were not allowed into the zones, and insiders were not allowed to venture out. All needs of the residents were taken care of by teams of workers and volunteers deployed for this purpose at each containment zone.  COVID-19 infection in its second wave is surging ahead in Telangana and GHMC at a faster pace than the first wave, as it is in several other States. On Wednesday, GHMC region has recorded a total of 989 fresh COVID-19 infections, the highest so far in the second wave.

23 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||‘No shortage of oxygen in govt. hospitals’||While expressing concern over the rapidly growing number of COVID-19 positive cases, Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas, who is heading the Group of Ministers (GoM) tasked with containing the spread of the pandemic, has asserted that the government is capable of handling the situation and advised people not to panic. Addressing the media after taking stock of the COVID-19 management and containment measures at a meeting of the GoM at the APIIC head office in Mangalagiri on Thursday, Mr. Srinivas said they had discussed the steps needed to bring down the number of cases and maintain adequate supply of oxygen, and vaccination. The GoM would be submitting its recommendations to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy during the next round of deliberations. Certain measures had been taken to ensure that there was no shortage of oxygen or medicines in the hospitals across the State. Oxygen plant As far as the oxygen supply was concerned, the Minister said it was in line with the current requirement of 360 tonnes, and that there was no problem for the government hospitals. The Centre would be providing assistance for setting up a new oxygen plant in the State. He urged people to wear face masks, sanitise their hands and maintain physical distance to prevent the spread of the virus. Mr. Srinivas further said that the government had so far vaccinated 49 lakh people, and warned that stringent action would be taken against hospitals exploiting the patients. ‘Decision on exams soon’ In his interaction with the media separately, Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh said that the government was trying to save the academic year for the students of Class 10 and Intermediate, and that a decision on universities, status of classes, and examinations would be taken soon. Ministers M. Sucharitha (Home), Buggana Rajendranath Reddy (Finance), Botcha Satyanarayana (Municipal Administration), Mr. Suresh, and K. Kannababu (Agriculture), and DGP D. Gautam Sawang were among others present at the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-shortage-of-oxygen-in-govt-hospitals/article34389099.ece
23 April 2021||New Delhi/Gurugram,||Sisodia seeks Centre’s help as Capital chokes||At least half a dozen hospitals ran out of oxygen in Delhi even as others struggled with depleting supply across the National Capital Region (NCR) on Thursday. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called on his counterparts in other States for a united front against the pandemic and pledged to share resources at every possible opportunity to do so. Mr. Kejriwal’s deputy and nodal Minister for COVID management in the city Manish Sisodia asked the Centre to intervene and deploy paramilitary personnel at borders if need be to ensure that the Capital gets its quota of oxygen from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, accusing their governments of interfering in supply. He wrote a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan stating that six private hospitals had exhausted their stock of oxygen, urging him to intervene to save the lives of people of Delhi and make sure that the city gets its quota of oxygen from other States. Officials appointed Fortis Hospital in Haryana’s Gurugram, in a series of distress messages on Thursday evening, said it was left with only 45 minutes of oxygen supply. In Delhi, two IAS officers were appointed to ensure smooth procurement of oxygen tankers from neighbouring States and the police tasked with facilitating movement to medical establishments. Around 1 p.m., Rathi Hospital in Delhi, which has 78 COVID-19 patients, said it had oxygen only for half an hour. Shanti Mukund Hospital pasted a poster on its gate that it is stopping admissions. Another private hospital said around 5 p.m. that it had oxygen only for 90 minutes and had 233 COVID patients. According to Delhi government estimates, Mr. Kejriwal said, the city required a daily supply of 700 tonnes of oxygen and the Centre had on Wednesday decided to increase the initial quota of 378 tonnes to 480 tonnes. In his letter to Dr. Vardhan, Mr. Sisodia stated that only one of the seven major government hospitals under the Delhi government had oxygen supply for 24 hours while six of the 15 major private hospitals in the city had exhausted theirs. Others were struggling with little to dangerously low supply of oxygen. The Delhi government, he said, was also mulling airlifting oxygen from Odisha. The pandemic, Mr. Kejriwal said, was a collective crisis and everyone needed to come together to confront and defeat it. It was time, he said, that governments rose above State divisions and became “Indians”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sisodia-seeks-centres-help-as-capital-chokes/article34389626.ece
23 April 2021||Guwahati,||300 flyers skip COVID test at Assam airport||Police and health officials in southern Assam’s Barak Valley have begun tracing about 300 air passengers who skipped mandatory tests for COVID-19 after landing at the Kumbhirgram airport near Silchar town on Wednesday. The State government had, in view of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, made it a must for all incoming passengers to undergo rapid antigen test and RT-PCR on arrival. The tests on incoming passengers at the airport are done at the Tikol Model Hospital nearby. Officials said 690 passengers had landed from six of the seven flights that touched down at the airport on Wednesday. Some passengers travelling to other States in the Northeast were exempted from testing. “Six of the 189 passengers who underwent RAT and RT-PCR tested positive,” Cachar district’s Additional Deputy Commissioner Sumit Sattawan said, adding that 300 passengers trooped out of the hospital without testing. All incoming passengers at Kumbhirgram are given the option to go to the hospital in buses provided by the local administration or take their own vehicles by giving an undertaking and sharing the details of the vehicle and the driver. Inadequate security One of the reasons the air passengers defied the hospital authorities is said to be the inadequate security on the premises. There were only four police personnel at the hospital on Wednesday. “The list of all the 300 passengers who skipped the testing is being prepared. We will trace them and take necessary legal action,” Mr. Sattawan said. Bhanwar Lal Meena, Cachar’s Superintendent of Police, said it would not be difficult to trace the passengers from Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts. “Air passengers are expected to be responsible citizens. We hope none of these 300 people test positive, but in case some of them do, they have already endangered the lives of their near and dear ones,” he told The Hindu . Assam’s COVID-19 positive count increased by 1,665 on Wednesday. Of the five COVID-related deaths recorded, one was from Cachar district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/300-flyers-skip-covid-test-at-assam-airport/article34389629.ece
23 April 2021||MYSURU,||‘Undeclared’ lockdown in Mysuru||An ‘undeclared’ lockdown situation prevailed in Mysuru city on Thursday morning after the police asked all shops and commercial establishments into non-essential trade to down shutters till May 4 in view of the worsening COVID-19 situation, causing confusion among the shopkeepers. These curbs are in addition to the night curfew and weekend curfew announced by the government for curbing COVID-19 surge. The police, in patrol vehicles, went around the city announcing non-essential businesses to down shutters. The sudden decision surprised and confused traders who sought a clarity on the matter as they thought they were exempted from restrictions. Those who had come for shopping in the city’s commercial hubs, including D. Devaraj Urs Road, Sayyaji Rao Road, and Ashoka Road, had to leave the shops and return home following the announcement of closure of all non-essential businesses till 6 a.m. on May 4. Some of the traders urged the district administration to allow them to at least function till the afternoon. However, the police told the traders that they were enforcing the government’s guidelines that came into effect from Wednesday. Movement of goods, public transport, and private transport has been permitted besides construction activities, offices and industries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/undeclared-lockdown-in-mysuru/article34389734.ece

23 April 2021||New Delhi,||Create special corridor for oxygen supply to Delhi, HC directs Centre||The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the Centre to immediately create a special corridor for safe and swift passage of oxygen tankers from neighbouring States such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the Capital. Delhi has been allocated 480 metric tonnes of medical oxygen by the Central government to tide over the unprecedented rise in COVID-19 cases. The Delhi government, however, stated that 140 metric tonnes of medical oxygen scheduled to come from Panipat in Haryana were not being allowed to be picked up by the local authorities there. “The situation in Delhi has rather turned precarious, with several hospitals complaining of complete exhaustion of oxygen or depletion to the level that it may not last after the next few hours,” a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli remarked, adding, “We all know that this country is being run by god.” “We make it clear that non-compliance of the said order [of April 21] and our order passed today will be viewed seriously since their non-compliance is likely to result in great loss to lives,” it said. The High Court also directed the Central government to ensure that adequate security is provided to the trucks transporting the oxygen. “A special corridor may be created for immediate transportation of the oxygen,” the Bench ordered. Bed availability Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said since there is a four-fold spike in COVID-19 cases in the Capital, the Centre could consider augmenting 80% of the beds in AIIMS Jhajjar, AIIMS Trauma Centre, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge hospital to make available around 8,000 more beds. “We expect the Central government to look into the requirement,” the Bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/create-special-corridor-for-oxygen-supply-to-delhi-hc-directs-centre/article34389627.ece

The distance between the villages was 2.5 km. A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi sought response from the authorities on the petition filed by M. Chelliah of Kodaikanal. The petitioner said that some of the landowners had agreed to give a part of their lands for the construction of the road. The petitioner said that around 20 families were residing in Kootapparai and Nallurkadu had a population of around 600. The villagers were dependent on agriculture and they were engaged by the owners of agricultural lands in the area. Kootapparai lacked basic amenities and to buy groceries the villagers had to come to Nallurkadu. In the absence of proper connectivity between the two villages, the residents of Kootapparai faced hardship, particularly during medical emergencies as ambulances could not reach Kootapparai from Nallurkadu, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pil-petition-seeks-laying-of-road-to-link-two-village-near-kodaikanal/article34389139.ece

23 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Vizhinjam: arbitration proceedings begin||The arbitration proceedings between the State government and Adani Vizhinjam Port Pvt. Ltd. (AVPPL), tasked with constructing the Vizhinjam International Multipurpose Seaport, on a 16-point ‘notice of disputes’ raised by the AVPPL has commenced. The AVPPL will file their claims by April 26 before a tribunal comprising presiding officer R.V. Ravindran and arbitrators K.S.P. Radhakrishnan and Kurian Joseph, all former Supreme Court judges. A preliminary online hearing was held after Mr. Radhakrishnan, arbitrator appointed by the AVPPL, and Mr. Joseph, arbitrator for the State government, opted for Mr. Ravindran as the presiding officer. State’s counterclaims The State will get two months to file counterclaims after the AVPPL files its claims and the arbitration is expected to be completed by December 2021. Official sources said most of the 16 claims are ‘force majeure’ and had been rejected by the Vizhinjam International Seaport Limited (VISL), the executing agency of the seaport project. The AVPPL had missed the project’s Phase I deadline of December 3, 2019. It had sought 16 months’ extension citing ‘damage’ inflicted by Cyclone Ockhi. The claim was rejected as just a dredger was damaged. Extension However, the VISL granted extension following the lockdown imposed last year due to COVID-19. The project is still dragging on. As per the agreement, after the Phase 1 deadline, there is a nine-month cure period (grace period), in which after the first three months, i.e. after March 2020, the AVPPL has to pay damages for not meeting the deadline. In July 2020, the AVPPL raised the disputes, bypassing the conciliation norms cited in the agreement. The AVPPL also approached the International Centre for Alternate Dispute Resolution (ICADR) to seek an arbitrator’s appointment on behalf of the government under ICADR Arbitration Rules, 1996. As per the legal opinion received by the government, the AVPPL move was ‘premature and irregular.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vizhinjam-arbitration-proceedings-begin/article34389265.ece

In rural areas, even the first dose is being administered to only a limited number of people daily; in Chennai, a section of residents found it difficult to get the second dose. Mathew Thomas, a resident of Old Mahabalipuram Road, went to the Injambakkam primary health centre for the second dose of Covaxin. “Covishield was available but the PHC had no stock of Covaxin. I have to wait for Covaxin since this is my second jab,” he said. The staffers told him that Covaxin was expected in two days. He left his contact number. “I saw a list of phone numbers written down. Reality is different from the plan,” he said. For a week, only this PHC had been providing Covaxin in the East Coast Road-Old Mahabalipuram Road belt, sources said. A person who went to a private hospital on Nelson Manickam Road for his second dose had a bitter experience. He had taken his first dose on March 10. People were asked to wait in a temporary tent until the vaccine arrived. Officials then announced that only the second dose would be administered. “Once the vaccine arrived, it was a mad scramble,” he said. Another person who wanted his parents to receive the second dose on Friday said when he called up the hospital, officials there told him that they had run out of stock and asked him to check again on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/many-in-tn-miss-out-on-second-dose/article34389140.ece

Current trends from the CoWIN portal, on those above 45 years with co-morbidities, show that walk-ins far outweigh online pre-registrations, with 8 crore walk-ins when compared with 1.3 crore online registrations. On Monday, the Centre announced that everyone above 18 years will be eligible for a vaccine from May. Estimates of India’s adult population range from 800 to 900 billion. Leaving out those above 45 years, and the 130 million who have received at least one dose, about 500 to 600 million people are expected to register for a COVID-19 vaccine from Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/anyone-over-18-can-register-for-vaccine-from-april-28/article34389086.ece

23 April 2021||New Delhi,||High Court dismisses FB, WhatsApp pleas||The Delhi High Court on Thursday dismissed plea of instant messaging app WhatsApp challenging a decision of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) calling for an investigation into its controversial new privacy policy. WhatsApp had contended that since the issue of its privacy policy was before the Supreme Court, the CCI did not need to order the probe. Not only WhatsApp, but social media giant Facebook, which owns the instant messaging app, had also filed a similar petition challenging the competition watchdog’s March 24 decision. WhatsApp had said the CCI “jumped the gun” and started the probe when this was not a competition issue. It had said the issue with respect to personal data of users, and sharing of personalised data was already before the Supreme Court, hence CCI ought not to have intervened. The High Court, however, noted that CCI’s order of investigation could not be quashed merely because it did not await the outcome of the pending cases before the Supreme Court and High Court. Data access The CCI, on the other hand, had argued the probe order was made to gauge whether access to data would lead to abuse of dominant position. The commission had said it was dealing with the instant messaging app’s new privacy policy that could lead to “excessive data collection” of consumers, the use and sharing of the data in anti-competitive context. The commission had said it was not concerned with the privacy aspect of the issue as the Supreme Court was already seized of it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/high-court-dismisses-fb-whatsapp-pleas/article34388989.ece
23 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Uncertainty looms over vaccine rollout for all above 18 years||With registrations to be opened up from next week for vaccination of all those above 18 from May 1, uncertainty remains on whether the rollout will be smooth. A senior government official, closely connected with the COVID management strategy, said the Centre’s decision was led by most States wanting the “flexibility” to domestically procure vaccines as well as import them. The National Expert Group on Vaccination discussed the pros and cons of whether State and private hospitals should be allowed to source vaccines independent of the Centre. “The discussions were detailed; there was no dissent,” the official told The Hindu . To address the ongoing crisis, the way out was a “massively parallel process of rollout” and the “surge has also brought to the front the need for speeding vaccination,” the official said. However, it would be premature to expect a prompt rollout beginning May 1. In spite of having approved three vaccines — Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V — suppliers have said they will not be able to ramp up supply before July. Adar Poonawala of the Serum Institute of India said he had supplied 110 million doses and was in the process of supplying another 100 million of Covishield. Bharat Biotech’s Krishna Ella said he had supplied 30 million doses and would supply 10 million more by April end. By July, with all their proposed manufacturing facilities running, they expected to be able to produce 60-70 million doses per month. However, at least 500-600 million beneficiaries are expected to sign up for vaccinations from May 1, which is the approximate number of Indians between 18 and 45 years old. Giridhar Babu, epidemiologist and part of the Karnataka Covid Task Force told The Hindu , “We are still to see a strategy or a document on how this rollout will be scheduled.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uncertainty-looms-over-vaccine-rollout-for-all-above-18-years/article34389026.ece
23 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||India joins search for submarine||The Indian Navy on Thursday dispatched its deep submergence rescue vessel (DSRV) from Visakhapatnam to support the Indonesian Navy in the search and rescue efforts for its submarine KRI Nanggala that went missing on Wednesday with 53 personnel aboard. “Spoke to the Defence Minister of Indonesia, General Prabowo Subianto over the phone and shared my pain over the news of missing submarine Nanggala and its crew members. India is extending its full support to the ongoing Indonesian rescue efforts,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Twitter. “I have already directed the Indian Navy to move its DSRV to Indonesia. I have also tasked the Indian Air Force to see the feasibility of induction of the DSRV intervention system by air,” he added. On April 21, an alert was received by the Navy through the International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office (ISMERLO), regarding the missing Indonesian submarine, the Navy said in a statement. The submarine was reportedly exercising in a location 25 miles north of Bali, it stated. The DSRV departed by sea and has to cover a distance of approximately 2,500 nautical miles, a Navy official said. Air Chief Marhal Hadi Tjahjanto, Commander of Indonesian armed forces, said KRI Nanggala 402 was participating in a torpedo firing exercise when it went missing. The Indonesian Defence Ministry said the submarine lost contact after being granted clearance to dive. The Indonesian Navy launched a massive search and rescue effort for the missing submarine and requested assistance from countries in the region. The 53 personnel onboard includes 49 crew members, three gunners and its commander. Specialised capability India is amongst the few countries in the world capable of undertaking search and rescue of a disabled submarine through a DSRV, the Navy said. “Indian Navy’s DSRV system can locate a submarine up to 1,000-metre depth utilising its state-of-the-art side scan sonar and remotely operated vehicle,” it stated, adding that after the submarine is successfully located, another sub module of DSRV — the Submarine Rescue Vehicle (SRV) — links with the submarine to rescue the trapped personnel. The SRV can also be used to provide emergency supplies to the submarine. The Singapore Navy has already pressed its rescue vessel while Australia too has offered assistance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-joins-search-for-submarine/article34389000.ece

Both used to spend a lot of time at our home after school playing with my daughter Aparajitha. They were living on the 5th floor and we were in the 3rd floor of VP house (hostel for MPs),” Mr. Raja told The Hindu . Senior Congress leaders also expressed their condolences. Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, in a heartfelt post on Twitter, said that there is no greater loss for a parent to endure. “May you find the strength to bear the inexpressible grief of your loss. My heart goes out to you at this painful time,” Mr. Tharoor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yechurys-son-ashish-passes-away/article34389030.ece
23 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Webinar spotlights India’s connect with Korean wave||Travelling to South Korea, “K-dramas”, “K-beauty” and Korean cuisine came under the spotlight at a webinar on “The rising Korean wave in India and how it will influence post-pandemic travel to South Korea” on Thursday. The webinar was curated by The Hindu Weekend for The Hindu , in association with the Korea Tourism Organisation, and delved into the various facets of South Korean culture which has found new fans over the past year. Speaking about the Korean language learning boom, Rathi Jafer, Director, InKo Centre, who also moderated the webinar, recalled how, in 2006, people registered to learn the language solely for reasons of employment. “Today, it is to follow what their idol is singing or their favourite star is saying. There’s always a waiting list [for the language classes] now,” she said. Scherezade Shroff, fashion, beauty, travel and lifestyle content creator, said that K-dramas provided a holistic viewing experience and spoke about the strong messaging that many shows had. “The shows are subtly bringing in important conversations about mental health or sexual harassment at work,” she said. Chef Vikramjit Roy, a panellist, showed the audience white kimchi , the flavourful, non-spicy dish made with cabbage and seasonal vegetables, and gochujang , the savoury-sweet red chilli paste that goes into bibimbap , and a host of other Korean dishes. “I am fascinated by how people are using K-beauty and its detailed regimens as a method of self care, to ground themselves, to overcome anxiety,” said singer and entrepreneur Chinmayi Sripada, who started Isle of Skin, an e-portal to bring her favourite K-beauty brands into India. Sandeep Dutta, marketing manager, Korea Tourism Organisation, said that there was plenty to look forward to travel, including dedicated tours to locations in K-dramas and K-pop videos. “Mass vaccination is ongoing in the country, and South Korea hopes to achieve herd immunity by the end of September. They are also launching vaccine passports by the end of this month. So by the end of this year, hopefully, travel can happen without quarantine,” he added. Young-Geul Choi, Director, Korea Tourism Organisation, in his closing address, said he hoped to see everyone in South Korea soon.

23 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Amid COVID-19 surge, Modi cancels West Bengal rallies||Prime Minister Narendra Modi cancelled his election rallies in West Bengal scheduled for Friday, looking at the exponential rise in COVID-19 cases in the country. He will instead be holding meetings on COVID-19 management with the Chief Ministers of high-burden States and leading oxygen manufacturers of the country. Mr. Modi said on Twitter, “Tomorrow, will be chairing high-level meetings to review the prevailing COVID-19 situation. Due to that, I would not be going to West Bengal.” He was scheduled to address four meetings, including one at the Shaheed Minar grounds in Kolkata. There was some talk that he might hold a virtual rally on Friday, but Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sources refused to confirm the same. It’s not clear at the moment whether the suspension of campaign is only for Friday’s meetings or the rest of the campaign time for the last two phases of the West Bengal Assembly election. The BJP and other political parties came under sharp criticism after their massive rallies and roadshows continued amid skyrocketing COVID-19 cases. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had earlier announced that he would not undertake campaigning in West Bengal due to the surge, but the BJP and the Trinamool Congress held big rallies. Hospitals, especially in the National Capital Region, have been running out of oxygen and beds, forcing courts to step in. West Bengal crossed five figures in daily cases as the election phases passed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-covid-19-surge-modi-cancels-west-bengal-rallies/article34389006.ece
23 April 2021||Kolkata,||Vaccine policy is anti-people and biased, says Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating that the vaccine policy of the Centre is “highly discriminatory and anti-people”. “I am afraid, this policy is highly discriminatory and anti-people. Moreover, it appears that there is a bias in favour of market against the interest of common people,” Ms. Banerjee said in the letter addressed to Mr. Modi. Seeking an urgent intervention by the Central government in this regard, Ms. Banerjee said she strongly feels that “Indians should get free vaccine regardless of age, caste, creed, location at one price, irrespective of who pays — the Centre or the States”. “Why should the process be different in cases of State government? GOI gets its vaccines from the manufacturers @ Rs. 150 per dose, while you have fixed for us, the States, a price of Rs. 400 per dose! States will need to pay 167% extra over and above the rates that GOI has fixed for itself. This is anti-federal and anti-poor and anti-youth,” the Chief Minister said. She said never earlier has any State been asked to buy vaccines in any mass immunisation drive, let alone at such inflated rates. Ms. Banerjee also pointed out that fixing the rate for “private hospitals at Rs. 600 per dose is not only discriminatory but also unhealthy as it is likely to trigger unscrupulous mechanisms in the market”. “In a grave crisis situation like the one the country is facing now, there is no place for making business by vaccine manufacturers. Every effort in this situation should be directed towards the common good of people without any difference or discrimination,” she added. Earlier in the day, while addressing a public meeting, Ms. Banerjee said the crisis due to COVID-19 had been created because of faulty policies of Mr. Modi. “You have sent the vaccines out of the country,” she said, referring to the Prime Minister. The Trinamool Congress chairperson once again reiterated that her government will ensure universal free vaccination from May 5. The State BJP leadership, meanwhile, said there will be a new government in the State after May 2, when the results will be announced, and that the new government will take forward the vaccination drive in the State.

23 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Swine fever hits four Mizoram districts||Certain areas in four districts of Mizoram have been declared as epicentres of the African swine fever (ASF) that has so far killed 1,119 pigs in a month. Joint Director (livestock health) of the State’s Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department Lalhmingthanga said Lungsen village and Lunglei Electric Veng in Lunglei district, Armed Veng and Edenthar areas in Aizawl district, Keitum village in Serchhip district and Vaipi-I in Siaha district have been marked ASF epicentres. “Five of Mizoram’s 11 districts — Aizawl, Lunglei, Serchhip, Mamit and Siaha — are currently affected by ASF. Mamit has not been declared as an epicentre although some ASF-related pig deaths have been reported there,” he said. The first pig deaths were reported from Lungsen village on March 21. ASF was confirmed as the cause of death on April 16 by the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Disease laboratory. Officials have calculated the loss to pig farmers at more than Rs. 4.47 crore.

23 April 2021||New Delhi,||Second wave exposed failed Gujarat model, says Congress||The Congress on Thursday claimed that the second wave of COVID-19 has exposed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “failed” Gujarat model that was built on “publicity, good headlines and PR management”. The party also said that Congress-ruled States would make every effort to ensure free vaccines for all. All India Congress Committee in-charge for Gujarat, Rajeev Satav, State unit chief Amit Chavda and Congress Legislative Party leader Paresh Dhanani said in an online press conference that the pandemic situation in Gujarat was out of control. 2014 poll promise Recalling Mr. Modi’s promise of implementing the Gujarat model across the country ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Mr. Satav said, “Nobody understood that the Gujarat model means only publicity, good headlines and PR management. In the last six years, what the PM has done is replicate the Gujarat model in the country ... He talked a lot about the Gujarat model, but neither the health infrastructure nor other things could be improved. The Gujarat model has only been of publicity,” he added. Mr. Satav, who is a Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat, alleged that the the BJP in the past 25 years of being in power in the State had not built any new hospital but added “some MLAs poached from the Congress”. The Congress MP asked the Centre to to put on hold projects like the Central Vista, the bullet train and aircraft purchase, and instead provide free vaccines for all. Asked if Congress-ruled States would provide free vaccines for all, he said, “I am confident that Congress-ruled states will work effectively towards providing vaccines for all. They will be exploring the options.” Mr. Chavda alleged that the state of affairs in Gujarat was so bad that 14 districts still did not have CT scan machines in district hospitals and antiviral drug Remdesivir was in short supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/second-wave-exposed-failed-gujarat-model-says-congress/article34389010.ece

MHA has designated ITBP as nodal force for operating the facility. A deliberation in this regards took place at the centre this evening by ITBP officials with all stakeholders and the ITBP will try to open it as soon as possible, target less than 3 days,” an MHA spokesperson said. The 10,000-bed SPCCCH was operationalised on July 7, 2020 and it was discontinued on February 23 due to dwindling number of patients. ITBP was tasked to run the centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/itbp-covid-care-centre-to-be-reopened/article34389031.ece
23 April 2021||New Delhi,||Vaccine policy has failed youth: Sonia||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging the modified vaccine policy was not only “discriminatory but also a complete abandonment of the youth” and urged the government to re-evaluate it. Ms. Gandhi, in her letter, asked, “In these said times, how can the Government of India permit such brazen profiteering from people’s misery?” She said the aim of the government should be to vaccinate everyone above 18, regardless of their economic circumstances, but “the policy implies that the Government of India has abdicated its responsibility to provide free vaccination for citizens between the age group of 18 to 45 years”. “It is surprising that despite the harsh lessons of last year and the pain inflicted on our citizens, the Government continues to follow an arbitrary and discriminatory policy, which promises to exacerbate existing challenges,” she said. On Wednesday, the Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures Covishield, announced three rate slabs: Rs. 150 for the Central Government, Rs. 400 for State Governments and Rs. 600 for private hospitals per dose. “This means that citizens will be compelled to pay these high rates to be vaccinated. This will also bleed the finances of State Governments. This begs the question, how can the same vaccine manufactured by the same company have three different prices? There is no rationale or justification that allows for such arbitrary distinction,” Ms. Gandhi noted. “At a time when medical resources are scarce, hospital beds are unavailable, oxygen supply and availability of essential medicine is dwindling rapidly, why is your Government allowing a policy that reeks of such insensitivity,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-policy-has-failed-youth-sonia/article34389035.ece
23 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||CPWD calls bids for 3 secretariat buildings||The Centre’s project of constructing a new common Central Secretariat for its Ministries was kick-started this week with the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) on Tuesday inviting bids for the first three buildings at an estimated cost of Rs. 3,408 crore. The CPWD invited technical bids for the two-stage tender process for three buildings to be constructed on the plot that houses the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA). The IGNCA is proposed to be demolished and relocated to a new campus at Jamnagar House. The CPWD estimated the construction work to cost Rs. 3,269 crore and maintenance for five years to cost Rs. 139 crore. In the tender document, the CPWD said it did not “bind itself to accept the lowest or any other bid”. The project was estimated to take 24 months to complete. The project would include “dismantling of existing structures [without blasting],” the tender document said in reference to the IGNCA. The work could take a large number of workers in three shifts to complete, it said. As a part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, the government is planning to construct 10 new secretariat buildings on Rajpath after demolishing most of the existing buildings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpwd-calls-bids-for-3-secretariat-buildings/article34388983.ece

The ex-legislator said there were enough provisions in the law to take action against those employees found violating service rules. “There was no need to issue new orders. The latest order can serve as a tool to the government and bureaucrats to suppress their subordinates. A sword of uncertainty has been kept on the heads of employees which can also be exploited by their superiors,” he added. He said an employee was a citizen first and had all the constitutional rights. “The need of the hour is to safeguard these rights,” he saidt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpim-criticises-bid-to-monitor-jk-staff/article34388987.ece
23 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assam Cong. moves poll candidates to resort||The Assam unit of the Congress herded its Assembly election candidates to a resort in Sonapur, about 30 km east of Guwahati. The move ahead of election results on May 2 is apparently to stop the ruling alliance led by the BJP from luring its candidates away. The Congress had fielded 95 candidates in the three-phase election that ended on April 6. It left the remaining 31 seats to its coalition partners in the 10-party Mahajot , or grand alliance. The party believes that the people will reject the BJP-led alliance and that the saffron party could indulge in horse-trading if the verdict on May 2 is fractured. Congress spokesperson Bobbeeta Sharma played down the decision to keep its flock together. “The candidates want to stay together for a few days in a relaxed environment away from public contact,” she said on Thursday. ‘BJP sending feelers’ But Rupjyoti Kurmi, the party’s three-time MLA from Mariani constituency, told mediapersons that the BJP has been sending feelers to a few candidates. “Everybody knows what happened in Goa and Manipur. The BJP will try to buy some victors among us or browbeat the Opposition MLAs with threats of implicating them in some case or the other,” he said.

The top court, which said it would hear the matter on Friday, appointed senior advocate Harish Salve as an amicus curiae to assist it in the matter. To hear Vedanta plea In a related development, the Supreme Court, which termed the COVID-19 situation almost a ‘national emergency,’ agreed to hear Vedanta’s plea for opening of its Sterlite copper unit at Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu on the ground that it would produce thousand tonnes of oxygen and give it free of cost to treat patients. The plant is closed since May 2018 over pollution concerns. The Bench headed by the CJI was unimpressed with the objection of the Tamil Nadu government which initially sought hearing of Vedanta’s plea on Monday and opposed its opening on various grounds including that it had been rejected by the apex court earlier. “We understand all this.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||The One who controls||Lord Narayana’s abode, Paramapada, is a place beyond time, whereas the Earth is bound by time. And yet the Lord chose to come to this Earth on many occasions to save His devotees. He is not bound by karma, but we are, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse. When Dhritarashtra weeps for his dead sons, Lord Krishna tells him that everyone operates within the framework of time. Here what the Lord is indicating is that everyone is bound by karma. None can escape its consequences. This being so, how can any relationship be permanent? What use then all the grieving over death? Will the same persons be our relatives in subsequent births? Imagine a flooded river. A twig happens to fall into it. Does the twig have control over which direction it moves in? The flood carries it along. As this twig is being dragged by the flood, another twig falls into the water, and briefly the two twigs move close to each other. After sometime, it is possible that one twig may be washed ashore, but the other may still keep moving. This is how people come together in life, not by their will, but because of their karma. They cannot choose their parents or other relatives. They cannot determine when they should be born or when they should die. We shower affection on our dear ones, only to have them separated from us at some point. We are like the twigs being pulled together by water, and then being separated. It is Lord Narayana who directs our lives, in accordance with our karma. He gives us the results we deserve for our karma. That is why Brahma praises Vamana, who is in Aditi’s womb as the One who controls the world. The One without old age, without death, the One who need not be born, the One without karma — that Supreme One was born to Aditi as Vamana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-one-who-controls/article34389016.ece

23 April 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||‘KSRTC sackings won’t hit schedules’||The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) on Thursday told the High Court of Karnataka that it can operate 100% bus schedules even after dismissing and suspending some of the employees for resorting to strike as it was not operating a large number of air conditioned buses at present in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, while the counsel for the Karnataka State Transport Employees’ League (KSTEL), which had given a call for strike, claimed that over 10,000 employees of road transport corporations (RTCs) have been suspended, the State Advocate-General clarified to the court that only 900 employees had been suspended so far. Employees stopped It was also pointed out to the court that four recognised employees’ unions did not give call for the strike but a large number of employees, who wanted to attend to duties, were prevented by those aligned with the newly-registered KSTEL, which is not a recognised trade union by the four State transport corporations. Meanwhile, while reiterating its earlier observation about the need to resolve the issue, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj adjourned further hearing till April 26 on a batch of PIL petitions questioning the strike and seeking directions to recover loss and damages caused due to it from the organisation that had given call for strike. Legal remedy To a query of the Bench on whether the government and the RTCs were willing to keep suspension of employees in abeyance, counsel for the KSRTC said dismissed and suspended employees have a legal remedy in law to appeal against such action, and the decisions taken against the trainee/probationary employees were disciplinary actions. The KSRTC counsel also pointed out to the Bench that services of several drivers, who were sent on deputation to various other agencies of the government, were taken back to the corporations in view of the strike. Earlier, the counsel for KSTEL said the strike was against the inhuman treatment of employees as four recognised trade unions had sided with the managements. Though the employees reported to duty showing deferences to the court’s earlier observations, the Bench said it would keep the petitions pending to ensure that the employees do not resort to strike again in the current scenario and to explore possibility to resolve the issue without coming in the way of prosecution of those resorted to violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ksrtc-sackings-wont-hit-schedules/article34389039.ece
23 April 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||‘COVID vaccine wastage reduced to 5%’||The COVID vaccine wastage across Tamil Nadu has been reduced to 5% between April 1 and 20 and steps were on to further reduce it to 3%, the Tamil Nadu government said on Thursday. In a statement after meetings with senior officials and District Collectors, Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan said with the Centre allowing vaccination for those above 18 years of age fro May 1, the vaccine wastage would be completely avoided. Explaining the scenario behind the vaccine wastage in the State, he said 20 persons would be administered vaccine from one vial of Covaxin, while it was 10 persons in case of one vial of Covishield. "In the beginning, when the general mood was to avoid vaccines and when five to six persons showed up in the centres for vaccines in the evenings just before the drive was to end for the day, vaccine shots were administered with the high objective not to disappoint those who came for vaccines," the statement said. Due to this situation, vaccine shots that would have been given to four to five persons had to go waste. Moreover, a vial had to be used up completely within four hours for its effectiveness. The national vaccination programme allows wastage up to 10%. "Due to above reasons, the vaccine wastage was reported between January 16 and March 31," it said. A senior official told  The Hindu  : "During the meetings, the government instructed officials to focus on contact tracing, intensify vaccination in hotspot districts and closely monitor health infrastructure including O2 beds to ramp up according to the need." As for charges that RT-PCR test kits were being imported at higher rates from Brazil, the State government refuted the charge and maintained the kit was being imported "at the lowest cost in the country" from South Korea and the US. Presently, of the 54,417 beds in COVID hospitals, 32,942 are with oxygen supply. Steps were on to increase the number of ventilators and high-flow nasal cannulas. As for oxygen, the storage in the State was increased from 395 MT last year to 888 MT this year. "A total of 1,167 MT oxygen storage is in government and private hospitals. The Tamil Nadu government has set up a control room anticipating need in addition to the daily need of 240 MT across Tamil Nadu presently." Medicines such as Tocilizumab inj - 400 mg, Remdesivir inj - 100 mg and Enoxaparain inj - 40 mg were being supplied to all Taluk hospitals across the State, he said and maintained: "Tamil Nadu is the only State where Remdesivir is available in all government hospitals in all districts." Stocks required for 20 days were in reserve and orders have been made to procure 2 lakh vials. "Based on need, this [Remdesivir] is being given to private hospitals too." As a first phase, funds to the tune of Rs. 61 crore have been sanctioned for setting up COVID Care Centres in all districts. A total of 5,43,518 violations of the Public Health Act, 1939 were reported and a total fine to the tune of Rs. 11.50 crore was imposed. Advisor to the State government and former Chief Secretary K.

23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ensure people wear masks, maintain social distance: HC||The Madras High Court on Thursday impressed upon the need for the State government and municipal corporations to strictly enforce the rule of wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in public places to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The court said the government and the civic bodies should also ensure that people do not congregate in large numbers in any place since the rate of infection was much more now than what it was previously. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observations during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed in November last year. Passing interim orders in the case, the judges said the fear expressed by the litigant last year had come true now with the State experiencing the second wave of COVID-19. New regulations In reply, State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan told the court that the government had come up with new regulations now by which the number of participants even in marriage ceremonies and funerals had been restricted. Advocate Karthika Ashok, representing the Greater Chennai Corporation, said that officials had begun to crack the whip on those who did not wear masks and failed to follow physical distancing norms in the city. However, petitioner’s counsel told the court that all rules and regulations of the government were only on paper and not put to practice. Referring to the recent death of film actor Vivekh, he said thousands of fans paid respects to the actor but most of them were found to be not wearing masks. He said physical distancing too went for a toss during the congregation and no action was taken by officials. Concurring with him, the Chief Justice said he too had watched such scenes on television as well as in newspapers. Lamenting that nobody bothered to enforce the COVID-19 protocol, he asked the SGP and counsel for Chennai Corporation to ensure that such incidents do not recur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ensure-people-wear-masks-maintain-social-distance-says-high-court/article34389192.ece
23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Vaccine wastage reduced’||COVID-19 vaccine wastage across Tamil Nadu had been reduced to 5% between April 1 and 20 and steps were on to further reduce it to 3%, the Tamil Nadu government said on Thursday. In a statement after meetings with senior officials and Collectors, Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan said with the Centre allowing vaccination for those above 18 years of age from May 1, vaccine wastage would be completely avoided. Explaining the scenario behind the vaccine wastage, he said 20 persons would be administered vaccine from one vial of Covaxin, while it was 10 persons in case of Covishield. “In the beginning, when the general mood was to avoid vaccines and when five to six persons showed up at centres for vaccines in the evenings just before the drive was to end for the day, vaccine shots were administered with the high objective not to disappoint them,” the statement said. Due to this situation, vaccine shots that would have been given to four to five persons had to go waste as a vial had to be used completely within four hours. The national vaccination programme allows wastage up to 10%, it said. A senior official told The Hindu : “During the meetings, the government instructed officials to focus on contact tracing, intensify vaccination in hotspot districts and closely monitor health infrastructure, including O2 beds, to ramp up according to the need.” The government refuted the charge that RT-PCR test kits were being imported at higher rates from Brazil, and maintained that the kit was being imported “at the lowest cost in the country” from South Korea and the US. Presently, of the 54,417 beds in COVID hospitals, 32,942 were with oxygen supply. Steps were on to increase the number of ventilators and high-flow nasal cannulas. Oxygen storage in the State was increased from 395 MT last year to 888 MT this year. “A total of 1,167 MT oxygen storage is in government and private hospitals. The government has set up a control room anticipating need in addition to the present daily need of 240 MT.” Medicines such as Tocilizumab inj - 400 mg, Remdesivir inj - 100 mg and Enoxaparain inj - 40 mg were being supplied to all taluk hospitals, he said and maintained: “Tamil Nadu is the only State where Remdesivir is available in all government hospitals.” Stocks required for 20 days were in reserve and orders had been made to procure 2 lakh vials. “Based on need, this [Remdesivir] is being given to private hospitals too,” he said. As a first phase, funds to the tune of Rs. 61 crore had been sanctioned for setting up COVID Care Centres in all districts. Advisor to the State government and former Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam, Director-General of Police J.K.

23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Truck turns turtle at Maduravoyal||Traffic flow on the ramp leading to the Chennai bypass at Maduravoyal remained disrupted for over an hour on Thursday evening after a trailer truck carrying a container turned turtle. Sources in the Maduravoyal police said the incident happened around 6.30 p.m. when the vehicle, proceeding from the Ambattur side, climbed onto the elevated bypass. Nobody was hurt in the incident. On way to the port Engineers of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said the movement of vehicles on the bypass was not affected due to the accident. The container was apparently carrying plastic goods and was proceeding to the Chennai port. When the driver was questioned, it was said the link between the pulling vehicle and the trailer was not fastened properly. Incidents of container-carrying trailer trucks turning turtle are common on both the Chennai bypass and the four roads that form the Ennore-Manali Road Improvement Project in north Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/truck-turns-turtle-at-maduravoyal/article34389577.ece
23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Modi has abdicated his responsibility, says Alagiri||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has abdicated his responsibility to the States after failing to control the spread of the coronavirus, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said. “If something goes right, Mr. Modi takes all the credit but when anything goes wrong, he places the burden on others. Does Mr. Modi think that this is cooperative federalism?” he asked. Slams PM, Amit Shah Slamming the Prime Minister for announcing a ‘Vaccination Festival’ and then going on an ‘election campaign festival’ in West Bengal, he accused Mr. Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah of conducting large rallies and spreading COVID-19 there and not worrying about the tragedy unfolding across the country. He also criticised Mr. Modi for announcing that States would have to purchase vaccines at Rs. 400 and private hospitals for Rs. 600 when the Centre procured the vaccines at Rs. 150 each. “Mr. Modi wants everything to be ‘one nation one tax, one nation one entrance exam, one nation one election’ but is now asking everyone to procure vaccines at different rates. Nowhere in the world has any government allowed this sort of pricing to be fixed by a corporate during this pandemic when the focus is on saving lives,” he said. He asked who had increased the price cap on the vaccines instead of ramping up the production. “The Modi government is hand in glove with vaccine manufacturers and the black market for vaccines. There can be no other bigger anti-people measure than this at the moment. Many countries, including the U.S., are vaccinating all citizens for free,” Mr. Alagiri pointed out.

23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||As cases go up, should Tamil Nadu be testing more?||The number of people tested every day for COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu has stayed around the 1.1 lakh mark in the last week, even as cases and the State’s test positivity rate (TPR) continue to rise steadily. The daily TPR crossed 10% on Tuesday and touched 11.18% on Thursday. The last time it was above 10% was during the last week of July, when an average of 60,000 tests were being done and 6,500 cases reported daily. The State had 120 labs then. Now, it has more than doubled the figure to 263, with a capacity to perform RT-PCR and other types of tests for COVID-19. This raises questions about whether Tamil Nadu can and should increase testing. Chennai, in particular, has a daily TPR of over 20% now. Last July, when the city was reporting a high number of cases, it was testing around 11,000-12,000 people a day, while its TPR was at 10%. While the cases reported daily have more than doubled now, tests increased to an average 17,000 last week — only a 50% increase from last July. A comparison of Tamil Nadu with other States also highlighted the possible need for increased testing. For instance, among the 15 States that have over 50,000 active cases, Tamil Nadu stands ninth in terms of tests per million population performed every day. Officials in Tamil Nadu have often highlighted the State’s complete reliance on RT-PCR tests, calling it the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, unlike other States that have widely used rapid antigen detection tests too. Delhi and Karnataka, among the few States to provide a break-up on the number of RT-PCR and other tests performed on a daily basis, however, indicate the possibility of better utilisation of lab capacities. Delhi, with 81 RT-PCR testing labs, performed 60,022 tests on average every day. Karnataka, with 153 labs, performed 1.25 lakh tests. In comparison, Tamil Nadu, with 189 RT-PCR labs, performed just 1.05 lakh tests. Prabhdeep Kaur, Deputy Director, National Institute of Epidemiology-ICMR, stressed the need for increasing testing based on a focused and data-driven approach. She said that while Chennai had been doing it to a considerable extent, mainly through its fever camps, a similar approach could be followed across the State. K. Kolandaisamy, former Director of Public Health, Tamil Nadu, stressed the need for an increase in focused and proactive testing in containment zones, testing of antenatal mothers and others visiting hospitals. J. Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, said the government was following a principle of testing at least 10 persons for every person testing positive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/as-cases-go-up-should-tamil-nadu-be-testing-more/article34389174.ece
23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Resolve differences, Madras High Court tells Lyca Productions, director Shankar||The Madras High Court on Thursday suggested that Lyca Productions and film director Shankar sit across the table and resolve their differences in completing the Kamal Hassan starrerIndian 2rather than fight a legal battle. The court granted a week’s time for the production firm, which claimed to be losing crores of rupees due to the stalled project, and the film director, who had decided to take up other projects, to resolve their differences. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the suggestion when an appeal preferred by Lyca Productions was listed for hearing. The appeal had been preferred against Justice P.T. Asha’s refusal to pass an ex-parte interim order restraining the director from directing any other movie without completingIndian 2. The legal proceedings were initiated after Mr. Shankar decided to make a movie with Telugu actor Ram Charan. The Bench, led by the Chief Justice, requested senior counsel P.S. Raman, representing the film director, to initiate the talks and asked advocate R. Prabhakaran, appearing on behalf of the production house, to ensure that its managing director based in London participates in the meeting, either in person or through video call. The outcome of the talks should be informed to the court by April 28, the Bench ordered. Rs. 236 crore budget According to Mr. Prabhakaran,Indian 2was being made at a whopping budget of Rs. 236 crore. The remuneration of the director itself had been fixed at Rs. 36 crore, apart from a share in the net profits. Stating that the production house had already paid an advance remuneration of Rs. 14.4 crore to the director, counsel claimed that the company was continuing to pay Rs. 1 crore to him every month though it was incurring huge loss due to the delay in making the movie. Shankar ready On the other hand, Mr. Raman brought it to the notice of the court that Mr. Shankar was ready to shoot the movie from June to October despite having scheduled his daughter’s marriage during the same time. However, the production company was yet to pay money to the art director so that the sets could be made ready. He said the director had sent a mail in this regard to the production house but it had not replied. The court was also told that actor Vivekh was playing a crucial role in the movie but he died recently due to cardiac arrest.

23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Higher turnout and victory margin not connected||Contrary to the perception among sections of politicians and experts, there is no co-relation between a higher voter turnout and the margin of victory for the winner, going by the 2016 Assembly election results. At Palacode in Dharmapuri district, where Tamil Nadu’s highest turnout of 88.57% was registered, Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan won by 5,983 votes over his nearest DMK rival. The margin was around 3.2%. This time too, the constituency recorded the highest polling of 87.37%. Mr. Anbalagan is in the fray again. Karur, another high-profile constituency from where Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar was elected five years ago, registered a turnout of 80.5%. But he won by only 441 votes. This time, the constituency reported a turnout of 83.57%. Mr. Vijayabhaskar is pitted against another prominent candidate V. Senthil Balaji of the DMK. At the same time, there are instances of high-turnout constituencies coming out with huge margins. In Oddanchatram, where turnout over and above 80% is the norm since 2011, the winner, R. Sakkarapani of the DMK, secured a margin of 65,727 votes five years ago. Tamil Culture-Language Minister K. Pandiarajan, who was elected from Avadi, an urban constituency, with a difference of 1,395 votes in 2016, however, feels the margin of victory is linked to the turnout. “I could sense it with my experience of having contested in four elections,” he says. Former School Education Minister and DMK nominee in Tiruchuli Thangam Thennarasu concurs with him. Mr. Thennarasu, who first entered the Assembly in 1998, points out that there is a possibility of the victory margin being very high in high-turnout constituencies. However, the situation could change, depending upon the ability of a third contestant or party in affecting the fortunes of the first two candidates. Academic G. Palanithurai says that the difference is bound to be high when one candidate scores over the others in mobilising the electors. There is a discordant view even among political leaders. A senior functionary of the AIADMK says there have been instances of candidates scoring huge margins in constituencies where the turnout was lower than the State average. The candidates’ base in their constituencies is a crucial factor in shaping the margins regardless of the turnout, he says.  The margin of victory is linked to the turnout.

23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Free vaccination camps from May 1||The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday announced that it would organise free vaccination camps across the State from May 1 for target groups among those aged 18-45 to combat the spread of COVID-19. The State government would continue to bear the costs of such camps and most affected districts would be given priority, it said. Construction workers, migrant labourers, those working in markets, retailers, workers of State Transport Corporations, government employees, school and college teachers and autorickshaw and taxi drivers would be given priority in the camps. An official release said the State government would encourage major factories and companies, private organisations and hotels and restaurants to coordinate with private hospitals to administer vaccines to their employees. The State government would also organise special camps to “boost herd immunity” among the general population as it aims to achieve immunity at least among 60% of its residents. “If this level is achieved, the spread will be contained naturally,” the release said. The State government has also instructed district administrations to ensure the availability of medical infrastructure, including beds with oxygen supply, and required medicines. “The spread of the infection can only be contained if contact tracing is effective. These efforts will be intensified,” the press release stated. The number of RT-PCR tests will be increased based on the need, and the aim is to keep the spread in all districts under 10%, it said. CM’s announcement Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had last year announced that vaccines would be administered to people for free, and on January 16, the government launched its inoculation drive. The State has been administering both Covishield and Covaxin, as per the choice of the people, for free at its medical facilities. While the State has adequate oxygen, “to encourage the production of oxygen additionally, steps are being taken to grant temporary licences to willing factories,” the release added.  The State will also organise special camps to boost herd immunity among the general population||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/free-vaccination-camps-from-may-1/article34389177.ece

Another 196 cases were booked separately against those who failed to maintain physical distance in public places or follow other COVID-19 protocols. City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal has appealed to the public to follow all COVID-19 guidelines to contain the spread of the infection. Awareness campaign Inaugurating an awareness campaign by the Traffic Police, Mr. Aggarwal said: “We are conducting awareness campaigns at 200 places. We insist on these simple rules to prevent the infection — the public should wear face masks, maintain physical distance and follow hygienic practices. They should make it a habit.”  “People should wear face masks when they step out from their homes and maintain physical distance in public places. They should avoid crowds and avoid going out if there is no reason. If we follow all the guidelines, we can control the pandemic. The city can emerge out of it soon,” Mr. Aggarwal said. “People should not avoid testing for the virus if they develop any symptoms. Also, getting vaccinated is a social responsibility,” the City Police Commissioner added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/15846-cases-filed-against-those-not-wearing-masks/article34389581.ece
23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||India’s leather exports decline 28.3% to $3.3 billion in 2020-21||India’s export of leather and leather products declined about 28.3% to $3.3 billion in 2020-21 from $4.6 billion in 2019-2020 owing to COVID-19 impact on key markets of the European Union, the U.K. and the U.S., according to Council for Leather Exports. E-commerce mode “Most of the sales in the overseas markets are happening through e-commerce mode and hence there is a vast change in the customer requirements as malls and shops are closed in our overseas markets and hence customers do not want to pile up inventories,” Shai Aqeel Ahmed Panaruna, chairman, Council for Leather Exports said. Changing scenario On account of the changed market scenario, customers were now demanding quicker delivery of products as well, he said. Container shortage However, there was a shortage of containers which was affecting our shipments, he pointed out. Mr. Panaruna said major markets were opening up, but the industry was concerned about the impact of surging COVID-19 cases in India on exports. The government had announced submission of application for incentives under the Merchandise Exports for India Scheme (MEIS) for 2019-2020 till September 30, 2021, as the industry was facing working capital problems, he said. The Council for Leather Exports had sought a facility for online applications under MEIS for the period April-December 2020, he added. It had asked for early notification of rates under the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RODTEP) which came into effect from January 1, replacing the MEIS and also extension of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS 2.0) to the leather and leather products industry. “These two support measures are crucial for our export revival and for the sustainability of our exports. We are also expecting a favourable Foreign Trade Policy for complete revival of exports, as the existing policy has been extended further till September 2021,” Mr. Panaruna said. India second largest producer of footwear He said India was the world’s second largest producer of footwear (both leather and non-leather). There was a positive demand for local supplies and hence more and more brands were now looking to manufacture in India for the domestic sales, instead of importing footwear from other countries, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/leather-exports-decline-283-in-2020-21/article34389195.ece
23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccine wastage across Tamil Nadu brought down to 5%||COVID-19 vaccine wastage across Tamil Nadu was reduced to 5% between April 1 and April 20, and steps are being taken to cut it further to 3%, the State government said on Thursday. In a statement after meetings with senior officials and Collectors, Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan said that with the Centre allowing vaccination of those aged above 18 from May 1, wastage would be avoided totally. Reasons cited As for the reasons for the wastage, he said 20 persons would be administered vaccine from one vial of Covaxin and 10 persons from one vial of Covishield. “In the beginning, when the general mood was to avoid vaccines and five to six persons showed up at vaccination centres in the evenings just before the drive was to end for the day, shots were administered with the high objective not to disappoint those who came for vaccination,” he said. Hence, doses that would have been given to four or five persons went waste. Moreover, a vial had to be used up within four hours. The national vaccination programme allows wastage of up to 10%. “Due to the above reasons, wastage was reported between January 16 and March 31,” the statement said. A senior official told The Hindu : “During the meetings, the government instructed officials to focus on contact-tracing, intensify vaccination in hotspot districts and monitor health infrastructure...” As for the allegation that the RT-PCR test kits were being imported at higher rates from Brazil, the government said they were being imported “at the lowest cost in the country” from South Korea and the United States. At present, of the 54,417 beds available at COVID-19 hospitals, 32,942 are fitted with oxygen supply. Steps are being taken to increase the number of ventilators and high-flow nasal cannulas. Oxygen storage has been increased from 395 metric tonnes last year to 888 metrics tonnes this year. “A total of 1,167 metric tonnes of oxygen storage is at government and private hospitals,” the statement said. Stocks in reserve Medicines such as Tocilizumab inj 400 mg, Remdesivir inj 100 mg and Enoxaparin inj 40 mg were being supplied to all taluk hospitals across the State, Mr. Ranjan said. “Tamil Nadu is the only State where Remdesivir is available at all government hospitals in all districts,” he said. Stocks required for 20 days are in reserve and orders have been placed for 2 lakh vials. “Based on need, this [Remdesivir] is being given to private hospitals too.” In the first phase, Rs. 61 crore was sanctioned for opening COVID-19 Care Centres in all districts. A total of 5,43,518 violations of the Public Health Act, 1939, were reported and fine of Rs. 11.5 crore was imposed. Adviser to the government and former Chief Secretary K.

23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fishermen protest against hatcheries being too close to high tide line||Fishermen organisations on Wednesday urged the government not to permit shrimp hatcheries to set up structures too close to the shore. Staging a protest at the office of the Fisheries Department at Nandanam, where the Coastal Aquaculture Authority (CAA) is also located, representatives of the Tamil Nadu Meenavar Iyakkangalin Orunginaippu Kuzhu alleged that the hatcheries that grew shrimp seeds meant for farms were setting up structures too close to the high tide line. “These units have approvals only from the CAA and have no other regulating authority. They let out effluents,” they alleged. They said vast tracts of common lands meant for use by fishing villages were being usurped by these industries.   D. Ramraj, president, All India Shrimp Hatcheries Association, said the shrimp larvae were mostly fed algae and compound feed and not any chemicals. “They are very sensitive live organisms and cannot be given any chemicals. The discharge from the hatcheries are monitored and are well within limits. Breeding fish, shrimp or any marine species requires sea water and sea front access and therefore a hatchery has been notified as a permitted activity under the CRZ regulations right from 1991 onwards,” he said. Sources in the CAA said most shrimp hatcheries were located within 2 km of high tide line. All these hatcheries fell under its jurisdiction and it regulated all their activities, starting from construction to monitoring their operations. Over 10 hatcheries that violated the provisions of the CAA Act, 2005, and its rules and regulations had been deregistered and closed by the CAA.  Most shrimp hatcheries are located within 2 km of high tide line and their activities are being regulated, says Coastal Authority source||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-protest-against-hatcheries-being-too-close-to-high-tide-line/article34389792.ece

The decision would help in ramping up the production quickly, he added. In a statement, he asked why the Centre had only allowed two private firms to develop the vaccines. If the public sector undertakings were involved, vaccine shortage would not have existed. The need to procure them at a higher price also would not have arisen, Mr. Balakrishnan said. He urged the Centre to drop its plan to allow the sale of vaccine in the open market, alleging that it would result in profiteering. By allowing such sales, the Centre was escaping from its responsibility of providing vaccines free of cost, Mr. Balakrishnan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/involve-psus-in-vaccine-production-cpim/article34389193.ece
23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Youth held for robbing jewellery||The Thiruvottiyur police arrested a 19-year-old youth and his friends for allegedly robbing a gold chain from his aunt to go on a trip to Goa.

23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Vacant plot along Thazhambur lake a dumping ground’||A vacant plot along the recently rejuvenated Thazhambur lake, off Rajiv Gandhi Salai, is being used as a dumping ground, residents of the area said. The waterbody can now store up to 22 million cubic feet of water after the restoration efforts of Care Earth Trust, a city-based biodiversity research organisation, with funding from Hinduja Leyland Finance. Kannan Sethuraman, a resident of Thazhambur, noted that the size of the garbage dump had been increasing for the past four years and hospital waste, too, was often dumped there. Anbu Vahini, a resident, said the lake was also now home to several species of birds. She recalled that the local body had promised to take up scientific disposal of waste through composting during the hearing of a case filed by Madipakkam residents at the National Green Tribunal, Southern Zone, in 2017. However, the panchayat was yet to adopt a solid waste management policy. Residents demanded that the local body shift the dumping yard to an alternate site. Sources in the Thazhambur village panchayat said the vacant plot was being used after approval.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vacant-plot-along-thazhambur-lake-a-dumping-ground/article34389583.ece

23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘We’ve surplus oxygen and enough ventilators’||The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday asserted before the Madras High Court that it had sufficient hospital beds and vaccines to deal with COVID-19. It also claimed to be producing a surplus amount of oxygen and in possession of adequate ventilators and Remdesivir to meet any exigency, including a sudden spurt in cases. The submission was made before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, who made a fervent appeal to the Centre to take into account that a large population of the country might not be able to afford the vaccines if they were sold by private companies for Rs. 400 a dose to the State governments and Rs. 600 to private hospitals. Since the Centre had decided to permit inoculation of all citizens aged over 18 from May 1, the plight of the poor and the middle class, who are already in economic distress owing to the raging second wave of COVID-19, should be considered while the vaccine prices are fixed, the judges said. Additional Solicitor-General R. Sankaranarayanan agreed to convey the court’s concern to the Centre. The observations were made at the hearing of an urgent suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up by the court on the basis of news reports that Remdesivir was being diverted from government hospitals to private ones and oxygen cylinders were being diverted from the State to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana without the government’s consent. Making his submissions in response to the case, Advocate-General Vijay Narayan said the State had 31,000 vials of Remdesivir, and there was no shortage at all. He said the government was providing the drug to private hospitals, which did not have enough stock, at Rs. 783 per vial, though the maximum retail price of each vial was Rs. 4,800. Mr. Narayan said the State had a capacity to store 1,167 tonnes of oxygen and manufacture 400 tonnes a day. Additionally, 150 tonnes a day could be produced in Puducherry. However, the current usage in Tamil Nadu was only 250 tonnes a day; therefore, 65 tonnes of surplus oxygen was recently diverted to the neighbouring States, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/weve-surplus-oxygen-and-enough-ventilators/article34389167.ece

In a petition to the poll authorities including Chief Election Commissioner, the AIADMK contended that it had been receiving information that officials in some districts had suggested to candidates that the boxes be opened even on May 1 if there was a consensus among the contestants. The premature opening of the boxes was bound to attract “multiple challenges” in the form of litigation after the declaration of results. Any deviation from established procedure was “liable to cause chaos,” the party stated. A delegation of the party functionaries including Minister D. Jayakumar, N. Balaganga and R M Babu Murugavel met Mr Sahoo. Panneerselvam meets CM Deputy Chief Minister O.

23 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||After delay, work to widen ECR to begin soon||After several years of delay, work to widen the 10.5 km urban stretch of the East Coast Road (ECR) from Thiruvanmiyur to Akkarai is likely to commence within this financial year. “Wherever we could, we have widened the road into six lanes. Now, with the land acquisition process nearing completion and the payments being made to property owners, we hope to complete around 80% of the widening by the end of the current financial year,” said a source in the Highways Department. The project was initially announced in 2005 and a token amount of Rs. 10 crore was sanctioned by the government. Continuous delays in land acquisition and court cases ensured that the four-lane road remained at that width on most stretches. It will cost under Rs. 10 crore to widen and construct storm water drains and footpaths on both sides. K. Suseela, a resident of Neelankarai, said the road had not been widened for a long time. This had caused traffic movement to slow down considerably in these areas. “One cannot go beyond 40 km/hr at any point of time since there are pedestrians and local traffic. We were expecting the elevated road from Thiruvanmiyur to the RTO office to be extended till Akkarai,” she said. Prevent flooding Meanwhile, the Department is presently constructing storm water drains in Palavakkam for a length of 1.5 km to prevent flooding. “Many drains leading from the western side of the ECR empty themselves onto the road, leading to flooding on the stretch. We deploy motors to pump out the water since it disturbs the traffic flow,” said an engineer associated with the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-delay-ecr-widening-soon/article34389579.ece

23 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Covid spread takes a toll on vegetable trade||The spread of COVID-19 in the last one year has taken a toll on wholesale vegetable trade here. “We are procuring just 50 % of what the quantity of vegetables that used to come to Coimbatore every day,” says M. Rajendran, president of TK Market wholesale vegetable traders Association. The wholesale prices of vegetables have fallen and some farmers and traders are unable to realise even the transport cost. For instance, the price of drumstick used to be Rs. 140 a kg. It is Rs. 8 to Rs. 10 a kg now, he says. The farmer should be get at least Rs. 12 a kg. Vegetable markets here get supplies from Karnataka and different parts of Tamil Nadu. The wholesale price of big onion on Thursday ranged between Rs. 10 and Rs. 15 a kg, that of small onion was Rs. 15 to Rs. 30 a kg, tomato Rs. 6 to Rs. 9 a kg, potato Rs. 16 a kg and cabbage Rs. 6 a kg. Except carrot, beans and cauliflower the other vegetables were selling at less than Rs. 20 a kg in the wholesale market. With high number of cases in Kerala, the wholesale traders here are unable to supply the usual volume to the neighbouring State. Most of the traders do not take delivery of the pre-Covid quantity. With the second wave of the pandemic in Coimbatore now, if the vegetable markets are shifted, the traders will be hit further, he says. Amirtharaj, a tomato farmer at Kinathukadavu, says that farmers spend Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1 lakh on an acre to harvest tomatoes. This year, the rain was good, there was no problem of pest attack and the harvest was also good. When the farmers take the produce to the markets, the traders lift the vegetables. “But, we do not get the prices. Almost throughout the last one year, we got just Rs. 100 to Rs. 300 for a box of 12 to 15 kg. Farmers are unable to meet the expenses with these prices,” he says. Suresh, secretary of Anna market vegetable traders’ association, says that retail business has taken a hit at the market because of the pandemic, though vegetable prices are low. “We will go back to operating just 50 % of the outlets on a rotation basis from Friday. Many people have taken to selling vegetables across the district and hence, sales at the market has dropped. Retail customers are also scared of visiting the market because of the pandemic,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-spread-takes-a-toll-on-vegetable-trade/article34389606.ece

IOCL sources said on Thursday that the two retail outlets were opened at Gandhi Managar and Sulur on April 19 to supply CNG for automobiles. Being a greener and more efficient alternative to existing vehicle fuels, the public will now have an option of using CNG for their vehicles as it costs around Rs. 70 per kg, for which it gives a mileage of around 25 km. These CNG retail outlets will refill fuel for those vehicles powered by CNG as well as the vehicles that run on petrol which are retrofitted with a CNG kit, the sources said. At present, the CNG supply for the two retail outlets are being carried out using cascades (gas cylinders), which are mounted on light commercial vehicles and are transported by road. This is an interim measure as IOCL is currently constructing a steel pipeline network is being developed in various parts of the district to bring piped gas connectivity to industries, commercial and domestic customers, which is expected to be completed by June. Construction works for a City Gate Station to supply CNG and Piped Natural Gas (PNG) is under way at Pichanur near Madukkarai. Through this City Gas Distribution (CGD) project, about 9.1 lakh households would receive domestic PNG connections in a span of eight years, the IOCL sources noted. According to a press release, the IOCL is developing CGD networks in Coimbatore and Salem districts and will be providing over 12 lakh PNG connections to domestic households and 431 CNG stations for vehicle refilling in the two districts over a period of eight years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iocl-to-open-15-cng-retail-outlets-in-coimbatore-district/article34389208.ece

23 April 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Action sought against CETP discharging effluents in Perundurai||The District Environmental Engineer, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), Perundurai, has recommended action against the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), that is run by tannery units functioning at the SIPCOT Industrial Growth Centre, Perundurai, for discharging effluent from its tank into the defunct oxidation pond here. The action comes after the Perundurai SIPCOT Affected People Welfare Association took up the issue with the TNPCB officials after which an inspection was carried out on April 18. During the inspection, it was found that the CETP of tanners, run under Perundurai Leather Industries Eco-Security Private Limited,  has not been functioning since March 2020, as maintenance and upgradation work need to be carried out. It was found that the tannery CETP discharged effluents from its tank into the adjacent defunct oxidation pond meant for the disposal of sewage generated from SIPCOT industries. Hence, a show-cause notice was issued to the tannery CETP. Based on the inspection, a report was submitted to the TNPCB headquarters in Chennai for further action. S. Chinnasamy, coordinator, Sipcot Affected People Welfare Association, said that many lakh litres of effluents were stored in collection, equalisation and aeration tanks and reverse osmosis plants, evaporation tanks and sludge drying beds without processing. Leakages from these tanks led to effluents entering the ground causing pollution, he said. He said the act of the leather industry was against the welfare of people and against all laws. “Tannery units violating norms should be closed permanently and criminal action should be taken against their owners,” he demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/action-sought-against-cetp-discharging-effluents-in-perundurai/article34389207.ece

Kandavel, coordinator, Tamil Nadu Federation of Power Loom Association. Also, due to elections in West Bengal, fabrics were not sent to the State for the past one month. He said that fabrics worth over Rs. 100 crore were stocked, forcing many power loom owners to halt production. “Due to night curfew, most of the power looms function only during daytime affecting production of 12 lakh metre rayon fabrics every day,” he added. L.P. Balasubramanian, secretary, Lakkapuram Power Loom Owners Association said that about 3,500 power looms function at Lakkapuram village and due to the night curfew and total lockdown on Sundays, workers were allowed to work only for three shifts a week. “Now, power looms function only from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day”, he said and added that workers will receive only half of their weekly wages. Many unit owners said that they are yet to recover from the first wave and they fear that the second wave, if it continues for over a month, would halt production completely.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rise-in-cases-night-curfew-hit-power-loom-sector/article34389202.ece

23 April 2021||Kochi,TAMIL NADU||5 held, fake notes seized in Kochi||In a joint operation straddling Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the Kochi City police and the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) arrested five persons and seized fake notes of the value of Rs. 1.80 crore. The operation lasted through the late-night hours of Wednesday into the early hours of Thursday. It was connected to a case registered by the Udayamperoor police following the seizure of Rs. 1.74 lakh on March 27. Immediately thereafter, the police had made four arrests, thus taking the total number of people arrested in the case to nine. Among the arrested were Ashraf Ali aka Settu, 29, Mohammed Rishad, 30, Syed Sultan, 32, and Azharuddeen aka Ashique, 28, all from Coimbatore.  Follow-up probe “We have been conducting a follow-up probe in the case to find out the source and suppliers. Of the five persons arrested, one was nabbed from Thrissur, which in turn led us to the other four in Coimbatore,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). The fake currencies in the denomination of Rs. 2,000 were found in 90 bundles of 100 notes each. Printer, scanner, and other equipment allegedly used in the production of fake currencies were also seized from their den in Coimbatore. The participation of ATS in the operation is considered instructive of the potential national security angle attached to the case. ATS sources, however, said prima facie the case did not seem to have any terrorism linkage as yet but seems to be purely driven by economic interests. Other ramifications, if any, will have to be unearthed during the probe, they added. The Udayamperoor police had earlier arrested Priyankumar K.K., 36, of Irumbanam and Dhanya, 38, of Karunagappally. They had confessed to having received the fake currencies from Coimbatore. The accused were found to have circulated around 90 currencies of Rs. 2,000 denomination at various places. “We had tracked and seized each one of those bills. The arrangement between wholesalers and retailers was that one original Rs. 2,000 bill will fetch the latter two fake bills of the same denomination,” said Mr. Nagaraju.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/5-held-fake-notes-seized-in-kochi/article34389542.ece

23 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Price of banana leaves crashes due to low demand||For banana farmers of Madurai district, the surge in COVID-19 positive cases could not have come at a worse time. Following the imposition of restrictions regarding festivals and weddings on a grand scale, there has been a significant fall in price of banana leaves, causing severe distress to farmers and traders. S. Vairamani, a trader at Mattuthavani vegetable market, said that while a bundle of 500 banana leaves was sold at around Rs. 1,000 a month back, the price has come down to around Rs. 300. The fall in price is attributed to higher supply but lower demand for the leaves. K. Pandiaraja, a farmer from Melavalavu village of Melur block, said the restrictions imposed for public gathering during Tamil month Chithirai has resulted in fall in sales of banana leaves. “The restriction to permit only 100 participants in weddings is another major reason for the fall in demand for banana leaves,” he said. In addition, the demand for banana leaves from hotels has also come down, he added. In addition, the cutting cost and transportation cost for taking banana leaves to the market makes it financially unviable for farmers to sell the leaves, said P. Gnanasekaran, a farmer from Mullipallam in Sholavandan. “The farmers are unable to earn any profits after paying for the transportation and cutting costs. Hence, many farmers are refraining from cutting the banana leaves from their fields," he added. Last year too Last year too the farmers faced severe financial constraints due to COVID-19 lockdown. “As a result, many farmers stopped raising banana crop,” said Mr. Gnanasekaran. The government can increase the number of participants in weddings, which will in return increase the demand for banana leaves, he suggested.

23 April 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Plea for CB-CID probe into man’s death in brick kiln||The CB-CID police must thoroughly probe the suspicious death of one Srinivasan, 45, of Nimmeli near Sirkazhi in Mayiladuthurai district as the suspects were influential and may give a twist to the case, said A. Kathir, director of Evidence, a Madurai-based non-governmental organisation. Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, he said that Srinivasan, a Dalit, who had been working in a brick kiln owned by Suresh Choudry, was found hanging at around 4 a.m. on April 17. The family members and relatives of Srinivasan told a fact-finding team from the Evidence that he had an issue with his employer over PF settlement of Rs. 4 lakh. Srinivasan’s wife Manonmani, 39, said supervisor Mohan had asked him to come to the kiln for resolving the PF issue. She received a call early in the morning that Srinivasan was found hanging. Alleging that the owner of the kiln and his men had beaten Srinivasan to death, Manonmani demanded that a murder case be registered against them. In a separate petition submitted to Collector Lalitha, Manonmani sought videographing of the postmortem. She said four other workers also died under mysterious circumstances over wage issues in the past. The Collector had ordered a probe by revenue officials. Mr. Kathir said that the police have registered cases under 174 (3) Cr PC, 306, 352 of IPC, 3 (1) (r), 3 (1) (s), 3 (2) (v) of SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act - Amendment in 2015. He said the State government must slap a fine of Rs. 25 lakh against the brick kiln owner and hand over the money to the family members of Srinivasan. Though the district administration had given Rs. 8.45 lakh to the legal heirs as per the SC Act, the government should look into the wage issues in all brick kiln units in delta districts. The first information report should be altered and murder case (302 of IPC) should be booked, Mr. Kathir said. A police official said three persons, including the kiln owner, had been arrested and investigation was under way to ascertain whether the victim was murdered or had hanged himself to death. But the family members had not received the body as they were determined that murder case be registered against the suspects, Mr. Kathir added.

23 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||U.T. drafts guidelines for various activities during lockdown||Amid a rising graph of second wave coronavirus cases, the administration on Thursday framed orders on prohibited and permissible activities that would be in force during the complete lockdown starting 10 p.m. on Friday and the partial restrictions from Monday up to April 30. In a bid to cushion the impact on economic activities, the State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) permitted a range of activities during the weekend lockdown, such as shops dealing with food, groceries, fruits and vegetables, dairy and milk booths, meat and fish, industrial production, animal fodder, pharmaceuticals, opticians, medicines and medical equipment, and newspaper distribution. The high-level meeting with officials, chaired by Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, on Tuesday had gone through the pros and cons before arriving at a decision to go in for a complete lockdown on the weekend and restricted timings next week, officials said. In essence, the measures, while allowing calibrated access to markets, simultaneously seek to discourage shopping as a family outing or random socialising behaviour for a brief period of time. According to officials, the administration had to weigh the deleterious effect of a complete lockdown on an already struggling local economy against the need for drastic action to disrupt the highly transmissible second wave of COVID-19. The administration’s hand was apparently forced by a combination of the steep increase in the caseload and the attendant pressure it put on health manpower and infrastructure and the feedback on lax compliance with safety norms, mainly with regard to social distancing on the streets. The Police Department’s inputs pointed to a ground situation where even though masking had become the default norm for the majority of the population venturing out, the distancing and sanitising aspects of COVID-19 appropriate behaviour left much to be desired. The non-compliance with safety protocols at social gatherings, apart from high-footfall places, such as markets, shops and recreation spots including the beach, was cause for concern, officials said. Striking a balance “We have attempted to strike a balance between curtailing common liberties and sustaining the local economy,” Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar said. “While our health infrastructure is more than adequate to deal with the existing situation, we needed to inject a sense of urgency in the public about the seriousness of the second wave,” he said. In recent weeks, there has been a net increase in COVID-19 cases, where new admissions have far outstripped recoveries, leaving the Union Territory at levels worse off than the peak of 2020. Left unchecked, a rising graph has the potential to quickly exhaust health infrastructure even at its ramped up state of preparedness, he pointed out. “The measures are designed to discourage people from coming out of their homes without a valid reason and to restrict outdoor visits to those purely functional. We have been noticing that people keep coming out of their homes in the evenings and remaining on the streets longer than they need to...and this is high-risk behaviour during the second wave of the pandemic,” said T. Arun, Health Secretary. According to the SOEC guidelines, on top of the night curfew in place from 10 p.m. till 5 a.m., there will be a complete lockdown in force through Saturday and Sunday till 5 a.m. on Monday. The guidelines also state that from Monday till April 30, shops/business/commercial establishments will be open only up to 2 p.m. on weekdays. Restaurants/food courts/tea shops will operate with up to 50% occupancy level. A range of essential services have been exempted from the total lockdown on the weekend as well. ‘Prioritise visits’ “We hope that by keeping essential outlets functioning during the total lockdown and with restricted timings from Monday, the panic-buying associated with lockdowns is avoided even while getting people to prioritise their outdoor visits,” the Chief Secretary said. Marriage functions would be allowed with a cap of 100 people, and funeral/last rites with a maximum of 50. This will be allowed even during the weekend lockdown. Religious congregations/gatherings and temple festivals are prohibited. Religious places shall remain open for regular poojas with strict COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, the guidelines said. Among other activities to be exempted are industrial production units, home delivery of food, hospitals, medical labs, shops, ambulance and hearse vehicles, medical and allied services and all emergency cases. So are goods transport and public passenger transport (buses/autos/taxis), vehicles carrying agricultural produce, agriculture and allied activities. Point of load bunks, banks, insurance offices, ATMs and SEBI/stock related offices, telecom, media, IT, cold storages, warehousing, private security agencies, water supply, sanitation, electricity and law and order, emergency, fire, municipal and election-related activities are also outside the purview of the restrictions. Persons engaged in government essential services will be permitted to function on production of valid ID and passengers allowed to transit on providing valid tickets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ut-drafts-guidelines-for-various-activities-during-lockdown/article34389790.ece

23 April 2021||Pudukottai,TAMIL NADU||Villagers oppose construction of houses by Slum Clearance Board||Tense moments prevailed at Vadaseripatti village near Vellanur in the district on Thursday after a group of villagers resorted to a protest opposing the construction of houses by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board for those who were affected by Cyclone Gaja that struck in November 2018. As preliminary works ahead of the construction of 528 houses were to commence on Thursday, a section of villagers vent their ire by assembling at the spot and besieging the vehicles thus preventing the works. As police personnel intervened asking the protesters to vacate, a section of them rushed towards the Tiruchi - Pudukottai national highway nearby and staged a road roko for some time. The grouse of a section of villagers was that construction would result in water problems and affect irrigation for farming activities. Works were temporarily halted in the wake of the protest. Police teams continued to be deployed at the spot. A case was booked against 20 persons by the Vellanur police for resorting to a road roko, said the sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/villagers-oppose-construction-of-houses-by-slum-clearance-board/article34389164.ece

23 April 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||‘No evidence to back my charge on Sterlite protest’||Tamil superstar Rajinikanth has told a commission of inquiry that he does not have any evidence to substantiate his charge that anti-social elements had indulged in violence during the protest demanding closure of the Sterlite copper smelter here on May 22, 2018. Thirteen persons were killed in police firing during a march taken out to the Collectorate. Submits affidavit In an affidavit submitted through his lawyer to the Justice Aruna Jegadeesan Commission of Inquiry into the police firing, the actor said he did not have any documentary evidence to prove his claim. After meeting families of the victims of police firing and violence, Mr. Rajinikanth had told journalists that the infiltration of anti-social elements had led to violence. Arul Vadivel Sekar, lawyer for the commission, told journalists on Thursday that Mr. Rajinikanth, in response to the summons, had sought permission to respond to a questionnaire. On receiving the questions, he submitted his reply. Clarifications “In his reply, he stated that his address to the media after visiting the victims at the Thoothukudi Medical College and Hospital was an unscheduled one, and he had no documentary evidence to prove his assertion that the intrusion of anti-social elements into the rally had caused violence and arson,” he said. The commission would summon the actor to get “a few more clarifications” based on his reply. The commission had summoned Mr. Rajinikanth to share evidence. The actor did not turn up before the commission on a few occasions, contending that his appearance would cause hardship to the people. Later, he cited COVID-19 for his inability to depose. Mr. Sekar said 48 persons deposed at the 27th sitting held between April 19 and 22. So far, 719 of the 1,052 people summoned had appeared before the commission. The policemen on security duty during the rally, the policemen injured in the violence and government officials, including the then Collector, would be summoned for the next sitting to be held between May 17 and 21, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-evidence-to-back-my-charge-on-sterlite-protest/article34389170.ece

Meanwhile, a traveller from Kuala Lampur who landed at the Tiruchi International Airport caused a stir after he had produced a COVID-19 positive report on arrival. The patient was immediately admitted to the Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, while all travellers were being traced and asked to isolate themselves. The Deputy Director of Health Services, meanwhile has issued a notice to the airport authorities on the negligence. “This is not the first time that this is happening. We have issued three notices earlier as well. It is the duty of the airline to check COVID-19 reports while boarding the passengers. Because of them, unnecessary panic is created,” S. Ram Ganesh, Deputy Director of Health Services, Tiruchi said.  We have increased testing and are focussing on areas where a large number of cases were reported last year Official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/central-districts-record-over-1000-cases-for-the-first-time/article34389159.ece
23 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Sports infrastructure in Tiruchi goes for a toss||Aspiring sports persons and players of various disciplines are dejected over the decline in sports infrastructure with the demolition of three major clubs that had excellent infrastructure and recreational facilities in the city. All the three clubs -- City Club, Union Club and the Srirangam Club -- were established during the pre-Independence period. They had served sports enthusiasts of Tiruchi for more than 100 years. The Srirangam Club, which was located in the close vicinity of erstwhile Srirangam Municipality, was the first club in the city that was razed down by the officials of Tiruchi Corporation. The officials armed with an earthmover demolished the building and the infrastructure associated with it within a few hours about six years ago over a dispute with the Corporation and the Club management. Besides recreational facilities for the members, it had an indoor badminton court, a tennis court, a table tennis court and infrastructure for bridge. City Club on West Boulevard Road was the second major club that was demolished. After winning a legal battle to claim ownership of about one acre of land, which was leased to the City Club in 1905, the Corporation officials razed down the heritage building and sports infrastructure such as tennis courts, badminton courts, a table tennis court in May 2019. The Corporation is now building a multi level car parking on the site. Union Club on Bharathidasan Road was the last one to be demolished in the city. Claiming that the Club management failed to pay lease amount to the Government for the last 44 years, the Revenue officials, who visited the club premises about 10 days ago, pulled down a portion of a century old heritage building along with indoor sports infrastructure recreational facilities. While the members resisted the demolition move by stating that the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court was seized off the dispute over the lease rent, the officials went ahead with the plan. They alleged that the officials served a February dated demolition notice just a day before the demolition. The three demolitions have left sports lovers bewildered and dejected. Over 1,000 persons had been members of these three clubs. With the demolition of the infrastructure built with the voluntary contributions by many people over a period of time, the players and aspiring young talents have nowhere to go. “Located in three different areas of the city, the clubs served the people well for several decades and helped develop sports culture among the people. Besides hosting international tournaments, the clubs have produced many national and some international players. But, it is unfortunate that the officials, by demolitions, have failed to acknowledge the importance of building a healthy society,” says S. Viswanathan, former Physical Director of the Bharathidasan University. Many lamented that the officials should have made alternative arrangements to create sports infrastructure in the respective areas before initiating actions on the club. “Individuals can not afford to build such infrastructure by spending huge amount. The government and the Tiruchi Corporation should come out with an action plan to re-create sports facilities in all three places,” says R. Ramesh Kamak, treasurer, Union Club.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sports-infrastructure-in-tiruchi-goes-for-a-toss/article34389142.ece

Special drives are being organised by the law enforcers in the nine districts daily against those found not wearing masks in public places.

Notwithstanding repeated appeals from the government to the public to adhere to the safety protocol of wearing masks while venturing out many could be seen either not wearing masks or wearing masks improperly in public places causing concern at a time when there was a spike in COVID-19 cases all over the State, say police sources. Police statistics reveal that Thanjavur district tops in respect of such cases booked by the law enforcers against those found not wearing masks in public places. The number of cases booked in Thanjavur district alone since April 8 was 17,731. Pudukottai district was second in the zone with the number of cases booked being 14,428 till now. Cases booked in Tiruchi Rural Police limits so far were 8,356, while in Nagapattinam it was 8,059 cases.

The number of cases registered under this head since April 8 was 3,102 in the Central zone with Mayiladuthurai district topping the list with 694 cases closely followed by Nagapattinam district where 661 cases had been registered till now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reluctance-to-wear-masks-remains-a-cause-of-concern/article34389163.ece
23 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Defence civilian employees pledge support to Centre||Defence civilian employees have reiterated their commitment towards the nation during the COVID-19 crisis period in the wake of the latest spike. In a letter to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, the General Secretary of All India Defence Employees Federation C. Srikumar pledged the commitment of the workforce to provide oxygen cylinders and extra beds to civil administration and State governments. The entire workforce of the ordnance factories and Defence Research and Development Organisation had, at the time of first wave of COVID-19 crisis, worked round-the-clock to provide personal protection equipment, medical tents, sanitisers and ventilators to the nation risking their lives. However, the announcement to corporatise the ordnance factories in violation of the previous written assurances and agreements given by the government, in the name of COVID-19 relief package, was shocking, and had demoralised the workforce. The Centre should, hence, favourably consider the demand of the workforce for withdrawal of the move to corporatise the ordnance factories in the interest of national security and defence preparedness. The government must withdraw the Government Owned Contractor Operated Model in the Electronics and Mechanical Engineers Workshops. Defence civilian employees and their dependants suffering due to COVID-19 infection must be provided medical treatment in all armed forces hospitals. All ordnance factory hospitals and factory health clinics must be permitted to directly procure COVID-19 vaccine and full reimbursement must be made for COVID-19 related medical treatment clams for defence civilian employees and their dependants, he emphasised. The other demands constituted issue of directions to defence industrial establishments to operate with only 50% workforce till the situation normalises; sanction of compensation/ ex-gratia payment to dependants of defence civilian employees who had died due to COVID-19 infection; and grant of out-of-turn compassionate appointment to dependants of defence civilian employees who had died due to COVID-19 infection over and above the five percent regular quota.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/defence-civilian-employees-pledge-support-to-centre/article34389153.ece
23 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Night curfew turns unpalatable for eateries||Roadside food stalls catering to customers at dinner time have taken a hit due to the night curfew imposed in the State in view of the second wave of COVID-19. The vendors claim that they had only begun making some profits over the last few months and that the new norms will only lead to further losses. A row of night eateries can be found near the back entrance of the Central Bus Stand, Gandhi Market, Omni Bus Stand, Big Bazaar Street, Singarathope, near the Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital and other parts of the city. They open up in the evening and serve varieties of dishes, including dosa, idly, parotta, chaats and snacks and cater to customers seeking to eat dinner before heading home or to work. These stalls have lost a large share of business due to the night curfew. Since the curfew begins at 10 p.m., they are asked to clear their stalls by 9 p.m., which is usually the peak business hours for them, they added. S. Nathar Ali, who runs ARR Biryani near the Central Bus Stand, said that their customers were mainly travellers who alighted at the bus stand. But, now inter-district buses to Chennai stop by 2 p.m. and only buses to nearby places like Perambalur, Manapparai and Musiri ply till 8 p.m, he said. Mr. Ali has been forced to reduce the number of workers working at his stall and kitchen to prepare the dishes. “Along with cleaners and dishwashers, we had a total of 20 people. However, in the last month, we have downsized to a team of seven. I have asked them to come on a rotational basis, on alternate days, because I am unable to pay them daily wages,” he rued. R. Sharath, who works night-shifts and was a regular customer at Mr. Ali's stall said that he was forced to buy food even before his shift would start or otherwise the stall would be closed and he would have to go hungry. “It is either cold food, or no food at all. Since restaurants close too, we are forced to buy early,” he said. Another vendor, near the Tiruchi MGMGH said that he had reduced the quantity of food he prepared. “On Tuesday night, I had to throw out more than half the rice I had cooked. Now, I have learned my lesson and make only half the quantity,” he said. His business was hit by at least 80%, he said. “The police force us to shut shop by 8 p.m., which is when people usually come to buy my food,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/night-curfew-turns-unpalatable-for-eateries/article34389147.ece

While appreciating the efforts of the State to check the spread of COVID-19 and setting up centres to treat the infected, M. Sekaran, Chairman of the Forum, however, suggested that setting up helplines would help patients reach the hospitals or care centres in time and avoid unnecessary panic. Some of the infected prefer to go to private hospitals considering overcrowding at government facilities. But, such patients do not have any means of knowing the availability of beds at private hospitals authorised to treat COVID-19 patients. Helplines which can provide accurate information would be of much help for such patients and their families, Mr. Sekaran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/provide-information-on-beds-for-patients/article34389149.ece

As per a recent Government Order, restaurants are not permitted to offer dining services on Sundays. However, they can offer take-away service. Owners of restaurants say that the G.O. is silent on opening sweet stalls and bakeries, which have been categorised under the list of restaurants. In the first phase of nationwide lockdown in 2020, they say that they were allowed to run as usual to offer parcel service. According to a rough estimate, around 150 to 200 bakeries and sweet stalls function in Tiruchi. A section of them had kept open during the first phase of the lockdown with the skeletal strength of workers. They are not sure whether to offer parcel service this time. “There is no clarity from the Government on opening sweet stalls on Sundays, says a proprietor. Just two days are left for the total lockdown day on Sunday. The Government should clarify on the issue immediately,” says Ganesan, proprietor of Aswin Sweets and Restaurants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sweet-stalls-and-bakeries-in-a-fix/article34389849.ece

23 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Tirunelveli district records over 400 fresh cases||Even as the district’s COVID-19 infection tally crossed 400 again for the second consecutive day on Thursday, an upgraded primary health centre near here and the administrative office of VOC Port in Thoothukudi have been closed after the staff tested positive for the viral infection. When a pregnant lady, who was admitted in the upgraded PHC in Kallur a couple of days ago for delivery, tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, 25 persons including her mother, doctors and nurses who attended the woman at the PHC, were identified during ‘contact tracing’. Subsequently, two doctors, as many nurses and the woman’s mother tested positive for the viral infection. Consequently, the PHC was closed on Thursday for disinfection after shifting the in-patients to other PHCs and the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital. However, the out-patient section is functioning from another building even as an ambulance has been kept ready for rushing the ‘emergency cases’ to TVMCH, a senior official attached to the Department of Health Services, said. Tirunelveli district’s infection tally crossed 400 for the second consecutive day as 449 new cases were reported even as 2,779 active cases are undergoing treatment in the hospitals and in home quarantine. After four members of a family at Anbu Nagar in Palayamkottai tested positive for the viral infection but remained asymptomatic, they were allowed to get treatment even while in home quarantine. “Since the quarantined persons have removed the barricade put by the corporation personnel in front of their house to go out for shopping nearby, we’re panicked. They should be shifted to the hospitals for treatment since they have violated home quarantine norms,” a few residents of Anbu Nagar said. Office closed The Administrative Office of VOC Port, Thoothukudi was closed on Thursday after 20 of its staff tested positive for COVID-19. The office will be opened again on April 26 after due disinfection, sources in the Port said. On Thursday, Thoothukudi recorded 354 cases, Kanniyakumari had 220 cases and Tenkasi reported 281 new cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tirunelveli-district-records-400-plus-new-positive-cases/article34389185.ece

GST collected despite lockdown||The Tirunelveli Sub-Commissionerate, taking care of Goods and Service Tax in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari districts, has made a tax collection of Rs. 662 crore against the target of Rs. 696 crore during last fiscal despite the prolonged lockdown last year that almost derailed the business for major part of the financial year. “Though the lockdown had seriously hit all the businesses, the Tirunelveli Sub-Commissionerate has managed to achieve this revenue during last financial year, mainly through facilitation and raids,” a senior official of the sub-commissionerate said. The GST officials here say that the iron and steel business including scrap sale was the ‘grey area’ where a section of the people involved in this business tend to prepare fake invoices. “For the sake of getting ‘input credit,’ some people prepare fake invoices without any transaction. Their places are being raided to find the chain of people involved in this fraud and detect GST evasion. If the quantum of evasion is high, it will certainly lead to arrest of the fraudster,” the officials said As much as Rs. 20 crore GST evasion was detected in this business and Rs. 12 crore had already been paid during 2020 - 2021, they added. When the officials, during one of the vehicle checks conducted near at Pudur Pandiapuram near Thoothukudi for E-Way Bills, intercepted a container taken to Bengaluru, they found plastic granules, raw material for making plastic products, worth Rs. 6 crore, inside. The importer, who had availed tax rebate for this import from Dubai via VOC Port, Thoothukudi, did not have proper documents for the consignment in a bid to evade tax.  Vehicle check “However, the vehicle check ensured the collection of Rs. 7.42 lakh as GST for this product imported from Dubai,” according to the GST officials. The officials helpdesk can be reached via 0462 – 2970235 to clarify doubts or for seeking any help regarding the three-year-old tax regime.

After being remanded in judicial custody, they were lodged in Srivaikundam sub-jail from where they were shifted to the Palayamkottai Central Prison on Thursday.

23 April 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Tiruppur MP accuses Centre of irresponsible behaviour||With India reporting the highest COVID-19 single-day case load in the world on Thursday, Tiruppur MP K. Subbarayan accused the Central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “irresponsible behaviour” in terms of the response towards the first and second waves of the pandemic. Speaking to mediapersons in Tiruppur, he said the government has failed to stock adequate doses of the vaccines in the face of rising cases across the State, including in Tiruppur district. “When I went for a second dose, there was no vaccine. I got the vaccine shot only the next day,” he said. He also condemned the Centre’s recent decision to divert 45 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The MP said that he has written a letter to Mr. Modi requesting him to allow government-controlled institutes such as BCG Vaccine Laboratory, Chennai and Pasteur Institute of India, Coonoor to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. The private institutes that currently manufactured the vaccines were concerned only about profit and not about the needs of the country. The Integrated Vaccines Complex at Chengalpattu must also be made functional and be used to manufacture the vaccines, Mr. Subbarayan demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruppur-mp-accuses-centre-of-irresponsible-behaviour/article34389603.ece

Members of trade bodies said the people of Kodaikanal were dependent on tourism for their livelihood. They had already suffered financially from the impact of the nationwide lockdown imposed last year. Instead of a total ban on entry of tourists, their number could be regulated with strict adherence to mandatory COVID-19 guidelines. The stakeholders and tourists would abide by the rules, said S. Abdul Gani Raja of Kodaikanal Hotels and Resort Owners Association. Echoing him, S.N.S. Raja Mohammed of Kodaikanal Traders Association said the ban would push the people further into financial crisis as they were dependent on tourism for livelihood. The members began the day-long protest at 10 a.m. Various government officials met them. The protesters agreed to temporarily call off the protest after the officials told them that their demand would be looked into.

However, for those who have taken both doses of vaccine, the test is not mandatory. Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan said special camps would be held for agents and candidates in all government hospitals in their constituencies on April 29 and 30. “We will ensure that priority is given to providing results of the swab tests on May 1.” He also assured candidates that agents found positive could be replaced 24 hours in advance. The Returning Officer concerned would issue identity card for the replaced agent. Each of the 149 candidates for seven Assembly constituencies would be allowed to have 19-20 agents inside the counting centres. “Since a few hundred counting personnel and agents would be inside each hall for hours together, a negative report would ensure a safe environment for all,” the Collector said. This included agents allotted for 14 tables for counting of votes in electronic voting machines and four/five agents for postal ballots and electronically transmitted postal ballots. “Most of the police personnel and government employees have taken both doses of vaccines as per the Election Commission’s earlier directive,” an official said.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Greenhouse farmers discard harvested flowers||Greenhouse farmers, who were looking to a summer of weddings and temple festivals propelling demand for flowers, have started to discard harvested flowers because of the surge in COVID-19 cases and the resultant curbs. With weddings forced to scale down, bookings cancelled, and temple festivals banned, flowers that ring in the festivities are being discarded out of greenhouses for want of demand, here in Bagalur. “Demand or no demand, flowers will have to be harvested or the crop will be lost,” says M. Harish Babu, a greenhouse farmer in Bagalur. But, there is just so long the harvested flowers can be stored. With absent demand, the flowers are being dumped by the greenhouse farmers. Wedding bookings in big halls have been cancelled. Whatever little demand for flowers for low-key temple weddings is hard to meet due to the night curfew, says Mr. Babu, who owns 12 acres of greenhouse cultivation and six acres of open field crop. Flowers are transported at night to avoid the daytime heat. Tempos carry flowers during nights to Kerala, Karnataka and Chennai, he says. But with the night curfew enforcement, the movement of the limited quantity of flowers, too, has been affected, he says. For the flower growers, March is a dull month. April, May and June bring muhurtams and ceremonies pushing up demand for flowers. “In March, we were under the impression that the worst is over, since last year was a complete loss.” For the greenhouses, unlike the open fields, flower production is a 365 cycle in order to keep up the capital investment on the polyhouse. Adding to farmers’ woes is the vertical rise in input costs. According to Mr. Babu, last year, the paper for packaging of flowers cost Rs. 36,000 per tonne. This year, it has gone up to Rs. 56,000 per tonne. The cost of fertilizers and pesticides doubled from Rs. 300 per ltr to Rs. 700 per ltr. Same is the case with other critical inputs like growth hormones, he says. Overall the cost of production had gone up per acre costing Rs. 2.20 lakh per acre, from the earlier Rs. 1.30 lakh per acre. Since the onset of the pandemic, farmers have been compelled to foot the production/plantation costs through non-institutional credit sources. Fear of losing credit ratings with banks, green house farmer, are looking to plug the gaps through non-bank borrowings, says another farmer not willing to be named. “I have borrowed outside of bank, from ‘kandu vatti’, because banks are refusing to lend knowing the COVID-19 situation is bad. But fields cannot be left to go fallow, because of the capital investment in polyhouse for greenhouse construction, which itself is Rs. 50 lakh capital investment,” says Mr. Babu. Unlike open fields, green houses need regular plantation irrespective of demand. This entails labour costs with or without market for flowers. Every alternate day, green house farms are harvested and the flowers are stored in anticipation of demand. After 10 days of cold storage, the flowers are discarded to make space for the new harvest. “This has been the case since the start of the second wave of the pandemic,” he says. There is also the maintenance of cold storage, including the electricity costs, he says. In this chain, the labourers of greenhouses have suffered, subsidising the capital costs for the owners. “The labourers are paid Rs. 7,000 to Rs. 8,000 per family, while the cost of running a family is nothing less than Rs. 15,000 at least,” acknowledges Mr. Babu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/greenhouse-farmers-discard-harvested-flowers/article34389203.ece

Officials then announced that only the second dose would be administered. “Once the vaccine arrived, it was a mad scramble,” he said. Another person who wanted his parents to receive the second dose on Friday said that when he called up the hospital, officials there told him that they had run out of stock and asked him to check again on Monday. His father had suffered three strokes. “If he were to contract the infection, he will not survive,” he said. Though his parents had paid Rs. 1,000 in advance for both doses, he decided to try another private hospital at Chetpet, which had also run out of stock. The government had recommended a waiting period of eight weeks after the first dose. But he wanted his parents to have the second dose sooner in anticipation of chaos after May 1. According to healthcare providers, the shortage is more pronounced in the private sector than at government hospitals. “If a hospital sought 20 doses, it was given just three. Shortage is high in the private sector and around 30%-50% in the government sector. It will take a month to settle down,” said T.N. Ravishankar, past president of the Indian Medical Association. “When the vaccine manufacture is augmented, the situation will ease.” Senior doctors in the private sector said stocks had been low for over 10 days. Centres that administered more doses were given more. Hospitals were advised to turn away new patients and reserve the doses for the second round. While Covaxin had not been supplied for more than a week, Covishield — that arrived a few days ago — was being sent to government hospitals and health centres, doctors said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-miss-out-on-the-second-dose-of-vaccines/article34389168.ece

23 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Police shut commercial establishments||Traders in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka were taken by surprise when police started forcing them to close their establishments on Thursday. “We don’t understand why there was so much confusion in the government on the guidelines it has issued,” said Mohammed Nazin, vice president, Bangalore Commercial Association. A senior functionary of an industrial body vented his ire at the State government for poor communication. “When a huge advertisement on Namma Metro can be given in all papers on Thursday, why can’t the government issue an advertisement on the changes in guidelines? This shows the government in poor light. What we know is that they have not learned from the experience of the first lockdown,” he said. A senior trader from Chickpet, Sajjan Raj Mehta, said the two-week lockdown, which they fear will be extended, will ruin businesses. “Traders are one community that has not received any help from the government, not even in the form of tax concessions. The trader community is already reeling under severe losses from last year, and several businesses had to close. Now this lockdown will only add to our problems,” he said. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked States to desist from lockdowns and here the BJP government does exactly the opposite.” Mr. Nazin warned that given the precarious financial position of most small businesses, many will not be able to pay their employees causing much financial distress to more families. Meanwhile, contrary to government guidelines, police in their enthusiasm to shut down non-essential services, also hindered the working of industrial units. The Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI) has complained to Chief Secretary P. Ravikumar that authorities have not allowed industrial activities in several districts even though permission has been given to operate by adhering to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The chamber president Perikal M. Sundar, in a letter on Thursday, requested the government to instruct deputy commissioners to desist from interfering with functioning of industries and to maintain operation of supply chains. Head offices of several factories in the city were forcibly closed by the police, much against its own guidelines of allowing private offices with skeletal staff, sources said. Train, bus services BMRCL has decided to run trains with less frequency during the weekend on account of the curfew. KSRTC and BMTC are also likely to curtail scheduled services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-shut-commercial-establishments/article34389559.ece
23 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State directs pvt. hospitals to allocate 80% of beds for govt.-referred patients||Following a steep rise in cases, the State government has now directed private hospitals and medical college hospitals to share 80% of beds to the government for COVID-19 patients. So far, private hospitals had been asked to allocate 50% of beds, including ICU ones, for government-referred COVID-19 patients. The new proposal, however, has not gone down well with private hospital managements. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Thursday said this is under the State Disaster Management Act. “Private hospitals should make 80% beds available within two to three days. The rates fixed by Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST) for government-referred patients will continue to be applicable,” he said. Besides, all 13 medical colleges (both government and private) in Bengaluru should henceforth only handle emergencies. “Except beds that are dedicated for dialysis, mother and child care and other life-threatening diseases, all other beds in these medical colleges will have to be dedicated for COVID-19 patients. This means that over 7,500 beds will be immediately available for COVID treatment only in medical colleges in Bengaluru,” he said.  Citing the example of former Minister M.B. Patil, who announced that COVID-19 patients will be treated at one-fourth of the cost fixed by SAST at his BLDE Medical College in Vijayapura, the Minister appealed to all hospital and medical college owners to cooperate. Opposing the new direction, the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) has said it was impossible to allocate 80% beds. “Where do we accommodate private COVID-19 patients, who are not catered to by the BBMP and government and other non-COVID cases? We are ready to allocate 50% beds and we have already conveyed this to the Minister. He has not even discussed this 80% with us,” said Prasanna H.M., PHANA president.  “A similar 80% direction issued by the Delhi government has been stuck down by the Delhi High Court. We will discuss this with the Minister,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-directs-pvt-hospitals-to-allocate-80-of-beds-for-govt-referred-patients/article34389252.ece
23 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Weekend curfew explained||Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday said that the weekend curfew will be similar to that of last year’s lockdown imposed across Karnataka. Barricades would be erected on main roads, sub-main roads, and ward roads, and unnecessary movement of people would be restricted. Following instructions from Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Mr. Bommai held a video conference with zonal BBMP officials and Deputy Commissioners of Police of Bengaluru. Vehicles would be seized and strict action would be taken against all those who violate the weekend curfew, which would be enforced from 9 p.m. on Friday to 6 a.m. on Monday. The Minister said flyovers in the city would be closed, and entry of vehicles to Bengaluru would be regulated during the weekend. The government has announced the weekend curfew following a surge in COVID-19 cases in Karnataka. The police have been told to ensure smooth movement of ambulances in the city and help hospital authorities maintain law order in their premises. At present, nearly 1,250 ambulances were moving around the city round-the-clock against 700 earlier. On organising marriages, he said the police have been told to create boundaries at marriage halls and convention centres to ensure strict implementation of COVID-19 guidelines.

23 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Workers at crematoriums want a break||Workers at electric crematoria, who have been taking care of the dead without any break have threatened to stop working unless conditions improve. They submitted a petition to the Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday seeking his intervention. “Staff have been working round-the-clock and are exhausted. Amidst this, people accuse them of corruption, which is making the situation worse,” said A. Suresh, State general secretary of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Dalitha Sangharsha Samithi who submitted the petition. Workers have demand two shifts. Mr. Suresh cited the example of Sumanahalli electric crematorium, which he said received as many as 49 bodies since Wednesday. “It takes at least one hour to cremate a body followed by cleaning the premises for the next body. Workers are exhausted because of the heat, and at least two have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last two days. The sad part is that one of them needed immediate hospitalisation, but could not get a bed in the city. He had to be taken to Kolar,” Mr. Suresh told The Hindu . BBMP promises incentives, and shifts The BBMP, on Thursday, issued an order to provide incentives for personnel in graveyards and electric crematoria. Workers will receive Rs. 500 as an incentive for each body they handle, irrespective of whether the deceased had COVID-19. This incentive will be applicable from April 1, for another two months. The civic body has also fixed rates for chatta and ash collection totalling Rs. 1,000 per body. Though all services are free for citizens, the BBMP will pay the money towards crematoria maintenance. To ease the burden on workers, the civic body plans to increase the number of personnel working in the graveyards and crematoria, and introduce shifts.  Staff have been working round-the-clock and are exhausted. Amidst this, people accuse them of corruption, which is making the situation worse...at least two have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last two days. The sad part is that one of them needed immediate hospitalisation, but could not get a bed in the city. He had to be taken to Kolar A. Suresh, State general secretary, Dr. B.R.

23 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC says COVID-19 situation in Karnataka is ‘very bad’||Describing the COVID-19 situation in the State as “very bad”, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed the State government to immediately take a call on purchasing Remdesivir directly from manufacturers and distributors, and then supply to the hospitals for a fixed price in a fair and transparent manner. Till the government decides on direct purchasing of Remdesivir, a mechanism should be evolved immediately to give a real-time online information system on availability of Remdisivir with stockists and retails so that the family members of COVID-19 patients could procure it easily as and when the vial is prescribed by the hospitals. Also, the court directed the government to create a distribution system for supply of oxygen to the hospitals by coordinating with manufacturers and suppliers in addition to the war room created to monitor supply of oxygen and posting of officers in oxygen refilling centres. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar, issued the directions during the hearing of PIL petitions on the issues that cropped up due to the pandemic since last year. The Bench took into consideration a letter to the Chief Justice by S. Shivakumar, president of the Karnataka State Association of the Management of Nursing and Allied Health Sciences’ Institutions, stating that he himself has tested positive for COVID-19 and has experienced black marketing of Remdesivir and the shortage of oxygen supply and beds for COVID-19 patients. The Bench directed the government to submit report of the technical advisory committee in a sealed cover after some of the petitioner have alleged that situation has become worse as government ignored the suggestion of the committee. Meanwhile, the Bench directed the government to take measures to ensure separate queues, as far as possible, for pregnant women and senior citizens in laboratories providing RT-PCR test facility, and take action against those labs that fail to provide results within 24 hours. Also, the Bench asked the government to consider evolving policy on whether pregnant women require a compulsory RT-PCR test for admission for hospital for delivery if they do not have any symptoms of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-says-covid-19-situation-in-karnataka-is-very-bad/article34389246.ece
23 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kaveri struggles with add-ons||The Kaveri application, which has been successful in online property registrations in Karnataka for over a decade-and-a-half, seems to be crumbling under its own weight. While the application on which it has been working has become obsolete, it has seen increased load over the years without any upgrade. When the system was developed in 2003, Kaveri application was meant to handle just about 10 modules, including document registration, property valuation, marriage registration, encumbrance search, and scanning archives among others. “As it successfully demonstrated its capacity, new tasks were imposed on it. In 17 years, about 20 more tasks that were not originally conceived have been added without any upgrade,” a senior Revenue official told The Hindu.  Almost every day there is some technical issue in one of the integration applications belonging to other departments, which were not part of the original module, he rued. The Kaveri system that is now critical in the land management system has been witnessing frequent shutdowns in the last few months with at least four reported Statewide shutdowns that brought registrations to a standstill. Kaveri 1 is running on VB platform and Win XP operating system, both of which do not get the update support of Microsoft since they have become outdated. The decentralised system is further affected since the old hardware and inefficient power back up delays restoration of data due to maintenance efficiency of 282 local servers located in each office. Sources pointed out apart from the original tasks, Kaveri now supports land related integrations from other departments such as Bhoomi, Mojini, e-Swathu, Upor, e-Aasthi, Sakala, Udyoga Mitra Portal, Khajane II, Moulya, Digilocker, BDA, BBMP, and PAN verification services. “Not much focus is being given to upgrade the application or bring a new system that is robust and can handle newer integrations,” said the source.  Over the last five years, the Stamps and Registrations Department’s transaction in over 280 sub-registrar’s office alone has seen an increase. The number of documents registered has gone up from 19.71 lakh in 2015-2016 to 20.45 lakh in 2019-2020. In the same period, marriage registrations have increased from 1.21 lakh to 1.49 lakh, encumbrance certificates 27.75 lakh to 36.79 lakh, CCs from 6.86 lakh to 8.07 lakh. Another officer said Kaveri was never meant to be interactive, but made partially interactive in the recent years. “The number of steps used in registrations have gone from about 5 to 22 now. Ambitious plans such as sending OTP to the user during registrations has added pressure. To generate one OTP, the application makes about 15 communications that adds to the stress.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kaveri-struggles-with-add-ons/article34389254.ece
23 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP pushes for integrated booking system||Priya S. (name changed), a resident of Banaswadi, recalled the helplessness of trying to find an ICU bed for her husband whose oxygen saturation levels were dropping at alarming levels due to COVID-19. As they rode in the ambulance knocking on the doors of hospitals, her husband’s oxygen saturation levels dropped to 54. “I did call the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) helpline and there were no ICU beds available in the government quota. So, I took him in an ambulance and went searching for a bed. The ordeal lasted three hours,” she said. With the clamour for hospital beds only increasing by the day, the BBMP is pushing for a common platform and booking system to be put in place that will allow people to monitor and book beds in the private quota as well. This will bring more transparency to a system that citizens allege is opaque. Such a system already exists for beds available under government quota. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, BBMP’s Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said, “A common booking system may help COVID-19 patients and prevent them from going to multiple hospitals in search of beds. This has been discussed in high-level meetings with the State government.” However, BBMP sources said there was some resistance from private hospitals in putting such a system in place. However, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) president Prasanna H.M. said the bed management system for private quota was in the process of being readied. “We wanted to have this in place last year itself. But dropped the idea after the number of cases came down. We will now have a dry run of the system on Friday and launch it soon,” he said. An integration of the existing system and a platform for private quota beds is the need of the hour, said officials. It is a system that may ease the trauma of finding a bed for their loved ones. Software engineer Shubha Rao called over 30 private hospitals after her colleague’s father-in-law tested positive with low oxygen saturation and was in need of an ICU bed.  The BBMP is coordinating with various private hospitals towards making a total of 11,000 beds available over the next two to three days. The State government too has directed all private hospitals and medical colleges to hand over 80% of beds in their facilities to the government. Mr. Gupta acknowledged the limited number of ICU beds in the city. The 600 ICU beds that had been handed over had already been allotted under the BBMP’s hospital bed management system. “As and when there is an availability, ICU beds are being allotted. Towards increasing the number of ICU beds, we have held discussions with private medical colleges and private hospitals. The total may increase by another 200,” he stated. At the government level, initiative is being taken to establish ICU temporary hospitals. “If this is done, an additional 1,000 ICU beds may be available,” he added. He urged citizens not to panic, and stated that nearly 90% of those who test positive do not require any serious medical interventions. Care centres The BBMP will have in place 12 COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs) for those who don’t have the wherewithal to isolate themselves at home, said Mr. Gupta. Apart from these facilities, step down hospital and private CCCs with certain medical facilities are being established by private hospitals in association with hotels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-pushes-for-integrated-booking-system/article34389245.ece

23 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No improvement in living conditions of metro workers in Bengaluru: Survey||The living conditions of metro construction workers in four colonies in Bengaluru worsened over the last one year since the first lockdown. This was one of the main findings of a ground survey undertaken by Maraa, a media and arts collective. Narrating the plight of more than 250 metro workers living at Kudlu Gate colony, the reports stated that they are forced to live in a dilapidated building that lacked proper water supply. They live in unhygienic conditions due to non-disposal of garbage. Only four bathrooms have been provided to workers. The report further adds that the area has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Lack of ventilation in rooms and instances of 15-20 people occupying a single room were some of the other conditions highlighted. The report said the BMRCL and its contractors should be held responsible for the lapses and violating labour laws. The BMRCL has been accused of not taking any steps despite being appraised of the poor living conditions of the workers when the pandemic broke out last year. “Regular health check-ups and vaccination for COVID-19 should be provided to the workers. Most of them work without safety gear and in close proximity with one another. Maintaining social distancing is almost close to impossible given their working conditions at project sites,” the report said. Maraa demanded formation of a monitoring committee so that it visits colonies of metro workers and evaluate their living conditions and attend to their grievances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-improvement-in-living-conditions-of-metro-workers-in-bengaluru-survey/article34389565.ece
23 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Set up mechanism to receive complaints’||With the surge in COVID-19 infection across the State, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed the State government to create a grievance redressal mechanism within three days to receive complaints from public about instances of violation of COVID-19 regulations and guidelines. The government has to create the facility to receive complaints through email and WhatsApp and other similar messaging platforms, directed a Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, during the hearing on a PIL petition by city-based Letzkit Foundation. The complaints should be acted upon and they should be monitored by the committees set up by the Director-General and Inspector General of Police. On an application filed by the petitioner, along with a photograph, pointing out that the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike’s Chief Commissioner himself was not wearing a mask at a recent event, to hand over machines to collect fine for violating COVID-19 norms, the Bench asked the government to look into it. “It is important for those at the helm of affairs to abide by all the norms,” the Court observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/set-up-mechanism-to-receive-complaints/article34389247.ece
23 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Why is NIC application not being considered?||A National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) developed by National Informatics Centre is available free of cost for the State struggling with Kaveri. According to government sources, it has been found that the free property registration related application has been adopted in eight States, and States such as Maharashtra and Telangana are considering it too. Sources said that Karnataka is part of the NGDRS committee, but has so far not considered the application for adoption. “This can be adopted within a month across the State and is expected to provide a permanent solution to the existing problem. Moreover, it is a free application,” said the source. The Centre for Smart Governance has been tasked with developing a new system to handle the existing and future needs. A revenue official said that it may be a year’s time before the new system can go live. “Till then, the daily fire-fighting continues.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/why-is-nic-application-not-being-considered/article34389253.ece

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar issued the direction after it was pointed out that staff attached to these seven crematoriums are forced to work for 16-18 hours a day and there is possibility of breakdown of electric furnaces due to overloading. Capacity versus actual The capacity of the electric crematorium at Summanahalli is 16 bodies per day, but 25 bodies of COVID-19 victims were being cremated, advocate Clifton D’Rozario pointed out to the bench while appearing for the All India Central Council for Trade Unions. Burial grounds Meanwhile, the bench asked the government to look into the shortage of burial grounds, including for Christians, in cities like Bengaluru and Mysuru apart from trying to use other electric crematoriums for COVID-19 victims in Bengaluru. The bench also asked the State government to ensure that COVID-19 victims and their relatives are treated with dignity as per guidelines issued last year based on the court’s directions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-tells-state-to-look-into-shortage-of-crematoriums/article34389557.ece

The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation ran 4,900 buses in the city, much to the relief of commuters. RTCs said they incurred a revenue loss of over Rs. 280 crore due to the strike. Officials predicted that with the rising number of COVID-19 cases and restrictions imposed on occupancy, ridership will fall significantly in the coming days. “On Thursday, we operated 90% of non–AC bus schedules within the State. But ridership was very low,” said an official with KSRTC. “In the coming days, ridership will drop further, which will impact our revenue generation. We may manage to meet fuel expenses and partial salaries of staff.” Demand for inter-State buses has also reduced. “Barring Andhra Pradesh, inter-state Services have been badly impacted due to the pandemic,” the official said. “The BMTC should have more buses depending on demand,” said Nayana R., a commuter.

23 April 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Shopkeepers shocked over closure order||The State government’s directive to close all shops and establishments, except those selling food and other essentials, came as shock to shopkeepers and small businessmen on Thursday. Several teams of officers swung into action to close down business establishments in Hassan. The businessmen, who were under the impression that their firms would be closed only during the weekend-curfew, were taken aback. Some of them entered into an argument with the officers of Hassan City Municipal Council and the police. “What has come into effect is a total lockdown, despite repeated assurance from the government that such a measure would not be taken”, said a textile shop owner. Another shopkeeper said he had been facing many difficulties for the last one year. “The government has brought in lockdown once again. For the next 15 days, we cannot do any business. How should we survive?” asked a stationery shop owner. The government has allowed degree colleges and engineering colleges to continue with the semester examinations. “Many students would require stationery items ahead of the examinations. If all the stationery shops are closed, where should they go”, wondered Chandan, an engineering student. Similarly, the government has allowed marriages during, but not allowed the shops that sell jewellery and clothes. Penalty Hassan CMC Commissioner R. Krishnamurthy slapped a fine of Rs. 50,000 on SRS Jewellers, a shop in the city, for not following the guidelines. The shop was opened for business on Thursday morning and more than 100 people had gathered inside. Many were not wearing masks and had ignored social distance norms. The Commissioner slapped a fine of Rs. 10,000 on Malabar Gold loan firm for similar offences. Hassan Deputy Commissioner R. Girish also went around the city to ensure the shops are closed. People in Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga district also faced confusion about the guidelines. Many businessmen had arguments with the police. Rise in cases Hassan district witnessed a steep increase in COVID-19 cases on Thursday when 663 fresh cases were reported. The total cases increased to 33,806.

23 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Traders caught off-guard as police swing into action||Lack of clarity over what is prohibited, particularly those relating to shops and commercial establishments, and the subsequent clarification by the authorities resulted in the police closing down all shops and commercial establishments in Dharwad district, including the twin cities, on Thursday. The sudden change caught traders and businessmen off-guard, some of whom even took exception to it and Karnatak Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), a representative of traders and industrialists, even shot a letter to the Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad. Some of the traders and a few media persons took to twitter after police personnel started closing down shops and commercial establishments in Hubballi. They raised objection that even though there was nothing in the guidelines, the police were unnecessarily closing down the market. They complained of high-handedness by the police and some of them even protested against the police action. However, soon, Deputy Commissioner Nitesh Patil clarified that the police action was in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Chief Secretary. He also responded on twitter clarifying about the development. As the news spread, rumour mills started running at full speed about the district recording more cases and another lockdown. Several people also called newspaper offices to know what was happening. Strict implementation Mr. Nitesh Patil has said that there will be strict implementation of the guidelines on night curfew and weekend lockdown. On Thursday, he too issued an order restricting the entry of public to the four major parks in the district. In the order, he said that entry to the Sunset Point on Karnatak University Campus, Dharwad, Sanjivin Park at Rayapur, Nrupatunga Betta in Hubballi and Neerasagar Reservoir at Dummawad in Kalghatgi taluk will be between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. only. He has also said that violators will be liable for legal action. Case registered Meanwhile, the authorities have begun filing cases against organisers of marriages. In Dharwad, a case has been registered against Bhimappa G. Bombay for holding marriage at Royal Community Hall inviting more than 200 guests and also against the proprietor of the marriage hall. As per the earlier norms the permitted number was 100 and according to the new guidelines, it is just 50. Based on a complaint from the municipal authorities, the Dharwad Town Police have registered a case. Vehicles seized The authorities have also booked cases against 14 public transport vehicles for carrying more than the permitted number of passengers and seized one bus and three maxi-cabs.

23 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||ASUSE till March next in 16 dists||The Regional Office of National Statistical Office (NSO) in Hubballi will be conducting the Annual Survey on Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) from this month to March 2022 in the 16 districts of North Karnataka. Addressing presspersons in Hubballi on Thursday, Deputy Director of NSO Sugandha Srivastava said that a three-day training camp on virtual mode on the annual survey is being held for field staff of regional office in Hubballi and sub-regional offices in Belagavi, Ballari and Kalaburagi. Ms. Srivatsava said that the survey is aimed at capturing economic and operational characteristics of unincorporated non-agricultural establishments in manufacturing, trade and other services sector. “The unit of enquiry of ASUSE will be an establishment. The unincorporated sector is important because of the large number of establishments in this sector and the magnitude of employment it provides to unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled persons. The data in this area is also important considering its contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country,” she said. Ms. Srivatsava said that the data collected through the sample survey would be utilised for planning formulation, decision support and as input for further economic and statistical analysis by government organisations, academics, researchers and scholars. She said that the first such survey was conducted during the 33rd round of National Sample Survey (1978-1979) and subsequently, it was conducted during the 67th round (2010-11) and 73rd round (2015-16).

23 April 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Traders, shoppers left high and dry in Kalaburagi||The decision of the administration to close down all commercial establishments and trading units except those selling essential commodities and providing services such as hospitals and pharmacies left people high and dry in Kalaburagi on Thursday. Police vehicles began patrolling the city at 4 p.m., blowing sirens and asking traders through loudspeakers to close their shops. In some places, including Super Market, Kapada Bazaar and Kirana Bazaar, police teams forcibly got the shops closed leaving traders as well as customers in shock. Police action created chaos in many places and left people, especially those who had arrived from villages, stranded in the city. “We came from a faraway village to purchase clothes for a wedding ceremony. The police emerged from nowhere all of a sudden and forcibly got the cloth shop closed. They did not even give us time to complete the transaction. We don’t know what to do now. We are not sure whether we have buses to return to our village,” a man standing at Kapda Bazaar told The Hindu . “The government had said that only night curfew will be imposed. The local administration is imposing a ‘complete lockdown’ without even a small hint or prior information. I am receiving hundreds of calls from traders,” Sharanu Pappa, secretary of Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said. A senior police officer, who wished not to be identified, said: “We had confusion as to how to implement the fresh restrictions announced on Wednesday.” “We received directions from higher-ups in the department on Thursday to close down everything, just as we did during the lockdown last year. We are just following the orders,” he said. The officer justified the action stating that it is necessary to minimise crowd gathering for preventing or containing, at least, the spread of COVID-19. “Except in places such as hospitals, you don’t feel that the deadly pandemic is wreaking a havoc. Unmindful of the fresh restrictions imposed by the government, people are carelessly gathering everywhere. Most of the shops in Kapda Bazaar are heavily crowded with people who arrive for shopping clothes for marriages,” he said. Deepak Gala, president of Hyderabad Karnataka Environment Awareness and Protection Organisation, said, “We are not against lockdown if it is absolutely necessary. But, we are opposed to the way the administration is implementing it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/traders-shoppers-left-high-and-dry-in-kalaburagi/article34389240.ece
23 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Unorganised sector may suffer due to curbs||The clarification issued by Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar on Wednesday that all commercial establishments that were not expressly exempted from closure will be closed down till May 4 is likely to affect the livelihood of lakhs of workers in the unorganised sector. In an addendum on Wednesday, Mr. Kumar said, “All shops/commercial establishments/private establishments except those mentioned shall remain closed,” during the curfew period. Exempted are shops selling basic essential commodities, restaurants for takeaway foods, lodging hotels, standalone liquor shops, food processing industries, banks and insurance, media, e-commerce, cold storage, hair dressers and construction activity/material. Consequent to Wednesday’s clarification, police personnel along with officials from local bodies were closing down shops and establishments not dealing with basic essential commodities, including textile, automobile, jewellery, vehicle repair, dhobi, tailors, electronic, footwear, mobile phone sale and repair, cutlery, stationary and many more across the State. The move affects life of general public too along with those depending upon these activities, rued Raviraj Kumar, a private sector employee. For example, if the automobile mechanic is forced to close his shop, one depending upon a vehicle for his daily avocation has no other option but sit at home if the vehicle develops technical snag, he said. With thousands of marriage and other programmes lined up, people find it difficult to perform the ceremonies with the closure of textile and jewellery shops. Chittaranjan Kumar, a bicycle repair shop owner in the city, was worried over leading life for the next fortnight. “Is the government providing free ration to lakhs of daily earners like me,” he asked. Mr. Kumar further said that one would understand closure of malls, cinemas and restaurants that attract heavy footfall. How come standalone shops like his attract footfall, he wondered and added that those riding bicycles for fitness too would be in a difficult position if their bicycles needed repair. It is a complete lockdown except that people’s movement was not curbed during the non-curfew hours, said Mahabala Rai, another resident. Justifying the curbs, the Chief Secretary said that the government had watered down the curbs while issuing the April 20 order. The curbs were based on the recommendations of technical experts. The decision was painful for the government too, he said.  Restrictions based on the recommendations of technical experts and the decision is painful for the government too, says Chief Secretary||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/unorganised-sector-may-suffer-due-to-curbs/article34389711.ece
23 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Food arranged for policemen in city||For police personnel who are finding it difficult to cook food in their houses in the city due to COVID-19 management duty, Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar here on Wednesday launched a canteen where food is being provided between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. “There are many bachelors among the police personnel and also, those who have been forced to stay single as they have sent their family members back to their native places following a surge in COVID-19 cases. They are dependent on hotels and other eateries for food. As we found that these personnel are facing problems in getting healthy food on time, we opened a new canteen,” Mr. Kumar said. To start with, six police personnel and two Home Guards have been deployed to cook food for about 300 personnel every day. While it was rice-sambar, pulav and kesari bath on Wednesday, rice-sambar and rice bath was provided to the personnel on Thursday. Four counters have been opened to provide food to the personnel in a staggered manner by maintaining social distancing. The personnel will also get “kashaya” at these counters. Mr. Kumar said that out of around 2,000 police personnel in the city, there are about 1,000 personnel who hail from different parts in North Karnataka. Of the 1,000 personnel, 50% of them are bachelors. “This facility is part of the efforts to keep the morale of the personnel high during these trying circumstances,” Mr. Kumar said. Funds provided by State government to meet investigation and other expenses are being used to run the new facility. Funds available for providing food for personnel posted for bandobust duties was also being used. Personnel in Moodbidri and Mulky will continue to get food parcels from the respective police stations, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/food-arranged-for-policemen-in-city/article34389717.ece
23 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Shopkeepers caught off-guard||Many shopkeepers in Mangaluru and Udupi were caught off-guard by the sudden action of officials on Thursday to close down all non-essential shops. A team of officials from Mangaluru City Corporation visited the Central Market area along with police in the afternoon and began asking shopkeepers dealing with mobile phones, cloth, bicycles and other non-essential items to close down. When traders in the Central Market building questioned the officials, the latter said that they cannot do much as they have to comply with specific directions issued by the State government. When a bicycle trader took time to move his articles back into the shop and close it, a city corporation official directed his team members to take action for cancellation of trade licence. All shops in malls, excluding those dealing with groceries, were asked to close down. In Udupi, officials went around the market area to make announcements asking shopkeepers to close down their establishments. When traders took time in acting on the announcement, officials threatened them with criminal action.

23 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Climbing fatality rate causing concern||The climbing case fatality rate (CFR) in Mysuru has become a cause for concern as the number of patients succumbing to the infection has gone up with about 63 deaths reported in a span of 13 days. Mysuru’s CFR stands at 4 per cent. Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar said focus has to be on controlling the deaths although many of the victims had complex co-morbidities and some had life threatening diseases. He told reporters that late admissions to hospitals is one of the main reasons for the deaths. Some of the deaths occurred while the patients from other districts were being shifted to the hospitals here. The death audit had documented the reasons which will be verified and analysed precisely.  Helpline Mr. Sudhakar said a decision had been taken to open a helpline at the Drug Controller’s Office here to overcome any shortfall of medical oxygen and the drugs required for COVID-19 treatment. “I have also told the department to make the COVID-19 War Room more proactive in view of the spike.” ‘Role model’ The Minister said Mysuru has become a role model to other districts on vaccination as it stands number one in terms of the vaccination coverage. So far, 7 lakh people have been vaccinated. Mr. Sudhakar lashed out at the Opposition for making false accusations on the vaccine and clarified that the Centre was not biased over the issue of supplying vaccines to the State. “Where did Rajasthan get the vaccine? From America is it,” the Minister asked, while hitting out at the critics of the BJP government for what he called baseless accusations. “I think we shall become small by way of making allegations and counter-allegations amidst the health crisis.” 30,000 oxygenated beds The Minister said the number of oxygenated beds rose from 3,000 to 30,000 since the outbreak of the pandemic. Nearly 50 oxygenated beds had been made available in taluk hospitals and these beds will cater to the needs of patients from rural areas. “This is an unprecedented situation and the government is doing its best to save lives and provide treatment. Such a pandemic situation was never seen in history. Even the developed countries were unprepared to face the pandemic and they too struggled to fight the disease. Only if all of us unite can we can fight the disease,” he said, replying to the allegations on the government’s failure to tackle the pandemic. As many as 51 patients are in ICU in Mysuru; the number in Mandya and Kodagu is 14 and 19 respectively and 39 in Chamarajnagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/climbing-fatality-rate-causing-concern/article34389743.ece
23 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Farmers’ stir completes a month||The agitation by farmers of Kochanahalli in Mysuru district seeking compensation for land acquired from them after being promised jobs, has completed a month. The crux of the issue revolves around nearly 400 acres of land acquired from the villagers for a pittance more than 12 years ago after being promised jobs by private players whose intentions are now being questioned. A ‘’heritage golf course’’ was planned and farmers of Kochanahalli were lured to part with their land at the rate of nearly Rs. 1.5 lakh per acre. This was after they were promised that they would not only get a monthly salary but their future needs would be met by way of contribution to the Provident Fund etc. But not only did the golf course project did not take off but a portion of the land acquired from them was sold to Karnataka Industrial Area Development Authority (KIADB) for almost Rs. 40 lakh per acre. The once land-holding farmers overnight turned into daily wagers devoid of both land and suitable compensation. Though the issue was brought to the notice of successive governments, it has not yielded any result. Harish of Socialist Unity Centre of India (SUCI) which is lending support to the cause said that the farmers are now cultivating on the same land they sold to the private players. But it lacks legal basis as the land is no longer in their names. Hence, no financial support is extended by banks nor do they get subsidy from the government. Meanwhile, the Tahsildar from Nanjangud visited the agitating farmers and told them that he would discuss the issue with the higher authorities. Mr. Harish said a joint meeting of the revenue officials, police and the KIADB has been sought to find out the best way possible to resolve the issue. Efforts by KIADB to develop the land into an industrial site was foiled by the farmers sometime ago and this is expected to snowball into a major issue in the days ahead. Mr. Harish said the farmers have two demands and this includes an assurance that the people of Kochanahalli will be given first preference for employment by future industries coming up on those plot. Their second demand is to fix a suitable amount as compensation matching the prevailing market rate. Nearly 70 to 80 farmers sit on a dharna daily in support of their demands which has not drawn the attention of the local MLA or the MP so far, according to SUCI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-stir-completes-a-month/article34389741.ece
23 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Efforts on to improve performance of students in SSLC examination||The Department of Public Instruction has taken a series of measures to shore up the performance of students in the district in the SSLC examinations slated to be held from June. This includes a series of preparatory examinations besides identifying students performing below par and conducting crash courses for them. This was stated by the Deputy Director of Public Instruction Panduranga at the Karnataka Development Programme review meeting conducted by the Mysuru Zilla Panchayat. The official said model question papers will be prepared and preparatory examinations will be conducted at the school, taluk and district level. In addition a fourth test is slated to be held all over the State before the actual examination that will commence from June 21. ZP president Parimala Shyam raised the issue in the light of the relatively poor performance of the district in the SSLC examination last year. Mr. Panduranga said 180 schools with less than 60 per cent pass percentage have been identified and students will be subjected to special or remedial classes in subjects they are found to be weak. The government has also appointed nodal officers for each district to oversee the performance. In Mysuru district, about 38,900 students are eligible to appear for the SSLC examination this year, said Mr. Panduranga. The discussion turned to delay in construction of classrooms in schools affected by floods and the PWD officials were rebuked for their failure to expedite the works. In all, 635 classrooms were to be constructed to benefit 334 government schools spread across the district and the government had earmarked Rs. 75 crore under various heads. The ZP president took exception to the delay in completing the works. Only 16 classrooms had been completed so far which drew the ire of the elected members. In H.D. Kote taluk, 146 classrooms were targeted for completion against which only 1 has been completed and 135 were in various stages of completion. In Hunsur, against a target of 93 classrooms, only 11 were completed while in K.R. Nagar 4 out of 171 classrooms were ready. In Nanjangud, Mysuru rural, Periyapatna and T.Narsipur taluks not a single classroom had been completed. The PWD engineers said work was in advanced stage of completion on 562 classrooms across the district and they will be completed within 15 to 20 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/efforts-on-to-improve-performance-of-students-in-sslc-examination/article34389746.ece

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which manages all the graveyards and crematoria in the city, blamed private hospitals for the rush. Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta claimed that many hospitals were releasing bodies for cremation or burial post-noon. “By the time ambulances and hearses reach the various graveyards and crematoria, it is 1 p.m. and there is a pile-up,” he said, and added that crematoria in the city have been directed to function from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. He claimed to have inspected several facilities and found that from 8 a.m. to post-noon, there was hardly any rush. “We have discussed this with private hospitals. We have requested them to release bodies earlier in the day to minimise rush at the various facilities,” he said. Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA), however, accused the civic body of delay in picking up bodies. PHANA president Prasanna H.M. told The Hindu that a majority of deaths happen during the early hours, between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. As per the protocol, private medical establishments declare the deaths, inform relatives and the BBMP. “Even when we inform the BBMP at 8 a.m., the bodies are picked up post-noon. We often hear that ambulances or hearses are unavailable,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-phana-blame-each-other-for-rush-at-crematoria-graveyards/article34389556.ece
23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Adivasis counselled for vaccine reluctance||The vaccine hesitancy among the forest dwelling tribes in Chamarajanagar district has been removed through counselling and measures are in place to cover 32,000 adivasis within the next few days. There are 150 tribal haadis or hamlets in the district and the district administration has converted the Girijana Ashrama Schools into vaccination centres. M.R. Ravi, Deputy Commissioner, Chamarajanagar district, said that a majority of adivasi hamlets are within close range of the schools and converting them into vaccination centre makes it easier to cover the hamlets. It is easier to mobilise the people and bring them to the nearest school where the rooms have been converted into vaccinating area and observation rooms. The removal of vaccine hesitancy entailed discussions with tribal leaders who were first convinced of the medical efficacy and importance of taking the jab. “We requested them to motivate their respective community members and things are now in place for vaccinating the adivasis – mainly Jenu Kurubas and Soligas - spread across Kollegal, Yelandur and Chamarajanagar taluks’’, said Mr. Ravi. Their general reluctance to take the jab stemmed from their way of life and the adivasis argued that as they are isolated and dispersed in remote areas with hardly any contact with the outside world, the chances of contracting the virus was remote. But despite their relative isolation no hamlet is completely cut off from the taluks and district headquarters nor is the interaction non-existent and hence the tribals were prevailed upon to take the jab in their own interest and safety. Apart fromthe adivasis, the district administration has identified nearly 25,000 women belonging to various self-help groups and above 45 years of age who were yet to take the vaccination. They too are being covered and the anganwadi workers and the staff from the Department of Women and Child Welfare are overseeing the vaccination drive. The women in the target age group will be brought to the nearest anganwadi centres or the health sub-centres and inoculated, said the Deputy Commissioner. In a bid to increase the vaccination coverage, all the five APMC markets in Chamarajanagar district have been identified as vaccination centres. They begin functioning from 7 a.m. when farmers, traders, retailers and wholesale dealers converge at the market and those above 45 are being given the jab. Each APMC market has an office and the authorities have taken over a portion of it to convert one part into a vaccination room and another portion into observation room. A doctor and a nurse have been deployed at all the places and an ambulance is also stationed to handle any emergency. Another group in focus is the teaching community and 1,900 teachers above 45 years are yet to receive the vaccination. They are expected to be covered within the next 4 to 5 days, according to Mr. Ravi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/adivasis-counselled-for-vaccine-reluctance/article34389722.ece

According to a public notice issued by the BBMP’s Rajarajeshwarinagar Medical Officer of Health on Thursday, Venkatesh (Mallathaalli UPHC) and Naresh and Pavan (Yeshwantpur UPHC) were allegedly accepting bribes from citizens to issue COVID-19 negative reports. Health officials have filed complaints with the jurisdictional police. ‘Services free of cost’ BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said complaints have been received from citizens about middlemen fleecing them for tests and vaccination. “The BBMP is providing all services, right from conducting RT-PCR test to vaccination, free of cost. Citizens need not pay for any service,” he clarified. This is not the first time that PHC staff have been caught tampering with the testing process. Earlier in April, two BBMP contract employees at a PHC in Kodigehalli were suspended for manipulating COVID-19 testing kits. They were allegedly sending swabs to laboratories without actually taking any nasal or oral samples, said police officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/3-swab-collectors-caught-for-tampering/article34389562.ece

Though most industries function on Saturdays, several managements have decided to stop work on the day on account of the curfew being in place till May 4. In lieu, they have asked workers to compensate for the shutdown by working some other day or adjust from their leaves, which has caused resentment. Trade union sources said that while the guidelines issued by the Chief Secretary on Tuesday are clear about smooth functioning of industrial activities during the curfew period, managements insist on shutting down. This has been reported in Jigani-Anekal, Peenya and Bommasandra industrial areas. “It is against rules to force employees to trade their leave or work some other day,” said sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/confusion-in-industries/article34389560.ece

Sudhakaran on Thursday. One such poster, which was found pasted on a poll campaign material of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), called Mr. Sudhakaran a “traitor.” It further stated that martyrs would not forgive him. Posters against the Minister were also found on the compound wall of the CPI(M) area committee office and on the building wall. The posters were later removed by party workers. CPI(M) area secretary A. Omanakuttan said the party had filed a police complaint demanding to bring all those behind the act before law. Last week, the wife of his former personal staff member lodged a police complaint alleging the Minister’s remarks in a press conference here on April 11 were damaging to womanhood and could provoke communal tension. It has been alleged that the complaint was the result of “growing factional feud” in the party’s district unit.

High Court Registrar (District Judiciary) P.G. Ajithkumar has ordered the subordinate courts not to allow crowding inside court halls or on court premises under any circumstances. Presiding offices have been directed to ensure that only a minimum number of persons attend the court at a time. The court may reduce the number of cases in the cause list and give time slots for each case or split the posting of cases in the morning and afternoon for regulating the number of persons present. Besides examination of witnesses, other court proceedings may be done through videoconferencing if possible. Priority to old cases A reasonable number of witnesses shall alone be summoned on a particular day. Priority should be given to old cases and those wherein time-bound disposal is prescribed by higher courts. Examination of witnesses through videoconferencing can be done wherever possible following the guidelines. The courts shall ensure physical distancing norms inside the courts and on verandas by arranging seats, and also ensure strict compliance with the directives issued by the Centre and State governments from time to time. The presence of parties shall be insisted only if necessary, and the party voluntarily coming to court will be allowed entry only if he/she carries a letter issued by his/her counsel stating that his/her presence in courts on that day is very essential.

23 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Stop Thrissur Pooram fireworks: Rajan Gurukkal||“It is unfortunate that the organisers of Thrissur Pooram have refused to do away with the fireworks that normally produce noise exceeding 140 decibels despite reducing the event to the basic rituals in view of the pandemic situation,” Rajan Gurukkal P.M., historian and Vice Chairman of the Kerala State Higher Education Council, has said. “The standard noise level set by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for the ambient environment is 60 decibels during daytime and 50 decibels during night to avert consequences of atmospheric contamination, aerosol pollution, and health hazards derived from crackers made up of harmful chemicals producing poisonous gases when burnt,” he said. Reminding that the World Health Organization has warned that noise pollution exceeding 85 decibels can have adverse health impacts, Prof. Gurukkal said it could damage hearing, aggravate cardiovascular disorders, induce heart attack, upset respiratory rhythm, seriously impact pregnant women, disturb the nervous system, and cause cognitive impairment in children. Stating that the pooram pyrotechnics by all means exceeded the carrying capacity of both the health and environment, Prof. Gurukkal said Thrissur could not ignore the serious health hazards inevitable in fireworks, especially with nearly eight major hospitals located in the surrounding area. “It is high time environmentalists, doctors, and the enlightened public campaigned against the life threatening practice. The honourable Supreme Court has to interfere with the violation of the precautionary principle and rights under Article 21 and assert the right to life over merry making under the feigned excuse of rituals,” he said. Prof. Gurukkal said banning potential crackers causing noise above 85 decibels does not infringe the religious freedom. “While the world has turned by and large to eco-friendly alternatives like the colourful drone light shows and digital spectacle, it is uncivilised to continue fireworks, life threatening, not only to humans but to birds and animals too,” he said.  Banning potential crackers causing noise above 85 decibels does not infringe religious freedom||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stop-thrissur-pooram-fireworks-rajan-gurukkal/article34389843.ece

In one incident, a man was found hanging from the second Goshree bridge, while the body of an unidentified man, seemingly in his 40s, was swept along the shore near DP World at Vallarpadam. In another incident, a woman died after reportedly jumping into the water from the same bridge. The man found hanging was identified as Vijayan, 62, of Ward 11 in Mulavukad. He had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Wednesday evening. It is not clear whether the victim was aware of the result or not. Even as the police and fire force were lowering the body around 10.30 a.m. a woman jumped off the same bridge. She was later identified as Briyona Mariyo, 26, of Pallippuram.

Road. The detailed project report (DPR) for the initiative will be ready before June. It will then be forwarded to the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), following which a meeting will be held with MLAs representing Ernakulam and Thrikkakara. Officials on Thursday inspected the premises of the Thammanam market and the nearby narrow junction and took stock of the need to straighten curves in the corridor leading to Pullepady. Officials of the KRFB, corporation works standing committee chairperson Sunitha Dixon, councillors George Nanat and Zakir Thammanam, and the civic body’s executive engineer inspected the stretch. Stakeholders are keen to straighten all curves on the stretch, considering the spree of fatal accidents at the curve near the Elamkulam metro station on SA Road during the past year, it is learnt. Meanwhile, the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) is under fire for not restoring the 1-km-long stretch from Kathrikadavu to Karanakodam it had dug up in January to lay pipelines. “The KWA has been directed to restore the stretch in a week, since motorists and pedestrians are having a harrowing time,” official sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dpr-on-road-development-before-june/article34389683.ece

Thankfully, only two of the staff members who incidentally chose not to vaccinate have been infected. All the rest have received at least one dose of vaccination, which the prison sources felt is turning out to be a formidable defence against the pandemic.

It also asked the Centre to urgently implement a free universal vaccination programme using public funds. “The Kerala government’s stance on the issue is worth emulating, and the Centre should do that,” it said. As per the new policy, vaccine manufacturers are obliged to give just 50% of the vaccine at restricted prices to the Centre, while they are at liberty to sell the remaining 50% to States and in the open market at a price of its choice. The Centre has not given any funds to States for this purpose, either. This will force States and private hospitals to compete in the market to procure vaccines. It will also result in sale of vaccines in black market. The net result will be that a large section of the population that is incapable of buying vaccines will be left to fend for themselves, the KSSP said, adding that such a development would blunt the fight against the pandemic. It asked the Centre to provide necessary support to vaccine manufacturers in the public sector in order to ramp up production of vaccines domestically.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/withdraw-new-vaccination-policy-kssp/article34389685.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran also directed the interview board to conduct the review in a month with due diligence, particularly with respect to his certificate of experience and degree certificate from the National Institute of Personal Management (NIPM). The court ordered that if Mr. Panicker’s candidature was found untenable, then consequential action should be taken by KMRL without delay. The directive came on a writ petition filed by C. Arockiaswamy of Tamil Nadu, a candidate for the post. According to him, Mr. Panicker, ranked first, did not have the required qualifications and experience. The petitioner pointed out that Mr. Panicker had only an experience of 19 years and 10 months in the human resource field, instead of 20 years as prescribed by the metro agency. On the handwritten certificate produced by Mr. Panicker from a hotelier, the court noted that reputed concerns never issued handwritten experience certificates.

Sources said that many of those who came to the vaccination centres early in the morning had their second dose due. They had hoped to get spot registration done and did not bother about checking the portal. Some of them claimed that they had not seen or read about the new rules. When complaints were raised, health officials were seen quickly pasting posters announcing the information on the premises. Some others, mainly senior citizens, complained that they were not able to register themselves with the portal. There were a few who were apprehensive if the vaccine stock would run short by the time they get the appointment for vaccination.Health Department sources, however, said the process was more or less streamlined later as fresh stock of vaccines had already arrived. Primary health centres, community health centres, and taluk hospitals could vaccinate between 100 and 250 people, respectively. ‘Norms flouted’ Meanwhile, the authorities were accused of flouting their own rules and holding mega vaccination camps and testing drives which led to a spike in fresh COVID-19 cases. Damodaran Kozhenchery, member of Red Cross Society, alleged in his complaint to the District Disaster Management Authority that uncontrollable crowd was seen at the mega camps held within Mukkom municipality limits on April 19 and 20. He claimed that around 600 people each had thronged these camps held at 10 centres. Physical-distancing norms were not followed, and the police were found to be helpless, he alleged. According to an earlier official order, not more than 200 people could attend a public event. Mr. Damodaran also alleged that though the government reduced this limit to 75 people on April 20, around 200 people each had attended a COVID testing camp and a vaccination camp held simultaneously at the community health centre, Mukkom. He sought action against officials under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, 2020, and sections of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccination-continues-despite-early-hiccups-in-kozhikode/article34389280.ece

Station House Officers from some of the rural police stations said the cameras would be used mainly to cover town areas and keep an eye on protocol violations. Such aerial surveillance measures taken last year at the time of the COVID outbreak were very effective to track violators with strong digital evidence, they said. Officials from the Thamarassery police station said they had already conducted multiple inspections to track violations within their station limits. Collected visuals from various spots would be examined in detail soon to identify violators and take legal action, they said. In Kozhikode city, aerial surveillance measures would be intensified by covering all the major tourism spots, including beach destinations. Premises of major markets, bus stands, malls, and micro containment zones would also be brought under surprise inspections. A trained team has already been appointed for the purpose within various station limits. Apart from drone surveillance, visuals from closed circuit television cameras connected to the police control room would be used to take stringent action against protocol violations.

Although the initial estimation of the contraband was 1,000 kg, excise officials clarified here on Thursday that the seized ganja weighed 761 kg. “Still this is the biggest seizure from a vehicle in the State. We have made several seizures from godowns and other places, but not so much from a vehicle,” said Excise Deputy Commissioner Shaji S. Rajan. The ganja in packets of two kg each was found stacked in secret chambers in the truck. It was reportedly brought from Visakhapatnam for wholesale distribution in Kerala. The truck was heading for Ernakulam. An excise team led by Mr. Rajan arrested three persons: Fayas and Badusha from Melattur, and Jishnu from Kattappana. Acting on a tip-off, the excise team laid its hands on one of the biggest drug rackets in the State. Those arrested were involved in transporting the drugs from the ganja fields in Andhra Pradesh to a wholesale distributor in Kochi. Mr. Rajan said they had information about the kingpin of the racket. The excise team was monitoring the movements of those involved. Valued at Rs. 95 crore The seized ganja is valued at Rs. 95 crore. In the post-COVID-19 scenario, local distributors are selling small packets weighing eight gm of ganja for about Rs. 1,000. Youngsters who lost jobs during the lockdown necessitated by the pandemic have increasingly turned to bulk transport of ganja from Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Although illegal and dangerous, the easy and quick money involved in the trade has attracted several youngsters into ganja business. All the three arrested from Walayar on Wedesday night were youngsters. The profit of ganja business is roughly 10 to 12 times the investment. It costs Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 10,000 a kg at ganja fields in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. A cheaper variety of ganja is available for Rs. 5,000 a kg as well. Keralites involved in ganja trade based in Idukki shifted their focus to Andhra Pradesh following a crackdown in Idukki a few years ago. Sources said some Malayalis were now directly involved in the cultivation of ganja in some Maoist infested areas in the south-eastern States.

District Collector Narasimhugari Tej Lohit Reddy has issued strict directions to the tahsildars, village officers and secretaries of the 11 local bodies through which the path passes to take immediate action to reclaim the encroached land. Revenue Divisional Officers (RDO) in Thiruvalla and Adoor have been tasked with coordinating the evacuation process and evaluating its progress on a daily basis. The RDOs are required to submit their final report by May 5. In case of a dispute over an encroachment, the Deputy Director of Survey and the Taluk Surveyor should inspect the site, mark the puramboku land and file a report along with the sketch, said the Collector. The village officers, at the same time, should examine each of the cases and submit a report by detailing the steps taken to evacuate the encroachment. The Public Works Department should evacuate the encroachments on the locations under its possession. The authorities have identified 259 encroachments along the traditional path across six villages in Kozhencherry taluk, besides 115 encroachments across five villages in Ranni. In March this year, the Kerala High Court had issued a strict direction to clear these encroachments by May 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thiruvabharanam-path-land-to-be-reclaimed/article34389305.ece

23 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Fresh doses to boost vaccination drive||The district can heave a sigh of relief with the arrival of an additional batch of COVID-19 vaccine doses late Thursday. A consignment of 2.5 lakh doses has been allocated for the Thiruvananthapuram region comprising Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, and Alappuzha districts. While the district is likely to get 30,000 doses initially, official sources said up to 65,000 doses could be expected. Following a lull caused by an acute shortage of vaccine doses, the vaccination programme is set to be on track with the health authorities scheduling the drive across 108 centres in the district on Friday. Barring three hospitals that will provide Covaxin, all the others will administer Covishield. These include 47 public institutions and 58 private hospitals. 600 doses a day Notably, the Jimmy George indoor stadium, which has functioned as a mega vaccination centre, will rejoin the drive three days after the programme was suspended there owing to the paucity of vaccine. However, spot registration will no longer be entertained there with the government insisting on online bookings. Moreover, the vaccination drive at the stadium could be restricted to around 600 doses a day to prevent crowding. The venue has earlier seen around 1,800 people getting inoculated in a day.  On Thursday, General Hospital (GH) witnessed some disorder when a large number of people queued up hoping to get registered on the spot for the vaccine. Despite having waited outside the hospital’s COVID-19 vaccination centre from 5.30 a.m., they were informed of the decision to restrict vaccines to online registrees only by 8.30 a.m This led to tension with many senior citizens venting their ire on healthcare workers. Soon, the police streamlined the crowd by sending off those who had not booked online. A total of 2,931 vaccine doses were administered in the district on the day. Among those who received the vaccine, 1,704 were vaccinated with Covishield and 1,227 with Covaxin. Those who got the second doses include 712 front-line workers and 634 others who are aged above 45 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-doses-to-boost-vaccination/article34389308.ece
23 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Shortage triggers blame game||The shortage of COVID-19 vaccines has triggered a political blame game in the State. It has stoked public anger and caused the Centre and the State to wrangle over the pricing and sourcing of the drug. For once, the ruling LDF and the Opposition UDF were on the same page. Both said that the onus was on the Centre to provide the vaccine free of cost to States to halt an aggressive second wave of infections. On Thursday, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala appeared to back Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's demand that the Centre ensured an adequate supply of vaccine doses to retard the pandemic, prevent further loss of life and save States from economic devastation. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Chennithala echoed Mr. Vijayan's sentiment that the State could ill afford to supply vaccines free to its residents. The Centre should underwrite the cost. Meanwhile, LDF supporters launched a social media campaign with the hashtag “vaccine challenge.” It aimed at raising contributions to the Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund to purchase vaccines. However, some viewed this as a dig at the Centre's alleged reluctance to supply the doses free to States. Mr. Vijayan said the campaign raised Rs. 22 lakh on Thursday alone. He highlighted it as a manifestation of the State’s unity. The CPI(M) said the Centre had upended India's free and universal vaccination regime by allowing private players to hike the price and dominate the supply of COVID-19 vaccines. ‘Constitutional violation’ The Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad said the Centre had urged States to procure vaccines at the market price fixed by manufacturers. It violated the constitutional obligation to ensure free and universal vaccination.  BJP State president K. Surendran accused the government of attempting to scapegoat the Centre for its shortcomings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shortage-triggers-blame-game/article34389324.ece

In the past few days, the Thiruvananthapuram Rural police have mobilised a large force for enforcement of protocol. The District Police Chief has deployed around 10 teams to assist the local police in enforcement. According to Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), Thiruvananthapuram Range, Sanjaykumar Gurudin, patrolling has been stepped up in the inter-State border areas, market places and beaches that witness crowding. Having taken stock of the situation in places such as Balaramapuram and Parassala, Mr. Gurudin issued directives to ensure proper physical distancing at markets. Monitoring committees comprising traders have also been roped in for crowd management. Drones and CCTV cameras are being utilised at the inter-State border points to keep track of vehicle movement. The police are screening incoming vehicles and entry is permitted to only those passengers who produce passes obtained from the e-Jagratha portal. RT-PCR reports However, citing impracticality, the police have not been insisting on RT-PCR reports, since a large number of people travel to and from Kanyakumari for jobs and other purposes daily. Anticipating resistance towards attempts to enforce the COVID-19 norms, the DIG cautioned police officers against harassment or misbehaviour that could antagonise the local populace. Efforts are being made to sensitise people to the necessity to adopt precautions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/increased-police-presence-on-city-outskirts/article34389834.ece
23 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Impose curfew on counting day: IMA||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has called for stringent measures such as micro-containment and curfew for the next two weeks, which, it says, is a crucial period when COVID-19 disease transmission will intensify. It was total laxity on the part of everyone in observing COVID-19 protocols during the poll campaigning in March, which has primarily resulted in the large-scale spread of the disease. In the light of this, the government has to strictly ensure that no celebrations or victory parades are conducted on the counting day on May 2, IMA leaders said at a press conference here on Thursday. They demanded that a curfew-like condition be imposed ahead of the counting day. ‘Situation very grave’ It reminded the public that the situation was quite grave and that already the occupancy of hospital beds and ICUs was rising in an alarming way. The State can in no way afford to have a situation wherein people would gather, leading to further disease transmission, it pointed out. The IMA appealed to the people to avoid all kind of festival gatherings such as Poorams or Iftar parties, which could lead to increased disease transmission. The IMA also appealed to the government to streamline vaccine supply and vaccination processes so that people do not crowd at vaccination centres. It would be dangerous if such places become disease dissemination centres, it said. Calls for more testing It demanded that COVID testing be increased to conduct one lakh tests daily so that more infectious people could be isolated. The IMA pointed out that it was the emergence of mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2 which has intensified disease transmission and that the State needed to conduct more scientific studies to generate molecular evidence in support of this theory. It was important from the clinical point of view to understand what doctors were dealing with. Despite persistent demands by the IMA for clinical data sharing during the first wave, the government had not responded adequately. It was disappointing that the State had not done any kind of clinical or academic research on COVID in the State, State secretary of the IMA P. Gopikumar and vice president N. Sulphi said.

Tourism Samrakshana Samithi, an umbrella body of 20 organisations, will observe Labour Day Statewide this time by wearing black masks. A social media campaign #SaveTourism too will be launched. Even entities generating some revenue out of tourism are in dire straits. Tourism has been a mainstay of the Kerala economy, generating Rs. 44,000 crore annually and providing 15 lakh jobs. However, the sector has been struggling in the past 14 months, the samithi says. Travel restrictions The second wave of COVID-19 has led the administration to impose further travel restrictions. Samithi convener Sudheesh Kumar says its demands include providing Rs. 5,000 a month to the jobless, a package aiding the workers involved in tourism, exemption from taxes and fees for tourist vehicles and houseboats, and moratorium on tax arrears. An immediate financial package of Rs. 250 crore to support the tourism workers, a financial aid as loan worth Rs. 2,500 crore through the Kerala Bank and restructuring of all bank loans in the tourism sector are the other demands. The organisation has also sought easing of restrictions on tourist movements and a 24-month moratorium on GST.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tourism-forums-gear-up-to-observe-black-day-on-may-1/article34389314.ece

The KGMOA, in its letter to the Chief Secretary, had pointed out that the augmented RT-PCR testing without adequate facilities was resulting in a delay of several days for results. Even the results of the first round of mass testing were not fully out. Other than voluntary isolation, there was no way the health system could ensure that the person who underwent the COVID test did not mingle with others till the results were out. The delay in obtaining test results led to the a dangerous situation of the tested individuals freely moving, spreading disease among the community. Target groups The KGMOA suggested that considering these limitations, testing be limited to selected target groups, symptomatic persons and their primary contacts. However, the Chief Minister and the Health Minister took exception to the statement. Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said mass testing to isolate as many infectious people as possible from the community was a scientific decision taken by the government and the expert committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kgmoa-letter-on-testing-irks-govt/article34389327.ece

23 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Scared of uncertain future, the elderly turn to temples||Valli Mutthu (67) of Nagari municipality had lost her job at half a dozen households as a maid during the lockdown induced by coronavirus last year. She just resumed her work in a few houses in November last year, after the infection started subsiding and the situation eased a little. Before she could put her life in order, Ms. Valli Mutthu lost her jobs again as the second wave of the pandemic came in the first week of April. The spurt in COVID cases has left many elderly people a bundle of nerves. Reports of those died of the virus getting ‘orphan-like’ funeral by the staff of the civic bodies, shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and blackmarketing of life-saving drugs and hefty hospital bills have left them shaken. Scared of their uncertain future, they find themselves a mere spent force and turn to listening to bhajans and puranas for solace. Many of the elderly people are now seen at local temples, offering prayers, and spending time by doing bhajans and listening to puranas. Such scenes are become common in suburban areas along the Chittoor-Tamil Nadu border, which is reeling under the impact of the second wave. ‘A burden’ “I came to Nagari from Chennai three decades ago after my husband’s death. The families who knew me well now find me a pariah. They think I am a potential carrier of the virus. I find solace in small temples now. I eat whatever little I can find once or twice a day. I spend time by listening to bhajans and religious discourses,” she says. Parameshwaraiah (72), who retired as a peon of a government office in Puttur says he has none to turn to in case of any emergency. “After my wife’s death a decade ago, I have been treated as a burden by his son’s family. I have to give away a big chunk of my pension to them. They don’t talk to me much. I am vexed with life. I find several likes of me visiting temples and praying. I join them. We chit chats on puranas and the latest news on the pandemic,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/scared-of-uncertain-future-the-elderly-turn-to-temples/article34389768.ece

23 April 2021||Kozhikode,ANDHRA PRADESH||Saritha Nair again taken into custody||The Kasaba police on Thursday arrested Saritha S. Nair, one of the accused in the solar cheating case, following a warrant issued by the Kozhikode Judicial First Class Magistrate Court. She was taken into custody from her house in Thiruvananthapuram in the morning. The arrest was recorded as she did not appear before the court for final hearing even after issuing multiple warrants. She was later produced before the Kozhikode Judicial First Class Magistrate Court III and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. The allegation against Saritha, the second accused in the case, was that she cheated Kozhikode-based industrialist Abdul Majeed and secured Rs. 42.7 lakh after promising him franchises in solar panel and windmill farm companies in 2012. It was the first cheating case registered in connection with the solar scam. Though the verdict of this case was expected on March 26, the court had adjourned it in the absence of the accused at the final hearing. According to sources, there were attempts on the part of Saritha, along with Biju Radhakrishnan, the first accused in the case, for “out of court settlement” and escape from legal proceedings. She had reportedly paid back a portion of the money she had secured from the industrialist. Charges against police There were allegations against the police that they were delaying the arrest of Saritha in many other similar cheating cases following the “out of court” settlement efforts on her part.

It was in December, 2013 that the chargesheet against the accused was submitted in the court. The trial began in 2016.

23 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala slams Centre on vaccine shortage||Telangana Municipal Minister K.T. Rama Rao has lashed out at the dual pricing policy of vaccination of the Central government saying: “One Nation – Two different Vaccine Prices?” In a tweet with hashtag #SabkaSaathSabkoVaccine, he said “We agreed for One Nation – One Tax (GST) and why is it that there are two prices for the vaccine in the country. Why should the vaccine be supplied at Rs. 150 for Government of India and at Rs. 400 for State governments,” he asked. Why can’t the Centre subsume the additional cost from PM CARES and help rapid vaccination across India, he asked. The dual price policy announced by the Centre received sharp criticism with the netizens lashing out at the Prime Minister saying he is insensitive to people’s issues. The national leadership should realise that the States are already under financial stress due to last year’s lockdown and the lockdown staring at them with spike in COVID-19 cases. Mr. Rao, however, said the Telangana government was committed to vaccinate all its frontline workers and tweeted that the frontline workers in the Municipal Administration Department are being taken care of. “Percentage of vaccination in 141 Municipalities is 95.55% and in GHMC it is 96.19%. Striving for cent percent at the earliest,” he tweeted. According to NGOs and private hospitals, the prices of oxygen have increased by at least 500%-600%. Before the second wave of the pandemic, a bulk cylinder used to cost Rs. 300-Rs. 400. Now, it is being sold for Rs. 3,000 in Warangal. Yet, finding it has become a problem because of scarcity. While the demand is high, supply is less. Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender said that some people were creating artificial scarcity and selling it in the black market, but government officials have kept a vigil on it. A.P. reviews situation In Mangalagiri, Andhra Pradesh Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas said they had discussed the steps needed to bring down the number of cases and maintain adequate supply of oxygen, and vaccination.

On the oxygen supply, the Minister said it was in line with the current requirement of 360 tonnes, and that there was no problem for government hospitals.

Meetings were fully shifted to virtual mode from Monday. New measures Thiruvananthapuram is home to three major units of the space agency — Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) at Thumba, Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) at Valiyamala, and the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU) at Vattiyurkavu.

Sanitiser dispensers have been deployed all over the campus,” a VSSC official said. The VSSC has around 4,700 staff plus contract employees, trainees, and security personnel. Similar measures are in place at the LPSC, which has around 1,000 staff and the IISU, which has 300 employees.

Thakur on Thursday directed the officials to rework on the schedules of bus operations based on the dwindling number of people opting for public transport in view of the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Thakur reviewed the issues arising out of the spurt in positive cases, and directed the officials to alter the operation schedules with focus on key issues such as cost of operation and occupancy ratio.

He also said that the arrears due for payment to the retired employees would be paid on April 27 and 30. Mr. Thakur asked the Regional Managers and Depot Managers to ensure that their respective offices and bus stands strictly followed the COVID protocols. “Ensure that people wear masks, maintain physical distance, and maintain hand-washing hygiene,” he said. Vaccination They should also ensure that the officers and staff aged above 45 were administered the vaccine, he said. They should also inform them about the government’s decision to inoculate all people aged above 18 from May 1. The Regional Managers should monitor the process of vaccination to the staff and distribute double-layered masks to all the employees. Mr. Thakur said the bus crew should ensure COVID-appropriate behaviour of the commuters. Employees who had contracted the virus would be granted 14 days special casual leave for the quarantine period, he added. Mr. Thakur also directed the officials to focus on revenue-generating models such as identifying RTC properties that could be leashed for construction of petrol pumps.

The Minister wanted the oxygen production to be increased to meet the imminent spurt in demand, while the total gas allocated to the State by the Centre stood at 440 metric tonnes per day. The actual supply was 340 MT. Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have equal share in the 200 MT of oxygen produced at VSP as per the allocation made by the Centre, Director of Industries J.V.N. Subramanyam told the Minister at a review meeting on oxygen produced in the industrial sector. Mr. Subramanyam said a major portion of oxygen was produced at VSP, Ellenbarrie Industrial Gases Ltd. (EIGL) in Visakhapatnam and Liquinox Gases Pvt. Ltd (LGPL) at Pydibhimavaram in Srikakulam district. Andhra Pradesh gets 100 MT from Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, 60 MT from LGPL and 40 MT from EIGL. A part of the oxygen requirement is met by supplies from Odisha, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some other areas. The Minister said the State had a maximum requirement of 516 MT of oxygen per day for 26,000 beds in hospitals. During the first wave of COVID in 2020, 300 MT of oxygen was consumed daily. Principal Secretary (Home) Kumar Vishwajeet and other top officials of Industries and other line departments were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-geared-up-to-meet-growing-oxygen-demand/article34389765.ece
23 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘SSC, Inter exams being held to avoid problems for students’||Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh on Thursday took objection to the TDP leader Nara Lokesh’s criticism of the government decision to go ahead with the conduct of the 10th Class and Intermediate exams. At a press conference, Mr. Suresh said a lot of thought had gone into the decision to hold the examinations. Last year, the students who had lost their academic year had been facing serious academic problems due to the government’s inability to conduct 10th class exams. “We did not want a repeat of the situation this year,” said the Minister. Mr. Suresh also objected to the language used by the TDP leader against the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. He said the student community in the State was happy with the welfare schemes introduced by the government as part of reforms in the education sector. As a result, government schools had witnessed nearly 4.5 lakh additional enrolments this academic year. He accused Mr. Lokesh of trying to create a fear psychosis among students by making exaggerated statements that 70 lakh students would contract the virus if the examinations were held. The government was sensitive to the problems of students in these difficult times and it had been doing all it could to ensure their health safety even while trying to reach out to them and impart lessons in some mode or the other. Last year also, the department could conduct SSC exams but was forced to cancel the supplementary tests in view of the rapid spread of the virus. Explaining the measures initiated by the government for the safety of students, the Minister said it was unfair on the part of the TDP leader to sit in Hyderabad and criticise the government. COVID protocol was being strictly followed in the government schools and colleges but there were reports of violations in some private educational institutions. He said managements of such institutions would be punished.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ssc-inter-exams-being-held-to-avoid-problems-for-students/article34389776.ece
23 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Atchannaidu seeks aid for pvt. school teachers||Telugu Desam Party State president Kinjarapu Atchannaidu has written a letter to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy alleging the government’s ‘negligence towards private school teachers in providing them with a COVID relief package’. In the letter on Thursday, Mr. Atchannaidu said that the private teachers and non-teaching staff who had lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic should be supported by giving a monthly stipend of Rs. 10,000. He also appealed to the government to provide interest-free loan from banks and employment opportunities in the form of outsourced staff in public sector companies. As schools were closed many private school teachers were facing difficulties due to lack of salaries. Some of them had become vegetable sellers, cobblers and construction workers to make a living. The government had failed miserably in supporting them, he said. “It is unfortunate that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy lacks focus on education system. Telangana government distributes 25 kg of rice along with Rs. 2,000 a month to support private teachers. Other States are also aiding them in some way. But in Andhra Pradesh, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy is acting as if nothing has happened,” Mr. Atchannaidu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/atchannaidu-seeks-aid-for-pvt-school-teachers/article34389771.ece

23 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Morphing case: HC asks Devineni to appear before CID on April 29||Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court Justice R. Raghunandan Rao on Thursday directed former Minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao to appear before the CID on April 29 for questioning in connection with the alleged morphed video of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, which he had shown at a press conference in Tirupati recently. In the same vein, Justice Raghunandan Rao ordered that no coercive steps be taken against Mr. Umamaheswara Rao till the next hearing on May 7. Mr. Umamaheswara Rao was accused of displaying a video in which Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had purportedly made a comment that “any cardiology specialist, or any individual who completed higher studies, wishes to live in Hyderabad, Bengaluru or Delhi, but not in Odisha, Bihar or Tirupati.” YSRCP Kurnool district legal cell president N. Narayana Reddy had lodged a complaint that the video was created from two different sources, including certain remarks made by the Chief Minister on his vision for healthcare in the State, and the outcome of his discussions in New Delhi on various issues. The complainant said two genuine videos were morphed to create a false impression. Justice Rao dismissed the petitioner’s argument that Advocate General S. Sriram could not appear in the matter in place of the regular prosecutor as the A-G insisted that Section 302 of the CrPC enabled him to prosecute any criminal case without prior permission of the court. The plea that Mr. Narayana Reddy had no locus standi was also refuted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/morphing-case-hc-asks-devineni-to-appear-before-cid-on-april-29/article34389778.ece
23 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Glitches in CoWIN hold up second dose for many||Glitches in the functioning of the CoWIN app foiled the plans of the district administration to smoothly execute the administration of the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine (both Covishield and Covaxin) here on Thursday. “Registration for the second dose was supposed to begin at 7.30 a.m., and we reached the session site at Swarna Bharati Indoor Stadium at 6.30 a.m. However, the app did not function till 10.30.a.m.,” a government employee said. She said the vaccines reached the centre at around 9.30 a.m., at least two hours behind schedule, and that she had to wait for six hours to get the jab. Many complained that the drive was not organised systematically and people, including senior citizens, had to wait for long hours for the inoculation. “The idea to have a special drive exclusively for those taking the second dose was good. However, the planning left a lot to be desired. Due to the rush of people and lack of social distancing norms, many like me got scared and left the venue,” a senior professor from Andhra University said. Authorities should deploy more police personnel, increase the number of registration counters, deploy more staff on the ground both for vaccinating and checking the post-vaccination status and focus on better functioning of computers and apps, said a senior citizen who had to wait for three hours for the second jab, at a centre in China Waltair. More vaccines to come To meet the demands of people who were due for their second dose, the district received nearly 40,000 doses, including 32,000 Covishield vials, and had organised a special drive. “For administering Covishield, we have opened up 180 vaccine centres, including all PHCs, across the district. For Covaxin, we had opened up seven exclusive centres,” Collector V. Vinay Chand said. According to him, the flow of vaccines is now being done in batches varying from 30,000 to 50,000 doses and the best way for mass vaccination is by organising drives. It is learnt that the district will be receiving 50,000 doses by Saturday, and another vaccination drive for people aged above 45 (first timers) will be organised. A senior officer from the district administration said that awareness on vaccines has picked up which is leading to a rush at session sites. “We are working to streamline the systems to avoid delays,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/glitches-in-cowin-hold-up-second-dose-for-many/article34389894.ece
23 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Activists urge villagers to oppose stone crusher unit||Activists urged residents of Sundarayyapeta panchayat to oppose the establishment of a stone crushing unit that is coming up within 364 m of a lake in their village. Sundarayyapeta panchayat is located in Kasimkota tehsil, 19 km from Anakapalle. The lake, which is known as Raju Gari Cheruvu, is the main source of irrigation for farmers in Sundarayyapeta, Atchiyyapeta and Mondipalem villages. The area where work is being done to set up the stone crusher unit is in the midst of agricultural fields and casuarina groves, and is a stone’s throw from the water body. Representatives of the All India Youth Forum (AIYF), A.P. Rythu Sangham, and All India Agricultural and Rural Labour Association (AIARLA) have appealed to the villagers not to allow the establishment of the unit, on the grounds that the dust generated would contaminate the water in the lake and destroy crops over a period of time. “A new panchayat road was laid from Sampathipuram to Venkupalem. It was built recently under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. This road will be destroyed within two years if heavy trucks ply on it. Anakapalle will be made a district headquarters sooner or later once a separate district is carved out of Visakhapatnam district. It should be protected from pollution for the benefit of posterity,” an activist said. The activists alleged that those who were setting up the stone crusher unit were violating environmental rules in the absence of resistance from the local people. The wondered whether the approval of the gram panchayat was taken, and whether a gram sabha and a public hearing were conducted as per statutory requirements. They called upon the local people to act before it was too late and submit a representation to the Joint Action Committee (JAC) to fight for justice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/activists-urge-villagers-to-oppose-stone-crusher-unit/article34389884.ece
23 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||VSP hunger strike enters 70th day||Relay hunger strikes being organised under the auspices of Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee continued for the 70th day on Thursday. Committee chairpersons D. Adinarayana and Mantri Rajasekhar said that though the Centre has decided to privatise Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), the public sector steel plant has come to the rescue of thousands of people at various places by supplying liquid medical oxygen. Though Maharashtra is an industrialised State, it does not have any oxygen plants, forcing it to depend on other States for its oxygen requirements, they said. “Private companies would be driven by profit motto unlike PSUs, which think of the community around them along with profits. This is the reason why PSUs have contributed to the growth of the region surrounding them and the buying power of the people,” they said. Committee convener Ayodhya Ram, co-conveners Gandham Venkata Rao and K. Satyanarayana said that the VSP agitation was getting support all over the State. They said that the agitation would be intensified if the Centre does not change its stance on VSP at least now. Visakha Ukku Porata Committee members Boddu Pydiraju, Gangadhar, Neelakantam, D. Pandey, Suribabu, M.N. Reddy, Srinivasu, Satyanarayana and Prabhakar were among those who participated. Meanwhile, the relay hunger strikes being organised at the Gandhi statue, near GVMC, entered the 21st day on Thursday. Addressing the gathering, AITUC district president Padala Ramana has warned that the Centre would be taught a lesson by the people if it doesn’t give up its plan to privatise VSP and other PSUs. The decision of the Centre to hand over PSUs to the corporate sector would be opposed tooth and nail, they said. Committee chairman M. Jaggu Naidu presided. CFTUI union representatives and VSP and Visakhapatnam Port employees participated in the hunger strike.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vsp-hunger-strike-enters-70th-day/article34389885.ece

Vinay Chand has warned private hospitals of severe legal action if they violate orders issued by the State government. At a review meeting with managements and coordinators of COVID-19 empanelled private hospitals, Mr. Vinay Chand said that a notification was issued by the government on Thursday categorising 40 private hospitals into ‘A’ and ‘B’.

Young migrant workers, some with their families occupy every available space on the open ground in front of the station near Platform 1. “There is a night curfew in Hyderabad. They may declare lockdown like last year. I want to go back before that happens,” said Rocky Singh, who drives a cab in the city and was waiting for the Raxaul Express that departs at 11.35 p.m. on Thursday. He was going to his hometown of Samastipur. There were dozens of other men sitting with their bags who did not have reservations but were expecting their friends to work out a solution. Entry into the railway station is restricted with the ticketing staff checking the tickets of passengers entering the platform. The State government is enforcing a night curfew in the State between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. till May 1 to check the spread of COVID-19 virus. Other north and east bound trains, too are packed. In the Howrah-bound Falaknuma Express, ticketing staff shooed away a large number of men who tried to board the second seating coach without valid tickets. “They are entering the platform by buying platform ticket and trying to board the trains. I sent them away from the coach near the engine and they tried to get into the coach near the guard’s cabin,” said a hassled SC Railway staffer. “The work has slowed down and our contractor said there is no work.

23 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre biased on oxygen, vials: Eatala||Though Telangana has placed an order for over 4 lakh vials of Remdesivir, the State was allotted only 21,551 vials of the anti-viral drug for 10 days (April 21-30). Health Minister Eatala Rajender, who set alarm bells ringing on crucial COVID-19 resources, lashed out at the Central government’s ‘discrimination’ in allotting vaccines and oxygen to the State. ‘Centre responsible’ Requesting procurement of oxygen from places near Telangana, he said that the Central government would be responsible for oxygen shortage in the State if they do not make changes in norms. During a press conference in the city on Thursday, he pointed out the problems with procurement of oxygen from faraway places in other States, why Hyderabad should not be seen as a place where patients only from Telangana get admitted, and other issues. He also pointed out to partiality towards Gujarat, and neglect towards Telangana. Remdesivir is manufactured by at least two companies in and around Hyderabad. Till Wednesday, the State was procuring it directly. Mr. Rajender said that the Central government had issued an order on April 21 stating that they would take control over Remdesivir injections, other vaccines and oxygen. “This is so saddening,” he said. Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan was informed of the issue, but there was no response. He said that while the State was allotted only 21,551 vials of Remdesivir, Gujarat was allotted 1.63 lakh vials, Maharashtra 2 lakh vials, 61,000 to Delhi, and 92,000 to Madhya Pradesh. 60-70% from other States Mr. Rajender said that around 60-70% of patients admitted in hospitals in Hyderabad were from other States. Usually, patients from Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Maharashtra get admitted to hospitals in the city. The Minister mentioned this to drive home the point that patients from various States get treated in the city, and meagre allocation of the antiviral drug or other resources would create a crisis. “We cannot impose a condition to admit patients only from our State. As the entire nation is in crisis, it is our responsibility to treat patients from everywhere. They should not face any issues. We placed order for 4 lakh vials of Remdesivir. I will write a letter to Union Health Minister,” he said. Currently, Telangana requires around 260-270 metric tonnes of oxygen per day, and the demand may go up to 350 metric tonnes per day, he said. Mr. Rajender said that oxygen was procured from other States, not from Telangana. Around 20 metric tonnes of oxygen is procured from Bellary, 30 more from Hospet, 20 from Chennai and 84 from Odisha. “Getting oxygen from places as far as 1,300 km is difficult. Special tankers are needed for that. We asked Dr. Harsh Vardhan to allocate oxygen from nearby places like Visakhapatnam, Sriperumbudur, and Bellary. If the Central government does not change its stance, it will have to take responsibility if there is any shortage,” he said. Vaccine crunch Shortage of COVID vaccines too, was pointed out at the presser. The Health Minister said that had vaccine production been increased, we would not have seen the shortage. He said that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had asked for increase in production. “Our suggestions were not considered,” he said, calling out varying prices of vaccines for Central and State governments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-biased-on-oxygen-vials-eatala/article34389657.ece
23 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP caught in a storm||Amid the COVID second wave resurgence, a huge internal turmoil is emerging out of the Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and threatens to remove the facade of unity and discipline in the party. Murmurs and social media chatter became public when party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar released a statement charging senior leaders N. Ramchander Rao and P. Shekar Rao of breaching discipline by meeting TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao in Pragati Bhavan to seek unanimous election for the son of Ramesh Goud from Lingojiguda division in Ranga Reddy district of GHMC. Whether the bypoll necessitated because of the death of Goud, before he could be sworn in due to Covid, will be held or not under the present public health crisis, the simmering differences among the top leadership is out in the open. A three-member fact-finding team constituted to look into the reasons why the two leaders along with the family of the deceased had to meet KTR “without informing the top leadership” faces an onerous task as the two leaders accused of ‘indiscipline’ are veterans with deep links in the party and the Sangh Parivar. If certain sections of the party are to be believed, the political drama is a tussle for supremacy between the city-based leaders — who always led the party, and the new leadership from the districts in the form of Mr. Sanjay Kumar plus the mix of caste and communities calculations. Since the party aims to dislodge TRS in the next elections, the power struggle too is inherent, they say. Having pulled off the Dubbaka byelection victory and leading the party’s spectacular performance in the GHMC polls which followed, the party State president has been riding high. His aggressive posturing has made the TRS leaders squirm and apparently, this issue came up during the “meeting” with KTR and it reached the president’s ears. The angry Karimnagar MP decided to go public with his displeasure catching many leaders off-guard. “I have been caught in an unintended crossfire. There is no question of crossing the party line as I went with the consent of the party leadership. I went as part of a delegation on humanitarian grounds with the family of the deceased leader. I feel this is a storm in a tea cup, but am ready to face any consequences,” said Mr. Ramchander Rao. “Whatever I had to say I have told the fact finding committee. Let them come out with their report, then I will react,” said Mr. Shekar Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-caught-in-a-storm/article34389673.ece
23 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||More curbs imposed on ULBs’ campaigning||The State Election Commission (SEC) has imposed more restrictions on the campaigning for elections to seven urban local bodies (ULBs) and also curtail the total period for electioneering by deciding to end it 72 hours before the end of polling schedule on April 30 or till 5 p.m. on April 27. The decisions were taken after reviewing the ongoing campaigning by political parties at a meeting held here on Thursday. The meeting was chaired by State Election Commissioner C. Parthasarathi, who observed that there were several instances of election meetings and campaigning wherein norms of social distancing, wearing of masks and others were flouted in blatant disregard to the guidelines issued by the Commission. “The Commission has taken a serious view of the repeated violations of the COVID-19 guidelines by star campaigners, political leaders and candidates who were supposed to scrupulously follow the norms. They have been grossly violating COVID-19 protocols there by exposing themselves as well as the public to the danger of infection”, Mr. Parthasarathi said. In view of unprecedented public health concerns, the Commission was of the considered view that the period of campaign needs to be curtailed in larger public interest and also to issue guidelines to be followed from now on, Commission Secretary M. Ashok Kumar said. Accordingly, it has been decided not to allow any rallies, public meetings, street plays and local meetings on any day during the days of campaign between 7 p.m. and 8 a.m. with effect from April 22. The silence period for rallies, public meetings, street plays, local meetings, bike rallies or any other gathering for campaign purposes would be extended to 72 hours before the end of the polling timings or from 5 p.m. on April 27. Other restrictions outlined for the remainder of the campaigning period by the SEC., including allowing a group of only five persons, including the candidate, but excluding the personal security officers, if any, of any of the five persons for the door-to-door campaigning following regular COVID-19 norms. During the road shows, the convoy of vehicles should be broken after every two vehicles, excluding the security vehicles, if any and the interval between two sets of convoy of vehicles should be at least 10 meters. Besides, there shall be at least half-an-hour gap between the road shows of two different political parties or candidates on the same route.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/more-curbs-imposed-on-ulbs-campaigning/article34389670.ece
23 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Procuring oxygen from faraway places a challenge||Procuring oxygen from places thousands of kilometres away from Telangana is fraught with risks that could hamper the supply, senior officials of the Health department said. They added that there could be multiple problems while procuring oxygen from Bhilai, Madhya Pradesh, which is 1,300 km in a two-way journey. “There could be problems in transportation if a lockdown is announced, or some other unforeseen issue,” the senior officials said. Besides, insufficient number of tankers to procure it is another problem, but that is being resolved. They said that around 305 metric tonnes of oxygen were being procured currently. But considering the severity of the COVID situation, around 400 metric tonnes of oxygen would be required in the State. This was communicated to the Union Ministry of Health, a few weeks ago. TS is supposed to get 360 metric tonnes of oxygen, which includes 125 from here and 235 from other States. But only around 180 to 190 MTs is being procured from outside sources. “Procuring oxygen from far away places has become a challenge. It takes three days to get oxygen from Bhilai, and we don’t have that kind of time in the peak of pandemic,” sources in the Health department said. Another source said that all means were being explored to get additional tankers. “Nitrogen tankers too, might be converted into oxygen tankers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/procuring-oxygen-from-faraway-places-a-challenge/article34389660.ece
23 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Bodies keep coming to cremation grounds||At 06:10 p.m. on Thursday, 12 bodies were in the process of being cremated at the COVID-designated ESI Cremation Grounds in Hyderabad. “12 bodies are being cremated in my shift. I cannot reveal information about how many bodies were burnt throughout the day as I am not authorised to speak,” said a staffer who keeps track of paperwork at the cremation ground. The number of bodies flowing in for cremations is such that workers at the cremation ground are clearing open space to carry out the funeral rites. The workers broke from the tradition of conducting funerals on the platforms which are numbered. The cremation ground has two locations where there are raised platforms where funerals are carried out. Three funerals were being carried out in the open ground behind the trees and shrubs. “There is a constant stream of ambulances and red funeral vans. Earlier, there used to be two or three funerals in a day. Now, I have stopped counting the number of bodies that are coming here,” said a juice vendor at the entrance of the funeral ground. According to Health Department bulletin, 23 persons lost their lives to COVID on April 21 across the State and 5,567 persons tested positive. There are three designated cremation grounds for Hindus at Amberpet, Bansilalpet and the ESI Cremation Ground.

23 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Oxygen shortage hits private hospitals in districts||Is shortage of oxygen supply haunting private hospitals? Yes was the answer from private hospitals. Initially, private hospitals declined to open up for corona treatment, they have made arrangement with allocating 50% of beds for corona treatment. As the number of corona cases is increasing, patients who can afford are approaching private hospitals for treatment. However, lack of supply of oxygen and medicines hit private hospitals hard. On Wednesday, some representatives of private hospitals in the district headquarters tried to meet the authorities and present their case. As it was a holiday, they spoke with Collector M Hanumantha Rao over phone who promised to address the issue in the next three days. “There is shortage of oxygen supply. Similarly, required medicine is not being supplied. We will be forced to close hospitals if the medicine and oxygen supply is not up to the requirement,” said one of the representatives of private hospitals. It was stated that about 2,000 litres of oxygen was required for private hospitals alone to meet the requirement. The pressure on medical staff, in both private and public sectors, has been considerably increasing. “There are three private medical colleges – MNR Medical College Hospital, TRR Medical College and Maheswara Medical College – that can handle about 1000 patients. The district hospital can treat about 400 and in area hospitals and private hospitals we can handle 1,500 to 2,000 patients. The only thing is, we have to handle manpower properly. We can treat patients at area hospitals at Zaheerabad, Patancheru and Narayanakhed with 100 beds,” said a doctor on condition of anonymity. “There are more than 20 ventilators kept unused in the government district hospital despite prevailing pandemic situation,” the doctor told The Hindu . “We are ready to handle as many patients as possible. Our problems were taken to the notice of Collector M. Hanumantha Rao who promised to address the issue,” Dr. Raju Goud of Sairam Hospitals said. Some private hospitals in Warangal have oxygen supply for two to three days only. Doctors said that some private hospitals have stopped taking more patients since they are running short of oxygen. However, Warangal Urban district authorities said that there was no dearth of the resource at government-run Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) Hospital and that one tanker each was received on Wednesday and Thursday for supply to government and private hospitals there and in the surrounding districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/oxygen-shortage-hits-private-hospitals-in-districts/article34389813.ece

23 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High Court seeks Finance Secretary’s appearance||Telangana High Court on Thursday directed the State Principal Finance Secretary to appear before it on June 3 if the government fails to accord sanction of finance assistance assured to an injured National Security Guard commando K. Sriramulu. The High Court, which had taken up a news report on the plight of the commando as PIL petition, took a serious note of government failing to fulfil the promise made to the commando. A division bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy deplored the inaction of the State government over the assurance given to the commando who served the nation. The fate of the former solider was hanging in balance from October 2018 to April 2021 due to the inaction of the government, the bench observed. The former NSG commando was an expert in defusing bombs and suffered serious injuries during the terror attack on Pathankot Air Force base in Punjab. The government counsel told the court that government already sanctioned 300 square yards of plot to the soldier and the file relating to financial assistance to build the house was pending with the Finance Department. Terming the contentions as most unacceptable, the Chief Justice directed the government to immediately sanction the assistance to the former NSG guard.  In a separate matter, the division bench headed by the Chief Justice took serious objection to the State government’s proposal of paying Rs. 5,000 honorarium to a retired judge heading the Appellate Authority for Telangana State Pollution Control Board. “Do you (State government) think that retired judges would work for such paltry sums…?” the Chief Justice asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/high-court-seeks-finance-secretarys-appearance/article34389672.ece
23 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||KTR lashes out at Centre’s dual-price policy of vaccine||Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) working president and Municipal Minister K.T. Rama Rao lashed out at the dual-price policy of the Covid19 vaccination of the Central Government asking “One Nation – Two different Vaccines Prices?”. In a tweet with hashtag #SabkaSaathSabkoVaccine, he said “We agreed for One Nation – One Tax (GST)” and why is it that there are two prices for the vaccine in the country. Why should the vaccine be supplied at Rs. 150 for the Government of India and at Rs. 400 for State governments, he asked. He also asked the Centre that can’t it subsume additional cost from PM CARES and help rapid vaccination across the country. Mr. Rao however said the Telangana government is committed to vaccinate all its frontline workers and tweeted that the frontline workers in Municipal Administration Department are being taken care of. “Percentage of vaccination in 141 Municipalities is 95.55% and in GHMC it is 96.19%. Striving for cent percent at the earliest,” he tweeted. The dual price policy, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, received sharp criticism with the netizens lashing out at the Prime Minister saying he is insensitive to people’s issues. The national leadership should realise that the States are already under financial stress due to last year’s lockdown and the lockdown staring at them with spike in COVID-19 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-lashes-out-at-centres-dual-price-policy-of-vaccine/article34389677.ece
23 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Secretariat staff await orders on alternate day duties||Employees in the State Secretariat are anxiously waiting for the government to issue orders on rotation of duties allowing them to attend office on alternate days. They requested the government to permit only 50% employees to be physically present in the office on any given day. The employees made repeated representations to the government for arrangements within the Secretariat premises to vaccinate all employees over 45 years of age in view of the intensification of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the second phase. Employees are under constant fear these days as both their demands remained unmet so far. Close to 100 employees, including dozen and half security personnel, tested positive to COVID-19 in the recent days and two employees succumbed while undergoing treatment. According to staff union representatives, dozen employees of the GAD, six from Finance, five from Medical and Health Department were among those affected by the virus while an assistant secretary rank officer of the Finance Department and a record assistant of the Home Department succumbed to the virus in the recent days. Employees are worried that the space in the new Secretariat building is congested and it is therefore leading to increasing number of positive cases. “COVID-19 positive cases are reported from almost all the floors of the Secretariat and way the virus in spreading through their contacts. The government has not acted on our representation so far,” an employees’ union leader told The Hindu . Employees’ representatives are lamenting that though the Chief Minister’s Office is not averse to issuing such orders in the interests of the staff, orders are however not forthcoming. “Why should there be hesitation when the Department of Personnel and Training of the Union Government and the Ministry of Home Affairs issued guidelines regarding safety at work places?” another union leader questioned. They are expressing concern that arrangements for vaccinating the employees have not been made in the Secretariat dispensary in spite of several representations. They are demanding that the government sanction 15 days special casual leave for the COVID-19 positive employees and increase ceiling limit of medical reimbursement to COVID-19 affected employees and their dependants from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/secretariat-staff-await-orders-on-alternate-day-duties/article34389675.ece
23 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘COVID deaths due to late detection’||Senior Central government officer Krishnamoorthy (name changed) has been pretty active throughout the pandemic touring the national capital and various cities and villages of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh but has been infected in this current nationwide second wave. “I always took utmost precautions and was never without a mask in public but despite my best efforts, I got the virus. My symptoms are mild and am in home quarantine but my complaint is about inadequate testing facilities and the long time it takes to get the results, which I feel is causing more hospitalisations,” he says. The senior official, who also held key posts in the twin cities, wanted to get himself tested in a private laboratory after he realised the mild fever was refusing to go. “I went to a diagnostic centre where I was informed that while the test could be done soon, the results can be expected in 72 hours only,” he explains. His question is — What should the probable COVID positive patient do in the meanwhile? “Isn’t there a danger of the virus spreading further in the body during this time with delayed medical assistance because of the late test result information?,” he wonders. The officer managed to take the RT-PCR test and obtain the result in less than 24 hours making use of contacts in a private hospital, following which he began the treatment protocols immediately through online consultation of a private doctor. “Deaths are happening not because of COVID infection but due to late detection of the disease and treatment. If we can ramp up the RT-PCR testing facilities, ensure results in shortest possible time and begin medication as per doctors’ advice, online or mobile too, we can not only save lives but prevent the rush to hospitals in critical stages. If private labs have managed to enhance their capabilities in the last one year, what prevents the government to scale them up?,” he asks. The official is of the opinion that more people are voluntarily coming forward for testing this year. So, the health department on its own or on a public-private partnership should open more testing centres and provide quicker results to cut the serpentine queues in government healthcare facilities.

23 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||DRDO product an oxygen source||Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has unveiled a new product that is useful not only for Army soldiers fighting in the extreme high altitude areas, but to all those grappling with COVID crisis. The Defence Bio-Engineering and Electro Medical Laboratory (DEBEL), Bengaluru, has developed SpO2 (Blood Oxygen Saturation) supplemental oxygen delivery system for soldiers at extreme high altitudes. This automatic system delivers supplement oxygen based on the SpO2 levels and prevents the person from sinking in to a state of ‘hypoxia’, which is fatal in most cases. The system reads SpO2 levels of the subject from a wrist-worn pulse oximeter module through wireless interface and controls a proportional solenoid valve to regulate the supply. The oxygen is delivered from a lightweight portable cylinder through nasal prongs. The DRDO system is available in various sizes from 1 litre and 1kg weight with 150 litres of oxygen supply to 10 litres and 10 kg weight with 1,500 litres of oxygen supply, which can sustain for 750 minutes with a continuous flow of two litres of oxygen per minute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/drdo-product-a-source-of-oxygen/article34389662.ece

Also, 26,169 new cases were reported, taking the total cases to 9,56,348. The positivity of new cases jumped to 36.24% – the highest till now. This means more than 36 out of 100 people taking the test are now testing positive. A total of 72,208 tests were done in a day, the bulletin said. Of the total cases, 8,51,537 people have recovered and there are 91,618 active cases. 53,673 vaccinated Meanwhile, a total of 53,673 beneficiaries took COVID-19 vaccination in the city in 24 hours, as per the bulletin. Out of the total 20,431 beds for COVID-19 treatment here, only 10.4% were vacant at 11 p.m. Also, only 15 ICU beds were vacant. Many hospitals, including Lok Nayak Hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and Burari Hospital, did not have a single vacant COVID-19 bed. Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said that once the oxygen crisis is resolved, the government will increase the number of beds. “We have demanded 7,000 beds for two weeks from the Centre. So far, 2,000 beds have been given. Beds for COVID-19 patients will be increased once the oxygen crisis ends,” he said. The Minister said that hospitals faced a shortage of oxygen the entire night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/city-reports-26169-cases-306-deaths/article34389635.ece
23 April 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||‘Reserve 50% beds for COVID patients’||The Odisha government on Thursday directed all private hospitals to reserve 50% of their beds for COVID-19 patients and charge reasonable cost. The government has fixed treatment cost to be charged by private hospitals. The 50% reservation will also be applicable to ICU and high-density unit beds. This was done to decongest government health facilities. The government found that private hospitals were also not admitting COVID patients with a plea that they did not have beds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/reserve-50-beds-for-covid-patients/article34389332.ece
23 April 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Haryana shops to shut after 6 p.m. from today, says CM||Amid the surge in COVID-19 cases, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Thursday said adequate arrangements have been made in the State to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oxygen, medicines and other facilities. Mr. Lal said the government has decided to close shops across the State dealing in non-essential items from 6 p.m. from April 23 onwards. Responding to question regarding shortage of oxygen supply, Mr. Lalsaid though some difficulty regarding the same was reported but now the problem has been resolved. “I have even held a detailed discussion with PM Modi on this issue. A roster has been made for the filling of oxygen cylinders and then loading these in the trucks from Panipat Oxygen Plant. From now on, one truck will be loaded for Haryana and one each for Delhi and Punjab,” he said. The Chief Minister said 170 MT of oxygen was supplied to Delhi from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Thursday (April 22) from the Panipat plant. “CM Arvind Kejriwal had expressed satisfaction for the supply of oxygen,” said Mr. Lal. He added that the Panipat plant has a capacity of producing 260 MT of oxygen per day, of which 140 is supplied to Delhi, 80 to Haryana and 20 to Punjab. He said Haryana also supplied 20 MT of oxygen from Bhiwadi plant in Rajasthan. On the current status of availability of beds with ventilators for COVID-19 patients in the hospitals, the Chief Minister said that the facility of availability of beds has been made online in Gurugram and Faridabad districts. Mr. Lal said 1,000 Remdesivir injections were supplied in government hospitals till April 21 and the supply will be further increased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/haryana-shops-to-shut-after-6-pm-from-today-says-cm/article34389334.ece
23 April 2021||LUCKNOW,||FIR against private hospital in Kanpur||An FIR was lodged against a private hospital in Kanpur for mismanagement and it was also charged with being negligent in treating a district judge. District judge R. P. Singh tested positive on April 18. On Wednesday morning when the judge went to the hospital for admission at around 11 along with the chief medical officer of Kanpur, they were shocked at the mismanagement. Stuck in lift The FIR, based on the complaint of CMO Anil Mishra stated that when they were going up in a lift at the hospital, it malfunctioned and got stuck. They managed to get out of the lift but found that there was no doctor available, the FIR said. Dr. Mishra alleged no doctor was there to attend to the district judge with any expertise. The judge could not get any special treatment, the CMO said. The case was lodged against Naraina Medical Hospital manager Amit Narayan and also the doctors and staff on duty. The FIR was lodged at Panki police station Kanpur under IPC Sections 166b, 188, 269, 270 and 596 and Section 3(2)(I) of the Epidemic Diseases Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/fir-against-private-hospital-in-kanpur/article34389331.ece
23 April 2021||Mumbai,||Congress seeks free COVID-19 jab for all||A day after the Maharashtra unit of the Congress demanded door-to-door COVID-19 vaccination in the State, the party on Thursday wrote to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding free vaccine jab for people in the 18 to 45 age group. Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap, while referring to former party president Rahul Gandhi’s demand of free vaccination, said, “On behalf of the Mumbai Congress, we demand that all people in the age group of 18 to 45 years in Maharashtra be given free vaccination as the poor working class will not be able to bear the cost of doses.” He added that more people would stay away from vaccination if they had to pay for it. “The Central government has announced vaccination for all above 18 years and we understand that the Centre will be charging those in the age group of 18 to 45 for administering doses,” Mr. Jagtap said. Earlier, Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole came down on the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleging that it was playing politics in the times of COVID-19 instead of extending a helping hand to the people of the State. “The State is facing a shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir. The urgency demonstrated by the Opposition to rescue a pharmaceutical company owner arrested by the police was never shown by BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis to approach the Central government to solve Maharashtra’s problems,” Mr. Patole said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/congress-seeks-free-covid-19-jab-for-all/article34389294.ece
23 April 2021||Mumbai,||Man wanting to meet girlfriend gets witty response from Mumbai Police||The Mumbai Police’s humorous reply to a Twitter user, who wanted to meet his girlfriend during the ongoing novel coronavirus-induced restrictions imposed by the Maharashtra government, has won the hearts of netizens. The city police have made it mandatory for the vehicles in emergency/essential services to put up colour-coded stickers in a bid to limit the vehicular movement. A Twitter user named Ashwin Vinod tagged the Mumbai Police and tweeted that he wanted to meet his girlfriend, and asked which sticker he should use for his vehicle to move out. “@MumbaiPolice what sticker should I use in order to go out and meet my girlfriend? I miss her,” he said. In their response, the Mumbai Police said his requirement did not fall under the category of essential or emergency services, and requested him to stay at home. “We understand it’s essential for you sir but unfortunately it doesn’t fall under our essentials or emergency categories! Distance makes the heart grow fonder & currently, you healthier. P.S. We wish you lifetime together. This is just a phase,” the Mumbai Police tweeted with the hashtag #StayHomeStaySafe. The reply by the police was well received and widely appreciated by users on the micro-blogging site. “Very thoughtful reply in these trying times. Each person has their own essentials. Please keep us engaged with witty responses and we are forever grateful for your service! You take care of Mumbai like no one else does! All of you stay safe and healthy!” Twitter user Satyan Israni said. Meanwhile, another Twitter user Sandeep Chauhan sought the police’s permission to meet his friend. “I want to meet my friend this weekend in kandivali, I m based out of bhandup..which color tag I should use?? it's been long since we met, I shall be travelling by my car,” he tweeted. In the reply, the city police tweeted, “A friend, who respects your taking precautions during COVID is a friend indeed. We are sure your friend will agree. Please stay home, we would not want to get unfriendly with you...” Both the tweets received thousands of likes and hundreds of retweets within a few minutes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/man-wanting-to-meet-girlfriend-gets-witty-response-from-mumbai-police/article34389293.ece

23 April 2021||Washington,||‘U.S. will cut emissions by 52% by 2030’||U.S. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% by 2030 relative to 2005 levels, in a clean break with the Trump administration policies on climate action. Mr. Biden also announced that the U.S. would double, by 2024, its annual financing commitments to developing countries, including a tripling of its adaptation finance by 2024. The President made the new target announcements at a ‘Leaders Summit on Climate’, which he is hosting on Thursday and Friday and in which 40 heads of state and government are invited — including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The emissions targets — part of the Paris Agreement on climate — are non-binding and the details of how they will be achieved are not available. However, in announcing the targets, the Biden administration is hoping to encourage other countries to increase their commitments. It is also seeking to bring America back into a leadership role on climate action after Mr. Trump had withdrawn the country from the Paris Agreement. Mr. Biden’s financing announcements are part of a $100 billion a year commitment from developed countries to developing countries for the period 2020-25, “an investment that is going to pay significant dividends for all of us”, Mr. Biden said. The withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement means it has not yet met its financing commitments either. The Obama administration had promised $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund (to help developing countries), only $1 billion has been paid. Jobs and growth In selling climate action to the American public, which until recently was governed by an administration sceptical of the climate crisis, President Biden and his administration have linked climate action and clean technology to jobs and economic growth. On Thursday, Mr. Biden extended this message to other countries. “And meeting this moment is about more than preserving our planet. It’s also about providing a better future for all of us. That’s why, when people talk about climate, I think jobs. Within our climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation and economic opportunity ready to be fired up,” he said. “By maintaining those investments and putting these people to work, the United States sets out on the road to cut greenhouse gases in half — in half — by the end of this decade,” Mr. Biden said. “The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable,” he said. The first guests to speak at the summit were UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Mr. Xi, Mr. Modi, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the U.K. and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-will-cut-emissions-by-52-by-2030/article34388979.ece
23 April 2021||COLOMBO,||Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe to visit Sri Lanka||China’s Minister of Defence Wei Fenghe will visit Sri Lanka next week, in the second high-level visit from Beijing to Colombo in the past six months. “The Minister will arrive on April 27 and leave on April 29,” Mohan Samaranayake, Director-General of the Department of Government Information, told The Hindu.     The Chinese Defence Minister and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General’s visit follows that of a high-powered delegation, led by senior Chinese leader and top foreign policy official Yang Jiechi, in October 2020. China has provided crucial support to Sri Lanka in the pandemic year, by way of a $1 billion loan, as well as a $1.5 billion currency swap facility to help the Colombo government boost its foreign reserves. Closer cooperation President Xi Jinping, in a call with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa last month, assured him that China was ready to support Sri Lanka’s post-pandemic recovery with “closer cooperation”. General Wei’s visit to Sri Lanka is the second to the region in recent months and comes months after China signed a military deal with Pakistan in December 2020, during his visit to Islamabad. The scheduled visit next week also assumes significance in the wake of heightened scrutiny within Sri Lanka, over China’s role and presence in the country, through infrastructure projects. Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court is currently hearing a case, of nearly 20 petitions challenging a Bill, of proposed, special laws to govern the China-funded $1.4- billion Port City coming up on reclaimed land on Colombo’s seafront. Critics of the Bill say it could pave the way to creation of a “Chinese colony” in Sri Lanka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chinese-defence-minister-wei-fenghe-to-visit-sri-lanka/article34388977.ece
23 April 2021||Moscow,||Russia orders troops back after massive drills near Ukraine||Russia’s Defence Minister on Friday ordered an end to military drills near Ukraine involving tens of thousands of troops and dozens of warships that had exacerbated tensions with the West. The announcement came as President Vladimir Putin invited Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky for talks in Moscow following weeks of renewed fighting in the east of Ukraine between government troops and pro-Moscow separatists. Mr. Putin said Mr. Zelensky was welcome in Moscow “any time”. “If President Zelensky wants to start repairing relations, then we of course welcome it,” he said. But the Russian leader appeared to shoot down Mr. Zelensky’s proposal to meet in war-torn eastern Ukraine, saying talks over the years-long conflict should be conducted directly with separatists. Earlier, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu oversaw massive drills in Moscow-annexed Crimea and said soldiers would begin returning to their permanent bases on Friday. “The troops demonstrated their ability to ensure the reliable protection of our country,” he said. “I’ve made a decision to wind down the checks in the Southern and Western military districts,” he said, adding that the pullback of troops should be completed by May 1. The announcement came after the West repeatedly called on Mr. Putin to pull back troops. Mr. Shoigu, who had arrived in Crimea earlier in the day to oversee military drills, said Moscow closely watched NATO movements and would remain vigilant. Both NATO and Mr. Zelensky welcomed Russia’s announcement, with the Ukraine leader tweeting that “the reduction of troops on our border proportionally reduces tension”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-orders-troops-back-after-massive-drills-near-ukraine/article34388976.ece
23 April 2021||Quetta,||Death toll in Pak. hotel explosion rises to five||The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility on Thursday for a deadly suicide blast at a luxury hotel hosting the Chinese Ambassador in the southwest of the country, as officials raised the death toll to five. Beijing said it strongly condemned the attack, although the Taliban said Pakistan security officials were the target of the blast. The bomber detonated the explosives late on Wednesday while inside a vehicle in the car park of the Serena hotel — part of a five-star chain popular with diplomats — in the city of Quetta, capital of Balochistan province. “The suicide bomber hit the security officials exactly as it was planned,” the spokesperson for Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan said in a statement. Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed pinned the blame on a “foreign hand”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/death-toll-in-pak-hotel-explosion-rises-to-five/article34388975.ece
23 April 2021||Jerusalem,||Israel strikes Syria after attack near nuclear site||A Syrian officer was killed and three soldiers were wounded on Thursday in strikes launched by Israel after a missile was fired towards a secretive nuclear site in the Jewish state, a monitor said. Since the outbreak of Syria’s civil war in 2011, Israel has routinely carried out aerial raids on the country, mostly targeting Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah forces as well as government troops. Its latest salvo was launched in the early hours of Thursday after a missile was fired from Syria towards southern Israel, where the Dimona nuclear reactor is located. Sirens sounded in Abu Qrenat, a Bedouin village not far from the nuclear site, the Israeli military said, before it responded by striking multiple defence batteries across the border. Iran attack The exchange of fire comes less than two weeks after Iran accused its arch-foe Israel of “terrorism” following an explosion at the Islamic republic’s Natanz nuclear facility. “A surface-to-air missile was fired from Syria to Israel’s southern Negev,” the Israel Defence Forces tweeted. “In response, we struck the battery from which the missile was launched and additional surface-to-air batteries in Syria.” The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the Israeli retaliatory strikes killed a Syrian officer and seriously wounded three soldiers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-strikes-syria-after-attack-near-nuclear-site/article34388973.ece
23 April 2021||Washington,||Modi announces climate partnership with U.S.||Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India and the U.S. were launching an energy and climate partnership during U.S. President Joe Biden’s Leaders Summit on Climate, a two-day gathering that included 40 heads of state and government. Details of the partnership are yet to be announced, however. “As a climate-responsible developing country, India welcomes partners to create templates of sustainable development in India. These can also help other developing countries, who need affordable access to green finance and clean technologies,” Mr. Modi said via a video link. “That is why, President Biden and I are launching the ‘India-U.S. climate and clean energy Agenda 2030 partnership’. Together, we will help mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies, and enable green collaborations,” he said. “Despite our development challenges, we have taken many bold steps on clean energy, energy efficiency, afforestation and bio-diversity. That is why we are among the few countries whose NDCs are 2-degree-Celsius compatible,” Mr. Modi said. NDCs or Nationally Defined Contributions are targets defined by each country to help achieve the Paris Agreement’s objective of keeping global warming to considerably below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius. India is targeting a 2030 GDP emissions intensity ( i.e., volume of emissions per unit of GDP) that is 33%-35% below 2005 levels. It also seeks to have 40% of power generated from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. Back to basics Although China, the U.S. and India are the top three emitters of CO2 in absolute terms, the U.S. has a much greater per capita emission statistic than China and India .    “Today, as we discuss global climate action, I want to leave one thought with you. India’s per capita carbon footprint is 60% lower than the global average. It is because our lifestyle is still rooted in sustainable traditional practices,” Mr. Modi said, adding that a a philosophy of “back to basics” must be an “important pillar of our economic strategy” in the post-COVID-19 era. Global economic output and growth in India were decimated last year due to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/modi-announces-climate-partnership-with-us/article34388981.ece

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Should election campaigns be made virtual?||India is witnessing a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with record numbers of new cases and deaths every day. At the same time, States holding Assembly elections have seen mass rallies by political parties. In most such rallies, especially in West Bengal, which still has two phases to go and where campaigning is still on, COVID-19 protocols such as masking and physical distancing are blatantly flouted. In view of the COVID-19 surge, and the fact that public rallies are super-spreader events, should campaigning be restricted to virtual mode — at least until the pandemic is behind us? In a discussion moderated by G. Sampath , Sanjay Kumar and Neelanjan Sircar explore this question. Edited excerpts: Should the Election Commission (EC) have made campaigning strictly virtual in view of the pandemic? Sanjay Kumar:I’m not sure whether the situation, when the elections were announced, required the EC to make such an announcement. It could not have anticipated how things would turn out. But it needed to ensure that people at these rallies wear masks. The problem is that even political leaders are not wearing masks. Neelanjan Sircar:Once things got bad, there should have been some consideration of protocol. At least with regard to those political actors over which the EC has some power, it should have demanded that protocols are followed. The banning of certain kinds of rallies or at least limiting their size could have been considered, especially because much of the campaign is actually not in rally form. How important are public rallies in terms of the campaign communications mix? There are many ways to put out your message. Why is it so important to gather a big crowd? NS:The average person on the ground does talk about who showed up at a rally, how big the crowds were, how the energy was, and so on. All this has political impact. Yes, there are other forms of media, but communicating via television isn’t as localised as rallies are. Mass rallies are also a tool to energise the party cadre, because you have to aggressively get people to a rally. In fact, the strength of a party cadre, or individual party workers, is often associated with their ability to get people to rallies. So, rallies play an important part in communicating with the voter and within the internal logic of a political party. Is there a correlation between turnout at rallies and votes garnered? If not, doesn’t that strengthen the case for virtual campaigns? SK:I do believe that the crowds at any given rally don’t necessarily vote for the party whose rally they are attending. But rallies have an important role to play. Look at how the election is being contested in West Bengal. It is a contest not only between the candidates on the ground or between the big leaders; there is also a mind game going on. You have to psyche your opponent and create a perception that you are winning — show that a lot of people are with the candidate, people are supporting you, and want to vote for your party. And this whole perception and aura can only be created through huge crowds. And such crowds can only be gathered if there is a big rally or public meeting. So, mass rallies are basically a tool to build optics? SK:Absolutely. How do you show that a candidate or a leader is hugely popular unless you can show massive crowds, which cannot be shown on an online platform? The number of likes on a YouTube video or shares of a social media post are an indicator of popularity as well. SK:There are different worlds out there, and the people who are on Twitter and Facebook cannot be compared with the kind who come for big rallies. Social media platforms are no substitute for the kind of optics that you can create from a mass rally. When a leader says something, and there is massive applause — that cannot be replaced. With public rallies, you are dealing with segments of society that are unlikely to be reached by social media. Also, since rallies take place in a constituency’s key locales, they have constituency-specific effects. In Bengal, [Congress leader] Rahul Gandhi has called off public rallies, the Left has also done so, and [West Bengal Chief Minister] Mamata Banerjee has curtailed public meetings as well. Only the BJP seems intent on having rallies. Are there party-specific factors that make mass rallies more essential as a mobilising tool for the BJP?  NS:The Trinamool certainly has a comparative advantage in the strength of its local cadre. The BJP is a new entrant in the State. It’s also taken in a lot of defectors from all sides. So, it’s an unwieldy force on the ground, it’s not organised. It does require the sort of energy that comes from having its top leaders come over. It’s been important for the BJP to bring big names, even big actors such as Mithun Chakraborty, to build an energy around its campaign in a way that I don’t think is required for the Trinamool or even the CPM. SK:I don’t agree that parties with a strong party cadre would not like to hold rallies because they know they have a lot of support on the ground and can therefore win without even holding a rally. No, all parties want to hold rallies. In Hindi, we have this saying about a half-empty vessel and a full vessel. If you drop a coin into it, the half-empty vessel creates a much bigger sound than the vessel which is full. So, the party which has solid support on the ground, with lots of workers, will still hold the rally. But it may not make an extra effort to create that loud noise. But the party which is not very confident of ground-level support has a much more urgent need to create that buzz around big rallies. This is why we have seen lots of rallies being held in Bengal by both the Trinamool and the BJP. What if campaigning is restricted to virtual mode? Will it queer the electoral pitch, giving undue benefits to some while disadvantaging others? SK:It will disadvantage candidates from deprived socioeconomic communities, and candidates in rural India. We keep talking about the role of money power in Indian elections, and how a wealthy candidate has better chances compared to one with limited resources, rendering the contest uneven. In a virtual campaign, this form of unevenness will be minimised, but there will be other kinds of unevenness with regard to Internet and social media access, and the ability to use new technology to one’s advantage. NS:While you may even out economic disparities in a virtual campaign, you’re certainly creating other disparities. The BJP might require the ability to do larger rallies in order to gather attention in places where it’s finding it hard to break into. If the Trinamool has an advantage in terms of local cadre, the fact that virtual rallies do not have the same impact locally that in-person rallies do would give the Trinamool an advantage. In places where the reach of a virtual rally might be less, there will be concerns of creating disparities in favour of whichever party organisation is stronger on the ground. If the pandemic situation doesn’t improve, does the EC have the powers to mandate a virtual campaign? SK:The EC has the powers to set the terms and conditions of the campaign. If those are very tough, political parties may go to the court against the EC’s decision. But the EC does have the powers to set the rules for how an election is to be conducted. For instance, campaigning normally stops 48 hours before polling, but now in Bengal it’s getting stopped 72 hours before polling. The EC can take such decisions. But you can’t change the rules when half the election is already over, as is the case in Bengal. However, nobody can stop the EC from being strict in asking leaders to follow COVID-19 norms, and in this respect, it has been very, very weak. It has not even issued notices to leaders who are moving around without masks. NS:In some sense, the idea that the EC wields police powers and certain rule-making powers during the elections is predicated upon the idea that when elections happen, everything else stops. Unfortunately, illnesses don’t stop, COVID-19 doesn’t stop. So, we have to consider to what extent the EC even has the capacity to think about what policing powers look like in an era of COVID-19. How does one even think about the security and policing infrastructure in the middle of a calamity, when there are other things happening alongside an election? If we consider the measures other States have put in place right now to curb the spread of COVID-19, we must think through how much of that is now being compromised because there’s an ongoing election in Bengal. And if it comes to pass that we are in election mode again soon, we need to ponder what are the relative policing powers that can get us out of this kind of trouble, and not make us completely dependent on the EC, which has no specialisation in the kind of policing work needed in a pandemic situation. There seem to be two different considerations here: democracy and electoral rights on the one hand, and public health and the right to life on the other. How do we reconcile the two? NS:It’s an incredibly difficult question. We have to think about what the security architecture of India looks like at the time of elections. We may then find we can’t have fair elections at a time like this because we’re too afraid that either the Central or the State government bureaucracies would be biased. So, when the conditions are not appropriate for mass gatherings, just don’t hold elections. If we’re unable to change our set architecture of elections being run by the EC, even in the middle of a pandemic, then, as we’re seeing now, it is not good for the EC’s credibility. So, you’re saying that if elections are due in the middle of a pandemic, then the EC should go with one of two options: either all campaigning is virtual or no elections.  NS:Absolutely. I agree with Sanjay that you can’t change the rules in the middle of an election. But let’s not pretend that the possibility of COVID-19 coming back in a serious way wasn’t in the background. Choosing an eight-phase election at this time, for whatever reason, was just playing with fire, and unfortunately, it looks like we’re getting burned. So, the next time an election comes due, which is less than a year from now, and the pandemic is unlikely to have receded by then, should the EC declare at total ban on mass rallies, right at the beginning? SK:Definitely. Elections are due in U.P., Punjab, and Uttarakhand early next year. The EC should take lessons from what is happening now. I would welcome a complete ban on big rallies, with only door-to-door campaigning permitted. NS:You cannot fault any political party or candidate for trying to win the election using the tools that are legally at their disposal. So it is up to the EC to set the ground rules that do not put parties, party workers and ordinary citizens at risk.  You can’t change the rules when half the election is over. However, nobody can stop the EC from being strict in asking political leaders to follow COVID-19 norms, and in this respect, it has been very, very weak.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||The chequered legacy of a Chief Justice of India||The Supreme Court of India in the last five years during the tenure of the last four Chief Justices of India (CJIs), has seen an unprecedented fall — from being an independent custodian of justice, to becoming an instrumentality of the government. After the tenure of former CJI Ranjan Gogoi, who oversaw the Ayodhya and Rafale verdicts, before retiring to join the Rajya Sabha, we thought the worst was behind us. We hoped that his successor, CJI S.A. Bobde would lift the Court out of this abyss and at least restore its independence from the executive. But, the nearly  18 months of his tenure has exposed a deep malaise in every aspect of dispensation of justice; from the administration of the Court; in the allocation of cases and benches; to presiding over matters related to the protection of civil liberties, securing the rights and the livelihood of the poor and marginalised; or in ensuring that the unconstitutional actions and policies of the executive are kept in check. Momentous months His tenure began in November 2019 with many important cases before him. There were over 100 petitions challenging the dilution of Article 370 and the reorganisation of the State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) into Union Territories. Soon after he assumed office, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed, which led to another spate of petitions challenging its constitutionality. The CAA sparked widespread protests. We witnessed police confrontation at the Jamia University campus and the entry of gangs into Jawaharlal Nehru University who beat up students and teachers under the full gaze of the police. Thereafter, the city of Delhi witnessed engineered riots and the subsequent hounding of young students and other activists in the guise of an investigation by the Delhi Police. There were also other important cases pending before the Supreme Court, including the validity of electoral bonds, and the protection of Rohingya refugees. Then, early in 2020, COVID-19 overtook the country, and with it began the lockdown of the Supreme Court and thereafter other courts, and then the entire country — which led to the largest exodus of migrant labour from the large cities in India. A powerful constitutional court like the Supreme Court of India must rise to these challenges, and it is in such challenging times that its mettle and independence is tested. It is here that the role of the Chief Justice of India — he is the master of the roster deciding the priority accorded to the hearing of cases, their allocation to Benches and setting the tone for the Court by his leadership — becomes critical. The cases challenging the cataclysmic changes to the status of J&K remained unheard during his entire tenure as did the cases challenging the CAA. The main challenge to the electoral bonds and other changes to electoral funding, which have a fundamental bearing on our democracy, remained unheard. Applications for the stay of bonds being issued before every election, were never listed for hearing, and were eventually dismissed on the ground that the bonds had been around for several years; therefore, there was no need to stay them. Similarly, the main petition regarding the status of the Rohingya refugees and the protection to be accorded to them, remained unheard. An application to prevent their detention and deportation, was disposed of by Chief Justice Bobde, in complete disregard of constitutional and international law norms, on the basis that their fleeing genocide in Myanmar did not concern the Court. The Supreme Court, under his stewardship, remained shut for physical hearing much of the time, resulting in fewer than 25% cases being heard in a Court, already reeling under a backlog and pendency of cases. Many habeas corpus petitions of people in detention were not heard for months, and thereafter summarily disposed of without deciding the main issue by relegating the petitioners to the High Courts. Migrant labour exodus During the nationwide lockdown last year, the country witnessed unprecedented suffering by migrant labour; there was a mass exodus of them from the big cities, and they suffered a huge loss of livelihood and income. Without any public transport, they were forced to walk hundreds of miles to reach their villages. Their case for relief in terms of food, wages and transport was initially heard by the CJI’s Bench. Unfortunately, the pleas on behalf of the migrant workers did not result in any relief to them with the Court saying it could not “supplant” the government’s wisdom on providing relief to the lakhs of migrant labourers across the country. The CJI remarked infamously during one of the hearings, “If they are being provided meals, then why do they need money?” It would be no exaggeration to say that the Court’s inhumanity and apathy towards the distress of the poor and marginalised reached its nadir during this time. Far from being a custodian of citizens’ rights, CJI Bobde, while hearing the Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan’s habeas corpus petition (arrested while covering the infamous Hathras rape and murder case in Uttar Pradesh), noted that the Court had been discouraging people from approaching it under Article 32 (https://bit.ly/3n92Ym1). Mr. Kappan’s petition remained pending with repeated adjournments. In the farmers’ protest case, the CJI appointed a committee of people, whose political neutrality was suspect, to examine the issues and commence negotiations with the farmers. These committee members had publicly supported the farm laws in the past. Administrative role Apart from his role as the master of the roster, the CJI also plays a pivotal role in judicial appointments. Unfortunately, here too, he failed to carry the collegium with him, leading to no appointments to the Supreme Court during his tenure, and very few appointments even to the High Courts. He did not even order the government to issue notifications for the appointment of judges where the collegium had unanimously reiterated its recommendations, despite the government procrastinating over them for long. The law laid down by the Court says that these are binding on the government. The Chief Justice of India also plays a critical role in dealing with complaints against judges. During his tenure, the CJI received a serious complaint made by a Chief Minister of a State against one of the Court judges, with considerable documentary evidence of questionable land purchases. For over six months, the people in the country were not informed how the complaint had been dealt with, and whether any in-house committee (as per the law) has been appointed to, who the members of the committee were, and what their report was. The same lack of transparency was visible in another case, where he was chairman of a committee examining allegations of harassment made by a woman staffer of the Court against his predecessor. His report, purporting to give a clean chit to his predecessor, was never allowed to see the light of day and not even provided to the complainant. Green cause I have tried to search for the redeeming features in the CJI’s tenure. But to my dismay, the only positive intervention by CJI Bobde that I have been able to discover was his order in the West Bengal trees case (https://bit.ly/3na6752), where he appointed an expert committee to examine the value of trees which are to be felled for any public project. In all other issues, the CJI has only caused disappointment with his silence, letting the executive have its way and even making strong remarks on sensitive issues and subjects. He has kept important matters pending, and has hardly intervened to provide any relief to the most marginalised or the weak in India. As we bid farewell to Chief Justice of India Bobde, the Supreme Court must examine what has happened to what had once been called the most powerful court in the world and a beacon for many other courts across the world. As the Supreme Court turns the page on his tenure, let us hope that in the coming years, it can rebuild its legacy by asserting its judicial independence from the government and once again reclaiming its constitutional role as a citadel that establishes India’s constitutional values, guards its democracy, and protects human rights and dignity.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||A descent into disillusionment and chaos||The Prime Minister’s address to the nation on April 20, though fairly motivational, confounded the expectations of much of the nation’s commonality. Apart from a coherent plea to States to avoid total lockdowns and a romantic COVID-19 situational briefing of sorts, much of it was optimistic yet stultifying rhetoric that could hardly have any influence on mass behaviour towards COVID-19. Nonetheless, while much of the visual aspect of the Prime Minister’s address was similar to the ones held last year, one conspicuous element was missing — that of a symbolic mask. While a number of alibis for the same are possible, it is an insignia that speaks volumes about our approach toward the second wave of COVID-19. Administrative fatigue Medicine and social science are two essential pillars of public health. However, medical interventions have historically been the ones to usurp the public health space. Much to the detriment of public health, this has time and again resulted in a subconscious dismissal of social science-based approaches that hold the keys to the public health castle. The situation with the second wave is hardly different. In our besottedness with strategies such as mass vaccination, which although of unrivalled significance have considerable near-term limitations, the simplest yet most crucial behavioural interventions have been given a criminally light touch at a time when they were supposed to be accentuated. And this goes beyond the abomination of political rallies potentially spreading infection, or public representatives failing at crucial public messaging by not wearing masks themselves. Take the instance of a mofussil town that no longer sees honking vehicles traverse the streets every morning, airing social distancing and masking messages, unlike during the first wave. Or the near-disappearance after the first wave of rings drawn outside of a shopping store to encourage social distancing. Surmount these with counter-intuitive public policies at the grass-roots level, and you have a perfect recipe for a flaring pandemic. For example, even before an official order was promulgated in Maharashtra, local police forced shops to remain open for only four hours during the day in certain localities, creating panic among customers and shopkeepers. The idea of limiting open-hours derives from the theoretical precept of rationing services to discourage over-consumption, much like waiting times. But the same fosters over-crowding, non-compliance with COVID-19-appropriate behaviour by both shopkeepers and customers, and is practically counterproductive when an infectious pandemic is in question. Similarly, it is possible to locate beneficiaries lined up outside some vaccination centres from midnight till noon for physical tokens, while the politically well-connected get their way within minutes. All of these indicate that much like pandemic fatigue among the public, administrative and governance fatigue is real, and that the crucial lessons from the early days of the pandemic have been squandered rather than strengthened. Poor messaging Another example of administrative fatigue, resulting from a subconscious dismissal of behavioural approaches, is the poor risk communication and public messaging that has accompanied the second wave. Health behaviours, once firmly embedded, are expected to be swiftly elicited on subsequent occasions. The concept is much like immunological memory where the body exerts a stronger response to a disease agent upon the second or third infection. Such embedded health behaviours in some East Asian countries have resulted in prompt and widespread public adoption of measures such as masking on the whiff of an infectious outbreak. The same cannot be expected for India given our lesser exposure to infectious pandemics. Nonetheless, a strong and subtle nudge was imperative during the second wave to quickly bring back COVID-19-appropriate behaviours with renewed vigour. This has failed, and that too during more pressing times than before.  As is often humorously exclaimed, the worst way to calm someone down is by telling them to calm down. Reducing the risk communication strategy to simple messages such as “please wear masks” is unlikely to work particularly in a setting of widespread pandemic fatigue, and where mixed signals are continuously disseminated by political representatives. Altering health behaviour, in addition to altering physical and social contexts, involves skilful and emphatic messaging that incentivises adoption of the right behaviours. Unfortunately, the public health messaging strategy during the second wave has been more generic, muffled, and far more equivocal than the first wave. A perspective An over-medicalised public health emergency is a disaster superimposed on another. Multiple fundamental aspects of COVID-19 vaccines and the protection afforded by them still remain fuzzy. Further, there are non-negotiable aspects such as the lag between vaccination and protection, and the gargantuan challenge of vaccinating a large population as ours. Overcoming our preoccupation with medical solutions and looking at behavioural approaches as more than mere rituals will be imperative to combat this second wave. Dr. Soham D.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Making education accessible||Access and affordability continue to plague teachers and students alike one year after the COVID-19 outbreak. Teachers, administrators and policymakers are all working, but the results are not encouraging. People at both ends of the classroom seem to be going through a mere exercise with precious little to show for their efforts. How much of learning is happening is anyone’s guess. Exams have lost their credibility. The cost to health with continuous exposure to screens and the dent on financial resources are significant for both teachers and students. Online learning seems to be a case of working mindlessly, rather than working smart. With physical classes out of the reckoning, access to education is now almost exclusively online. Internet penetration in India is 50% and that reveals one reason for the less-than-efficient achievement in the online education sector. Every single teacher-educator and student, even in the metros, has experienced poor connectivity. In the rural areas online access remains an aspiration. What happens to that child in the village government school, eager to learn but with no proper access to the Internet? Even if there is a selfless teacher who is willing to use his/her mobile hotspot, how much can he/she spend? The government has a solution right in its backyard. Two influential agencies The Government of India owns the airwaves. Prasar Bharati is India’s broadcasting corporation handling both radio and television in India. All India Radio (AIR) is blessed with 470 broadcasting centres which cover 92% of the country’s geographical area and 99.19% of our population. Doordarshan (DD) handles television, online and mobile broadcasting across our country and the world with 34 satellite channels, 17 well-equipped studios in State capitals and 49 studio centres in other cities. With such resources, AIR and DD can be used to broadcast lessons, given that education is one of the three functions of the two agencies under the Prasar Bharati Act. These two agencies can be reinvented to cater to the needs of the education sector. Educational broadcasts for classes 10, 11 and 12, to begin with, can be done over AIR and DD in the ratio 4:1 (four hours of radio and one hour of TV). Those courses which need demonstration and where seen/observed physical activity is important can be broadcast on TV. This calls for some training and some effort, but it can be done. There are two benefits from this: one, we will be able to reduce for our teachers and students the strain of having to stare at their screens endlessly; and two, with AIR and DD being free, the heavy drain on financial resources will be drastically reduced. Policymakers should make it a point to involve teachers in their planning. Training can be provided by a set of master trainers over a month for teachers who will turn into scriptwriters and programmers. These teachers can also be taught to create appropriate tools for evaluation over radio and TV. The Central and State educational boards should be roped in, to support, monitor and provide feedback to improve the system. If regular radio is not enough, we also have digital radio spawning FM stations leased out to private players for a fee and several FM stations that are run by NGOs, universities and such agencies. My suggestion is this: let the AIR devote four hours (per class) to educational broadcasting and let DD undertake educational broadcasting for an hour (per class). With these two public broadcasting services combined in the ratio of 4:1 (per each class), we will be able to serve the entire student population of our country. Free hours of Internet Another suggestion that the government could consider is to ask Internet Service Providers to provide many hours of free Internet usage to teachers and students. This will not be easy but the government should call the shots and take a decision that is in the interest of the people.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Green and raw||The establishment of tribunals as adjudicatory bodies in specific fields is based on the idea that specialisation and expertise are required to decide complex cases of a technical nature. The ‘tribunalisation’ of justice is driven by the recognition that it would be cost-effective, accessible and give scope for utilising expertise in the respective fields. Central to this scheme is the principle that the ‘experts’ appointed to these tribunals should bring in special knowledge and experience. These criteria came under focus recently when the appointment of former IAS officer, Girija Vaidyanathan, as Expert Member in the Southern Bench of the NGT, was challenged in the Madras High Court. Even though the court initially granted an interim stay on her appointment, it ruled that she was not ineligible, going by the criteria in the NGT Act. She was found to have fulfilled the eligibility requirements by virtue of her administrative experience of nearly five years in “dealing with environmental matters”. The Act spells out two kinds of criteria — one based on qualifications and practical experience, and another on administrative experience in the field — and a candidate has to fulfil only one of them. For the first, a masters’ or a doctorate in science, engineering or technology, with 15 years’ experience in the relevant field, including five in environment and forests in a national level institution, is needed. The fields include pollution control, hazardous substance management and forest conservation. On the other hand, the administrative experience criterion is shorn of detail, and merely stipulates 15 years’ experience, of which five should have been in “dealing with environmental matters” in either the Centre or the State or any reputed institution. Even though Ms. Vaidyanathan’s stint as Secretary, Environment and Forests, Tamil Nadu, and Chairperson of the State Pollution Control Board together amounted to only 28 months, the court accepted the contention that her tenure as Health Secretary should also be considered. The court also observed wryly that it is an entirely different matter whether administrative experience in the second criterion should be regarded as equivalent to “the real expertise” indicated in the clause on qualifications. The court rightly declined to interfere with the appointment, as the equivalence found in the rules falls under the domain of Parliament. At a time when the need, relevance and composition of tribunals are under judicial scrutiny, and the Centre itself has abolished some of them, it would be salutary if the government spelt out with clarity, as the court has suggested, the extent to which a bureaucrat’s involvement in environmental matters could be regarded as equivalent to expertise. It should also show greater urgency in implementing earlier Supreme Court directions to constitute a National Tribunals Commission to supervise the appointment and functioning of tribunals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/green-and-raw/article34388949.ece
23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Judges pro tem||The Supreme Court’s decision to invoke a “dormant provision” in the Constitution to clear the way for appointment of retired judges as ad hoc judges to clear the mounting arrears in the various High Courts is an indictment of the extraordinary delay in filling up judicial vacancies. Whether the fault lies with the Collegium system or the Centre’s tardiness, there is little doubt that the unacceptable delay in the appointment process in recent times has caused huge vacancies in the High Courts. Therefore, it is definitely not unwelcome that the Court has chosen to activate Article 224A of the Constitution, which provides for appointment of ad hoc judges in the High Courts based on their consent. A Bench headed by CJI S.A. Bobde has made it clear that “the challenge of mounting arrears and existing vacancies requires recourse to Article 224A”. The numbers both in respect of pendency of cases and vacancies in the High Courts are quite concerning — a backlog of over 57 lakh cases, and a vacancy level of 40%. Five High Courts account for 54% of these cases. Interestingly, official data suggest that there need not be a correlation between the number of vacancies and the large backlog. The Madras High Court has 5.8 lakh cases against a relatively low level of vacancy at 7%. As many as 44% of the posts in the Calcutta High Court are vacant, but the cases in arrears stand at 2.7 lakh. As the provision has been utilised only sparingly in the past, and for the limited purpose of disposing of particular kinds of cases, the endeavour to appoint ad hoc judges will have to come with some guidelines. The Court has made a beginning by directing that the trigger point for such an appointment will be when the vacancies go beyond 20% of the sanctioned strength, or when more than 10% of the backlog of pending cases are over five years old; when cases in a particular category are pending for over five years, or when the rate of disposal is slower than the rate of institution of fresh cases. The Bench has ruled that the current Memorandum of Procedure be also followed for appointing ad hoc judges, a process initiated by the Chief Justice of a High Court, with a suggested tenure of two to three years. The Court has clarified that this is a “transitory methodology” and does not constrain the regular appointment process. The government, which did not oppose the proposal, but wanted the vacancies to be filled up first, would do well to expedite the regular appointment process from its end, and give up its propensity to hold back some recommendations selectively. As for the judiciary, it should ensure that only retired judges with experience and expertise are offered the temporary positions, and there is no hint of favouritism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/judges-pro-tem/article34388950.ece
23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Amplifying the written word||Some months ago, I received an email from a reader about an article I had written on current research on Friedrich’s ataxia, a disease that causes damage to the nervous system as well as speech impairment and movement problems. Friedrich’s ataxia starts during childhood and manifests later as impaired muscular coordination that worsens with age. It is caused by an inherited aberrant gene. We all carry two copies of every gene, each inherited from a parent. Friedrich’s ataxia occurs when both copies of the FXN gene have the defect. The defective FXN gene causes a problem in producing a protein called frataxin, which is found in cells throughout the body, with the highest levels in the heart, spinal cord, liver, pancreas, and muscles used for voluntary movement. The article described how the researchers had identified a way to tag the defective part of the gene and bind it so that frataxin can be produced normally. This was done in cell lines in the lab, and treatment of people with the problem was still some distance away. I got a few emails after this article was published asking me for the contact details of the researchers. These emails mentioned that relatives were suffering from Friedrich’s ataxia and that perhaps the research would hold the key. This was not surprising or new — research kindles hope for patients and their relatives who often reach out asking for more details. But what did surprise me was the recent email I got, where the writer was emailing to know more — it came three years after the article was published. This touched me on several counts. First, it brought home the thirst for scientific knowledge and the eagerness to probe and understand complex phenomena, among the readers. It was moving to think of the reader scouring the web for information that could help a loved one. Successful research, promising results and reactions of hope are what make it worth the while for science journalists who spend their time trying to make sense of the abstruse and simplifying it for the lay reader. Second, the email underscored the reach of the medium of the Internet and the power of the published word. This reinforces in us journalists the need for rigour and commitment to facts in the reports we write. The role of the Internet in prolonging the life of stories is well known, but the ease with which a person can access an old story and also mail the writer for an update never fails to astonish. In earlier days, when print was the dominant mode of communication, the combination of the short life span of stories and the time it took to establish communication with the writer worked to prevent such easy links between the reader, writer and the written. Back then, letters were the dominant mode of communication, and people travelled across the globe to confer, whereas now, instant messaging and Zoom conferences have made discussions easy to organise. The Internet has taken us from daily, weekly and monthly schedules to round-the-clock planning. It has also played a role in amplifying and making immortal the written word. For reporters, it is an added responsibility to use the power of this medium in a manner consistent with journalistic values.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/amplifying-the-written-word/article34388962.ece

In the most outspoken attack yet of China’s latest diplomatic overtures to the west, the Soviet Union also renewed the charge that Peking was dreaming of triggering off an armed clash between the two big powers - the Soviet Union and the United States. In defining Peking’s aims in the Third World, it made allusions to the current developments in Pakistan and Ceylon in which Moscow had suspected Peking’s hand but had so far refrained from stating it openly. Moscow’s charges came out in a long article in the influential Soviet political weekly ‘New Times’ credited to L. Kirichenko. The Russian version of the weekly was not due to go on stalls until Friday but it was a measure of official importance given to the article that Tass released advanced excerpts of it this morning. The operative passage quoted by Tass said that in the Third World, numerous facts showed that Maoists continued to “meddle in the affairs of India and Burma, Pakistan and Ceylon, the Arab States and several countries of Africa. One of their tasks is to encircle India by States which would follow in the wake of Peking’s policy. Their other task is not to allow the hotbed of war in West Asia to be liquidated. The third task is to get a foothold in some countries of Africa through the construction of roads and enterprises there, supply of weapons and despatch of Chinese specialists.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/china-trying-to-encircle-india/article34388961.ece
23 April 2021||MUMBAI,||Retail asset quality concerns re-emerge as cases surge: ICRA||With fresh COVID-19 related restrictions in place, microfinance and unsecured SME loan pools would likely face the most stress if case severity increases, ICRA said in a report. However, housing loans would remain the most resilient as was seen even last year, it added. “The restrictions on movement would have a bearing on collection efforts for the NBFCs, especially for microfinance loans where cash collections still remain dominant. Commercial vehicle loans could also face stress if the inter-State restrictions are reimposed, though even the current restrictions put in place in Maharashtra and Delhi would lead to lower fleet utilisation for the operators,” ICRA said in the report. Abhishek Dafria, VP and head, Structured Finance Ratings, ICRA, said, “While it is too early to comment on the extent of impact on the asset quality of retail loans due to the rising COVID cases, there is reason to be cautious.” “Post the nationwide lockdown last year, we had witnessed a severe drop in collections for most asset classes... The restrictions at present are localised and less harsh, but the severity has been gradually increasing as the surge in COVID cases is yet to be brought under control,” he said. Securitisation volumes had dropped to a quarterly record low of Rs. 7,500 crore in the first quarter of last fiscal due to the nationwide lockdown. Following the second wave of the pandemic, ICRA said it expected securitisation volumes to again get impacted in the first quarter of this fiscal as NBFCs and HFCs will be more selective in fresh lending.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/retail-asset-quality-concerns-re-emerge-as-cases-surge-icra/article34388924.ece

Observing that the central government had acted swiftly last year and extended the timelines for compliance under various laws, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Sanjay Aggarwal told Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, at an interaction on Thursday, that the same steps and support measures were required this year too. Ms. Sitharaman assured industry that its inputs would be considered, a statement from the finance ministry cited her as having said. The minister had also stressed that the way to tackle the current situation was through micro containment zones ‘so that life and livelihood can be protected’. The government was ‘working arduously for smooth co-ordination between States, hospitals and suppliers of oxygen and vaccines’, Ms. Sitharaman had pointed out. “Provision of oxygen, vaccines and their logistics to people affected by coronavirus is being ensured, given the recent surge in cases of COVID-19 pandemic across the country,” she was quoted as having said, adding that the government was identifying idle manufacturing capacities for bolstering oxygen supplies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/industry-urges-fm-to-extend-timelines-for-compliance/article34388934.ece

About 60% of the companies surveyed by Dun & Bradstreet said they would require more support measures, including government initiatives, to withstand the adverse impact. Market access (42%), improving overall productivity (37%) and access to more finance (34%) were cited as the three key challenges that were most likely to hinder small businesses’ recovery. The survey covered responses from more than 250 small businesses (50% each in manufacturing and services sectors) with annual revenue between Rs. 100 crore and Rs. 300 crore across seven major cities in India. The data indicated that about 95% of firms were impacted in April 2020 when the nationwide lockdown was imposed. Even with progressive unlocking, 70% of businesses remained disrupted till August 2020 and 40% till the end of February 2021. “During our recent survey, small business owners cited three most important support measures they needed to revive their businesses post the pandemic — better credit facility (59%), better marketing support (48%) and adoption of technology (35%),” said Arun Singh, global chief economist, Dun & Bradstreet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/covid-impacts-82-of-small-businesses-shows-survey/article34388931.ece
23 April 2021||CHENNAI,||IBA suggests restricting banks’ business hours, staff rotation||The Indian Banks’ Association has suggested some additional standard operating procedures for banks, including restricting business hours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and deploying staff on a rotational basis in the wake of the second wave of COVID-19. The association said it held a meeting of the special managing committee on April 21, which suggested issuing an advisory on the measures to be taken in addition to the existing standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued last year. Considering the fact that there is no nationwide lockdown and States are issuing relevant guidelines, the managing committee had advised that banks should continue to provide four mandatory services — accepting deposits, cash withdrawals, remittance and government businesses across the country. Doorstep banking activities should be encouraged, the association said in the communication to State level bankers committees (SLBCs). SLBCs could modify the SOPs depending on the situation in the respective States, the association said. Employees may be deputed on a rotational basis or be allowed to work from home depending on the nature of job, staff position and size of the establishment, the IBA said. Ideally 50% of the employees may be called for ‘in-person’ duty and on a rotational basis, according to the additional measures suggested.

23 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Ashok Leyland bets on LCVs, defence to grow||Commercial vehicle manufacturer Ashok Leyland Ltd. (ALL) is betting on Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs) and the defence business as they are key levers for growth, said a top official. “We started our LCV journey 11 years ago,” said chief operating officer Nitin Seth. “At the time, many [said] it was a wrong move. In the last 11 years, LCV sales have grown to 51% of our total volume. [LCVs] enabled us to successfully hedge the cyclicality of the medium and heavy commercial vehicle business,” he added. For the nine months ended March, ALL sold about 49,000 LCVs against 47,000 units a year earlier, he said. In the period, sales volume grew 5% while industry contracted 17%. The company gained 2% market share, he added. E-commerce and FMCG doing well during the pandemic and the revival of the agriculture sector spurred LCV sales in the period. In FY22, the LCV segment is likely to see 30% growth and ALL would be ahead of the curve, he said. “LCV will continue to be a focus area for ALL; [we are] already working on bridging portfolio gaps with a modular range of products that will enable us to look at international markets more aggressively. ALL will also enter five new markets in Africa,” he said. On defence, he said ALL had sufficient orders for the next 15 months. “ALL will bid for tenders in mobility whether for armoured or non-armoured vehicles.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ashok-leyland-bets-on-lcvs-defence-to-grow/article34388937.ece

(RIL) goes through in a reasonable time frame, sources said. Lenders to Future Retail had last week agreed to extend repayment of loans by up to two years, while converting unpaid interest into a funded interest term loan. The penal charges too will be waived under the plan. The recast plan has been approved by a RBI-constituted expert committee headed by K V Kamath.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Padikkal bosses the chase, RCB back on top after mauling RR||Devdutt Padikkal came of age with a brilliant unbeaten 52-ball 101 to guide Royal Challengers Bangalore to a 10-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Thursday. Padikkal’s masterclass took RCB to the top of the points table with a fourth straight win. RR — hampered by the unavailability of key players Jofra Archer, Ben Stokes and Liam Livingstone — slumped to a third loss in four matches. Big impression Padikkal, an immensely talented youngster, made a big impression with his maiden IPL century. That he only recently recovered from COVID-19 made his performance all the more special. The 20-year-old scored his runs at a rapid rate, but there were no wild slogs. The southpaw played late and used pure timing to pierce the gaps. When the bowlers pitched it up, Padikkal brought the bat down with a clean swing, sending the ball far into the stands. Padikkal scored the fastest IPL century by an uncapped player, bettering the record of Paul Valthaty (52b, KXIP v CSK in 2011) by one ball. Chasing 178, openers Padikkal and Virat Kohli (72 n.o.) made short work of the target. During the course of his knock, Kohli became the first cricketer to cross 6,000 runs in the IPL. After being put in, RR lost wickets early, but recovered well to post a healthy score. Jos Buttler, Manan Vohra and David Miller were dismissed cheaply, with Mohammed Siraj and Kyle Jamieson doing the damage. Siraj was impressive once again, taking out Miller with a sharp, fast yorker. Captain Sanju Samson blasted off-spinner Washington Sundar for a huge six, but chipped the next ball to mid-wicket to fall for 21. From 43 for four, RR came back into contention through good knocks from Shivam Dube (46, 32b, 5x4, 2x6), Riyan Parag (25, 16b, 4x4) and Rahul Tewatia (40, 23b, 4x4, 2x6). Dube and Parag put on an attacking 66-run fifth-wicket stand, shifting the initiative back to RR. Pacer Harshal Patel broke the dangerous partnership with a slower ball, which Parag tried to scoop to fine-leg. A top edge, however, landed in the hands of deep third-man. Dube was sent back by a good diving catch by Glenn Maxwell at long-on. Tewatia was deceived by a cutter from Siraj. Harshal and Siraj finished with three wickets each. Harshal retained his spot as the highest wicket-taker (12).  Padikkal played an outstanding and flawless innings. Once he got going, there was no stopping him. I had the best seat in the house Virat Kohli||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/padikkal-bosses-the-chase-rcb-back-on-top-after-mauling-rr/article34389075.ece
23 April 2021||KIELCE (POLAND),||Indian women punch their way to seven gold medals||Indian women boxers, featuring in seven of the 10 summit clashes, performed magnificently to sweep gold in all the categories in the World youth boxing championships here on Thursday. Gitika posted a commanding 5-0 win over local favourite Natalia Kuczewska to claim the 48kg gold medal and give India a fine start. Gitika remained ahead by landing plenty of punches, including a few shots to the head. She switched her tactics to use her feet, stay away from her opponent and deliver some straight punches resulting in a bloodied nose for the Pole in the last two rounds. A fearless Babyrojisana Chanu, an Asian youth champion, bagged the second gold for the country by upsetting European junior champion and taller Russian Valeriia Linkova in the 51kg title clash with a 5-0 margin. Poonam Poonia beat Frenchwoman Sthelyne Grosy 5-0 in the 57kg final. With a power-packed performance, Vinka defeated Zhuldyz Shayakhmetova of Kazakhstan in the 60kg final when the referee stopped the contest in the third round.

For, India’s best-ever women’s tennis player and six-time Grand Slam winner Sania Mirza had a pleasant surprise on Wednesday night when former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli made an appearance at her home for dinner in Dubai. Neighbours now “I have known Marion from the junior days and she has been an amazing champion. It’s wonderful that we are neighbours now,” said Sania. It may be mentioned here that the star India tennis player is currently taking a forced break from tennis because of the second wave of pandemic after being part of the Indian team for the recent Billie Jean King Cup World Group playoffs against Latvia which India lost 1-3. Bartoli’s husband, Yahya Yahya Boumediene , is a professional footballer and is currently in Belgium to see his mother, and she herself is now into coaching, mentoring Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia, who won the 2017 French Open. “She is an old friend of Sania and the two have a wonderful chemistry as they know each other for close to two decades,” said Imran Mirza, father-cum-coach of Sania. “It is always a nice feeling for Sania to see someone who has a similar wavelength on many subjects relating to the sport and, more importantly, the two share mutual respect,” he said. Imran also said that Sania has been really working hard to maintain the desired fitness level and is eagerly waiting for the situation to pave way for some sporting activity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-friendly-pleasant-surprise-for-sania/article34388944.ece
23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||PBKS desperate to arrest slide against MI||Defending champion Mumbai Indians will hope to get its campaign back on track against struggling Punjab Kings in Chennai on Friday. MI’s defeat against Delhi Capitals has raised questions about the middle-order. Against Sunrisers Hyderabad and DC, Mumbai’s batting never hit top gear in the middle overs. Rohit Sharma’s side has been undone by the slowness of the Chepauk surface, with the lack of power-hitting from Kieron Pollard and Hardik Pandya compounding the woes. Pollard has 49 runs from four matches and Hardik, 35. Suryakumar Yadav’s 56 against Kolkata Knight Riders remains the highest score by an MI batsman this season. However, with Jasprit Bumrah among the wickets and Trent Boult in form, MI’s bowling has enough strength. It has generally used two spinners: Krunal Pandya and Rahul Chahar. But against DC, Jayant Yadav got a look in. MI might persist with the same combination against PBKS. With three losses on the trot, PBKS is second from bottom. In Chennai, with the conditions getting tougher for batting, skipper K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal need to begin well. Rahul and Chris Gayle are slow starters, so there could be a case for Nicholas Pooran at No. 3. The inexperienced middle-order is masked by Deepak Hooda and Shahrukh Khan’s power-hitting. In the bowling department, there was an expected departure from the pace-heavy attack. Jhye Richardson and Riley Meredith did not play the last match. Leg-spinner M. Ashwin returned to the starting XI; Ravi Bishnoi is waiting in the ranks. It’s still early days, but PBKS would want to arrest its slide against a settled MI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pbks-desperate-to-arrest-slide-against-mi/article34389064.ece

We have the responsibility to make sure he has got the support he needs and we hope they recover quickly,” added the former New Zealand skipper. The coach also added that he was pleasantly happy with his side’s performances in Mumbai where conditions are not ideal for a spin-based attack. “Winning three out of four probably exceeded the expectations. We felt maybe three out of five or if we got a couple would be good,” said Fleming.

23 April 2021||KOLKATA,||‘ESL is a unique opportunity to ruin football’||The LaLiga president Javier Tebas said that the attempt to have the breakaway European Super League is a unique opportunity to ruin football, and the reforms agreed upon by all for the UEFA Champions League is the way ahead. Tebas was joined by the presidents of five LaLiga clubs — Sevilla FC, Real Betis, Villarreal CF, Valencia CF and Levante UD — who expressed their solidarity with the views of the LaLiga president, in a virtual press conference for the global media. “I have always maintained that the concept of European Super League was a unique opportunity to ruin football. We, at Spanish football, are trying to end this complicated situation as we continue with our financial control model,” Tebas said. “The threats are coming from the big European clubs for a long time. Now that is going to disappear. It is interesting to see what happened in Europe in the last few days. The English clubs withdrew straight away after the fans and the politicians got involved and the same happened with the French clubs after President (Emmanuel) Macron got involved,” Tebas said. Tebas said that the big European clubs wrongly assessed ESL as an opportunity to bail out of the financial crisis. “The question is not about revenue. If we give them more revenue compared to what they can earn, there will be more demand. I think it is better that the big clubs should manage their expenses in a better way,” he said. “Just a few days ago, the European Club Association (ECA), in which all these big clubs are members, voted in favour of having reforms in the UEFA Champions League. The UEFA agreed to this, so what is the point of forming a breakaway league,” Tebas added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/esl-is-a-unique-opportunity-to-ruin-football/article34389298.ece

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||… While the sun shines||Life is not easy for the ‘ugly ducklings’ of the agricultural world. For all the perfectly shaped fruits and vegetables that we buy from the green grocers, there are thousands left on their stalks to rot unharvested in the field simply because they do not meet the aesthetic criteria of retailers. Mumbai-based foodtech innovator Science 4 Society (S4S) Technologies has been working to cut down on this waste by promoting solar dehydration as a way to preserve such produce. In the wake of the lockdown, the company, founded in 2014 by young entrepreneur Vaibhav Tidke along with collegemates Ganesh Bhere, Tushar Gaware, Shital Somani, Ashwin Pawade, Nidhi Pant and Swapnil Kokate, has empowered 2,700 women farmers and 200 micro-entrepreneurs near Aurangabad by training them in dehydration of natural produce. They do this through the patented Solar Conduction Dryer (SCD), a portable solar-powered machine that dries vegetables and spices while retaining nutrients.  “When we started, the business model was about selling our dehydration equipment to farmers. But we realised eventually that what most farmers want is an alternate source of income during the dry season. That’s how we pivoted, and rather than just providing technology, we started buying back the produce in 2018. So we are now not just selling the machine, but also the food dehydrated by it,” says company co-founder Nidhi Pant in a telephone interview from Mumbai. The technology won S4S the 2020 Ashden Award for Energy and Livelihoods, supported by the Waterloo Foundation, U.K. It has been installed in 1,200 sites and is used in France, Jamaica, Nepal, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Bangladesh, besides India. Components of the dehydrator vary according to the size and model selected, though all of them are designed to be user-friendly, especially for women. “We give a cutting machine, a primary processing dryer and solar conduction dryer in our package. The equipment is non-electrical, as power outages are quite common in villages. It is as simple to use as a domestic mixer or grinder. Our dehydrator helps to maintain moisture, colour and aroma, and completes the process in six to seven hours, to minimise microbial growth,” says Nidhi. Four machines with a capacity of 200 kg output, cost around Rs. 1,40,000. Purchasing the equipment isn’t mandatory, as it can be hired by farmers through financial aid. Mutual benefit The company’s twin-pronged business model works with growers and women processors in villages. “S4S Technologies procures the B and C grade produce (that has been rejected by commercial retail sales because of its non-standard appearance) and delivers it to the women who have been trained in the dehydration process. Since 2019, we have been ensuring that the farmers earn an assured income from our work for at least nine months of the year,” says Nidhi. S4S trains women farmers in clusters of 20 per village guided by a field executive, to work on their dehydration projects. The decision to target women agriculturalists was conscious, she says. “Due to the water shortage in the Marathwada region, the growing season is limited to four months of monsoon here. Male farmers are more likely to migrate in search of work elsewhere during the dry season, while the womenfolk are usually left behind. Operating our dehydration equipment allows women farmers to earn from the comfort of their homes. Besides, women are more open to trying new things,” she says. Sunita Dhyaneshwar Muthe, 30, from Khamkheda village in Nashik district, Maharashtra, is one of the many micro-entrepreneurs who have learned to become financially independent with the help of S4S work. “I am from a farming family that grows maize, cotton and bajra . For the past three years, instead of working in the nearby factory during the dry season, I have been drying garlic, turmeric and onion on a contractual basis for S4S at home. I have earned up to Rs. 50,000 last year, which helped us buy seeds, repay vehicle loans and budget other household expenses. Earlier, we would have to borrow money at high interest rates just to buy seeds,” she says. Building stability Amol Padul, an S4S agriculture extension officer, says his mother, Prabhavati from Hatmali village, was among the earliest women agriculturalists to get trained in the project. “My mother started with farming and dehydrating beetroot, ginger and other crops for S4S. She was able to educate me in a city college and fulfil other family responsibilities with her income as a micro-entrepreneur. I feel we have regained some of our self-respect with this kind of ancillary skill.” Saving for posterity While S4S has its own natural snack brand DesiVdesi made with dehydrated produce, it also supplies dried raw material like garlic, ginger, onion, turmeric, coriander and so on, to big players like Nestle, Sodexo, Marico, IRCTC, Taj Stats and Capital Foods. The mechanism can also be used to preserve meats, seafood and spices. The lockdown validated S4S Technologies’ core work, as more farmers returned home to wait out the lean season and started exploring dehydration equipment. Besides earning a decent wage through the decentralised dehydration, the equipment helped them to preserve their harvest when the wholesale markets closed down last year.  The S4S dehydrator is as easy to use as a domestic mixer or grinder||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/while-the-sun-shines/article34389122.ece
23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Open secrets of summer||The hottest days of summer are here, and it is time to pay attention to staying hydrated while replenishing nutrients. There are various healthy summer coolers which help us stay refreshed and energised as the mercury rises. The traditional choices of the hot season: musk melon, watermelon, lemon and tender coconut water are also pocket friendly. Here are some more juices that have been part of southern India’s cuisine for many generations. “It was nungu paal (ice apple-based) and nannari sherbat that we had during my childhood in Thanjavur, but now the options are wider and healthier,” says Devi Bala Chandrasekar, whose foodblog, KitchenDB focusses primarily on traditional, healthy family recipes. “Each region in our country has special cool drinks and I have tried Nellai pazharasam (mixed fruit punch) and the much easier neer moru (spiced buttermilk) during summer,” she adds. Devi Bala shares recipes of herbal summer drinks like lemongrass lemonade, orange and oregano juice, tulsisherbet and variyalisherbet (fennel seeds and raisin) on her blog. Nandita Shah, a homeopath, suggests juicing vegetables. “In north India, aam panna (made with raw mango and jaggery), sol kadhi (a coconut milk drink laced with herbs) and jal jeera (herbs and lemon juice) are popular. But we can also try blending nutrient-rich vegetables with a little lemon juice and mint in a sugar-free drink,” she says. She says sugar can be substituted with dates paste or raisins. She also suggests drinking tender coconut chaas, made by combining half a cup of creamy tender coconut kernel, eight drops of lemon juice, two-and-a--half cups of water and one teaspoon chaas masala.  “When it comes to vegetable juices, everyone prefers carrots and beetroots, which are naturally sweet. But try blending any kind of gourd along with raw mango (the kilimooku variety) and you will enjoy it,” says Sreedevi Lakshmikutty of Coimbatore-based Biobasics. Electrical mixer/blenders have made fresh juices easy to make at home. “But we must aim at making these without sugar or at least substituting it with palm sugar or jaggery,” she says. Sreedevi suggests trying blending curry leaves with coconut milk seasoned with some salt and palm sugar and adding little water to make it a nutrient loaded drink for the season. “I wonder why people have stopped drinking the ragi koozh ( fermented porridge ) or the simple lemon water with a pinch of salt,” she adds. Pune-based Neha Mathur, who blogs at The Whiskaffairs, says “In Pune, chaas, shikanji and Jeera soda are a daily affair during summer months. I make beetroot chaas which looks great, tastes good and kids simply love it. Also cucumber blended with tender coconut flesh can also be added to the regular chaas as it can cool the body,” says Neha. Down south, it has always been the neeraagaram or pazhaya sadam (cooked rice fermented in water overnight) that has been the saviour for many during the harsh weather, says Seethalalshmi N., of Organic Farmers Market, Chennai. She adds, “Using heritage rice and making sure to soak few fenugreek seeds along with the rice can promote health and keep the body cool and has numerous health benefits.” She adds that “soaking sabja seeds and almond gum overnight in water, and adding lemon juice and water and a pinch of salt makes a wonderful drink.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/open-secrets-of-summer/article34389127.ece

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Brick by Brick A treasure of sorts||The story so far: Neel and Mohit are terrified to find bricks flying out of the fireplace on their own. When they explore, along with Susan, they find a hidden space.  Neel stared into the fireplace. “I’m not touching it!” he said. “Suppose it’s an animal trap or something and it snaps shut on me?” He and Mohit sat back on their heels to think about what they should do but Susan didn’t wait. She just leaned in and pulled out what was in the hidden space. It was a tin. “Treasure!” said Mohit and Neel together, brave once again and anxious to get their hands on the tin. “Does it look like the kind of thing in which treasure would be hidden?” she asked, putting the old and rusty tin on the floor. The boys didn’t reply. They kept staring at the tin but didn’t want to touch it, so Susan pried it open. There was a book wrapped in an oil cloth inside. Priced pages “Maybe it has a treasure map in it!” said Mohit. “Really? A full book’s worth of treasure maps?” scoffed Neel. Susan intervened. “Stop it! Let’s see what’s in it. We have found it for a reason.” She opened the book and turned the yellowed pages carefully. They were covered with squiggles and numbers and more squiggles. “I can’t read it!” she wailed. ‘It’s in another language!’ “It must be someone’s diary with directions to a treasure!” said Mohit. “With numbers?” said Susan. “Uh – uh – you know, a paint-with-numbers kind of thing…” improvised Mohit. “Oh, it could be someone’s accounts…” said Neel. “…of the amount of treasure they have hidden…” said Mohit, refusing to let go of his treasure idea. Neel and Susan burst out laughing. Susan murmured, “Maybe it’s a diary of meetings between two people. You know, dates and things…” ***** It was a full week later when Susan came panting up the hill to the two boys when they were eating lunch under the trees. “You won’t believe what’s in that book!’ said Susan. “I got someone to translate for me; and you were right. It is a treasure book of sorts.” The boys sat up straight. “What do you mean?’ “You know how our great-great-something-grandfathers were taken away from India and made to work in Fiji? That book had a record of all the financial dealings of the owner of that big house and it showed that he had secretly sold people to be shipped off to foreign countries…” Neel was thunderstruck. “So the fireplace was really trying to tell us something, wasn’t it?” Susan nodded. “And we were meant to find the book. The facts, figures, names are all here. It is like a historical document.”  Mohit said, “Do you know? I have a feeling that now, if we brick up that fireplace, it will stay bricked up!” Neel made a face at him. “So, just go and do it!” he said. “I think you’re beginning to enjoy working!” Mohit laughed and put his arm on his shoulders. “So are you, my friend, so are you. So, let’s do it together!”  The End||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/brick-by-brick-a-treasure-of-sorts/article34389916.ece
23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||When Daksha’s cake was cooked||Daksha looked at the blank page. She had been sitting like this for two hours and been unable to write even one line. Her mother had told her she could not leave the room until she completed her assignment. Last evening, after returning from the library, she had left her books in the dining room. Now she realised the folly of it. If only she had listened to her parents about not leaving her things lying around, her books would be in the room and she could be reading them. But, instead, she was stuck in the room with this assignment. But wait a minute! Her mother had packed a whole lot of books and put them in the loft in her room. Very quietly, she climbed up on her table and opened the loft. There it was! The carton of books. She opened it, grabbed the first few books and got down. Something to read The first was an old recipe book, then two accounting books, a Learn French and, finally, an old tattered copy of The Duchess Bakes a Cake . Happy with her success, she settled down to read. She got so involved that she did not notice it was late. She was dragged out of her book when she heard the incessant calls of her mother. “Daksha! Daksha! Dinner is ready!” “Oh no!” she said, looking at the clock. “Is that the time?” She put away her book and went down for dinner. “Have you finished your assignment?” asked her mother. “Hmmm,” she muttered, knowing she would be in trouble if she said that she hadn’t yet started. “Considering the amount you read, it should be a piece of cake for you,” said her father. The assignment was simple: Write a short story. But Daksha was too lazy to apply her mind. She preferred to curl up and read. After dinner, she said a hasty goodnight to her parents and retreated to her room. “I’d better start work on it or I’m going to be in serious trouble,” she said to herself. Once again, she sat in front of her notebook. The Duchess Bakes a Cake lay on her table. She had an idea. She began to rewrite the story; substituting the duchess for a princess and changing everything to an Indian context and quickly finished her story. As she had not finished reading the book, she made up her ending. When she re-read her story, she knew it was good. A couple of days later, in school, the English teacher walked in with all the assignments and called Daksha to the front and asked her to read her story aloud. Daksha was proud of the recognition. When she finished, the teacher asked Daksha what had inspired her story. “It is pure imagination, ma’am,” she lied. “I’m not so sure, Daksha,” replied her teacher. “Because I remember reading a story similar to this. Only it was a duchess that baked the cake, not a princess. And of course, the story was not set in India…” Caught, Daksha confessed that the idea — in fact, the whole story — was from the book The Duchess Bakes a Cake !

Once you get involved in theatre, it boosts your confidence, shapes your personality. I began to feel that I could do something.” He remembers watching practice sessions of Shafi Inamdar directing Gujarati plays and acting in iconic Marathi plays like Vasant Kanetkar’s Ashroonchi Zhali Phule . “The play inspired many films, including the Dilip Kumar-Anil Kapoor starrer Mashaal. I used to play Anil sir’s part. Given a chance, I would like to do it again, as the play remains meaningful,” he says. Now, it is payback time and Shreyas has launched Nine Rasa, an OTT platform dedicated to theatre. Already live, it has more than 100 hours of content in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati and English. More importantly, it has provided opportunities to around 1,500 actors and technicians during the pandemic. “The idea came into being after phone calls were exchanged as to what could be done for the theatre community. I felt when everything is going online, why not theatre. After all, it is one of the oldest art forms. When people are missing theatre, why should it remain limited to auditoriums,” asks Shreyas. “When I used to do theatre, we had shows on weekdays as well, but gradually theatre was reduced to a weekend activity. Online shows will not have such limitations.” No retakes But isn’t theatre all about live response, no retakes, and cuts? “No two ways about it. The magic of a live performance cannot be replicated in any other medium,” admits Shreyas. “But it is a great opportunity to document theatre and reach homes. Given a chance, I would have continued in theatre. Because of the limited returns, one must explore multiple options to keep home fires burning.” Talking about Nine Rasa, Shreyas underlines the efforts that have been made to see that the sanctity of the medium is retained. “We ensure that there are minimum cuts and no gimmickry. Shooting a play allows you to improve upon the visual and sound quality.” “First,” he says, “we expect the cast to perform the play as they do on stage. Maza aa raha hai toh barkarar rakhen (if they are having fun, we expect them to continue).” Afterwards, if required, some close-ups or a few camera shots are recorded. Lapel mics are now common on stage and performances are less ‘loud’ than what they used to be when the voice needed to reach the last row. Sometimes, he says, it depends on the instinct of the director and the quality of the audience as well. “When Utpal Dutt was once asked why his plays are loud, he said it was because he wanted to be heard. His plays made socio-political statements. Sometimes a dash of slapstick has to be added to help the audience understand the essence of the play and the message it wants to convey.” Audience reaction is crucial to theatre. “We did want to bring the audience inside during the shoot but the restrictions during the pandemic don’t allow it,” he adds. On the quality and variety of content, Shreyas says that an attempt has been made to include various shades of theatre on the platform. “It is not just about Hindi and Marathi commercial theatre. We have plays in different languages and genres. There are full-length plays, one-act plays, comedies, dramas, thrillers, experimental theatre, etc. Ekanki or one-act plays are like 20-20 cricket matches and should appeal to the millennials.” A bit of everything In future, he says, they would like to stream musicals like Mughal-e- Azam and also international productions. “Whatever is possible on stage, will be available on the platform, including skits and stand-up comedy. The good thing about today’s generation is that it likes to try everything.” Shreyas is in touch with stalwarts such as Naseeruddin Shah and Nadira Babbar and is hoping they will bring their productions to the platform. Classic plays of Dinesh Thakur’s Ank Theatre Group such as Bibiyon Ka Madarsa and Hai Mera Dilare already being staged . “Some of them have reservations about the online format and want to wait a while before coming on board,” says Shreyas. Interesting plays such as Pashmina and Pause  are already online and he is looking forward to Ae Ladki , an adaptation of Krishna Sobti’s story. “We only buy the rights of the recorded productions. The producers are free to stage their plays on ground when the condition improves and we don’t expect any share in revenue unless we are co-producing the play,” says Shreyas, who is working out a model where all the stakeholders can have a steady revenue stream. How does his platform compare with a channel like Zee Theatre? Shreyas says those channels also have theatre, but “we only have theatre.” Theatre reflects the reality of everyday life but Shreyas is staying clear of controversial productions. “Our mantra is to engage, entertain and enrich,” he says.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Dance like a boy||They are known as Gotipuas (‘goti’ means single and ‘pua’ is boy in Odia), but they have to dance dressed as girls and in groups. Born out of the tradition of devotion, the struggle for survival over the years has reduced them to mere entertainers. A precursor of Odissi, Gotipua is now facing the biggest threat from Odissi itself. “There was a time when Odissi followed the Gotipua dance style. Now it is the other way round — Gotipuas follow Odissi,” said Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee and well-known Gotipua guru Birabar Sahoo in an interview to this writer a few years ago. . Ironically, on a recent trip to village Dimirisena, located about 35 km from Puri and known as the cradle of the 400-year-old Gotipua tradition, I attended a dance festival that featured mostly Odissi dancers. Dancing for gods  Organised by Satyapira Palai, a well-known Gotipua exponent, the annual event was meant to showcase the village’s dance heritage. “It is here that Gotipua is practised as an offering to the divine, and in its most authentic form, without the modern acrobatic movements. We adhered to tradition even with costume, make-up and music. But this meant losing out on performance opportunities outside Dimirisena. Some 30 years ago, for the survival of our troupe, we gave in to the demands of festival organisers and brought about changes in our presentation. Yet, we have not completely lost touch with the tradition of dancing for the gods,” says Satyapira. If Gotipua dance has survived and is being performed across the globe today, it is due to bandha (complex body postures) and the formation of human pyramids that has become the principal attraction of the dance style, say its exponents, including Satyapira. “Gone are the days when kings and zamindars patronised Gotipua troupes. We are now entirely governed by market forces. So we have no choice but to cater to changing trends,” says Bhubaneswar-based Bijay Kumar Sahoo, an Odissi dancer, who grew up performing Gotipua at Balunkeswar temple in Dimirisena. He now owns a popular Gotipua troupe, Naxatra Gurukul, that gets several opportunities to perform and earn. However, there is one exception. Gautam Mohapatra, who also used to perform at Balunkeswar temple, has been teaching at Nilakentheswar Gotipua gurukul near Dimirisena for the past 12 years. He still follows the tradition of the boys singing and dancing simultaneously. Gautam’s repertoire has more avinaya (expressional dance) pieces set to songs of medieval Odia literature and the choreography excludes gymnastic poses or human pyramids. In 2011, he surprised everyone with a solo presentation in the true tradition of ‘Gotipua’, at the first-ever Gotipua festival hosted by the State government in Bhubaneswar. “When Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s Gaudiya Vaishnavism entered Odisha from Bengal, it influenced a panoply of religious and cultural practices. Its paratopic religiosity generated the Gotipua tradition. Gotipuas were celebrated for their artistic virtuosity and religious devotion,” says Anurima Banerji, associate professor of dance at the University of California-Los Angeles, who researched the Devadasi and Gotipua traditions for her recently published seminal book, Dancing Odissi. Unlike the Maharis, the devadasis of Odisha, whose role was confined to the temples, Gotipuas had the advantage of performing at both sacred and secular spaces, both for gods and for people. As a result, they have been the carriers of Odisha’s dance, music, literature and religious beliefs over centuries. Odissi thus owes more to the Gotipua tradition than the Mahari. “Although Odissi imbibed a lot from Gotipua and gained global recognition as a classical dance form in a very short span of time, Gotipua was totally marginalised. While the child got recognition, the mother was ignored,” rues septuagenarian Guru Gobinda Pal, an exponent of both Gotipua and Odissi. Artistes like him have reason to be frustrated, what with the Odisha government hosting and supporting several Odissi dance festivals while largely ignoring Gotipua. Ashok Kumar Tripathy, former Commissioner of Culture, should be credited with conceptualising and launching a Gotipua festival in 2011, bringing some hope to dancers looking for state patronage. Eight troupes were invited to participate in the festival, where 21 exponents were honoured. The government declared that the festival would be a regular feature of the annual cultural calendar, but that has not happened. What has hit the artistes really hard now is the Odisha Department of Culture’s latest rule that those seeking admission to the state-run Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya for a degree in Odissi, would have to score high marks in their high-school exams. “It is surprising that our expertise and experience are not being taken into account,” says Gurupada Baliarsingh, secretary of the newly-formed Utkal Samskruti Gotipua Sangha, a forum for Gotipua troupes. “Being performers from a young age, we hardly get to focus on academics. We are now demanding reservation of seats in the college for Gotipua dancers.” The winds of change are blowing fast over this old, traditional form, with Gotipua’s earthy elements being refined rapidly to make it appear like Odissi. It’s a process by which much is lost. “The beauty of Gotipua lies in its inherent rawness. Let the thin line of demarcation remain to save Gotipua from further degeneration,” says Guru Gobinda Pal.  The independent journalist from Odisha writes on cultural affairs.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||On the trail of Muvva’s unsung poet||The ‘sacred geography’ of India, to borrow a term made famous by author Diana L. Eck, is dotted with villages and towns that are historically and emotionally connected to one popular deity of a local temple, who takes precedence over all others. Tirupati in the south or Benaras in the north may just be names that resonate in our collective consciousness but there are many other such places, perhaps less celebrated but just as important for the devout. Most of these deities, especially in south India, have been the silent force behind the musical genius of many a composer or poet, lending a touch of renown to these small villages and towns. Think Tyagaraja and Tiruvaiyaru; think Annamayya and Tirupati, think Bhakta Ramadasu and Bhadrachalam. Place and poet are conjoined for eternity. Muvva, in present-day Andhra Pradesh, is one such temple town. The place is intimately connected with its local deity, Venugopala Swamy, who is the protagonist of many padams penned by the inimitable Kshetrayya. As Muvva’s Venugopala Swamy, the god is immortalised as the young cavorting Krishna, playing his flute, feet crossed in the holy swastika. Not many people might know that Muvva is the birthplace of another poet, who has remained shrouded in relative obscurity. Puvvada Sri Ramadasu, born in 1845, was also a gifted son of Muvva. Perhaps a contemporary of Muthuswami Dikshitar, he is believed to have penned several hundred compositions. Ramadasu’s piety is celebrated with a legend of how he was once bitten by a rattlesnake, but carried on with his prayers unperturbed, following which the impressed rattlesnake returned and sucked the poison out from him. Unfortunately, of the hundreds of keertanas written by him, only 10 have survived, a great loss to musical history. Now, a descendant of Sri Ramadasu, Puvvada Venugopal, has taken up the task of putting together these 10 compositions and making them available to not just music connoisseurs but also lay persons.  Restoring old works Venugopal, head of Engineering Design at Qualcomm in Bengaluru, seemingly far removed from the world of art and culture, is committed to the idea of restoring his ancestor to his rightful place in the pantheon of Telugu poet-composers. Along with his brother Vithal, sister Sreedevi, and wife Meera, Venugopal is spearheading the revival project that was initiated by his father Thikkana Somayaji, a writer of padyalu (Telugu poetry). Somayaji collected all available material and published the book Muvva Gopala Swamy Keertanalu in 1990. The family has a long-standing and illustrious association with poetry and music. Puvvada Seshagiri Rao, Venugopal’s grandfather, was also a celebrated writer of padyalu. Telugu padyalu are rich in content and complex, with great importance accorded to meter, of which there is a dazzling variety, often leading to highly challenging permutations and combinations of syllables and words. It was Seshagiri Rao’s father who salvaged about 30 of Sri Ramadasu’s manuscripts but a fire destroyed all but 10. The compositions give a glimpse of the versatility of the poet who wrote in praise of not just Venugopala Swamy but also other deities such as Rama and Shiva as Bhimeshwara and Ramalingeshwara — a secular approach rarely seen in poet-composers, who are usually devoted to one particular god. Ramadasu’s songs are mostly steeped in the spirit of sharanagati or surrender, with the exception of one, which opens with very unusual lyrics. The narrator, a gopika, is remonstrating with Krishna and telling him not to come seeking her as she is now a nursing mother and doesn’t have any time or inclination for frivolities! One wonders at the wealth of writing that must have emanated from the quill of this man if this unusual piece is anything to go by. Since the songs seem amenable to dance, the revival has been designed as an audio-visual project that includes choreographies in Bharatanatyam by Bengaluru-based dancer Geeta Sirisha. Several other people are on board, with the pieces set to tune by vidwan Srivatsa, a musician from Bengaluru, while a few others are being composed by Keertana Vaidyanathan, a disciple of Bombay Jayashri. Aalaap, a Chennai-based platform for the performing arts, is the social media partner for this project, and it hopes to reach out to a larger audience through the videos, opening up the door to further possibilities of collaboration.  The classical dancer is the artistic director of Feet on Earth.   The compositions give a glimpse of the versatility of the poet who wrote in praise of not just Venugopala Swamy but also other deities such as Rama and Shiva as Bhimeshwara and Ramalingeshwara||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/on-the-trail-of-muvvas-unsung-poet/article34389526.ece
23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||A perfect ten||Thematic concerts demand more diligent research, meticulous planning and flawless execution than the usual recitals. Vignesh Ishwar’s recent ‘Dasavataram’ concert for Naada Inbam was a perfect blueprint for this kind of presentation. He commenced with a Periyazhwar Pasuram, ‘Devudaiya meenamaay’, explaining the 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu to Andal. For Matsyavatar, Vignesh chose verses of Vadiraja Swamy, starting with ‘Proshteesa vigraha su’. He aptly rendered it in raga Jalarnava (Khanda Chapu talam). Vadiraja Swamy speaks of how, at the end of the Yuga, the Matsya uses his horn to support the vahana that keeps everyone afloat during the deluge. For Kurmavatar, the second avatar, Vignesh chose Periyazhwar’s Pasuram, ‘Malai mugadu mel vaiththu vasukiyaichutri’ in a brilliant Atana. His expansive swaraprastara drew an equally splendid response from R.K. Shriramkumar on the violin. After a magnificent alapana in Sri, Vignesh sang Purandaradasa’s Devarnama, ‘Adi varahana’ (Misra Chapu) for Varaha avatar. Shriramkumar’s elucidation of Sri was equally soothing. “The inability to perceive the sacred feet of Lord Adi Varaha has hurt my eyes,” says the composer. Muthuswami Dikshitar’s ‘Narasimha Asrayami Satatam’ (Jayasuddha Malavi – Tisra Triputa talam), with a splendid chittaswara, was Vignesh’s choice for Narasimhavatar. Verses from Avatara Keertana in Malayalam starting with ‘Ooda moham mahabali thannude’ and Andal’s Tiruppavai ‘Ongi ulagalanda’ (Arabhi) were chosen for Vamana avatar. Three verses from Narayana Bhattatiri’s Narayaneeyam, appealingly tuned by Shriramkumar in Purvikalyani, were sung for Parasurama avatar. Here, Bhattatiri sees Parasurama in Lord Guruvayurappa. Vignesh rendered a lilting raga alapana and tanam for this song, responded to amazingly by Shriramkumar. Melodic raga phrases The piece de resistance was Tyagaraja’s ‘Rama ni samanamevaru’ (Karaharapriya-Rupakam), after an expansive alapana. The niraval was at ‘Paluku paluku’, followed by a swaraprastara with several melodic phrases ending in rishabha. For Balarama avatar, the vocalist took verses starting with ‘Jayatu Srihari, hey ashesa janadhari’, (Hamsadhwani-Misra Chapu), from the Odia Dandi Ramayana by Sri Balaramadasa, one of the poets of the Panchasakha group. Here, describing the swarupa of Balarama, the composer says, ‘Balabhadra, you are Vishnu. All the Devatas worship you.’ After a leisurely yet power-packed Kamboji, Vignesh took up Narayana Tirtha’s Tarangam ‘Nandagopala Krishna (Misra Chapu). Niraval was at ‘Devadi kritha moda’. The kalpanaswaras were unique in as much as they were slow-paced, bringing out the gentle aspect of this raga. The thani by K. Arun Prakash (mridangam) and Anirudh Atreya (kanjira) was out of the box, with both vidwans using a feather touch. The tisra kuraippu was stunning. Special mention must be made of the pair’s expertise in enriching the rendition of the songs. In the kirtana for Kalki avatar, ‘Jayati jayati Mahavishnur’ (Revathi-Misra Chapu), one saw what a creative composer Shriramkumar is. Jayadeva in his first Ashtapadi, ‘Pralaya Payodhijale’, describes all avatars including Buddha as forms of Krishna. The vocalist rendered it as a Ragamalika, tuned by Kadayanallur Venkataraman. M.S. Subbulakshmi used to render it like this as well. Vignesh wound up the two-and-a-half-hour concert with ‘Vedanuddharate’, a sloka from the Ashtapathi, in Surutti.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Looking beyond Swati Tirunal||Three-and-a-half decades had passed since Puthucode Krishnamoorthy’s death when the musician’s daughter Uma Parvathy put together a collection of five compositions. “This is Devi Pancharatnam, penned and notated by my father. It would be nice if you could sing them,” ,” she told vocalist Baby Sreeram during the monsoons last year. Within weeks, Carnatic music lovers got to hear the well-tuned Malayalam kritis. The online event organised last year to pay tribute to Krishnamoorthy had five artistes singing the Devi Pancharatnam. Like the Nattai-to-Sri raga sequence of the famed Tyagaraja Pancharatnam, Krishnamoorthy’s kritis stick to the format of swara patterns subsequently finding expression in words. “But unlike Tyagaraja’s Pancharatnam where all the songs are in Adi tala, here each is set in a different tala,” points out Santhala Raju, who performed at the event. Undiscovered gems  Krishnamoorthy, who comes from Puthucode, a village 40 km southwest of Palakkad, is one among several of Kerala’s Carnatic composers whose works remain undiscovered. The recent Gana Kairali festival addressed this issue by featuring almost 200 songs in Malayalam and other languages by composers from the region. Veteran musician K. Omanakutty, who chairs Sangeeta Bharati, which organised the festival in association with the State Department of Culture and Bharat Bhavan, says Carnatic music practitioners of Kerala suffer from an ‘needless’ inferiority complex. “In the 1990s,” she reminisces, “after a concert at the Madras Music Academy, a rasika came up to me to know the composer of ‘Ananda rupa hare’ that I sang in Pantuvarali. ‘Kutti Kunju Thangachi,’ I replied. She wanted to know why audiences don’t get to hear such compositions more often. Similarly, during a concert in New Delhi, flautist Mala Chandrasekhar was overwhelmed by my rendition of ‘Karuna cheyvan enthu thamasam’.” ‘Karuna cheyvan,’ in Sri ragam, is by Irayimman Thampi (1982-1856), who was a musician in the court of Swati Tirunal and Thangachi (1820-1904) is his daughter. For aficionados at large, much of Kerala’s Carnatic contribution begins and ends with the Travancore Maharaja, Swati Tirunal. Vocalist K.N. Renganatha Sarma agrees, but says Malayalam is yet to generate a significant bank of Carnatic kritis. “The lines ought to be classical for the music to sound elevating,” he says.  All the same, the Malabar coast has contributed excellent classical compositions in languages besides Malayalam. This, much before the language acquired its modern form in the 16th century. Musician S. Saketharaman points to the hymns penned by the 12 Azhwars of the first millennium CE. “Thirteen of their 108 slokas praising Vishnu’s abodes pertain to what is now Kerala. Much later, Lalithadasar, a 20th century composer, wrote kritis in Telugu, Sanskrit and Tamil besides Malayalam,” says the vocalist. Lalithadasar ( alias T.G. Krishna Iyer), who hailed from Tripunithura, worked as a civil engineer in Madras. He was a contemporary of Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar (1896-1974). Most Chembai concerts featured the Hamsanandi raga kriti ‘Paavana guru,’ the most popular of Lalithadasar’s 150-odd kritis. A frontline Chembai disciple, the versatile 89-year-old T.V. Gopalakrishnan, also belongs to Tripunithura. “Because of his mastery over mridangam, his compositions revel in kanakku (arithmetic) but without comprising on aesthetics,” says TVG’s disciple Rajkumar Bharati. “When the poet is also a musician, the composition gains a holistic appeal,” says senior vocalist Mavelikkara P. Subramaniam. “We need a fine blend of dhatu (notes) and matu (words),” he adds, citing examples of a string of Kerala composers, from Swati Tirunal (1813-1846) to the Kochi-based N.P. Ramaswamy, who died in 2019. Ramaswamy’s great-grandfather, composer Palakkad Parameswara Bhagavatar, served at the Travancore court. He popularised Swati Tirunal’s Utsavaprabandham kritis particularly, through his discourses. The 12-song Utsavaprabandham, which essays in different meters the ten-day festival at Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram, has 42 lengthy verses in Sanskritised Malayalam — Manipravalam. This hybrid language, with a history dating to 11th century CE, enriched Carnatic music through the works of composers such as K.C. Kesava Pillai (1868-1913) and Thamarasseri Krishnan Bhattathiri (1890-1963) . Since Independence, Akashvani in Kerala played a major role in propagating Carnatic kritis from the State. “The role of dramatist-lawyer ‘Mali’ Madhavan Nair (1915-94) as the broadcast head merits special mention,” says instrumentalist-music critic S. Sivaramakrishnan. “In the 1970s, AIR used to feature exclusive Carnatic-teaching programmes with the focus on Kerala. Sadly, not even a tenth of the repertoire is found today.” In the subsequent decade, Carnatic exponent Cherthala Gopalan Nair (1923-97), who worked with AIR, set to tune quite a few Swati Tirunal kritis such as ‘Aliveni’ (Dwijavanti) or ‘Bhajabhaja manasa’ (Sindhu Bhairavi), says his musician-son G. Sriram. “Even Thampi’s ‘Karuna cheyvan,’ and ‘Adimalarina thanne’ (Mukhari) and Thangachi’s ‘Ananda rupa’ were set to tune by him, besides those by Kesava Pillai, Keerikad Gopala Pillai, North Malabar’s Kuttamath Kunjikrishna Kurup, and Kottayam Kerala Varma.” Earlier, in the 1940s, titans such as Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer brought out books with notations for 100 Swati Tirunal kritis. The practice of the writer of the songs not being the composer continues. Some Sanskrit works by retired bureaucrat ‘Tulasivanam’ R. Ramachandran Nair feature in the concerts of veteran musicians T.V. Sankaranarayanan and T.N. Seshagopalan. Many of them were tuned by scholar-teacher R. Prabhakara Varma (1928-2008), who also wrote Carnatic compositions. Varma’s disciple ‘Poornathrayee’ Jayaprakash Sharma has 400 kritis to his credit. C.S. Krishna Iyer, another 20th-century musician from Palakkad, has written Carnatic kritis that often dealt with emotions beyond bhakti and he composed music for the same. “In the 1960s, he, along with Puthucode Krishnamoorthy and V. Dakshinamurthy, composed music for modern poems by Sankara Kurup, Vennikulam Gopala Kurup, Kunhiraman Nair and N.V. Krishna Warrier,” says Krishna Iyer’s student Sadanam K. Harikumar, who has composed two dozen Malayalam kritis. Percussionist Vaikom Venugopal suggests the inclusion of songs by Kerala composers in the syllabus of the State’s music colleges. Adds vocalist B. Arundhathi: “Malayalam-speaking Carnatic musicians must ensure that their concerts include works of composers from the region.” In 2012, the first Kochi-Muziris Biennale hosted a vocal concert focusing on composers of Kerala. Sreevalsan J. Menon presented 14 kritis of composers ranging from fifth century Jain monk Ilango Adigal and philosopher Adi Shankara to songs in Jewish and Arabi Malayalam, bhakti poet Poonathanam (1547-1640) and a Kathakali song by Kottarakkara Thampuran. Since the 18th century, Kerala has been enriching the Carnatic repertoire with the works of satirist Kunchan Nambiar, Shadkala Govinda Marar, Rugmini Bayi (Swati Tirunal’s sister), and Neelakanta Sivan. One has heard ‘Sagara shayana vibho’, composed by M.D. Ramanathan, more often from his fellow musician and Palakkad native K.V. Narayanaswamy. The recent ‘Gana Kairali’ festival saw Vizianagaram’s Manda Sudharani presenting a Tamil piece by T. Lakshmana Pillai (1964-1950) of Thiruvananthapuram. It was, essentially, Andhra Pradesh’s salute to Kerala’s Carnatic lineage.  The writer is a keen follower of Kerala’s performing arts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/looking-beyond-swati-tirunal/article34389503.ece
23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Some musical bytes||Senior musician N. Vijay Siva recently inaugurated a novel video series titled ‘Vande Sangeetam’ on his YouTube channel. The first episode titled ‘Kaveri Saveri’ sees Vijay sitting by the Kapila River, its pristine waters flowing behind him. He talks of the importance of rivers to civilisation and the fact that many prominent Carnatic composers, Tygaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Syama Sastri, hailed from the banks of the Cauvery, and intersperses the narrative with with informative anecdotes. He then sings Dikshitar’s ‘Kari kalabha mukham,’ a song in Saveri, on the Dundi Ganapati deity located on the shores of the Cauvery in Mayiladuthurai. Vijay likes to know the word-by-word meanings of the songs he sings. He does not use any mnemonic aids at concerts. In these videos too, he delivers his content without notes, in easily comprehensible English, moving from anecdote to anecdote, switching effortlessly to singing while strumming the tanpura himself. With some 12 episodes filmed over three consecutive days, a lot of effort must have gone in to present an in-depth account in a free-flowing, viewer-friendly format. Five-member team A team of five is behind the series — Vijay, two friends who provided instantaneous feedback on site, and the camera crew of Pramod Gokhale (his long-time student) and his wife Akshatha. Aesthetically presented, the videos have been filmed in picturesque settings that catch the viewers’ attention. Pramod and Akshatha scoped out locations, zeroing in on the Mundaje area of South Kanara district in Karnataka. Some locales were hilly and tricky to navigate, even sometimes requiring Vijay to be lowered down carefully with ropes. Pramod and Akshatha handled the introductory graphics, recording and post-production. Lest we think this is a series about rivers alone, Episode 2, released this Wednesday, is titled ‘Margam Tyagaraja’ and filmed in a lush green farm surrounded by banana saplings. Taking off from how Tyagaraja has an Aradhana all his own, Vijay explains how the composer stands apart from others in being the only one to show musicians how to be professionals in the art form and yet to attain salvation. He sings the relevant compositions of Tyagaraja that illustrate how to produce the voice, how and when to practise, the dos and don’ts, including a little-known fact, that the composer advocated alapana and niraval singing but not kalpanaswarams. Subsequent episodes, Vijay says, will explore other topics ranging across composers, stalwart musicians, ragas and thoughts on puranas. According to the musician, the plan is to release an episode a week for a year or so, time and circumstances permitting. “Once concert schedules get back to normal, the project might become harder to manage.” The goal, he explains, is to engage with rasikas in a productive manner, sharing information that is relevant not just now but for posterity. The series makes it evident that Vijay Siva has combined his formidable knowledge of compositions with what he has assimilated from books as well as gleaned from interactions with musical stalwarts. The author writes on classical music and musicians.   The goal, Vijay Siva explains, is to engage with rasikas in a productive manner, sharing information that is relevant not just now but for posterity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/some-musical-bytes/article34389531.ece

Divyasena, will release a virtual dance production ‘Jai Hanuman,’ made in collaboration with Vasu Digitals, on April 25. Conceptualised and choreographed by Divyasena, the theme is from Hanuman Chalisa by Saint Tulsidas . Swaras and jatis are interwoven with lyrics to add to the visual appeal.   The dance production will be available for viewing on Divyanjali’s YouTube channel on May 4. ‘Jai Hanuman’ was shot over a period of five days at various locations across Andhra Pradesh.

23 April 2021||April 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Looking beyond Swati Tirunal||Three-and-a-half decades had passed since Puthucode Krishnamoorthy’s death when the musician’s daughter Uma Parvathy put together a collection of five compositions. “This is Devi Pancharatnam, penned and notated by my father. It would be nice if you could sing them,” ,” she told vocalist Baby Sreeram during the monsoons last year. Within weeks, Carnatic music lovers got to hear the well-tuned Malayalam kritis. The online event organised last year to pay tribute to Krishnamoorthy had five artistes singing the Devi Pancharatnam. Like the Nattai-to-Sri raga sequence of the famed Tyagaraja Pancharatnam, Krishnamoorthy’s kritis stick to the format of swara patterns subsequently finding expression in words. “But unlike Tyagaraja’s Pancharatnam where all the songs are in Adi tala, here each is set in a different tala,” points out Santhala Raju, who performed at the event. Undiscovered gems  Krishnamoorthy, who comes from Puthucode, a village 40 km southwest of Palakkad, is one among several of Kerala’s Carnatic composers whose works remain undiscovered. The recent Gana Kairali festival addressed this issue by featuring almost 200 songs in Malayalam and other languages by composers from the region. Veteran musician K. Omanakutty, who chairs Sangeeta Bharati, which organised the festival in association with the State Department of Culture and Bharat Bhavan, says Carnatic music practitioners of Kerala suffer from an ‘needless’ inferiority complex. “In the 1990s,” she reminisces, “after a concert at the Madras Music Academy, a rasika came up to me to know the composer of ‘Ananda rupa hare’ that I sang in Pantuvarali. ‘Kutti Kunju Thangachi,’ I replied. She wanted to know why audiences don’t get to hear such compositions more often. Similarly, during a concert in New Delhi, flautist Mala Chandrasekhar was overwhelmed by my rendition of ‘Karuna cheyvan enthu thamasam’.” ‘Karuna cheyvan,’ in Sri ragam, is by Irayimman Thampi (1982-1856), who was a musician in the court of Swati Tirunal and Thangachi (1820-1904) is his daughter. For aficionados at large, much of Kerala’s Carnatic contribution begins and ends with the Travancore Maharaja, Swati Tirunal. Vocalist K.N. Renganatha Sarma agrees, but says Malayalam is yet to generate a significant bank of Carnatic kritis. “The lines ought to be classical for the music to sound elevating,” he says.  All the same, the Malabar coast has contributed excellent classical compositions in languages besides Malayalam. This, much before the language acquired its modern form in the 16th century. Musician S. Saketharaman points to the hymns penned by the 12 Azhwars of the first millennium CE. “Thirteen of their 108 slokas praising Vishnu’s abodes pertain to what is now Kerala. Much later, Lalithadasar, a 20th century composer, wrote kritis in Telugu, Sanskrit and Tamil besides Malayalam,” says the vocalist. Lalithadasar ( alias T.G. Krishna Iyer), who hailed from Tripunithura, worked as a civil engineer in Madras. He was a contemporary of Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar (1896-1974). Most Chembai concerts featured the Hamsanandi raga kriti ‘Paavana guru,’ the most popular of Lalithadasar’s 150-odd kritis. A frontline Chembai disciple, the versatile 89-year-old T.V. Gopalakrishnan, also belongs to Tripunithura. “Because of his mastery over mridangam, his compositions revel in kanakku (arithmetic) but without comprising on aesthetics,” says TVG’s disciple Rajkumar Bharati. “When the poet is also a musician, the composition gains a holistic appeal,” says senior vocalist Mavelikkara P. Subramaniam. “We need a fine blend of dhatu (notes) and matu (words),” he adds, citing examples of a string of Kerala composers, from Swati Tirunal (1813-1846) to the Kochi-based N.P. Ramaswamy, who died in 2019. Ramaswamy’s great-grandfather, composer Palakkad Parameswara Bhagavatar, served at the Travancore court. He popularised Swati Tirunal’s Utsavaprabandham kritis particularly, through his discourses. The 12-song Utsavaprabandham, which essays in different meters the ten-day festival at Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram, has 42 lengthy verses in Sanskritised Malayalam — Manipravalam. This hybrid language, with a history dating to 11th century CE, enriched Carnatic music through the works of composers such as K.C. Kesava Pillai (1868-1913) and Thamarasseri Krishnan Bhattathiri (1890-1963) . Since Independence, Akashvani in Kerala played a major role in propagating Carnatic kritis from the State. “The role of dramatist-lawyer ‘Mali’ Madhavan Nair (1915-94) as the broadcast head merits special mention,” says instrumentalist-music critic S. Sivaramakrishnan. “In the 1970s, AIR used to feature exclusive Carnatic-teaching programmes with the focus on Kerala. Sadly, not even a tenth of the repertoire is found today.” In the subsequent decade, Carnatic exponent Cherthala Gopalan Nair (1923-97), who worked with AIR, set to tune quite a few Swati Tirunal kritis such as ‘Aliveni’ (Dwijavanti) or ‘Bhajabhaja manasa’ (Sindhu Bhairavi), says his musician-son G. Sriram. “Even Thampi’s ‘Karuna cheyvan,’ and ‘Adimalarina thanne’ (Mukhari) and Thangachi’s ‘Ananda rupa’ were set to tune by him, besides those by Kesava Pillai, Keerikad Gopala Pillai, North Malabar’s Kuttamath Kunjikrishna Kurup, and Kottayam Kerala Varma.” Earlier, in the 1940s, titans such as Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer brought out books with notations for 100 Swati Tirunal kritis. The practice of the writer of the songs not being the composer continues. Some Sanskrit works by retired bureaucrat ‘Tulasivanam’ R. Ramachandran Nair feature in the concerts of veteran musicians T.V. Sankaranarayanan and T.N. Seshagopalan. Many of them were tuned by scholar-teacher R. Prabhakara Varma (1928-2008), who also wrote Carnatic compositions. Varma’s disciple ‘Poornathrayee’ Jayaprakash Sharma has 400 kritis to his credit. C.S. Krishna Iyer, another 20th-century musician from Palakkad, has written Carnatic kritis that often dealt with emotions beyond bhakti and he composed music for the same. “In the 1960s, he, along with Puthucode Krishnamoorthy and V. Dakshinamurthy, composed music for modern poems by Sankara Kurup, Vennikulam Gopala Kurup, Kunhiraman Nair and N.V. Krishna Warrier,” says Krishna Iyer’s student Sadanam K. Harikumar, who has composed two dozen Malayalam kritis. Percussionist Vaikom Venugopal suggests the inclusion of songs by Kerala composers in the syllabus of the State’s music colleges. Adds vocalist B. Arundhathi: “Malayalam-speaking Carnatic musicians must ensure that their concerts include works of composers from the region.” In 2012, the first Kochi-Muziris Biennale hosted a vocal concert focusing on composers of Kerala. Sreevalsan J. Menon presented 14 kritis of composers ranging from fifth century Jain monk Ilango Adigal and philosopher Adi Shankara to songs in Jewish and Arabi Malayalam, bhakti poet Poonathanam (1547-1640) and a Kathakali song by Kottarakkara Thampuran. Since the 18th century, Kerala has been enriching the Carnatic repertoire with the works of satirist Kunchan Nambiar, Shadkala Govinda Marar, Rugmini Bayi (Swati Tirunal’s sister), and Neelakanta Sivan. One has heard ‘Sagara shayana vibho’, composed by M.D. Ramanathan, more often from his fellow musician and Palakkad native K.V. Narayanaswamy. The recent ‘Gana Kairali’ festival saw Vizianagaram’s Manda Sudharani presenting a Tamil piece by T. Lakshmana Pillai (1964-1950) of Thiruvananthapuram. It was, essentially, Andhra Pradesh’s salute to Kerala’s Carnatic lineage.  The writer is a keen follower of Kerala’s performing arts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/looking-beyond-swati-tirunal/article34389516.ece
23 April 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi police on their feet to keep the Capital breathing||Around 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Thakur received a panic call from Batra Hospital saying their oxygen supply was going to end in two hours. The hospital apparently told him that they have been trying to manage cylinders for the last three days but were unable to arrange. With other senior officers in tow, he rushed to the hospital and spoke to the management, who were panicking because lives of more than 350 patients were in their hands. The first task was to identify where they could procure the oxygen from, as the hospital required liquid oxygen tankers. Teams then identified that one oxygen tanker was travelling to GTB Hospital. “But at that crucial point, the driver wasn’t picking the call. We had to trace him and almost intercept him,” he recalled. The team then went to GTB Hospital with the tanker before bringing it to the Batra Hospital. Meanwhile, police got another lead that an oxygen tanker was coming from Haryana’s Samalkha. But the old hassle surfaced. The driver’s traced location didn’t match with what he was saying. He was finally found in West Delhi and brought to Batra Hospital. “Amid all this, we were informed that the oxygen had completely run out and some patients were having seizures. The pressure was mounting. Around 12.30 a.m., Samalkha tanker reached and by 1 a.m., the one from GTB too came. We helped them with seven tonnes of oxygen,” he said, adding that over 100 policemen were involved in this mission for five to six hours. One hurdle after other Reflecting on the situation, a senior officer termed coordinating as the toughest challenge, besides pointing out that supplies are disrupted as more oxygen is required but there is no arrangement to meet the demands. “Planning for the second wave was not conducted in terms of oxygen and hospital requirement. There is a huge lack of a tracking system, which would make oxygen supply smooth and check consignment,” he said. Production of oxygen has not been enhanced as it should have been and internal disputes of several stakeholders appears to have lead to this chaos, sources said of their opinion after observing ground situation. Sources said that many officers are infected in the force and for some, their families are infected due to which they need leaves which seniors can’t deny. “Much of our resources are diverted to the healthcare situation while we have to ensure the lockdown is imposed and guidelines are followed,” an officer said. Additional DCP (Outer) Sudhanshu Dhama has been attending distress calls for the last few days. The latest was from Rathi Hospital, who were in a dire situation on Wednesday evening with lives of 78 patients at stake. Mr. Dhama, who was in the hospital till around 3a.m. on Thursday, along with his teams, managed to arrange 120 oxygen cylinders from Bawana, Kanjhawala, Mayapuri and even from another hospital. “We had to plead with other hospitals,” he said, adding that hospitals are scared to help because of the fear of cylinders running out. The police are stretched, but they keep on helping the city breathe. “At this point, one cannot say this is not my job because the situation is such. One cannot demarcate. Right now, we are providing help by whatever means we can,” he said. DCP (North) Anto Alphonse, who had arranged oxygen for NKS Hospital from Mayapuri by going in person, said his control room has been attending to PCR calls from people calling for hospital beds, life-saving injections, oxygen cylinders and even ration. He said they are trying their best to meet their needs while adding that coordinating for oxygen with suppliers is a task at the moment, he said. Coordination pangs Pranav Tayal, DCP (Rohini), also said that coordinating with gas agencies for oxygen and then providing it in that short span of time to the hospitals is challenging. “We arranged 50 oxygen cylinders for a private hospital and they were delivered in two hours. They were arranged from Bawana and Khanjhawala,” he said. According to the data shared by Delhi Police, only 5-10 officials were testing positive till April 4. But the numbers soared to 263 on April 20. There was marginal respite, as it came down to 193 on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-police-on-their-feet-to-keep-the-capital-breathing/article34389289.ece
23 April 2021||New Delhi,||Join hands to defeat virus defying State borders, appeals Kejriwal||Terming it a collective crisis, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday appealed to his counterparts in other States to come together to confront and defeat COVID-19 instead of allowing State borders to divide their response to the pandemic. Addressing a digital briefing, the Chief Minister also pledged to provide resources, such as oxygen, essential medicines and medical personnel, including doctors, to other States as and when these were in a position of being shared. “Over the last few days we have witnessed the paucity of oxygen, medicines, vaccination and other resources across the country due to the COVID-19 situation. Delhi has also been facing issues, especially related to oxygen. I have spent nights in attempt to ensure oxygen supply to city hospitals,” Mr. Kejriwal said. Oxygen need “According to Delhi government estimates, the city requires a daily supply of 700 tonnes of oxygen. The Centre had allocated a quota of 378 tonnes of oxygen to Delhi initially, but has increased that to 480 tonnes yesterday for which we are very, very thankful. Though it is lower than what is required, we are thankful for increasing it,” he also said. The Centre, Mr. Kejriwal said, also decides which company will supply oxygen to different States and cities such as Delhi, where oxygen is not manufactured. Oxygen manufactured by companies in other States is allocated to others according to the Centre’s directions, he said. Some State governments, Mr. Kejriwal alleged, where such manufacturing units were located, had stopped the transportation of oxygen allocated to Delhi and used it themselves, given the circumstances and paucity of oxygen. “I want to thank the Centre and the Delhi High Court for helping us with this issue. I, Delhi’s Ministers and officers have not slept for several nights and were in constant touch with the Centre over the issue of oxygen supply,” he said. “But the increased supply will take some time and we are mulling airlifting oxygen from Odisha. In the meantime, I am personally ensuring that every truck with oxygen reaches its destination. Like I had promised, these six days are being utilised to ramp up our medical infrastructure as much as possible, round the clock,” he also said. The pandemic, Mr. Kejriwal said, was “a very big emergency” and everyone needed to come together to confront and defeat it. “I want to assure you that I will share my resources with other States as soon as possible,” he also said.

23 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘6 hospitals ran out of oxygen’||At least six private hospitals treating COVID-19 patients ran out of liquid medical oxygen on Thursday, as per the Delhi government, with several hospitals stating during the day that they had dangerously low levels of oxygen. Many hospitals said that they arranged oxygen cylinders to manage the shortage, while some had to ask patients to shift to somewhere else. Oxygen supply to hospitals in Delhi has been a problem for the past five days and the Delhi government has been blaming U.P. and Haryana governments for disrupting supply from private companies to Delhi. The quota of oxygen for each State is decided by the Centre and in case of Delhi, it comes mostly from private oxygen plants in other States. On Wednesday as well, several hospitals complained of dangerously low stocks of oxygen. On Thursday, accusing the Haryana and U.P. governments of stalling the supply of oxygen to the Capital, Mr. Sisodia asked the Centre to deploy paramilitary personnel. He said that Delhi was not getting the full quota of oxygen from a plant in Haryana as district officials were stopping trucks coming from Delhi for liquid medical oxygen. Jungle raj “In some time, without adequate oxygen supply, it may become difficult for Delhi hospitals to save lives of patients. We cannot keep on going on with this makeshift arrangement. It is my request to the Central government that even if you have to deploy paramilitary forces to ensure trucks from all States are replenishing oxygen without any hindrances from officials from other State governments, please do so. The way U.P. and Haryana governments are trying to monopolise and hoard oxygen, they have created a j ungle r aj ”, which is very dangerous for everyone,” Mr. Sisodia said. Later, in a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, Mr. Sisodia said that six private hospitals have exhausted the stock of oxygen. The hospitals were Rathi Hospital, Santom Hospital, Saroj Super Speciality Hospital, Shanti Mukand Hospital, Tirath Ram Shah Hospital, and UK Nursing home, as per the letter. Mr. Sisodia urged the Union Minister to intervene to save people’s lives and make sure that Delhi gets its quota of oxygen from other States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/6-hospitals-ran-out-of-oxygen/article34389642.ece

23 April 2021||New Delhi,||Over 2,550 ambulance calls made daily by COVID-19 patients: data||Over 2,550 distress calls from COVID-19 patients were dispatched to ambulances in the national capital daily for the last one week, numbers compiled by the Delhi government show, highlighting the severity of the ongoing wave of the pandemic. The cumulative figure of 17,924 calls in the past one week do not include the ones made by patients to private ambulances. According to data, at least 2,560 calls from COVID-19 patients were being dispatched to ambulances in the city every day for the past week as the number of cases continue to show an upward trend in Delhi. This is a visible jump from the calls made by patients every day to ambulances during the first week of April, which was within the range of 1,200-1,900. While 2,279 calls were dispatched to ambulances on both April 15 and 16, the number went up to 2,861 on April 20 — highest in the last week — and 2,618 on April 21. A total of 1,347 people succumbed to the virus during the period.

23 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Stranded labourers on Yamuna banks bank on hope||For the hundreds of migrant workers who continue to reside on the banks of the Yamuna, the week-long lockdown imposed by the Delhi government to curb the surge in COVID-19 cases, has been all too similar to conditions, which prevailed exactly a year back – when they were stranded at the same place without work. Less than five km away from Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence, the daily wagers said that the only aid they have received since the lockdown began was from a gurdwara in the vicinity that provided cooked meals twice a day. Ashok Kumar, who hails from Aligarh, said: “There is no provision of food or shelter for us from the government. We have been surviving on cooked meals provided by volunteers from the gurdwara. They are the only one who look after us and provide us meals. The shelters have become so crowded that it becomes impossible to stay there. So we have no other option, but to idle our time away on the banks of the Yamuna.” Like Mr. Ashok, 42-year-old Sanjay Kumar, who hails from Uttar Pradesh’s Sitapur district, rued about lack of work in the run-up to the lockdown, which left them without any means to return to their villages.“We are engaged in work that involves weddings. That is our main source of income. But due to this virus, that industry has been badly affected and most weddings are held adhering to restrictions. We have not been able to earn much in the last few months. So how can we even think of buying tickets and returning?,” said Mr. Kumar. While most are aware of the COVID-19 protocols, which are required to be followed, the workers complained that no provisions were made to distribute masks among them. When found without a mask, Raju Singh, from Bihar’s Samastipur district, said: “We are daily wagers. If I have no earning, how am I supposed to buy masks and sanitisers? Some have managed to get a few masks, but there has been no proper distribution that I have seen since the time I have been here. I reached Delhi a month back in search of work. While last year I had returned during the lockdown period, this time I could not arrange enough money for the tickets.” The workers are just hoping that this lockdown is not extended like earlier. Hari Mohan, from Odisha’s Mayubhanj district, said, “The government said that things will open up in a week. That is our only hope at the moment. We don’t have enough means to go back. We hope that the lockdown is not extended.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/stranded-labourers-on-yamuna-banks-bank-on-hope/article34389640.ece
23 April 2021||New Delhi,||Red Fort violence: court allows police to obtain Deep Sidhu’s voice sample||A court here on Thursday allowed Delhi Police’s plea to obtain the voice sample of actor-activist Deep Sidhu, accused in connection with the Red Fort violence on the Republic Day. Metropolitan Magistrate Sahil Gupta allowed the application in which the police claimed that in order to authenticate the voice of the accused in several videos (Facebook live, TV interviews etc.), it was necessary that his voice was matched with the voice in those video clippings. Sidhu was arrested on February 9 and was granted bail by a Delhi court on April 16 in the case. He was later arrested in another related case and is currently in judicial custody, while his bail application is pending in the matter. In its application, the police said that during the investigation, it came to the notice that accused was live on Facebook page and also made various posts on the date of incident. “These video clips/Facebook live have been taken on record which contain the voice of accused,” the police told the court, while seeking his voice sample. The application was opposed by Sidhu’s counsel, saying that the police plea was an infringement of his fundamental rights. While allowing the police plea, the court termed as ‘premature’ the arguments made by the counsel for the accused that the application was vague and lacked any concrete detail of the videos for which the voice sample was required, saying that “the manner in which investigation is to be done is the prerogative of the investigating agency.” Quality of evidence “Also, at the stage of investigation, one cannot assume that by obtaining the voice sample, false evidence by tampering with the video clips could be imputed against the accused. “The admissibility and quality of evidence is a question to be determined during the trial and not at the stage of investigation,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/red-fort-violence-court-allows-police-to-obtain-deep-sidhus-voice-sample/article34389751.ece
23 April 2021||New Delhi,||NGO seeks ration, food for those without card||The Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan has approached the Delhi High Court seeking immediate provision of rations and cooked food to needy persons who do not possess ration cards, in light of the fresh curfew imposed in Delhi to curtail the spread of COVID-19. “The lockdown has resulted in loss of livelihoods, which is causing intense financial distress and food insecurity among the economically weaker sections, especially daily wagers, domestic workers, construction labourers, homeless persons and residents of slum settlements,” the NGO said. “The distress can be gauged from the thousands of people turning up at the homeless shelters in Yamuna Pushta area seeking food. In the absence of requisite measures, many are being turned away without any provision of food,” it said. The plea has sought provision of dry rations for people who do not possess ration cards, either through resumption of Mukhya Mantri Corona Sahayata Yojna or any other scheme. It also asked for free cooked meals through all homeless shelters and through hunger relief centres set up for the purpose and ensure no one desirous of food is turned away without food. Only 37% of the population of Delhi possesses ration cards, the NGO said. The case is likely to come up for hearing on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ngo-seeks-ration-food-for-those-without-card/article34389748.ece

Tagging Home Minister Amit Shah and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal among others, the hospital authorities in a tweet said: “Fortis Hospital in#Haryanahas only 45 minutes of oxygen left. Requesting@ashokge hlot51@raj nathsingh,@PiyushGoyalOffc,@m lkhattarand@AmitSh ahto act immediately and help us to save patients’ lives [sic]”. Another tweet said it was an “#SOScall from Fortis to allow oxygen tanker from Bhiwadi to reach our hospital#ASAP. The district administration intervened to immediately supply around 100 oxygen cylinders to hospital and later ensured that it got its regular supply from the Bhiwadi plant as well. Regular vendor Deputy Commissioner Yash Garg told The Hindu that the hospital’s regular vendor in Bhiwadi deserted them leading to the shortage of the liquid oxygen. “We have adequate supply of oxygen for hospitals in Gurugram. We had offered to Fortis as well to take supply from one of our tankers on Wednesday evening. But they refused saying that they would anyway get supply from their vendor on Thursday. But the vendor deserted them leading to short supply,” said Dr. Garg. He added that the daily average need of Gurugram hospitals was around 25 MT liquid oxygen and was being easily met from Panipat plant. Earlier, CM Manohar Lal reviewed the situation in Gurugram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/oxygen-crisis-averted-at-gurugram-hospital/article34389286.ece
