02 April 2021||New Delhi,||No interest cut on small savings||Hours after notifying significant cuts in small savings instruments’ returns for this quarter, the government backtracked and reversed the sharp rate cuts that sent the Public Provident Fund (PPF) return to a multi-decade low. The rates notified on Wednesday night for the April to June 2021 quarter were 40 basis points (0.4%) to 110 basis points (1.1%) lower on different instruments. This is the first time that the Centre has scrapped the notified interest rates on small savings schemes after switching to a quarterly interest rate setting system for them, beginning April 2016. “Interest rates of small savings schemes of GoI (Government of India) shall continue to be at the rates which existed in the last quarter of 2020-2021, i.e. rates that prevailed as of March 2021. Orders issued by oversight shall be withdrawn,” Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a tweet on Thursday morning. ‘No change’ While there was no further official clarification on the oversight that led to the pullback of the rate cuts, by evening, the Budget division in the Department of Economic Affairs issued a memo in “suppression” of Wednesday’s order. “…It has been decided that the rate of interest on various small savings scheme for the first quarter of FY 2021-22… shall remain unchanged from those notified for the fourth quarter of the FY2020-21. This has the approval of competent authority,” the memo said. The ongoing Assembly elections may have influenced the government to rethink the rate cut following a sharp backlash overnight on various social media platforms about the middle class being squeezed further even as retail inflation, and fuel and LPG cylinder prices, are soaring.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-interest-cut-on-small-savings/article34219650.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Pakistan freezes plan to allow imports from India||Just a day after announcing its plan to allow import of cotton and sugar from India, the Pakistan government on Thursday said it was “deferring” the decision and linked any “normalisation” in ties to moves by New Delhi on Jammu and Kashmir. The U-turn was seen as an embarrassment for the Imran Khan government and, in particular, for the newly appointed Finance Minister Hammad Azhar, who had addressed a press conference on Wednesday announcing clearances by the Economic Coordination Council (ECC) for imports from India, which have been suspended since August 2019. Significantly, Mr. Khan holds the Commerce Ministry portfolio, which moved the proposal at the ECC on Wednesday. ‘More debate needed’ Speaking to the media earlier, Mr. Azhar said the move was a commercially based need for Indian sugar and cotton due to the high prices and low yield in Pakistan last year. The reversal of the ECC’s decision on Thursday was announced by Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who, in a taped video statement, said the matter needed “further debate”. “An impression was emerging that ties with India are moving towards normalisation and trade has been opened. We had a discussion on this, and the unanimous view of the Cabinet was that until the unilateral decisions taken by India on August 5, 2019, are not reconsidered, it would be impossible to normalise relations with India,” Mr. Qureshi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pakistan-freezes-plan-to-open-imports-from-india/article34219647.ece
02 April 2021||Kolkata,||Bengal under a strong BJP wave: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said that West Bengal was “under a strong wave of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)” and that his party would win more than 200 of the 294 seats in the State. Mr. Modi, who addressed two public meetings in West Bengal, one at Joynagar and other at Uluberia, said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had become afraid of losing the polls and that was the reason why she had sought help from other parties. He was referring to Ms. Banerjee’s letter to 14 leaders of Opposition parties in which she urged them to unite against the BJP. Addressing a public meeting at Joynagar, Mr. Modi made a pitch based on Hindutva, saying the Trinamool Congress (TMC) had “problems with people wearing saffron, sporting tilak and choti (tuft of hair); they call them rakshas (demons)”. Mr. Modi added he was “not among those who showed their reverence by going to temples seasonally”. Referring to the CM’s remarks that goons from other States were trying to influence voters in West Bengal, he said, “You have taken the oath of the Constitution which doesn’t permit you to speak against other States or people of other States.” On the day Nandigram went to polls, the Prime Minister fuelled speculation that Ms. Banerjee may contest the polls from some other seat. The Chief Minister is contesting from Nandigram, where her rival is BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari. “Please tell me, how far are these rumours true that you are filing nomination from any other seat? Is this true? You went there [Nandigram] and people gave you the message. Even if you go anywhere else, people are ready there also,” he said. The TMC leadership quickly refuted the speculation and insisted that Ms. Banerjee would be contesting from Nandigram alone. TMC leader Yashwant Sinha said Mr. Modi should refrain from making such comments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bengal-under-a-strong-bjp-wave-modi/article34219838.ece
02 April 2021||Kochi,||Construction of ship dock, jetty will block water flow in canals, govt. tells HC||The construction of a major ship dock near the Old Harbour Bridge on Willingdon Island and a jetty at Kalvathy canal mouth by the Coast Guard will obstruct the free flow of water through the canals in West Kochi, according to an affidavit filed by the State government in the Kerala High Court. The affidavit added that the construction of the berth was “dangerous for the ships coming in as there is a good chance for accidents to occur” besides preventing the tidal flow into the canal system in West Kochi areas. The dock construction would also obstruct the free flow of low tide and high tide. The government also pointed out that the ship dock would obstruct free flow of water from upper Kuttanad and Muvattpuzha river to Vembaland Lake. This would cause major flood in upstream areas such as Aroor, Maradu and Vypeen. Waste dumping The government said the waterlogging problem in West Kochi areas was mainly because of the poor water carrying capacity of Rameswaram, Kalvathy and Eraveli canals due to the dumping of waste and sewage into the canals and reduction of the canal width at many intermediate locations due to construction of roads and culverts. A study had pointed out that many parts of the canal system in West Kochi had failed to serve their intended purpose due to accumulation of silt and waste. The poor condition and the missing links in the canal network were causing overflow and flooding of the adjoining areas during rain. Besides, the canals had become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and sources of pollution. The affidavit pointed out that the tidal difference occurs approximately every eight hours — the water flow from the South-most Vembanad backwaters, and back. Since the Kalvathy canal is the first opening from the outer sea mouth, water gushes out first and gushes in every eight hours during the tidal difference. This was working fine earlier, keeping the water of the canals clean and navigable. But now, it was not possible due to blockade and missing lines in the canal system. There are approximately 80 bridges/culverts, big and small, in the main canal. Most of them were not cleared, thus blocking the flow of water during rainy seasons. A challenge The affidavit said the handling and disposal of residual sludge in the limited area available under the Cochin Smart Mission Limited’s (CSML) project of constructing vacuum sewer network and sewage treatment plant might pose a challenge. Suitable uninhabited locations for timely disposal of sludge have to be located, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/construction-of-ship-dock-jetty-will-block-water-flow-in-canals-govt-tells-hc/article34220247.ece
02 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Physical lessons suspended for class VI to IX students in city||With the rise in COVID-19 cases, the government has decided to suspend on-campus lessons for students of classes VI to IX across schools in Bengaluru Urban from Friday onwards. Schools had been allowed to conduct classes for students of classes VI and VII under the Vidyagama programme and regular classes for those in classes VIII and IX. Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, who issued a statement late on Thursday night, said the decision was taken in consultation with the Chief Minister in the interest of the students. On-campus classes, however, will continue for class X and pre-university students. Students of classes VI to X in other parts of Karnataka will continue to attend classes on campus. Officials in the Department of Primary and Secondary Education said a decision would be taken shortly on how students in higher grades would be assessed this academic year. “We have decided to tweak the assessment model for students of classes VI to IX. At present, they have four formative and two summative assessments. The modalities of how and when the assessment will be carried out will be announced next week,” said a senior official. However, the department has decided to do away with assessments for government school students of classes I to V who have not returned to campus for physical classes. Students in classes I to III, who are part of the Nali Kali system, will have regular assessment based on their learning outcomes. A senior official said that for those in classes IV and V, the plan was to use written material/assignments they may have submitted during the Vidyagama programme held between July and October. Meanwhile, many private schools have already completed exams/tests for students of class I to IX and declared holidays. Others who are midway through the examination process are disappointed that they have to suspend it. “Students in government schools, however, do not have access to gadgets and stable Internet connection, which is why we have decided to do away with the assessment for some classes,” the official said. Tarun S., an autorickshaw driver whose son studies in class V at a government school in Rajajinagar, said, “I am glad they are not conducting any assessment for my son as he has not had any formal classes this year. But I am extremely worried that he will not be able to cope the next academic year as classes have been disrupted.” Niranjan Aradhya V.P., Senior Fellow, Centre for Child and the Law, National Law School India University, said that rather than focussing on assessment this year, the government should plan an accelerated learning programme or a bridge course for students. “Before the next academic year begins in July, a plan needs to be chalked so that students are on a par with the age-appropriate learning level,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/physical-lessons-suspended-for-class-vi-to-ix-students-in-city/article34220083.ece

Addressing a meeting, the Chief Minister said that following the directions of the Union government, every one above 45 years should get vaccinated and in case, the Centre gave revised guidelines for people below 45 years, the State government would also vaccinate them. “I expect that the entire process of vaccination would be completed within 90 days and I am sure we will cover the entire State,” Mr. Jagan said. “Vaccination is the only solution to combat the virus and by the grace of God, we were able to vaccinate ourselves. COVID is here to stay and we should learn to live with it. I am proud that nowhere else, such an initiative has been taken at ward and village secretariat level and we will be a role model in the country by vaccinating maximum number of people,” he said.

02 April 2021||New Delhi,||Dadasaheb Phalke for Rajinikanth||The Centre on Thursday announced the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award for Rajinikanth for his contribution as an actor, producer and screenwriter. Announcing the decision in New Delhi on Thursday, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said, “For the past 50 years, Rajinikanth has been ruling the film industry. His work is like the sun. Through his talent and hard work, he has made a space for himself in the hearts of millions of people.” Rajinikanth will be conferred the award on May 3, a day after the results of the Assembly elections are announced. “Happy to announce #Dadasaheb Phalke award for 2019 to one of the greatest actors in history of Indian cinema Rajinikant ji . His contribution as actor, producer and screenwriter has been iconic,” Mr. Javadekar later tweeted. Instituted in 1969, the award is the highest honour in India for cinema.

02 April 2021||Bengaluru,||COVID-19 cases breach one million mark in State||Nearly 13 months after recording its first COVID-19 case, Karnataka breached the one million mark and hit 10,01,238 cases, as 4,234 persons tested positive on Thursday. Over 43% of this total caseload is from Bengaluru Urban alone. Over 10% of the caseload has been reported in the past three months. The State had reported 9,00,214 cases till December 12 and has since added 1,01,024 cases to its tally. This brings Karnataka to the third position in the country, after Maharashtra and Kerala. With 30,865 active cases as on Thursday, Karnataka is in the second position among States, after Maharashtra, on this count. Fuelled by a spike in cases in Bengaluru, the situation in the State took a turn for the worse from the beginning of July by breaching the 2,000 mark daily initially. It subsequently jumped to over 5,000 cases per day, and later to over 10,000 a day in September. 18 new deaths With 18 deaths on Thursday, the toll touched 12,585. This is apart from 19 deaths of patients because of other deaths. Over 96% of COVID-19 fatalities in the State had been reported till December-end. The State’s daily Case Fatality Rate (CFR) now stands at 0.42%. From 101 cases in March 2020, the State witnessed a four-fold rise in April and subsequently a six-fold increase in May. From May to June, there was a five-fold rise and then an eight-fold increase from June to July, when the number of cases crossed one lakh and touched 1,08,873. Subsequently, the numbers more than doubled every fortnight and touched 8,02,817 till October 25. After that, there was a decline in new cases, and by December the State started recording less than 1,000 cases. Following that the daily cases reduced to less than 500 cases by February-end. However, the number of cases again started rising from the first week of March. The State has been reporting more than 4,000 cases for the past two days. Weak contact tracing V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka and member of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee, said the State had failed in properly communicating to people about the seriousness of the second wave. “This coupled with weak contact tracing is hitting us hard at the onset of the second wave,” he said. “During the corresponding period last year, we were tracing 47 contacts for every positive case detected. Now, it is as low as 1:10. We need to trace at least 20-30 contacts for every positive case,” he said. He said it was important for the State to initiate district-specific data-driven interventions. “Testing targets and management strategies based on prevalence in various districts should be taken up on a war footing. Otherwise, by this month-end we will be going the Maharashtra way, reporting 25,000 to 30,000 cases a day,” he said. Complacency, false belief C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, attributed the rising cases to extreme complacency in people, a false sense of belief that the curve had flattened since November onwards, mutations in the virus, and waning immunity among those who had been infected earlier. “The false sense of belief that the curve has flattened led to a release phenomena resulting in relentless crowding, gathering and violation of COVID-19 norms,” he said, adding that slowing down the rate of transmission was entirely in people’s hands now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-cases-breach-one-million-mark-in-state/article34220082.ece

CM at Hisar airport||Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala faced the ire of agitating farmers during his visit to Hisar on Thursday when hordes of protesters, including women, blocked the exit to the city’s airport for around two hours, not allowing him to come out of the premises. Eventually, Mr. Chautala landed at Haryana Agriculture University campus in his chopper before going ahead with the day-long trip. The farmers continued to chase him to different venu-es all through the day before he flew back to Chandigarh. The protesters owing allegiance to different farmer unions and workers of trade unions gathered outside the city’s airport around noon. “The farmers parked tractors, trolleys and trucks on the road connecting the highway to the airport, completely blocking it. When the farmers did not budge, Mr. Chautala flew to the HAU campus. He then went ahead with his official programme at the mini-secretariat,” said Suresh Kumar, district president, Centre of Indian Trade Unions. Mr. Chautala’s chopper flew in the direction of Chandigarh to mislead the farmers, but took a detour to reach HAU, claimed Mr. Kumar.

As many as 144 flying squad teams and 144 static surveillance teams are on duty. A team should inspect at least 200 vehicles in a shift, and a clear schedule has been given to them. Since we have tightened our vigil and intensified the search, more seizures have been reported from the field,” said Mr. Prakash. “Apart from that, it is a challenge [to prevent] minor level transactions done in connivance with givers and receivers. That can be prevented if only we receive information,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-1035-crore-cash-seized-in-city-on-a-single-day/article34220144.ece

The indirect tax collections in March were 27% higher than that in March 2020, with revenues from import of goods 70% more than a year ago, and the revenues from domestic transaction, including import of services, 17% higher. “GST revenues crossed above Rs. 1 lakh crore mark at a stretch for the last six months and a steep increasing trend over this period are clear indicators of rapid economic recovery post pandemic,” the Ministry said in a statement, pointing to the 14% growth in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020-21, compared with a 41% decline in the first lockdown-hit quarter. Apart from a recovery in the economy, GST collections were also bolstered by closer monitoring against fake-billing, deep data analytics using data from multiple sources, including GST, Income Tax and Customs IT systems, and effective tax administration over the past few months, the Ministry said. “The all-time high GST collection ... shows a sustained economic recovery and also is a result of audit closures and the government tightening compliance and anti-evasion measures,” said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gst-mop-up-hits-a-record-in-march/article34219648.ece

The searches were conducted in Visakhapatnam, Guntur, Prakasam, Srikakulam, Kurnool, Krishna, East Godavari and Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh, and Ranga Reddy, Hyderabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Medak in Telangana. The case relates to furthering the activities of the proscribed CPI (Maoist) in Andhra Pradesh in the guise of frontal organisations, the official said.

The case pertains to the seizure of revolutionary literature of CPI (Maoist), press notes, medicines, wire bundles and explosives substances from Pangi Naganna, who was intercepted by the police in Visakhapatnam Rural during vehicle checking. Naganna had been ostensibly working as a journalist and was passing information about the police movements to CPI (Maoist) leaders. He has also been involved in allegedly instigating the villagers to obstruct combing operations of police and prevent them from entering into villages and motivating the villagers to revolt against the police parties and hold rallies against the government. Till now, six accused — Naganna, Anduluri Annapurna, Jangarla Koteswar Rao, Manukonda Srinivasa Rao, Rela Rajeswari and Boppudi Anjamma — have been arrested in the case.

02 April 2021||N. RahulHYDERABAD,||A.P. and Telangana to discuss bilateral issues on April 6||The Union Home Secretary will convene a meeting of Chief Secretaries of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh through video conferencing on April 6 to discuss pending bilateral issues as per A.P. State Reorganisation Act. In preparation for the meeting, Principal Finance Secretary of Telangana K. Ramakrishna Rao on Thursday discussed the status of the issues with heads of several departments. Sources said the issues concerned finalisation of allocation of DSPs (Civil), Additional SPs (Civil) and SPs (Non-cadre) between the two States. Apportionment of assets and liabilities of government corporations, institutes and companies listed in Schedule IX of the Act was another contentious issue as the States had different views on the division. While A.P. insisted that the division of assets and employees should be based on population ratio of 58:42 in accordance with the Act, Telangana maintained that employees be divided based on where they belong. Division of Singareni Collieries and division of assets and liabilities of institutions listed under Schedule X of the Act will also be taken up. Division of Andhra Pradesh Bhavan in Delhi and payment of power dues to APGenco are the other issues to figure in the talks. There were 142 departments in Schedule X which Telangana wanted to divide based on their location, but A.P. did not agree to it. Taxation provisions in the Act, apportionment of institutions not listed anywhere in the Act, shifting of headquarters of Krishna River Management Board to A.P., cash credit of A.P. Civil Supplies Corporation, Division of Andhra Pradesh Bhavan in Delhi and payment of power dues to AP Generation Corporation were the other issues to figure in the talks.

02 April 2021||Kolkata,||80% polling in phase 2 of Bengal polls||Amid stray incidents of violence, 80.43% of the voters exercised their franchise in the second phase of polling to 30 seats in West Bengal across four districts. Purba Medinipur and Paschim Medinipur recorded 81.23% and 78.02%, respectively, for nine seats each. The percentage for eight seats of Bankura was 82.92%, and for the four seats of South 24 Parganas, 79.65%. The percentage was of voting till 5 p.m. and the figures are expected to rise. While all eyes were on Nandigram, the Keshpur Assembly constituency in Paschim Mednipur witnessed violence both before and during the polls. Uttam Dalui, Trinamool supporter of village Darba, was attacked with sharp weapons late on Wednesday under the Keshpur police station limits and he died on Thursday. The Trinamool blamed the BJP for the murder of their supporter. State Chief Electoral Officer Aariz Aftab said eight persons had been arrested for the crime. Later in the day, the vehicle of BJP candidate Tamnay Ghosh was attacked in Keshpur by locals with sticks, stones and batons. Several vehicles including some in which journalists were travelling were also attacked. A few presspersons, including a woman journalist, suffered injuries. According to the CEO, a case has been registered and more than 20 persons have been arrested. There were also reports of some violence from the Moyna Assembly segment in Purba Medinipur and Sabang in Paschim Medinipur. “Except a few isolated incidents, elections have been peaceful,” he said. According to the EC, the body of 52-year-old Uday Shankar Dube was found in his home in Nandigram. The CEO said prima facie the death was due to ‘suicide’. The BJP had described the deceased as a party supporter. While allegations of irregularities were made by the Trinamool, it has not demanded repolling in Nandigram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/80-polling-in-phase-2-of-bengal-polls/article34219596.ece
02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Younger people at risk during second wave’||The second surge of COVID-19 puts children and younger adults at high risk with the situation being very grim especially in rural and tribal areas which were spared in the first wave, warn experts. “Children and young adults are mostly uninfected so far and therefore are at high risk of contracting the infection. The schools and colleges are functioning in most States resulting in higher risk of transmission in closed settings. Young adults have resumed working from office and are again at higher risk in closed spaces,” explained Giridhar R. Babu, Head of Life Course, Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India. He said there are multiple super spreader events happening in schools, colleges, offices, public transport (metros). “There is no doubt that many States are surging and as a result, the country is witnessing a rise in cases amounting to the ascending phase of a second wave. Based on some of the results of modelling done by experts at the COVID-19 study group, the peak of this wave seems to be around May, 2021. If the rise in cases continues as steeply as they are now, there will be a strain on the health system,” he said. Rural belt Stating that rural and tribal areas are facing a grim situation now, Ravi Wankhedkar, member, Indian Medical Association (IMA), said malnutrition leading to decreased immunity, not following safety norms and lack of proper quarantine facilities have increased the incidence of infection. On the third phase of the vaccination drive, Sahar Qureshi, medical superintendent, Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, said, “We commenced with phase three of drive which allows vaccination for those above 45 years. The footfalls were lesser than expected [if we compare with March 1] since it was a working day. However, we hope this will rise during the upcoming long weekend, starting Friday.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/younger-people-at-risk-during-second-wave/article34219606.ece
02 April 2021||BENGALURU,||Eshwarappa episode brings rift into the open||The unprecedented action of BJP senior leader and RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa of complaining to the Governor against the alleged interference in his department by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has not only kicked up political dust in the ruling party but also indicated that divisions in the party is getting further deepened. Some leaders in the party believe the situation is similar to the one that prevailed during the BJP rule in 2008 whose performance was marred owing to infighting between the pro- and anti-Yediyurappa camps. Mr. Eshwarappa has raised serious issues such as interference in administration, violation of norms related to division of powers between Ministers and the Chief Minister, nepotism, and indiscriminate release of funds from outside the budgetary allocation. He has also alleged violation of norms related to the Panchayat Raj Act. No alternative But party insiders admit that the issue goes beyond these technical contentions as it is a clear indication of the party facing trust deficit again. It is also an indication of “leadership vacuum”, the party having no suitable alternative for the 78-year-old Mr. Yediyurappa, observed another leader. He pointed out that there was no cohesion between the party old guards and those who came from other parties. Though this is not the first time that Mr. Eshwarappa has rebelled against Mr. Yediyurappa, a long-time senior associate who hails from his own district, the timing of the rebellion — just ahead of the bypolls to the Lok Sabha and the Assembly and when yet again there are murmurs of a possible leadership change — has led to anxiety within the party. On his part, Mr. Yediyurappa has so far desisted from commenting on the issue, while his supporters have launched a counter-attack at Mr. Eshwarappa. But it is interesting to note that none of the prominent Ministers from among the party old guard, barring R. Ashok, who is identified with the Yediyurappa camp, has come to the defence of the Chief Minister. Referring to this, party insiders felt this was an indication of factional politics becoming active again or an attempt by the old guard to clip the wings of Mr. Yediyurappa. Already, the issue has provided enough fodder for the Opposition Congress to launch an attack at the government and the Chief Minister. The Opposition is unlikely to keep quiet unless some of the issues mentioned in the complaint are looked into since the complaint is submitted to the Governor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/eshwarappa-episode-brings-rift-into-the-open/article34219567.ece

02 April 2021||Kolkata,||Passions run high in Nandigram||After the high-voltage campaign, polling in Nandigram on Thursday was held amid sporadic incidents of violence and high tension with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is contesting from the seat, alleging electoral malpractices. Boyal in Nandigram become the flashpoint of conflict between the supporters of the Trinamool and the BJP. Since early morning, the Trinamool was alleging that their polling agents were not allowed inside the polling booths. When Ms. Banerjee arrived at Boyal, she faced protests and slogans by the BJP supporters. While the Chief Minister sat inside the polling booth in the Boyal Maktab primary school for almost two hours, supporters of both the parties came face to face outside the booth. The protests took place not far from (50 metre) where the Chief Minister sat on a wheelchair on the school premises. The security personnel tried their best to keep the supporters of two parties away. Passions ran high as hundreds of supporters of both parties raised slogans and charged at each other with stones and batons. In one of the most haunting images of the day, the mother of Trinamool polling agent Mrinal Kanti Jana in Boyal refused to allow his son to go even as police personnel convinced that they would provide him protection. The mother pleaded with folded hands that his family has to reside in the area even after the security forces and media personnel are all gone. Alleging irregularities in the polling process, Ms. Banerjee said she will approach the courts. “I have come here to prove that 80% votes have been rigged. Since the morning, 63 complaints have been made but not a single action has been taken,” she told journalists at the polling booth. She also called Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and senior Election Commission officials demanding free and fair polls. Chief Electoral Officer Aariz Aftaj said there was slogan shouting between two groups at Boyal. Sufficient forces and reinforcements were deployed. Police intervened and brought the situation under control.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nandigram-poll-mamata-alleges-irregularities/article34219600.ece
02 April 2021||CHENNAI,||HC sees serious breach by BJP||The Madras High Court on Thursday granted six weeks’ time for the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the Puducherry cybercrime cell to continue their inquiries into allegations of the BJP having accessed mobile phone numbers, provided by voters while obtaining Aadhaar cards, to send SMS to them with a link to join polling booth-level WhatsApp groups created by the party. Passing interim orders on a public interest litigation petition, Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy wrote that there appeared to be a serious breach by the BJP on how it conducted its election campaign in Puducherry. Stating that a “credible allegation” had been levelled of messages having been sent only to voters’ phone numbers linked with Aadhaar, the court said it was up to the UIDAI to provide an adequate answer to the claim. The judges observed that it would do well for the authority to conduct an inquiry to ascertain the source of leak, if any. “The UIDAI is required to answer how details and particulars furnished to it in confidence by citizens and in the hope that the confidentiality would be preserved, may not have been adequately protected,” they said. The Bench also refused to accept the claim of the BJP that its ‘karyakartas’ (field workers) had obtained the mobile phone numbers by undertaking a door-to-door information collection exercise and pointed out that senior counsel R. Vaigai, representing the PIL litigant A. Anand of the Democratic Youth Federation of India, had found such submission to be laughable. Criminal probe After recording her submission that no voter would readily share personal information such as phone numbers with the political parties, the judges ordered that the Puducherry cybercrime cell should continue the criminal investigation into the issue and the ECI too should not put a lid on the matter until the issue of the bulk messages having been sent in breach of the model code of conduct in force in the Union Territory was dealt with in accordance with law. “It is completely within the domain of the Election Commission to deal with the issue … Apart from the unfair mileage that the sixth respondent [the BJP] may have gained in resorting to a form of campaign without obtaining prior permission there for as required, there is the more serious matter of the privacy of the citizens being breached. This huge aspect of the matter should not be lost in the politics of the season or the hullabaloo of the attendant campaigning,” the Bench said. The court called for reports from the UIDAI, the ECI as well as the police after six weeks. When Ms. Vaigai insisted that the recognition of the BJP should be suspended before the elections since the party had blatantly violated the code of conduct, the judges said such a direction could not be issued to the ECI which enjoyed primacy during elections. They pointed out to a constitutional bar to interference by courts in electoral matters under Article 329 of the Constitution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-sees-serious-breach-by-bjp/article34219611.ece
02 April 2021||Chennai,||Covaxin for those who got placebo||On March 24, the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) permitted Bharat Biotech to unblind all “participants of age group of more than 45 years and offer to administer the vaccine free of cost as and when they become eligible for the vaccine in the national programme”. The Committee recommended that the company unblind the participants as “vaccines [including Covaxin] are [already] available under the immunisation programme, and therefore all the eligible age groups under the immunisation programme should be permitted for unblinding for vaccination”. Apparently, Bharat Biotech intends to carry out a phase 3 trial in a cohort in Brazil. The company is now required to submit the “detailed revised clinical trial protocol for inclusion of a cohort from Brazil along with the revised statistical calculation for assessing the efficacy of the vaccine”. On March 3, based on 43 cases — 36 cases in the placebo group and seven cases in the vaccine arm — Bharat Biotech announced the first interim vaccine efficacy of 80.6% for Covaxin. The second the final time points for further analyses were 87 cases and 130 cases, respectively. But with the Committee now allowing everyone above 45 years age to be unblinded, the trial can continue only in those below that age bar. “A significant number of participants will no longer be available to study the vaccine efficacy once unblinding of participants above 45 years is carried out,” says Dr. Anant Bhan, global health and bioethics researcher based in Bhopal. “With the current surge in cases, more younger people are getting infected.” In all likelihood, the phase 3 trial may achieve its final endpoint of 130 cases but the trial will not include the most vulnerable population of participants above 45 years. “More cases might have been recorded in March. Reliability would increase if further analysis too showed efficacy of over 80%. It is not the ideal, but what else is the alternative now?” says Dr. Jacob John, formerly with CMC Vellore. Could the SEC have asked the company to request participants above 45 years to continue in the study for the successful completion of the trial and unblind only those who want to withdraw from the trial? According to Dr. Bhan, this could have been done as long as participants are provided adequate information about eligibility to get the vaccine and are allowed to exercise an informed choice. “We are not aware on what basis the decision was taken. More context would have been useful,” he says. “But the decision to unblind those above 45 years will affect the study.” Ethical decision However, virologist Dr. Shahid Jameel, Director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University, says the Indian regulator has taken the right decision by allowing Bharat Biotech to unblind everyone above 45 years. “It’s the correct and ethical thing to do,” he says. “We have some efficacy data of the vaccine. Whether it increases or not when further analyses are done will not make any difference on the ground. It’s only of academic interest,” Dr. Jameel says. “There is so much focus on the efficacy of vaccines. What is ignored is that every COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use has 100% efficacy against severe disease and death. And that’s the only efficacy that matters.” Different strokes In the U.S., even when three highly efficacious vaccines are available, the AstraZeneca phase 3 trial is continuing without unblinding even after the first interim analysis showed 76% efficacy based on 190 cases. “Every regulator looks at it differently,” says Dr. Jameel. Dr. Jameel goes further to say that India should not insist on bridging studies especially in the case of Johnson and Johnson, Novavax, and Sputnik V vaccines, where there is an Indian company manufacturing the vaccines. “Restricted use authorisation was granted to Covishield even before the bridging studies were completed. Today, there is a surge in cases across many States. More groups will be eligible for a vaccine if vaccine supply is not limited. Israel has demonstrated how large scale vaccination can control the pandemic. We must rethink our policies,” says Dr. Jameel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covaxin-for-those-who-got-placebo/article34219615.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||New experiments in Muslim politics||Muslims constitute more than one-third of the population in Assam and more than one-fourth in West Bengal and Kerala. Two political parties in Assam and West Bengal, the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and the Indian Secular Front (ISF), respectively, are trying to emulate the success of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in mobilising the community in Kerala. The IUML is a key constituent of the UDF in Kerala, while the AIUDF and ISF are constituents of coalitions in Assam and Bengal that include the Congress and Left parties. Marginalisation The marginalisation of Muslims is pronounced in politics. In the current Lok Sabha, there are 27 Muslims members; a proportionate representation would be 80. In 2019, only 32 of the Congress’s 423 candidates were Muslim. In West Bengal, the number of Muslim MLAs is currently the highest in history — 59 of 294 — but even this is 27% short when compared with their share in the population, shows an analysis by Sabir Ahamed, national research coordinator at the Kolkata-based Pratichi Institute. Facing charges of Muslim appeasement, the ruling Trinamool has fielded 46 candidates from the community this year, compared to 53 in 2016. While the catchment areas of ISF and AIUDF are Muslim pockets of Bengal and Assam, respectively, both parties claim to be catch-all rather than exclusive, and both claim to represent tribals and Hindus as well. And both parties face linguistic and class diversities within the Muslims that question any notion of a monolithic identity. “ISF presence is only among the Bengali-speaking peasants among Muslims in pockets of south Bengal. The Urdu-speaking Muslims in Kolkata, Asansol and Islampur are not part of this. They used to speak for the whole community,” said Mr. Ahamed. The AIUDF is largely confined to the Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam. “The Assamese Muslims are not part of the AIUDF politics,” said Mirza Zulfiqur Rahman, a researcher based in Guwahati. “Language still remains a major factor among the Muslims. There isn’t much social intermingling between the Bengali Muslims and the Assamese Muslims.” Can class politics work? The ISF, founded by Abbas Siddiqui, says it is a party of the poor, not Muslims. “Poor people have no religion. We have Dalits, tribals and all castes and religions with us,” said Gazi Shahabuddin Siraji, ISF candidate in Canning East, in South 24 Parganas. The leader of the AIUDF, Badruddin Ajmal, claims to speak for all Assamese. “I am Assamese first and Muslim second,” he said in a recent interview. These claims of inclusive politics are weakened by facts on the ground and labelling by their opponents. The combined votes of the Congress and the AIUDF in 2016 was above the BJP in enough number of constituencies to overturn the latter’s victory. But the Congress-AIUDF alliance has triggered other dynamics. A Muslim Congress leader in Assam said: “The BJP’s campaign that Ajmal will become the CM has been effective among Bengali Hindus and Assamese nationalists. This alliance is a net loss for the Congress, and beneficial for the BJP.” “The rise of the BJP is leading to a partial erosion of linguistic divide in the community. In BJP politics, all Muslims are the same,” said Mr. Rahman. Muslims are cognisant of the possibility that a vote to the ISF could benefit the BJP. “TMC could remain the primary choice of the community,” said Mr. Rahman. The religious hostilities could overwhelm the class solidarity that the ISF proposes in Bengal. For instance, the Dalit Matuas who migrated from Bangladesh to West Bengal expect to benefit from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and find little common ground with Muslims who feel threatened by the law.  The rise of the BJP is leading to a partial erosion of linguistic divide in the community.

02 April 2021||KOCHI,||Is development taking a back seat in Kerala campaign?||Rasagi, 46, sells fresh juice at a tarpaulin-covered shanty on the mini bypass at Thripunithura in suburban Ernakulam. Her son, a class 9 student, helps her at work while her husband is a salesman at a shop in Thripunithura town. The family had seen better days when Ms. Rasagi worked as a collection agent for a chit fund, which shut shop after being accused of duping investors. “The biggest problem now is the absence of employment guarantee,” said Ms. Rasagi. The family stays in a rented dwelling near Sree Poornathrayeesa temple. “The municipality had asked all wayside vendors to vacate, but then party workers extended us support to stay on,” she said. For Ms. Rasagi, the biggest poll issues are those concerning livelihood and employment. “Sabarimala is an issue for believers, but has a final verdict been pronounced on it,” she asked. But that has not deterred the Congress-led UDF and the BJP from using it as a poll plank. Misogynistic videos, songs and massive wayside hoardings seeking to stir up sentiments over Sabarimala have marked their campaign besides recurrent references made by senior leaders. Charges against CPI(M) The Opposition is focused on the allegations against the CPI(M)-led LDF government, including a now-withdrawn contract with a U.S.-based firm for the construction of deep-sea fishing vessels which the LDF said was signed by an officer without government concurrence. “Kerala wants to know if the Opposition would dare to compare their performance in 2011-16 with that of ours over the last five years. Are you ready?” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan challenged Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on Wednesday. “They have no alternatives to offer,” said Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac, the architect of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). “Infrastructure that would have taken 25 years for creation could be built in five years, thanks to the KIIFB’s market-sensitive annuity model,” he said. Job generation The vision is to create a modern knowledge society, said S. Ramachandran Pillai, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member. “Take K-FON [Kerala Fibre Optic Network] for instance, which connects every household. Since ‘work from home’ is an accepted practice now, this is going to generate employment for lakhs of people, especially housewives,” he said. “KIIFB is a brilliant model for the medium term to meet the State’s finances,” said writer N.S. Madhavan, a former IAS officer. But the focus has remained largely on welfare measures, without any clear-cut policy initiative on taking forward the ‘Kerala Model’. Mr. Madhavan doesn’t see the campaign around Sabarimala cutting ice with the electorate, as all fronts are almost on the same page on the issue. “That apart, Kerala’s demography doesn’t allow the kind of polarisation that happens in the north.” K.V. Thomas, working president of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, thinks that the Opposition responded positively to the government when the State faced a string of crises, but is duty-bound to call the government’s bluff when it falters. “Wasn’t the government forced to annul the deep-sea fishing vessel building contract after we cried foul,” he asked. The UDF took pains to collect public opinion before putting together its manifesto which is its road map for development, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/is-development-taking-a-back-seat-in-kerala-campaign/article34219546.ece
02 April 2021||New Delhi,||NIA suspects Vaze destroyed video evidence||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) suspects suspended police officer Sachin Vaze has destroyed an unknown number of video footage regarding his alleged role in the murder of Thane resident Manuskh Hiran. Mr. Vaze, assistant police inspector with the Mumbai Crime Branch, was arrested on March 13 for allegedly planting an explosives-laden car near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s mansion. Mansukh Hiran, the last occupant of the Scorpio car that was found near the Ambani mansion Antilia on February 25, was found dead under mysterious circumstances on March 5 near Mumbra. The Union Home Ministry on March 20 transferred the probe into Hiran’s death that was earlier being investigated by the Maharashtra police to the NIA. A senior NIA official said the murder case and the case pertaining to the recovery of explosives near Antilia would be merged. The Maharashtra police had earlier arrested another suspended Mumbai police constable, Vinayak Shinde, and a bookie, Naresh Dhare, for allegedly killing Hiran. “Vaze knew Hiran and it is certain that he killed Hiran. We are making efforts to retrieve other DVRs [digital video recorder] that we suspect could have been destroyed by the accused. There would be many recordings available of Vaze’s movements on that night leading to the murder of Hiran, people who have knowledge of the incident should come forward,” the official said. The NIA at the instance of Mr. Vaze on March 28 recovered a DVR, a laptop, a CPU and two number plates from the Mithi river that was dumped there by the accused. The DVR was allegedly removed from the housing society in Thane where Mr. Vaze lives. Last week, Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant had claimed that when Param Bir Singh was the Police Commissioner, the DVR of the Mumbai Police Commissionerate disappeared from his office. He claimed that the State Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officially took the DVR for investigation on March 10 but it was recalled by Mr. Singh’s office within two hours and since then it has disappeared. Mr. Vaze was reporting directly to Mr. Singh in the said case. The NIA official refused to comment if the former Police Commissioner had been questioned or will be questioned in future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-suspects-vaze-destroyed-video-evidence/article34219598.ece
02 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||UDF uses IISc floods study to target LDF||The findings of an Indian Institute of Science (IISc) study on the devastating 2018 floods in Kerala have been spotlighted by the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) ahead of the Assembly elections to back up its claim that the disaster was avoidable and that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government mishandled the situation. The July 2020 study, carried out by the IISc's Interdisciplinary Centre for Water Research (ICWaR), raises pertinent questions about dam management and points to the need for improved, region-specific rainfall forecast and judicious land use for flood mitigation. The office of the Accountant General (Audit 1) here had engaged the services of the IISc for the study. On March 30, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the IISc finding was a ''chargesheet'' against the LDF government. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy told a press conference here on Thursday that the UDF would take necessary follow-up action if it came to power as scientific studies have proven that the disaster was man-made. Citing reservoir authorities, the study notes that the rule curve was not followed for reservoir operations in Idukki and Edamalayar during August 14 to 18, the peak flood period. The flood cushion between full reservoir level (FRL) and maximum water level (MWL) was not utilised in Idukki during the period. If the flood cushion of 110.42 million cubic metres (mcm) had been used, initial spills could have been reduced. At the Idamalayar dam, the storage volume between full reservoir level (FRL) and maximum water level (MWL) was partially utilised, but the flood cushion was not utilised to its full capacity, it says. Absence of accurate rainfall and flow forecasts affected reservoir operation during the flood period, the study notes.

02 April 2021||PALAKKAD,||CBI to probe death of Walayar siblings||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has taken over the sensational Walayar case, in which two minor sisters of a Dalit family were found hanging in their house under mysterious circumstances on different dates in 2017. The CBI will investigate the case afresh. CBI sources said rape and murder charges would be investigated seriously. Outrage The case, in which rape and murder were alleged, had sparked an outrage and invited national attention when a POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act) court here set free all the accused for want of evidence in October 2019. The victims’ mother, with the support of an action forum formed by Dalit and human rights activists, approached the government seeking a reinvestigation, and later the High Court demanding an inquiry by the CBI. SIT probe The government in January this year formed a special investigation team (SIT) led by Superintendent of Police (Railways) R. Nishanthini to reinvestigate the case. Amidst continuing protests by the victims’ mother under the banner of the Walayar Action Forum, the High Court on March 19 asked the CBI to take over the case. Ms. Nishanthini’s special investigation team handed over the case files to the CBI on March 26. The CBI formally took over the case on Thursday by registering two separate cases before the Judicial First Class Magistrate at Alathur, who is in charge of the POCSO court here. The cases will be transferred to the POCSO court here when POCSO court judge S. Muraleekrishna returns from leave after a week. A CBI team led by DySP Ananthakrishnan will investigate the deaths of the siblings aged 13 and 9 separately. The incident The elder sister was found hanging on January 13, 2017, and the younger one on March 4, 2017. There were allegations against the police for trying to help the accused, who were CPI(M) workers. Pradeep Kumar, one of the five accused in the case, committed suicide. He was found hanging in his house at Cherthala. The CBI, while approaching the case from dual angles of rape and death, has invoked the POCSO Act and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-to-probe-death-of-walayar-siblings/article34219583.ece
02 April 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. targets FM over interest rates||Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Thursday said that there was nothing “inadvertent” about announcing a cut in interest rates on small saving instruments while Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra called the decision to put it on hold as being an “election-driven” move. Stepping up the attack, party chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had no “moral authority” to continue in her position if a decision affecting millions could be taken by an “oversight”. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted that the Modi government, that was “looting” citizens on petrol and diesel, would “start looting the middle class by reducing interest rates on small savings once the elections were over”. At the party’s official briefing, former Union Minister Rajeev Shukla asked Ms. Sitharaman to clarify if the government has altogether cancelled the reduction in interest rates or simply deferred by it a quarter because of the ongoing elections. “Really @nsitharaman ‘oversight’ in issuing the order to increase interest rates on GOI schemes or election driven ‘hindsight’ in withdrawing it?” asked Ms. Vadra in response to Ms. Sitharaman’s tweet in which she described Finance Ministry’s orders to revise the interest rates as “an oversight”. On Wednesday, the Finance Ministry had notified new rates for small savings instruments that effected a cut between 40 basis points (0.4%) and 110 basis points (1.1%) on various instruments for the April to June 2021 quarter. “Announcement of interest rates on savings instruments for the next quarter is a regular exercise. There is nothing ‘inadvertent’ about its release on 31st March. The BJP government had decided to launch another assault on the middle class by slashing the interest rates and profiting itself,” Mr. Chidambaram said in a series of tweets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-targets-fm-over-interest-rates/article34219594.ece
02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rawat launches joint logistics hub||As part of measures to boost tri-service integration and resource optimisation, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat on Thursday operationalised the third joint logistics node (JLN) in Mumbai. “These JLNs will provide integrated logistics cover to the armed forces for their small arms ammunition, rations, fuel, general stores, civil hired transport, aviation clothing, spares and also engineering support in an effort to synergise their operational efforts,” a Defence Ministry statement said. The initiative would accrue advantages in terms of saving of manpower, economise utilisation of resources, besides financial savings. “Establishment and operationalisation of JLNs is a very important first step in the direction of logistics integration of our three Services. Acceptance of each other’s limitations and learning from each other’s strengths and best practices is essential to help improve the functioning and efficacy of these nodes,” Gen. Rawat said. He also released the standing operating procedure of the JLN. The government sanction letter for the establishment of the JLNs in Mumbai, Guwahati and Port Blair was signed on October 12, 2020. The JLNs in Guwahati and Tri-Services, Andaman and Nicobar Command, Port Blair, were operationalised in January this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rawat-launches-joint-logistics-hub/article34219609.ece
02 April 2021||New Delhi,||Dues from mills to sugarcane farmers go up to Rs. 23,000 cr.||Halfway through the marketing season, payment arrears from sugar mills to cane farmers have almost reached Rs. 23,000 crore, leading mills to lobby for the Centre to hike the minimum selling price of sugar. With regard to exports, millers hope that the decision to permit sales to Pakistan and facilitate sales to Iran will help meet targets. Central government data showed that, as on February 28, dues of Rs. 22,900 crore were pending for the cane procured in the current season, which began in October 2020. March and April make up the peak crushing season for sugar. A year ago, arrears stood at around Rs. 19,200 crore. Data from the Uttar Pradesh government shows that more than half the dues are owed to farmers in that State. By mid-March, dues to U.P. farmers for the current season had crossed Rs. 13,600 crore. “The prevailing low ex-mill sugar prices for the last several months, has adversely affected the liquidity of mills and their ability to pay the FRP [Fair and Remunerative Price] to cane farmers,” said the Indian Sugar Mills Association. “The cane farmers and sugar mills are hopeful of an early announcement by the government regarding increase in MSP of sugar as a measure to improve revenue realisation by mills and payment to farmers, which will in turn ease the current situation of very high cane price arrears. Otherwise, it is feared that if current situation persists, then cane price arrears will jump very fast to alarming levels,” it added. Apart from price hikes, the other way to increase liquidity is reduce surplus stocks through exports. ISMA estimates that contracts worth 45 lakh tonnes have already been made. The export target for the marketing year ending September 2021 is 60 lakh tonnes. “The Pakistan government has allowed import of 5 lakh tonnes of sugar, and has recently permitted sugar imports from India too,” said ISMA, noting that this resumption of imports would open a new market for Indian sellers. “Meanwhile, it is learnt that the government is working to find alternate currency exchange options to facilitate sugar exports to Iran and we are hopeful of an early solution,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dues-from-mills-to-sugarcane-farmers-go-up-to-rs-23000-cr/article34219613.ece
02 April 2021||New Delhi,||Finance Ministry defends EPF’s tax-free thresholds||The Finance Ministry has strongly defended its decision to grant a higher tax-free threshold of Rs. 5 lakh for Provident Fund contributions by government employees, compared with private sector workers whose income on annual contributions beyond Rs. 2.5 lakh will be taxed from this year. “I would like you to clarify this. There are two ways the contribution can be made — by the employer and by the employee. In case where the contributions are made by both of them, the employers’ contribution up to Rs. 7.5 lakh is exempt and for employees, it’s Rs. 2.5 lakh. So the total threshold for private sector employees is at Rs. 10 lakh,” Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj explained. “For the government (or for such) funds where only the employee is contributing, we have put a threshold only of Rs. 5 lakh. So, in fact, it’s the other way round,” he said, stressing that private sector employees with higher salaries can have a contribution up to Rs. 10 lakh a year into their EPF accounts with tax-free interest, while those who only contribute themselves face a threshold of Rs. 5 lakh. Mr. Bajaj said that it was incorrect to suggest the tax on EPF income amounted to double taxation as contributions beyond Rs. 1.5 lakh are made from tax-paid income. Section 80C Section 80C limits tax breaks on employees’ PF contributions along with other similar savings instruments to Rs. 1.5 lakh per year, so some experts have pointed out that a part of EPF contributions beyond Rs. 1.5 lakh will face taxation at the contribution stage and savings beyond Rs. 2.5 lakh will be taxed at the income stage as well. “I think that’s a wrong interpretation. We are not taxing your contribution; we are taxing the interest income on your contribution. When you invest in FDs, when you invest in shares, when you invest in company deposits, you are doing the same thing. You are taxed for your income there also,” he pointed out. “It is quite possible that one has put Rs. 1.5 lakh in EPF, Rs. 1.5 lakh in an insurance policy, and then Rs. 1.5 lakh in PPF also. Then he doesn’t get any benefit under PPF. Basically, anything you invest is from your tax-paid income only, but the interest on that will be taxed as that is again your income,” the Secretary said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/finance-ministry-defends-epfs-tax-free-thresholds/article34219617.ece
02 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Frenzied campaign for UDF and NDA||A galaxy of high-profile BJP and Congress leaders has descended on Kerala in a last-minute bid to turn the tide of the electoral battle against the LDF government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Union Ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Prakash Javadekar and Smriti Irani, BJP national president J. P. Nadda, and others have gone on whirlwind tours covering large swathes of the State. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has spearheaded the UDF election campaign. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Sachin Pilot, Salman Khurshid, Jairam Ramesh, A.K. Antony and Shashi Tharoor lend leverage to the UDF’s election pitch. Different styles Mr. Modi has obliquely referred to the UAE gold smuggling case that had dogged the LDF government. Referring to the Sabarimala issue, he said the Kerala government had “used lathis against devotees and trampled on their faith.” Mr. Gandhi has talked about the LDF’s alleged attempt to allow foreign trawlers to raid the State’s traditional fishing grounds. He also promised a law to preserve Sabarimala traditions. Ms. Vadra spotlighted governmental corruption, nepotism, crimes against women, “inherent misogyny” in the LDF, political murders, backdoor appointments and unemployment. In contrast, the LDF has opted for a low-key approach. Apart from a few and comparatively less frenzied roadshows by CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat, it has focused on door-to-door campaigning. It has strived to make the elections a referendum of its governance record and management of the COVID-19 crisis. The LDF has positioned itself as a bulwark against the BJP’s brand of majoritarian politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/frenzied-campaign-for-udf-and-nda/article34219540.ece
02 April 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Roads to Kerala through Dakshina Kannada will not be closed’||The State government on Thursday assured the High Court of Karnataka that it would not close any road connecting Kerala through Dakshina Kannada district to prevent spread of COVID-19. The assurance was given before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj during the hearing of a PIL petition by B. Subbaya Rai, a Mangaluru-based advocate. The petitioner had questioned the closure of 23 roads connecting Kerala through Dakshina Kannada. The government also made it clear that movement of people and vehicles by road through Dakshina Kannada will not be prevented. Following this assurance, the Bench disposed of the petition while observing that the order, issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada in his capacity as Chairperson of the District Disaster Management Authority, was contrary to the Central government’s COVID-19 guidelines issued from time to time asking States not to restrict inter-State movement of people and vehicles. The Deputy Commissioner had initially ordered the closure of 23 of the 27 roads connecting Kerala with Dakshina Kannada citing increased number of COVID-19 positive cases in Kerala while allowing entry through only four main roads with negative RT-PCR test. ‘Ridiculous measure’ After the court termed such a measure as “ridiculous” when roads connecting Kerala from other districts are open; the Deputy Commissioner modified the order leaving it to the discretion of the municipal authorities to close only those roads that are used by very few people. However, the court had again questioned this move pointing out that roads connecting two States cannot be closed in view of the Central government’s guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/roads-to-kerala-through-dakshina-kannada-will-not-be-closed/article34220086.ece
02 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Pinarayi corrects Jayarajan, says party decides a member’s role||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday appeared to correct Industries Minister E. P. Jayarajan on the latter’s decision to quit electoral politics. Talking to mediapersons in Kannur, Mr. Vijayan hinted broadly that CPI(M) members were subject to the party’s will. The party would decide whether a member should contest the elections or focus on organisational work. Mr. Jayarajan had on Tuesday said in Kannur that he was quitting electoral politics. He had averred that he was older than he looked and had chronic health issues. Also, when pressed about Mr. Vijayan electoral innings, Mr. Jayarajan responded in arguably exaggerated terms. He said Mr. Vijayan possessed exceptional energy and was a unique individual. Mr. Jayarajan said persons like him would consider it a blessing if they were half as skilled and resourceful as Mr. Vijayan. Media interpretation Mr. Jayarajan’s observation appeared to provide grist to political rumour mills. A newspaper cartoon suggested that Mr. Jayarajan’s comments about Mr. Vijayan’s prowess were contemptuous and cynical.  Mr. Vijayan, however, seemed to make light of the media interpretation of Mr. Jayarajan’s remarks. Mr. Jayarajan was widely reckoned to be second only to Mr. Vijayan in the LDF Cabinet. He had also held the Chief Minister’s charge when Mr. Vijayan had gone to the U.S. for a month. By some account, Mr. Jayarajan had disapproved of yielding the Mattannur Assembly constituency, which he represented, to Health Minister K.K. Shylaja. Moreover, the CPI(M) State committee had decided not to assign seats to members who had contested the Assembly elections on two consecutive occasions. Several prominent leaders, including high-profile ministers like Mr. Jayarajan, had found themselves without party tickets due to the two-term norm. Recently, Mr. Vijayan had indicated the norms would apply to him in 2026. It had caused some disquiet among their supporters. The uneasiness had manifested as posters in Alappuzha, Kannur and Palakkad districts. It also found an echo in social media. CPI(M) leaders quickly distanced themselves from the campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pinarayi-corrects-jayarajan-says-party-decides-a-members-role/article34219875.ece
02 April 2021||MALAPPURAM,||We will end poverty in Kerala, says Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, MP, reiterated his assurance that there will not be any single person in Kerala without an annual income of Rs. 72,000 from the day after the United Democratic Front (UDF) comes to power in the State. Addressing a UDF election rally at Thuvvoor, near Wandoor, on Thursday, Mr. Gandhi said that the UDF, if elected to power, would revolutionise the State’s economy. ‘Jobs to youth’ “With one stroke, we will eradicate poverty in Kerala, we will revive the economy of Kerala, and we will give jobs to the youngsters of Kerala,” Mr. Gandhi said amid loud cheers from the crowds. “Kerala is going to be the first State in India to have a guaranteed income for all its people. This is a revolutionary idea. We have made calculations. We are confident that this idea itself will transform the State. Every single poor person in Kerala will automatically get Rs. 6,000 a month, and Rs. 72,000 a year,” the Congress leader said. He called upon the people to stretch their minds to imagine a State without a single person or a single bank account having less than Rs. 72,000 a year the day after the UDF comes to power in Kerala. “The poorest labourer, the handicapped, the jobless…. Their income will not be less than Rs. 72,000 a year,” he reiterated. Mr. Gandhi said that without economy the State could not survive or develop. “Just like a car needs petrol, economy is a must for the land. The fuel of the car is petrol, and the fuel of the economy is the money in people’s hands.” Mr. Gandhi accused the Central government of taking away that money from the people’s hands. “GST took that money out of your hands, the new farm Bill took that money out of your hands, rising prices took that money out of your hands, and increasing diesel and petrol prices took that money out of your hands. If you have no money, you don’t spend. When you don’t spend, the economy does not work,” he said. Rousing receptions Mr. Gandhi received rousing receptions at Areekode, Thuvoor and Nilambur. The rally at Nilambur continued late into the evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-72000-annual-income-will-revolutionise-kerala/article34219580.ece
02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||BIMSTEC meet skirts Myanmar violence||India on Thursday expressed commitment about taking the Bay of Bengal community to “new heights”. The statement was made by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar at the ministerial meet of the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), which was held virtually. The meeting drew participation from all the seven-member States, including Myanmar which is witnessing a large-scale crackdown against anti-military protesters. “Our National Security Advisers have met thrice since 2017. They have been working closely and have moved forward in several aspects of security cooperation including counter terrorism, intelligence sharing, coastal security, cyber security, etc in a tangible manner,” said Dr. Jaishankar highlighting the common security challenges facing the member countries. Cohesion among the members has been difficult to achieve mainly because of the Rohingya refugee crisis which created bitterness between Myanmar and Bangladesh. This affected the working of the organisation to some extent as it could not develop a common charter. However, Mr. Jaishankar announced that the organisation will soon have the common set of rules and goals. “I am also delighted to note that the text of the BIMSTEC Charter has been finalised. We hope that all member states will timely complete their internal procedures for its adoption at the fifth BIMSTEC summit,” said Mr. Jaishankar. Thursday’s meeting, the 17th BIMSTEC Ministerial, chaired by Sri Lanka, however, avoided any reference to Myanmar’s current crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bimstec-meet-skirts-myanmar-violence/article34219589.ece

02 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Facial recognition app locked him out of system, claims Uber driver||An Uber driver who went on a pilgrimage to Tirupathi, and returned with a tonsured head, and shaved beard, per religious customs, claimed that he was locked out of the system as a selfie he uploaded, a part of the logging-in process, failed to identify him and was rejected by the company’s facial recognition system. The company has denied the claim. Speaking to The Hindu , 22-year-old driver Srikanth, a resident of Lingampally, said that he returned from Tirupathi and attempted to log-in on February 27 by uploading a selfie in the Uber partner app. While log-ins are approved within a few seconds, the wait this time was longer, and the log-in request was rejected, he claimed. “After the log-in was rejected, I went to the Uber’s Driver Centre in Kondapur the next day and informed them of the problem. The next day, I tried to log-in again, but this time all my requests were blocked. This has never happened before. It has been more than a month and I am unable to work,” Mr. Srikanth said. The issue came to light after Shaik Mohammed Salauddin, who heads the Telangana Gig and Platform Worker’s Union, tweeted Mr. Srikanth’s issue, pointing out that the latter had completed 1,428 trips, and holds a 4.67 star rating. “I have come across such issues before, and there needs to be clarity on the issue. “There are many stories like Srikanth where due to software decisions of the cab aggregators, drivers’ IDs get blocked. Customer complaints lead to immediate drivers’ ID blocks. If there is a conflict of any other app with Uber app on phone the IDs gets blocked (issue of false location),” he said. The issue created a flutter on social media, and organisations like Internet Freedom Foundation voiced their support for Mr. Srikanth, and tweeted: “We voice our support for Srikanth. Gig workers provide a wide range of services and make lives easier for lakhs of Indians. They are increasingly at the mercy of AI based tools that may result in harms. We need institutional safeguards and remedies. CC: @Uber_India”. For their part, Uber told The Hindu that it has a well-functioning facial recognition system, and that Mr. Srikanth had violated the company’s community guidelines. In an official statement sent via email, an Uber spokesperson said: “The driver in question had visited an Uber Partner Seva Kendra when he was unable to log in and it was communicated to him that his access to the app had been removed due to repeated violations of our community guidelines, which set the highest possible safety standards on our platform. Uber’s facial recognition tool is capable of detecting natural changes in a person’s appearance such as long or cropped hair. In case drivers face a problem logging in due to any technical issue with the selfie verification process, they have the option to visit the nearest Uber Partner Seva Kendra for a manual review of their profile.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/facial-recognition-app-locked-him-out-of-system-claims-uber-driver/article34220071.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||No interest cut on small savings||However, by evening, the Budget division in the Department of Economic Affairs issued a memo in “suppression” of Wednesday’s order. “…It has been decided that the rate of interest on various small savings scheme for the first quarter of FY 2021-22… shall remain unchanged from those notified for the fourth quarter of the FY2020-21. This has the approval of competent authority,” the memo said. The ongoing Assembly elections may have influenced the government to rethink the rate cut following a sharp backlash overnight on various social media platforms about the middle class being squeezed further even as retail inflation, and fuel and LPG cylinder prices, are soaring. The government resets the interest rate on small savings instruments every quarter, but this round of rate cuts was significant after three quarters of the rates being left untouched. The last round of rate reductions was in the April to June quarter of 2020. On Wednesday, the sharpest cut was proposed in the quarterly interest rate paid on one-year term deposits, from 5.5% in the January to March quarter to 4.4% in this quarter. The rate of return on the Senior Citizen Savings’ Scheme was cut from 7.4% to 6.5%. The rate of return on the popular Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme was reduced from 7.9% to 7.1% last April and further slashed to 6.4% for this quarter, before the Minister announced the rollback.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-interest-cut-on-small-savings/article34219570.ece
02 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||‘CPI(M) has no right to speak on data sanctity’||Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Thursday said the CPI(M) had no moral ground to sermonise on data sanctity. He was responding to CPI(M) Polit Bureau member M.A. Baby's allegation that Mr. Chennithala had invaded citizens’ privacy by publishing the personal details of nearly 4,34 lakh citizens on the charge that they had illegally come into possession of multiple voter identity cards. Mr. Baby alleged that Mr. Chennithala had published voters' personal information on a website hosted on a Singapore-based server. “This is a serious matter. Mr. Chennithala should explain how voter IDs, names, addresses and other details of people here were handed over for storing abroad. As cross-border data transfer regulations are applicable in our country, he should spell out which legal permission did he seek to share sensitive data with a website hosted in Singapore,” Mr. Baby said. Baby’s argument Mr. Baby also asked whether Mr. Chennithala had procured individual consent before uploading their photographs and individual details on a foreign server. He said Mr. Chennithala's action had raised serious questions about data sanctity. “Double voting should be prevented, there are no two ways about it. But Mr. Chennithala is politicising this too by hinting that adding voters is an LDF ploy to return to power,” Mr. Baby said. Chennithala claim Mr. Chennithala said the Left Democratic Front had compromised the private medical information of lakhs of citizens at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The government had hired a U.S.-based big data analytics firm to crunch medical information to zero in on the most vulnerable segments of the population and to help the administration predict the spread of the pandemic. The process facilitated the company to sell valuable information to major players in the health and insurance sectors, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chennithala-baby-cross-swords-over-data-sharing/article34219804.ece

We have crossed the record collections by a good margin,” Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj told The Hindu.  The indirect tax collections in March were 27% higher than that in March 2020, with revenues from import of goods 70% more than a year ago, and the revenues from domestic transaction, including import of services, 17% higher. “GST revenues crossed above Rs. 1 lakh crore mark at a stretch for the last six months and a steep increasing trend over this period are clear indicators of rapid economic recovery post pandemic,” the Ministry said in a statement, pointing to the 14% growth in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020-21, compared with a 41% decline in the first lockdown-hit quarter. Apart from a recovery in the economy, GST collections were also bolstered by closer monitoring against fake-billing, deep data analytics using data from multiple sources, including GST, Income Tax and Customs IT systems, and effective tax administration over the past few months, the Ministry said. “The all-time high GST collection ... shows a sustained economic recovery and also is a result of audit closures and the government tightening compliance and anti-evasion measures,” said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gst-mop-up-hits-a-record-in-march/article34220073.ece

We had a discussion on this, and the unanimous view of the Cabinet was that until the unilateral decisions taken by India on August 5, 2019, are not reconsidered, it would be impossible to normalise relations with India,” Mr. Qureshi said.  According to media reports in Pakistan, Mr. Qureshi, along with Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid and Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari, were most vocal in their opposition to reopening trade with India. Ms. Mazaari had tweeted against the decision on Indian imports hours before the Cabinet meeting, indicating that there were differences within the Cabinet. “Cabinet stated clearly NO trade with India,” Ms. Mazaari emphasised in a tweet after the meeting on Thursday, referring to India’s “illegal actions” in Jammu and Kashmir. Mr. Rashid told the media that India’s decision to overturn Article 370 was the precondition for any engagement. While New Delhi has made it clear that it will not reverse decisions on Article 370 from a slew of measures taken in August 2019, both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have publicly said that the Statehood of Jammu and Kashmir, which has been downgraded to a Union Territory at present, would be restored at an “appropriate” time. The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment, both on the earlier decision to open imports, and the latest one to defer any easing of trade ties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pakistan-freezes-plan-to-open-imports-from-india/article34219587.ece

The woman, who has filed a complaint with the police, accompanied the sleuths for the exercise. She had in her statement before the judicial magistrate and the SIT alleged that the former Minister had taken her to the flat and sexually abused her, sources said. The SIT also conducted a mahazar of the paying guest accommodation where the victim lived in until recently. SIT officials had raided the accommodation from where they claimed to haverecovered Rs. 9 lakh in cash, prior to the victim appearing before the police. The police were tight-lipped on whether or not the victim has disputed the seizure from her accommodation in her absence. The police have also seized the victim’s phone and her SIM card for forensic examination. She has claimed in her statement that Mr. Jarkiholi not only chatted with her on her phone but also made lewd video calls, and has reportedly submitted screenshots and other evidence of several messages and calls. The mobile phone along with the alleged sex video and voice samples collected from the victim would be sent for forensic examination, SIT officials said. Meanwhile, the victim’s counsel K.N. Jagadish Kumar addressed the media through a social media platform and demanded that the SIT immediately arrest Mr. Jarkiholi. “The victim has deposed before both the magistrate and the SIT, provided supporting evidence, and medical tests and mahazar of the crime scene have also been conducted. What are the police waiting for to arrest the accused in the case?” he said. He also raised suspicion on the integrity of the SIT. “The Chief Minister says the accused will come clean and invites him to campaign for the party in the bypolls.

But a confirmation of the re-infection will require a whole genome sequencing, it stated. According to the study ‘SARS-CoV-2 re-infection: development of an epidemiological definition from India’ which has been published by Cambridge University’s Epidemiology and Infection journal , an investigation was conducted with the objective to develop an epidemiological case definition of possible SARS CoV-2 re-infection. SARS-CoV-2 re-infection is an emerging concern and there is a need to define it, the scientists highlighted. A working epidemiological case definition for re-infection was developed and its magnitude was explored via archive-based, telephonic survey. The epidemiological case definition for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was developed from literature review of data on viral kinetics. Re-infection with SARS CoV-2 was defined as two positive tests at an interval of at least 102 days with one interim negative test.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/icmr-study-helps-define-re-infection/article34219601.ece

He was addressing a National Democratic Alliance (NDA) election campaign meeting in Haripad on Thursday. Mr. Adityanath said that despite the Kerala High Court directing the State government to frame laws to stop 'love-jihad' in 2009, the State had not yet passed such a legislation. By mollycoddling the Popular Front of India (PFI), Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and other jihadi organisations, Kerala had been put on a dangerous path. “In Uttar Pradesh, we have passed an ‘anti-love jihad' law. Despite the court directive, Kerala has not enacted such a law. Why has a law not been made? Both the LDF and the UDF are engaged in vote bank politics and are turning a blind eye to jihadists,” he said. Mr. Adityanath said the alternate rule of the LDF and the UDF had failed to bring the State on the path of development. Mr. Adityanath said the role of the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) had been degraded to a firm recruiting party workers and family members to government jobs. “The LDF government is not concerned about youth, women, farmers, and fishermen. Government jobs are being given to party cadres. Time has come for a change in the State and the only alternative is NDA-BJP,” he said adding that the NDA’s mantra is ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ (collective efforts, inclusive growth).

It was unable to ensure welfare and security of common people, youths, women and workers in the State. We also witnessed how they flip-flopped in front of a raging COVID-19.” “The people should make the verdict of the Assembly polls as their answer to those who violated our customs and traditions,” he said while also thanking the people of Kerala for donating generously towards the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

02 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||COVID-19 hits Singareni coal production||As expected the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the economic activity has taken a heavy toll on the performance of Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) as it has posted the second lowest coal production and despatches in 2020-21 during the last 11 years. According to the company officials, the public sector coal company could mine only 50.58 lakh tonnes of the fossil fuel mainly used in power generation, cement, steel and other industries as also by railways in 2020-21 against the target of 67.5 million tonnes. In terms of percentage it was only 74.93. Similarly, the coal despatches by the company too were low at 48.51 million tonnes or 71.87% of the target of 67.5 million tonnes. Compared to the previous fiscal 2019-20, coal production was hit over 21% and despatched by over 22%. Since 2010-11, it was only in 2013-14 the coal production was the lowest at 50.47 million tonnes as the movement to statehood to Telangana was at its peak and impacted the mining activity with regular strike of work in support of the movement. In despatches too, 2013-14 was the worst-hit when only 47.89 million tonnes of coal was despatched. The officials stated that month-wise production of coal was lower by 40% to 45% during the April-August period of the just concluded fiscal. However, production was slightly higher in two months of the fiscal, when compared to the previous year. “Production was hit for about two months badly during the lockdown period when lay-off was announced in most of the underground mines, except those where coal mining was completely mechanised. The impact of production and demand loss was huge on the company and it is estimated at over Rs. 5,000 crore,” a senior executive of the company said when contacted. The coal demand (consumption) was affected up to 60% during the lockdown period and it had reached normalcy only in a phased manner, the senior executive said adding that that reduced coal demand was met from the opencast and five mechanised underground mines. With the revival of the economic activity following the phased unlock of the restrictions, the demand for coal has picked from all sectors. The company has set a target of 70 million tonnes of coal production for 2021-22 and to achieve it the company has also decided to acquire new machinery and equipment with over Rs. 41 crore. The turnover of the company which was Rs. 24,208 crore in 2019-20 is also expected take a hit in 2020-21 with the COVID-induced slump in production and sales of coal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-hits-singareni-coal-production/article34219786.ece

02 April 2021||Bengaluru,||No assessment for govt. school students in classes 1 to 5||With physical classes on campus for government school students of classes I to V yet to resume and the academic year drawing to a close, the Department of Primary and Secondary Education has decided to do away with assessments. The decision was taken after much deliberation in the backdrop of the surge in COVID-19 cases in the State. Students in classes I to III who are part of the Nali Kali system have no examination, but will have regular assessments based on their learning outcomes. A senior department official said that for those in classes IV and V, the plan is to use written material or assignments that they may have submitted during the Vidyagama programme held between July and October 2020. However, exams will be conducted for students of classes VI to IX as on-campus classes had been reintroduced for them in a phased manner in February. “We have decided to tweak the assessment model. Currently, they have four formative and two summative assessments. The modalities of how and when the assessment will be carried out will be announced next week,” said the senior official.

The Supreme Court had granted Maudany, represented by advocate Haris Beeran, bail in 2014 till the conclusion of the trial before a court at the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail in Bengaluru At that point of time, the top court had granted Maudany bail on the ground that he had already undergone judicial custody for four years since August 2010 and was suffering from various ailments. The Supreme Court’s bail came after the Karnataka authorities had undertaken to complete the trial within four months from November 14, 2014. “More than six years have elapsed and the trial has still not been concluded. The trial was protracted on account of the lethargic attitude of the respondent [State of Karnataka]. The case before the trial court is crawling at snail’s pace and the progress of the trial was hampered on several occasions due to various reasons such as recall and re-examination of witnesses, transfer of special public prosecutor thrice, transfer of presiding officer thrice and now on account of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic,” the application filed by Maudany said.  “He [Maudany] has spent 11 years in jail since arrest and seven years under conditional bail,” the application said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maudany-moves-sc-for-bail-relaxation/article34219584.ece

The J&K administration has approved the transfer of 496 kanal (62 acres) and 17 marla in the Jammu region to the TTD to build a temple and its allied infrastructure. J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha approved the transfer of land for a period of 40 years during a meeting of the J&K administrative council on Thursday. Multiple facilities A government spokesman said the temple will have other allied infrastructure, including pilgrim amenities complex, Veda Patasala, spiritual and meditation centre, residential quarters and parking. “In the future, there would be medical and educational facilities also on the campus,” the spokesman said. The TTD, a trust established in 1932 is a charitable organisation of international repute. “The TTD’s arrival in J&K will tap the tourism potential, particularly pilgrim tourism in Jammu, the city of temples, besides enhancing economic activities,” the spokesman said. The TTD infrastructure will be an attraction for the pilgrims and tourists, in addition to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine and the Amarnathji shrine. “It will enable tourists to come and stay longer in Jammu city and will also contribute to economic growth of the region,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ttd-gets-62-acres-to-build-temple-in-jk/article34219585.ece
02 April 2021||B. Tilak ChandarMadurai,TAMIL NADU||HC directs DGP to take action against Inspector||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Director General of Police to initiate departmental proceedings against an Inspector of Police of the District Crime Branch in Pudukkottai district, after taking a serious note of the fact that the Inspector was involved in a ‘katta panchayat.’ Justice R. Hemalatha observed that the function of resolving civil disputes was entrusted to the judiciary and not to police officers. The courts have time and again deprecated the initiation of false criminal proceedings in cases having elements of a civil dispute, the judge said. The court was hearing the petition filed by L.N. Nithyanantham of Pudukkottai. He said the Pudukkottai police were harassing him and trying to enforce a pre-drafted compromise deed. He sought a direction to the police and the subordinate officers not to harass him. It was said that the police were acting on a false complaint lodged against Nithyanantham. The petitioner had borrowed money from a doctor, S. Ramadoss, to meet family and business expenses. Under these circumstances, Ramadoss lodged a complaint against the petitioner alleging that the latter had received a sum of Rs. 1.5 crore from him to secure a job for his daughter-in-law. Based on this complaint, the petitioner said that the police were harassing him and he was also forced to sign a compromise deed which was pre-drafted to suit the convenience of the doctor. Nithyanantham said he was constantly harassed by the police and asked to pay the money mentioned in the deed. A representation to the Superintendent of police also did not evoke any response, he said. Taking a serious view, the court observed that no person can be forcibly summoned to a police station except in accordance with law. The court has examined the illegal and high-handed act of the Inspector, the judge said. The court quashed the compromise deed and directed the DGP to initiate departmental proceedings against Inspector Anitha Arockiya Mary. The court said quick relief offered by a criminal prosecution as opposed to a civil dispute incentivises the litigant to initiate false and vexatious proceedings. Moreover, in a country suffering the scourge of the world’s largest backlog of cases, litigants often view criminal proceedings as a tool to pressurise and threaten the other party to enter a favourable settlement. It is shameful that law enforcers had become law unto themselves, crossing their boundaries, knowing fully well that they had no business to intervene.

02 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Civic amenities, a priority in Mylapore||For a constituency that has allowed no single party to hold sway, even electing a BJP candidate once, the bet is on how Mylapore will vote this time. R. Nataraj, former Director-General of Police, who won the seat on the AIADMK ticket in 2016, is again contesting on behalf of the party. He will take on Dha. Velu, a long-time resident and former councillor of the DMK. Also in the fray are actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) high-level committee member Sripriya and K. Mahalakshmi of Naam Thamilar Katchi. M. Radha, a transwoman and one of the two transgender candidates across the State, is contesting as an Independent. Incidentally, the AIADMK won in 2006 and 2011. “For many residents’ associations like ours, Mr. Nataraj has been an accessible MLA. Apart from utilising the MLA Local Area Development Scheme funds effectively, he has spearheaded positive initiatives for the community. Going forward, we want the streets to be made more pedestrian friendly, and have offered a proposal for the same,” says K. Viswanathan, secretary, Mylapore Residents Welfare Association. Among the projects that were carried out in the area over the last five years include the construction of storm-water drains in a few areas, which used to get inundated during the rain, and desilting of temple tanks, says R. Chandrasekaran, founder, Raja Annamalaipuram Residents’ Association. “We want some additional focus now on the Buckingham Canal, which should be deepened and cleared of encroachments. Steps can also be taken to create greenery and plant trees along the bank,” he adds. Issues pertaining to traffic congestion on Santhome High Road as well as at junctions such as Luz need attention, some residents say. They have highlighted the need for clearing pavements in several areas of encroachments and addressing the issue of indiscriminate parking of vehicles on busy roads. Among Mr. Nataraj’s areas of focus this time are the beautification of Mada streets around the famous Kapaleeshwarar Temple, establishing a shopping complex at Venkatesa Agraharam to accommodate roadside vendors, and coordination with the authorities to monitor and ensure that the Metro Rail project connecting Lighthouse to Nandanam goes on smoothly. “To address the traffic issues, I have proposed the construction of multi-level car parking facilities in each of the seven wards of the constituency. I also acknowledge concerns regarding water shortage and propose to identify tail-end consumer areas and ensure an equitable distribution of water,” he says. Mr. Velu, once a councillor for Pattinapakkam, says that as a resident of the constituency, he is well aware of the needs of the people and will be accessible. “There are several basic issues that still need to be addressed, including the slow pace of housing projects for fishermen along the seashore. I will also focus on building a market for fishermen along the loop road, besides a hospital and community hall in the area. Our focus will be on developing the area in accordance with the promises made in the DMK manifesto and ensuring that those projects are implemented well,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-amenities-a-priority-in-mylapore/article34220142.ece

02 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||13% of candidates in T.N. have criminal cases, 18% are crorepatis||An analysis done by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has shown that 13% of the candidates in the 2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly election have criminal cases pending against them, and 18% are crorepatis. The analysis shows 6% of the candidates have cases pending against them on serious charges. Of the 3,998 candidates, ADR analysed the affidavits of 3,559 candidates, which is around 90%. Ten from the DMK, 30 from Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK), 23 from Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), and 59 from the AMMK are among the candidates whose affidavits were not analysed because they were not uploaded on the Election Commission of India’s website at the time of compiling the report, the ADR said. Major parties Of the 466 candidates who have declared criminal cases against them, close to 350 are from the major parties. A total of 136 of the 178 (76%) candidates contesting on the DMK’s rising sun symbol have criminal cases, the highest among the major parties. In terms of percentage, this was followed by the BJP. Fifteen of its 20 candidates (75%) face criminal cases. While 50 DMK candidates (28% of the total) face serious charges, the BJP has eight such candidates (40%). Among the 191 candidates fielded by the ruling AIADMK on the two leaves symbol, 46 (24%) have criminal cases, of which 18 (9%) face serious charges, according to the report. Among the other key parties, 71% of the candidates from the Congress, 44% from the PMK, 30% from the DMDK, 29% from the AMMK, 15% from the MNM and 14% from the NTK have criminal cases. The report classified 74 of the 234 constituencies as “red alert constituencies” because they have three or more contestants with declared criminal cases. According to the report, 652 of the 3,559 candidates are crorepatis. Of them, nearly 50% are of the AIADMK and the DMK. The report says that 87% of the DMK’s candidates and 86% of the AIADMK’s candidates are crorepatis. The average worth of assets of each candidate is Rs. 1.72 crore. Among the other parties, 91% of the candidates of the Congress, 75% of the BJP, 63% of the AMMK, 61% of the PMK, 33% of the MNM, 32% of the DMDK and 13% of the NTK are crorepatis. ‘Norms not followed’ Releasing the report, Madras High Court advocate V. Suresh said that though the ECI laid out norms following a consistent fight by civil society in the Supreme Court, they were seldom followed in letter and in spirit. For instance, no party adhered to the norm demanding proactive publication of criminal antecedents of its candidates through advertisements in vernacular and English language newspapers at least thrice before an election. Jayaram Venkatesan and P. Joseph Victor Raj of Tamil Nadu Election Watch, which collaborated with the ADR in the analysis, demanded norms to prevent those with serious criminal charges pending for long from contesting in elections.

02 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A candidate on the platform of development||E. Sarath Babu is a known face among south Chennai residents for his impressive rise from humble origins. Coming from a poor family — his mother brought up five children by running a roadside food stall — the Madipakkam resident went on to start a catering company after completing his graduation at BITS and IIM, Ahmedabad. He has also been involved in welfare activities. Mr. Babu has been aiming to enter political office to cleanse politics. He contested as an Independent in three elections. In this election, he has been nominated in Alandur by the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM).  Having contested as an Independent all these years, what prompted you to join the MNM? I have been contesting in elections since the age of 29. I started out as an Independent in the 2009 Lok Sabha election in south Chennai. Since then, I have been regularly contesting in the elections. Two years ago, I joined the MNM, attracted by its stand against the money power used by the two major Dravidian parties and against cash for votes, and its policy to rid the administration of corruption and create a hunger-free State. Anyhow, I had no plans to start any party... What are your chances of succeeding in this election? My chances look very promising, going by the way in which people, cutting across age groups — especially women and youngsters — are identifying the MNM as a party which can root out corruption and put in place an administration grounded in development. MNM founder and actor Kamal Haasan has a good reputation among the educated. So, in Alandur where there is a large number of middle- and upper-class voters, I am confident of doing well. In the last Lok Sabha election, I polled more than 23,000 votes. Is there any separate manifesto for Alandur? If so, what are the priorities? The MNM has created a separate manifesto for Alandur, promising to merge Moovarasampet village with the Chennai Corporation and installing reverse osmosis plants near water-tanks. A separate 110-kilovolt sub-station would be constructed at Nanganallur, the Adambakkam Lake would be renovated and beautified, a skating rink would be built for the residents of Mugalivakkam and the bus services would be improved. A government arts and science college would be opened at Mugalivakkam. A free coaching centre, along with an employment guarantee centre, would be started at the government school at Kovoor to train students in the civil services examination and NEET. What is your campaign style and how are you reaching out to people? While the two Dravidian parties enjoy good financial and cadre support, our party has never backed the concept of bringing in workers by giving them money to canvass. Though I have a large number of people working in my office and close friends, I have not allowed my business to get mingled with the party work. All those who are helping me in my campaign have volunteered. I have been on an extensive campaign, covering more than 80% of the constituency through road shows, highlighting the need for good governance.

The police said Ravi alias Solution Ravi of Ezhil Nagar in Kodungaiyur, who is a history-sheeter with assault cases pending against him, married Vijayalakshmi, of Pulianthope, a couple of years ago. The couple have a 11-month-old boy. Vijayalakshmi, who was five months pregnant again, fought with Ravi and went to her maternal home in Pulianthope a few days ago. On Wednesday night, Ravi quarrelled and beat up his father-in-law Venkatesh and asked him to send Vijayalakshmi. Even as the couple were walking to Ezhil Nagar around 2 a.m., an argument erupted between the two as Ravi suspected Vijayalakshmi. He suddenly took out a liquor bottle, broke it and stabbed Vijayalakshmi in her neck. Vijayalakshmi died on the spot while Ravi escaped with the child. Arrested within hours The police rushed to the spot and sent Vijayalakshmi’s body for post-mortem. Ravi was caught within hours and the child was rescued from him. He has been charged with murder and remanded in judicial custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tipsy-man-stabs-pregnant-wife-to-death-during-spat/article34220130.ece
02 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Young patients turning up with clinical changes||Of late, doctors are noticing changes in clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients and radiological findings in young patients that have led them to analyse the variations when compared to last year. As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, health officials and doctors have been noting that a significant number of patients are now in the lower age group. They were reporting with variations in clinical presentation, early onset of complications and changes in lung findings. E. Theranirajan, Dean, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, said clinical presentations remained the same in most patients. However, there were certain variations in radiological findings. “In some patients, the lung presentation included nodular patterns with bilateral involvement. We have seen CT scans with such variations as opposed to our earlier findings of ground glass opacities. We have taken samples for biopsy, and our teams are analysing such CT findings,” he said. Patients were turning up with multiple symptoms, said K. Narayanasamy, Director of the Government Corona Hospital that has 480 patients at present. “Earlier, we mostly had people with fever, cough and body ache. Now, many are showing additional symptoms of vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain,” he said. The hospital saw several patients aged between 20 and 45 with breathlessness as many of them preferred home isolation and came in late as symptoms progressed. “We are analysing atypical features in CT scans,” he said. At the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, doctors found certain variations in presentation. “In cases of mild fever, there is aggravation of symptoms in three or four days. There are many persons with swab negative results but positive CT findings. There is sudden deterioration in the condition of patients. As far as CT findings are concerned, we do find some variations such as bilateral involvement, nodular appearances and involvement of the whole lungs as compared to earlier ground glass opacities, unilateral and peripheral involvement. We are studying such findings,” Dean P. Vasanthamani said. Lung issues R. Jayanthi, Dean, Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, said they were seeing more patients aged 30 onwards than before. The hospital has 300 patients. She pointed out that many were clinically symptomatic. “Some patients with breathlessness easily move on to intense lung involvement. However, the percentage of lung involvement shown in a CT scan does not correlate in such cases. Such patients desaturate readily,” she said. In some patients, there is radiologically minimal involvement of the lungs which is disproportionate to their symptoms. The variants may be among the reasons. “Mutations can cause properties to change,” she said. More symptoms K. R. Vijay Chakkaravarthy, head of department, Critical Care Unit, Kumaran Hospitals and Appasamy Hospitals, said, “Last year, many patients came in with fever and sore throat, while some had loose stools and abdominal pain. Now, the proportion of people with loose stools and abdominal pain is a little more compared to last year. They mistake it for common diarrhoea.

02 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Devendrakula Velalars rue lack of leadership||Devendrakula Velalars, who are spread across several districts in south Tamil Nadu, face many issues. But, in an election season, they all agree on one thing: the need to identify and consolidate and speak in one voice. Karunanithi, a senior citizen in a village in Thachanallur in Tirunelveli district, says the community desperately needs a leader like Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi president Thol. Thirumavalavan, who can forcefully articulate its concerns. He is disappointed with the current crop of leaders in the community. “We lack a leader who can speak like Mr. Thirumavalavan. Look at how he speaks for the people he represents. The leaders who emerged within our community and showed promise have only done well for themselves,” Mr. Karunanithi says. While the community members agree that leadership has to emerge from within for pragmatic reasons, many say battle of egos and one-upmanship among the leaders have sapped the community of its electoral strength. ‘One-upmanship’ Kopparai Subramanian, who has been an elected local body representative at Thachanallur since 2006, identifies the battle of egos between the leaders as one of the reasons for the community’s failure to develop. “The constant one-upmanship among the leaders has affected the community’s development. When these leaders disagree and separate, the strength [of the community] reduces. And none of the bigger parties — the DMK, the AIADMK, the Congress, and the DMDK — will like leaders emerging from the community. We are like curry-leaves to them,” he says. Small outfits Activists point out that the community has innumerable small outfits as the functionaries of K. Krishnasamy’s Puthiya Tamilagam or John Pandian’s Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, who split after disagreeing with their leaders, form smaller outfits in the neighbourhoods where they are active. Subsequently, these outfits become smaller and smaller. Madurai Muthu Pandian of Tamilar Viduthalai Kalam, who says his outfit is the third biggest organisation after Puthiya Tamilagam and Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam in the south, says Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attempt to reach out to the community has made Dr. Krishnasamy rethink his strategy and has forced him to again prove his strength within the community. In this election, Puthiya Tamilagam, which was earlier part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, is contesting in 60 constituencies alone, arguing that the BJP has not promised that it will take the community off the Scheduled Caste list. Dr. Krishnasamy has reiterated that this election will be a referendum on whether or not the community wants to leave the list. Mr. John Pandian is contesting in Egmore constituency in Chennai. Jeevan Kumar Malla, president, Bahujan Dravida Party, which is contesting in 20 constituencies in the southern districts, says there is a leadership vacuum within the community due to lack of an ideological approach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/devendrakula-velalars-rue-lack-of-leadership/article34220157.ece

02 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Liver transplant done using microscope||The SRM Institute for Medical Science, Vadapalani, performed a liver transplant under an operating microscope. The microsurgical method reduces post-surgical complications to a large extent and ensures better outcomes for the patient. S. Vivekanandan, lead surgeon, liver transplant, SIMS, said: “Conventionally, liver transplants are done using magnifying glasses (also known as surgical loupes) to enhance visualisation of tissues and blood vessels. But we performed the transplant under an operating microscope, a first in the State.” Surgical microscopes are generally used for brain and microvascular surgeries. Smaller incisions  The microsurgery technique has more advantages as the incisions are small, resulting in less haemorrhage. The handling of tissue was minimised, beside offering closer wound approximation. The surgeries done using microscopes magnify the object under study from about 20 to 30 times and the approximation of tissues is more accurate as thinner suture materials are used. The technique helps in reduction of tissue reactions, which in turn prevent blockage of tissues (thrombus formation) and narrowing (stricture) of the bile ducts in the long term.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/liver-transplant-done-using-microscope/article34220145.ece

02 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Alagiri condemns PM, Adityanath’s remarks on women’s safety in T.N.||Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Thursday condemned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech hitting out at DMK MP A. Raja and Dindigul Leoni, contending that his speech lowered the dignity of office of the Prime Minister and it only showed that the AIADMK-BJP combine were set to lose the Assembly election. Mr. Alagiri said Mr. Modi’s statement that the DMK-Congress alliance was against women and the speech of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath claiming that if the DMK alliance came to power in Tamil Nadu, women won’t be safe, were highly condemnable. The DMK, Congress, Communist parties in the State had for long fought for women’s rights, he said, adding that Indira Gandhi had served as India’s Prime Minister for 15 years and was praised worldwide for her leadership. He said Congress president Sonia Gandhi had protected the nation from the BJP leading the UPA for 10 years keeping the BJP out of power and that Pratibha Patil served as India’s President. He said it was Congress president Sonia Gandhi who had led the efforts to table the Bill for 33% reservation for women in Parliament and Legislative Assembly in 2010 and was passed in the Lok Sabha. “But it was the BJP and other Opposition parties who stalled its passage in the Rajya Sabha and put it in cold storage for 11 years. The BJP government has not even tried to get the Bill passed or taken efforts for it,” he said. Mr. Alagiri said the Congress has a legacy of female leaders who were given importance in the movement from the time of the fight for India’s Independence. “But the RSS has not even had a woman leader. RSS leader Gowalkar’s philosophy itself was anti-woman and the RSS has never given women their rights,” he charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alagiri-condemns-pm-adityanaths-remarks-on-women-safety/article34219733.ece

02 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC: Can’t restrain Shankar from taking up new film without finishing Indian-2||The Madras High Court on Thursday refused to restrain filmmaker S. Shankar from directing any other movie without first completing actor Kamal Haasan starrer Indian-2, for which shooting began in 2019. Lyca Productions approached the court fearing that the movie being made by them on a whopping budget of Rs. 236 crore would get shelved if the director commences shooting of his next pan India project with Telugu actor Ram Charan. Justice P.T. Asha expressed her disclination to grant an injunction without hearing the director. “I am not going to put fetters on a filmmaker from pursuing his work. He has replied to your notice and accused you of having stalled the project,” the judge told Lyca’s counsel. She directed the High Court Registry to issue notice to Mr. Shankar informing him about the commercial suit preferred by the production house and that it would be heard next on April 15. Ealier, advocate R. Prabhakaran, representing Lyca Productions, told the court that Mr. Shankar had entered into a director, author, scriptwriter and screenplay writer agreement with the production house in 2019. As per the agreement, it was his responsibility to make the film and its final cut to the best of his ability and ensure that the movie gets completed with the close of play. Under clause 7.2 of the agreement, the final budget of the film was agreed to be Rs. 236 crore. Since Mr. Shankar was one of the highest paid film directors in the country, it was mutually agreed upon to pay him a remuneration of Rs. 36 crore, apart from being entitled to one-third of the net profit. Counsel also said the production house had paid an advance remuneration of Rs. 14.4 crore to the director and it was willing to deposit the rest of the amount before the court as a pre-condition for grant of an interim injunction restraining him. Stating the company had so far spent Rs. 180 crore onIndian-2and around 80% of the movie was complete, Mr. Prabhakaran insisted that the director should complete the rest of the movie before he takes up any other project. Claiming to have heard from the film industry that the director had decided to commence shooting for his next movie with Mr. Ram Charan sometime in July, counsel said the plaintiff company would suffer a huge loss if its project got shelved.  The judge directed the High Court Registry to issue notice to Mr. Shankar informing him about the commercial suit preferred by the production house||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-cant-restrain-shankar-from-taking-up-new-film-without-finishing-indian-2/article34220359.ece
02 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Police excess: SHRC recommends Rs. 3 lakh solatium to driver’s kin||The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on Thursday recommended that the Tamil Nadu government pay compensation of Rs. 3 lakh to the legal heirs of a cab driver, who killed himself after being harassed by police personnel in January 2019. Besides recommending disciplinary action against sub-inspectors Ramuthai and S. Thangam and head constable S. Perumal in connection with the incident, SHRC member D. Jayachandran condemned the actions of the then Joint Commissioner of Police-West and Superintendent of Police, Railways, for their reported attempt to not bring out the truth in the incident. The Commission also recommended the Tamil Nadu government give suitable instructions to the Director-General of Police to instruct police officials to conduct a proper inquiry on the complaints forwarded by it and to take suitable action against the erring officials. The SHRC had, in 2019, taken suo-motu cognisance of a media report over the incident, including a video clipping of the driver in which he alleged harassment by the police. Eventually, a complaint by the deceased man's brother, M. Ramkumar, was received. According to the media report, cab driver Rajesh picked up a woman employee in Anna Nagar and was waiting for another employee when two policemen hit the rear of the car with a lathi and asked him to move the vehicle from that place. When the driver moved to another place, the policemen returned and verbally abused him. Though the driver said there was a woman passenger inside the vehicle, they further abused him. Later, the driver took the extreme step in Taramani after being humiliated by the policemen. His statement about the harassment was recorded by him on his mobile phone, the report said. During the hearing of the case, it came to light that the investigating officer in the case neither recovered the mobile phone of the deceased nor brought the recorded video to the notice of the authorities, though she was inquiring into the case. She even went on to ask the deceased's brother to delete the video from the mobile phone, even though it was aired on TV channels through the deceased's friends.

02 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. to seek Krishna water from May||The Water Resources Department is planning to make a representation to Andhra Pradesh to release Krishna water to Chennai in the first week of May. The five reservoirs, which supply water to the city, have storage of 9.33 tmcft as against their capacity of 11.75 tmcft. With mercury level peaking in the last few days, the reservoirs, particularly in Red Hills and Chembarambakkam, are losing about 40 mcft of water daily to evaporation. However, officials said there was sufficient storage to cater to the city’s requirement this summer. Moreover, work was in progress to repair vulnerable portions of the Kandaleru-Poondi canal in the State limits. Share of water “We plan to write to Andhra Pradesh authorities this month on water release due for the current spell. We will discuss the share of Krishna water due to Chennai,” said an official. Water is being diverted from Poondi reservoir to Red Hills and Chembarambakkam. Nearly 550 million litres of water a day is drawn from these two reservoirs. On average, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) supplies about 830 million litres of water daily to the city. Tamil Nadu received nearly 8.98 tmcft of Krishna water in two spells since May last, one of the highest quantum of water released since 2011, the officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-to-seek-krishna-water-from-may/article34219779.ece

The two leaders presented a 41-point list of achievements of the current government in the last four years and urged the people to vote for their party to ensure that such achievements were sustained and the State remained peaceful.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-highlights-its-achievements/article34219718.ece
02 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Palaniswami dares Stalin for a debate on corruption charges||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday challenged DMK president M.K. Stalin for a one-on-one debate on the alleged corruption in the AIADMK government. “I will hold a mike, you hold one. Let us debate on the corruption you have been alleging in my government. Let that debate take place in front of the people, who will judge,” Mr. Palaniswami said in Coimbatore, while campaigning for candidates of the alliance. The DMK had presented a list of corruption charges against the AIADMK to the Governor. One of the allegations in the list was a scam in a project in the Highways Department. The government had not sanctioned the project, nor allotted money nor floated tenders. But it was in the DMK list, the Chief Minister said and added that the DMK president went about making frivolous, unsubstantiated allegations against the government. On the other hand, 13 former DMK Ministers, who had been facing cases for the last five years, were seeking one adjournment after another. “The AIADMK’s conscience is clear. Your (DMK) tricks won’t work,” he said. Further, Mr. Palaniswami said the DMK tried to confuse Muslims and Christians to garner votes. But people should think about which of the two parties had addressed their concerns and delivered on the promises. There had been no communal riots in the State in the last four years of his rule, the Chief Minister said. The DMK was trying to portray the AIADMK as anti-minority only to garner votes. Speaking in Erode, he said that during the floor test held in the Assembly in 2017, DMK MLAs stood on the benches and unleashed violence. Even the opposition leader M.K. Stalin threw the Assembly rule book. “It is a place where laws are enacted. If they come to power, how will they protect the people?” he asked. Derogatory remarks Mr. Palaniswami said that DMK leaders were passing derogatory remarks against women and AIADMK leaders during the campaign. “If they are given power, how can people live peacefully?” he asked, adding that the AIADMK would not allow the DMK to come to power. In Coonoor, the Chief Minister hit out at what he termed as dynastic politics within the DMK, stating that the descendants of M. Karunanidhi would not allow “anyone from outside the family to grow” within the party. Mr. Palaniswami said that following the death of Karunanidhi, the post of party president was taken by Mr. Stalin, who then handed over the post of youth wing secretary to his son, Udhayanidhi. Kanimozhi is the secretary of the party’s women’s wing. “Remember that Stalin was youth wing secretary till he was almost 70-years-old,” remarked Mr. Palaniswami. The AIADMK was a democratic party, he claimed. It was possible for every party cadre to rise through the ranks provided he was willing to serve the people, added Mr. Palaniswami. Speaking about Nilgiris MP A. Raja’s controversial remarks, the Chief Minister said the DMK party as a whole took pleasure in hurting the sentiments of others. “But we are a party that takes greatest pleasure from the happiness of others,” he said.  Private company In Namakkal, Mr. Palaniswami alleged that the DMK was a private company and anybody could buy shares in it. In the DMK, seats were given only for persons with money. Even in the Assembly election, only those with money were given seats and there was no place for hardworking cadre in the DMK, he said. Mr.Palaniswami said that those who were removed from AIADMK had joined the DMK. Former Minister Senthil Balaji and Mr. Stalin criticised each other in the Assembly, but today they praised each other, he pointed out. On the criticism levelled by Mr.Stalin against Ministers P.Thangamani, S.P.Velumani and K.C.Veeramani, the Chief Minister said that these ‘Manis’ were like temple bells and their sound would resonate throughout Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palaniswami-calls-stalin-for-debate-on-corruption-charges/article34219736.ece
02 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Yarn price expected to stabilise||Prices of cotton yarn, which were on an upward trend since December, are expected to remain stable in the coming weeks. Chairman of Southern India Mills’ Association Ashwin Chandran told The Hindu on Thursday that following a recent virtual meeting of the textile mill associations from across the country, the associations have urged their members to keep the prices stable this month due to concerns among industries in the value addition segment. Prices of cotton was about Rs. 34,500 a candy in August last year and Rs. 46,000 now. Prices of hosiery yarn was Rs. 215 a kg in August last year and Rs. 291 now. The hosiery yarn requirement of Tiruppur garment units are mostly (75 % to 80 %) met by the textile mills in Tamil Nadu. The mills are operating at 85 % to 90 % capacity as against the normal of 93 % to 95 %. This is because of labour shortage and to some extent working capital crunch. Mr. Chandran said that with gradual decline in export orders and domestic demand, textile mills in the country were facing several challenges since 2015. Many mills had closed down, too. The problems aggravated during lockdown last year. However, demand starting reviving in August for select products and picked up for all products. With an unexpected surge in requirement for yarn, the mills were unable to increase production suddenly. Hence, there were problems in supply to the customers. Prices also went up because of higher cotton prices. “There was a pent up demand and inventory filling happened at every level. There were logistics-related challenges too. Hence, there was a demand-supply mismatch for a couple of months,” explained Mr. Chandran. “Things should normalise now,” he said. However, Indian yarn prices continue to be lower than international prices. Hence, the end product manufacturers should talk to their customers for higher price realisations, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/yarn-price-expected-to-stabilise/article34219758.ece

The CCC’s secretary K. Kathirmathiyon said the advertisements were illegal as the advertisement agencies concerned had failed to take the permission of the appropriate authority, in this case the District Collector, were against various Madras High Court orders, in violation of the Indian Road Congress norms and caused revenue loss to the exchequer. The advertisements were at shelters at bus stops, in the form of digital boards in various places and alongside roads. Though the CCC had written letters in May 2018, November 2018, September 2019 and October 2020, the Corporation had failed to remove the boards. The Indian Road Congress had specifically banned advertisements with moving lights – digital advertisement boards as they were illegal. And, as they were illegal no advertisement fee could be fixed. After the CCC pointed out that such violations to the state Government, the Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department Secretary wrote to the local bodies directing them to strictly comply with the IRC norms, court orders and rules. But as the Corporation had failed to initiate action and as such action had caused revenue loss to the state Government, the CCC was constrained to move the Madras High Court with a contempt of court petition and take the issue to the notice of the appropriate authority for departmental inquiry, Mr. Kathirmatiyon added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/remove-illegal-advertisements-consumer-body-tells-corporation/article34220160.ece

02 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Kamal Haasan is a twitter politician: Vanathi||Makkal Needhi Maiam president Kamal Haasan who had been seeking votes in Coimbatore South Assembly constituency is a Twitter politician, who is yet to mature politically, BJP candidate for the constituency Vanathi Srinivasan said here on Thursday. Referring to the incident in Puducherry, where Mr. Haasan threw his party symbol, torchlight, into his campaign vehicle, Ms. Srinivasan said his reaction only showed that he was yet to mature. In an attempt to dismiss the stone-throwing incident at a rally the BJP had conducted on Wednesday, Ms. Srinivasan said it was a minor incident. What was more important was who was trying to blow it out of proportion for political mileage, she said. The BJP was for inclusive growth and not for creating communal tension. At this juncture, it must be remembered that it was during the DMK regime that Coimbatore witnessed communal clashes and bomb blasts. The DMK should apologise for these incidents and also for the anti-women comments its party leaders made at campaigns, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kamal-haasan-is-a-twitter-politician-vanathi/article34220159.ece

Ravi of the Special Court for TNPID Act awarded 10 years of simple imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs. 21 lakh on the accused Prakash.

02 April 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Sushma Swaraj’s daughter hurt by Udhayanidhi’s remarks||Bansuri Swaraj, the daughter of former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, on Thursday disapproved of DMK youth wing leader Udhayanidhi Stalin's recent remarks on the death of her mother. During his campaign at Dharapuram in Tiruppur district on Wednesday, Mr. Udhayanidhi read out a list of senior BJP leaders, who he alleged were sidelined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As he mentioned the name of Sushma Swaraj, he claimed that she died after being “unable to bear the torture of Modi.” Swaraj died on August 6, 2019 at the age of 67 years after suffering a heart attack. False statements Taking to Twitter on Thursday, Ms. Bansuri wrote: “@udhaystalin ji please do not use my Mother's memory for your poll propaganda! Your statements are false! PM @Narendramodi ji bestowed utmost respect and honour on my Mother. In our darkest hour PM and Party stood by us rock solid! Your statement has hurt us @mkstalin @BJP4India” The DMK youth wing leader also alleged that former Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had died due to the “pressure and torture” exerted by Mr. Modi.

02 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Stalin challenges CM to pose questions to PM||DMK president M.K. Stalin, while campaigning in Mettupalayam on Thursday, asked Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to pose a set of questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi when they share the dais in Madurai on Friday. Mr. Stalin challenged Mr. Palaniswami to ask the Prime Minister questions on issues such as Citizenship Amendment Act, NEET and the three farm laws. He also wanted the Chief Minister to speak about the release of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, the debt relief package that the State had asked for after natural calamities, India’s abstention from voting in the United Nations Human Rights Council and Centre’s opposition to 7.5% reservation in medical seats. “Even if Mr. Palaniswami does not have the courage to stand upright to ask the questions, let him genuflect or crawl, but still ask the questions because the interest of the State is paramount,” Mr. Stalin said. Likewise, he should also appeal to Mr. Modi to go around the site chosen for building the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Madurai, to check how much progress had been made. In Mettupalayam and Kavundampalayam, where Mr. Stalin campaigned for the Secular Progressive Alliance candidates, Mr. Stalin said many poll pundits were commenting that there was no wave in this election. “There is not just a wave: a tsunami is coming. The DMK-led alliance will sweep all the 234 seats,” the DMK president said. The Opposite camp would get washed out. Along with the BJP candidates, AIADMK contestants should also be defeated because on winning, the AIADMK MLAs would start functioning as BJP MLAs, he said. Mr. Stalin said it was important that the DMK alliance won all the seats in the Kongu belt to shatter the notion that this region was an AIADMK stronghold. “In the 2019 Parliament election, the DMK had dented that image. Now it is time to completely destroy that notion,” he said. Taking on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who campaigned in Coimbatore on Wednesday, Mr. Stalin said it was unfair on the part of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister to say that women would start feeling unsafe under the DMK regime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-challenges-cm-to-pose-questions-to-pm/article34219729.ece

02 April 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||‘Both Centre, State responsible for fuel price hike’||Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.A. Alagiri on Thursday said that continuous increase in fuel prices led to sky-rocketing of price of essential commodities, affecting the common public and blamed both the Central and the State governments for levying additional taxes on fuel. Canvassing for party candidate Thirumagan Evera, who is contesting in Erode (East) Assembly constituency, he said that when the Congress was in power, crude price was $108 per barrel, petrol was sold at Rs. 70 per litre and LPG cylinder at Rs. 442. But now, when the price of crude oil was $54 per barrel, petrol was sold at Rs. 94 per litre while the LPG cylinder cost Rs. 900. “Since the crude price had dropped, petrol should be sold at Rs. 35 per litre and LPG cylinder at Rs. 200,” he said and added that levying of taxes by both the governments was causing more burden on people. Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who, during his campaign at Dharapuram, said that the Congress-DMK alliance have an ‘anti-women mindset’, Mr. Alagiri said the Congress party was led by Indira Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. “Was the BJP or RSS led by any women,” he questioned. He said once DMK president M.K. Stalin assumed office as Chief Minister, economic reforms outlined by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would be followed and price of essential commodities would be brought down. “Changes will be made to the Goods and Service Tax to reduce price of items,” he said. Mr. Alagiri said a sum of Rs. 640 crore was spent to promote Sanskrit that was studied by 26 lakh people while Rs. 7 crore was spent for promoting Tamil that was spoken by eight crore people. “The BJP and the RSS are carrying out a cultural invasion and the one-nation, one-language policy will not succeed,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/both-centre-state-responsible-for-fuel-price-hike/article34219778.ece
02 April 2021||Karur,TAMIL NADU||‘Boycott corrupt DMK-Congress alliance’||Stating that the BJP-AIADMK alliance was the only front that stands for development, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday urged voters of the State to boycott the ‘corrupt’ DMK-Congress alliance. Canvassing votes for Aravakurichi BJP candidate K. Annamalai and the Karur constituency AIADMK candidate M. R. Vijayabhaskar at Velayuthampalayam, Mr. Shah said that the BJP-AIADMK front was committed to develop the State in all aspects. The Centre and State governments led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam had spent time and energy to implement a number of developmental and welfare projects. It was with the aim of taking the agenda of development to the next level that the Centre had allocated funds to the tune of Rs. 1,60,000 crore to the State, he said. Mr. Shah said that the BJP, which had spearheaded the agenda of development all over the country, would work further for the growth of the State. “Vote for the BJP-AIADMK alliance and it is a vote for development. Hence, the voters should give a resounding victory to the front,” he said. Later Chief Ministers M. G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa were tall leaders of the State and the candidates of the BJP-AIADMK alliance had their eternal blessing, he added. The Home Minister said that the Congress and the DMK front was nothing but an alliance of corrupt forces. There should be no place for dynasty politics in the State and voters should boycott the corrupt alliance. Mr. Shah said that Mr. Annamalai, the BJP candidate in Aravakurichi constituency, had a great track record as an honest police officer. Hence, the voters should reward Mr. Annamalai by electing him to the State Assembly. Earlier, accompanied by Mr. Vijayabhaskar and Mr. Annamalai, Mr. Shah travelled on a decorated open vehicle from High School Medu to Velayuthampalayam and canvassed for votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/boycott-corrupt-dmk-congress-alliance/article34219711.ece
02 April 2021||Karur,TAMIL NADU||Mugilan, other activists held in Karur||The police on Thursday took S. Mugilan, coordinator, Tamil Nadu Environmental Protection Movement, and a few others into preventive custody for planning to stage a black flag demonstration against Home Minister Amit Shah during his election visit to Karur. The police also detained Gunasekaran, general secretary of Samaaniya Makkal Katchi, hours before the arrival of the Mr. Shah to campaign in support of the Aravakurichi BJP candidate, K. Annamalai. The police, who visited the house of Mr. Gunasekaran, at Vellalapatti near here, took him into preventive custody. Mr. Gunasekaran raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Shah for “indirectly favouring” the BJP government in Karnataka to construct a dam across the Cauvery at Mekedatu. Mr. Gunasekaran had earlier declared that he and his party men would show black flags to Mr. Shah for his failing to stop the attempt of the Yediyurappa government to construct the dam, which was against the interests of Tamil Nadu. Similarly, Christina Samy of Swaraj India was also taken into preventive custody for planning to wave black flag against Mr. Shah. Mr. Mugilan claimed that the Central government had been supporting the Karnataka government to construct the dam at Mekedatu. It had allocated a substantial amount in the State budget for the construction.

02 April 2021||Krishnagiri,TAMIL NADU||Factionalism may hinder AIADMK’s chances||Bargur constituency has always been viewed as the AIADMK forte, and is famously invoked for having been the first constituency of the AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa’s electoral contest under the faction led by her in 1989, and equally remembered as the constituency that handed out her defeat in 1996. A major part of the constituency except Kaveripattinam union is dry. With agriculture as the mainstay, cultivation was sustained by bore well irrigation. Today, number of borewells has turned dry and this has affected water availability for livestock too. The lush coconut groves and plantains that were once sustained by pump irrigation have become unsustainable. For the constituents, the implementation of Badethalaavaai canal project will help filling up of lakes from the run-off from River Thenpennai. The project will help filling of 28 lakes that are fed by River Thenpennai. The promise figured in the poll manifesto of the AIADMK in 2016, but was not implemented. Bagur was held for the last two terms by the AIADMK and briefly held by the DMK in 2009. Notwithstanding its image as an AIADMK forte, Bargur is now encumbered by anti-incumbency and factionalism. The AIADMK has fielded A. Krishnan, a native of Kaveripattinam union. Seen as ‘unfamiliar’, he is also viewed to have won the ticket at the behest of AIADMK leader from Kaveripattinam K.P. Munusamy. On the other hand, Bargur is also seen as a turf of AIADMK’s M. Thambidurai, a countervailing figure to Mr. Munusamy. Mr. Krishnan’s candidature will have to wade through factionalism. The DMK has fielded D. Mathiyazhagan. Mr. Mathiyazhagan was the district secretary of Rajini Makkal Mandran until early 2019, when he switched sides with a considerable chunk of fans to the DMK. Amid speculations that he would be given a ticket for the Lok Sabha constituency, there was dissent to according importance to a new entrant. Mr. Mathiyazhagan is also the president of the pulp industries association of Krishnagiri district and has an array of business interests in Bargur in the form of quarries and factories. Though seen as a reasonably new entrant to the DMK, his pitch is also that he is a native of a village in Bargur constituency. The constituency’s vote bank includes a considerable section of Naidus, Vellalar Gownders. It also has an equal proportion of Vanniyars and Dalits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/factionalism-may-hinder-aiadmks-chances/article34219766.ece

02 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||DMK election manifesto is like a counterfeit note: OPS||“While the election manifesto of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is like counterfeit currency, the manifesto of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) is the real currency,” said Deputy Chief Minister and AIADMK Coordinator O. Panneerselvam here on Thursday. Campaigning for AIADMK’s Madurai East candidate R. Gopalakrishnan, Mr. Panneerselvam said the AIADMK had implemented schemes that were beneficial for the present and for the future. The AIADMK government had built over 6.50 lakh concrete houses for the poor till date. Many policies of the AIADMK were aimed towards women empowerment and their welfare. Financial aid of Rs. 25,000 was given for marriage of women from poor families. Similarly, financial aid given to educated women from poor families for marriage will be increased from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 60,000. The financial aid given under Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Benefit scheme will be increased from Rs. 18,000 to Rs. 21,000. While the AIADMK had fulfilled its promises made in the previous elections, the DMK did not do so, he said. Explaining the promises made in AIADMK'S election manifesto, Mr. Panneerselvam said six cooking gas cylinders would be given for free every year for each household. The State government had implemented many schemes for the welfare of students, which helped in ensuring that nearly 49% of students opted for higher education. Mr. Panneerselvam also canvassed votes for Tirumangalam candidate R. B. Udhayakumar, Sholavandan contestant K. Manickam and Tirupparankundram candidate V.V. Rajan Chellappa. IT hub Madurai East constituency would be made a Information Technology hub and in the next five years it would witness a rapid growth, said AIADMK candidate R. Gopalakrishnan. Speaking to reporters, the former Madurai MP, elected in 2014, said once the eight-km-long elevated road on New Natham Road was thrown open to traffic, it would serve as an incentive for IT companies to set up their offices in Madurai. IT parks would be built as in Chennai and Coimbatore. Madurai needed better infrastructure. CCTV cameras would be installed in wards which were annexed to the corporation so as to ensure safety of women. Mr. Gopalakrishnan, who had served as Deputy Mayor, said he was instrumental in getting Central fund of Rs. 290 crore for Madurai Corporation for underground drainage project in the added wards. And funds from the Union Highways ministry for laying the four-lane Chettikulam-Natham highway and for four lane Ring Road expansion.

02 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||MP flays ‘oversight’ in reducing interest rates||Flaying the Central government’s announcement on reduction of interest rates for various small savings schemes, Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan said the Centre had hurt the common man several times due to oversight in the last seven years. He was reacting to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman who had said that the order to reduce interest rate for several small savings schemes was due to “oversight.” She had ordered for the restoration of the interest rates to the old rates. In a statement, Mr. Venkatesan said the Centre had “carefully” helped the Corporates all these years. Only because of the “oversight,” the Centre had increased the price of petrol, diesel and cooking gas and collected Rs. 1 lakh crore from the people in the last one year. “However, with all care you had given several lakh crores to Corporate friends Ambani and Adani by reducing corporate tax. Could Mr. Ambani’s fortune have increased to Rs. 1.40 lakh crore during the COVID-19 year of 2020 without your care?,” the Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP asked. Recalling that the interest rate of several small savings schemes were reduced with a single order on Wednesday, Mr. Venkatesan said that small savings does not mean stashes of currency notes but blood and sweat of the poor and middle class people. Stating that the Centre had never cared for the common man, Mr. Venkatesan said that the fear of election had forced the Centre to take back the order within 24 hours. “The voters will ensure that this fear in you continued with their judgement on the polling day,” he said.  Could Ambani’s fortune have increased to Rs. 1.40 lakh crore during the COVID-19 year of 2020 without your care? Su.

In his public interest litigation petition, advocate K. R. Raja of Madurai said most of the prison inmates depended on free legal counsels assigned by the District Legal Services Authorities for case details. But the counsels could be shifted to other duties as per the monthly duty roster prepared by the DLSA. Due to lack of information and problem in accessing information about their case status, the prison inmates were depressed. He said that he sent a detailed representation to the prison authorities to set up information kiosks in central prisons and also to provide a computer with Internet connection and printer for the legal counsels to assist the prison inmates in accessing the information. But there was no response from the prison authorities. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S.

Palaniswami alleged here on Thursday the DMK gave seats only for those with money. There was no place in the party for hard-working cadres. Campaigning at Namakkal, Mr. Palaniswami also pointed out that those who were removed from his party had joined the DMK. Former Minister Senthil Balaji had jumped five parties. He said the AIADMK was firm on its policies and all hard-working people were with the party. On the criticism levelled by Mr. Stalin against ministers P. Thangamani, S.P. Velumani and K.C. Veeramani, the Chief Minister said these “Mani”' were like temple bells and their sound would resonate throughout Tamil Nadu.

Karunanidhi's birth anniversary — if the DMK was elected to power, party MP Kanimozhi said here on Thursday. Seeking support for Natham DMK candidate Andi Ambalam, she said he was not only simple and accessible, but also one among them. Attacking AIADMK candidate Natham R Viswanathan, she alleged that he had done nothing tangible for the district or the constituency. The DMK, if elected, would establish a government arts and science college in the area and a government polytechnic at Sanarpatti. Taking a dig at BJP and AIADMK, she said both had a hidden agenda and, in order to promote themselves, they were trying to retain power. The Palaniswamy government had pledged the self-respect of the Tamils. In every aspect, the BJP attempted to push Hindi. For instance, the name of the candidate list of the BJP was in Hindi. The condolence message to Mr. Palaniswamy recently from Union Home Minister Amit Shah was written in Hindi. The government had thus lost its independent identity. Both Mr. Palaniswamy and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam had promised many programmes, but in reality, the people had not benefited. In Periakulam constituency, seeking votes for party candidate A. Maharajan, she said the DMK had stated in its manifesto that Rs. 100 would be given as subsidy on LPG refill. Likewise, under the MGNREGA scheme, jobs would be for 50 days from the present 100. The wage too would be enhanced from Rs. 200 to Rs. 300 each. Vacancies in government departments would be filled up only with Tamils in the State, she said and charged the AIADMK coordinator Mr. Panneerselvam with doing nothing though he hailed from the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-cardholders-will-get-rs-4000-on-june-3-if-dmk-wins-assemebly-poll-kanimozhi/article34219745.ece

Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundarajan will launch a vaccination programme, targeted exclusively at women, by taking the first shot of COVID-19 vaccine at the Rajiv Gandhi Government Women and Children’s Hospital at 10 a.m. on Friday. Addressing a press conference at the Raj Nivas, Ms. Soundararajan said she was getting vaccinated to instil confidence in the public to volunteer for immunisation against COVID-19. She noted that there had been a surge of fresh cases in the recent weeks across the country, while some countries were considering going into lockdown to contain the second and third wave of the infection. “It is too early to consider a harsh measure like a lockdown. But it can neither be completely ruled out if the spread of the variant strain of the coronavirus is not contained. The best strategy is to prevent the spread through vaccination and adoption of safety measures,” she said. Pointing out that unlike last year when hospitals were flooded with COVID-19 patients, she said the advantage now was that the country was able to develop an effective vaccine. The health administration is scaling up testing infrastructure, given the spurt in fresh infections, she added. Ms. Soundararajan urged the public to seize the opportunity to get themselves immunised at the earliest. Vaccination facilities were now available at all government hospitals/PHCs and private medical colleges. “We have adequate stocks of vaccines and have also made arrangements to scale up in accordance with demand,” she said. ‘Follow protocols’ The Lt. Governor reiterated her appeal to the public to maintain guard by wearing masks, sanitising hands and maintaining distancing. She also urged political parties and attendees of rallies to adopt safe practices during electioneering. Meanwhile, 868 healthcare workers, 1,394 frontline personnel and 1,431 members of the public took their first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine in the last 24 hours.

The village coming under Kuralnathan Panchayat in Veerapandi Assembly constituency is located in Jarugumalai Reserved Forest of Salem Forest Division where two villages, Melur and Keelur, are located that has a total of 716 voters. Reaching Jarugumalai is a herculean task as one has to trek for 3.5 km from the foothills through the terrain road. Pregnant women and patients are carried in a cradle or cot to reach the foothills and to the hospitals. Also, provisions and LPG cylinders are carried as head-load by the villagers to Jarugumalai on foot that takes over two-and-a-half hours to reach. Election materials to the booth at the Panchayat Union Middle School are carried as head-load by the villagers in all the elections held so far. Hence, there is a demand for road facility to the village. An earthen road was formed under MGNREGS for 8 km. But, vehicles could not be operated. A proposal was submitted in 2018 for diversion of 4.80 hectare of forest land for upgradation of the eight km road from Erumapalayam Panangadu to Jarugumalai. Also, 9.60 hectare non-forest land was identified in Kurichi village as compensatory land for the forest area diversion proposal. Since the existing right of way for the length of 1.60 km could not be improved due to improper gradient, a new alignment was proposed and clearance was obtained from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. Under NABARD funding, the road was laid for 7.1 km at Rs. 9 crore and work was completed in January this year. Election officials said that vehicles would be used for ferrying poll materials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vehicles-to-ferry-poll-materials-to-jarugumalai/article34219773.ece

However, in a bid to attract votes, the AIADMK promised to express its concern through resolutions after the election. This would not happen, he said. Referring to the huge crowd at the venue, Mr. Raja said it indicated a change of government, and appealed to the people to teach a lesson to the AIADMK. The BJP, which was trying to inculcate ‘sanathana’ ideologies, should not be given space in the land of Periyar and Anna. The Tamils alone could stop the BJP’s growth and hence, the whole nation would watch the results on May 2. He said that Tamil Nadu was known for social justice and women empowerment. The number of the unemployed in the State had touched an all-time high. To restore the lost sheen of the Tamils, the DMK combine should have absolute power, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/entire-nation-will-watch-tn-results/article34219743.ece

Mr. Negi had started his preparation for the GATE 2021 exam in March 2020 when the COVID-19 lockdown was imposed. His preparation was by self-study through reference books, making notes and solving a lot of numerical problems, besides attempting a lot of mock tests. “Preparing for GATE developed my mental fortitude, and the good ranking has opened up opportunities in the field of higher studies and jobs,” Mr. Shivam said. Mr. Potti who started his preparation during September 2020 also went through the process of self-study. “Understanding the concepts well and applying them for problem-solving plays a major role in getting a good GATE rank,” he said. The students said they were guided by their faculty and that Chemical Engineering coursework at NIT-T turned out to be of immense utility. Mr. Negi is looking forward to working as a staff scientist at BARC while Mr. Potti has set sights on postgraduate studies. Nine more students in the NIT-T have cleared GATE this year, Institute Director Mini Shaji Thomas said congratulating the faculty and students.

02 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||These candidates tap the youth bank to garner votes||Candidates of parties like Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) and Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK) who are contesting in Tiruchi for the upcoming elections have pinned their hopes of getting the votes of young voters. They are also hopeful that neutral voters would sway in their favour. With campaigning for the elections set to draw to a close, candidates are pulling all the stops in the hope of garnering support. While bigger parties depend on their traditional vote-banks, the new crop of parties seek to woo the youth and women who are unhappy with the two Dravidian parties. M. Muruganandham, MNM candidate for Tiruverumbur, said that the constituency lacked basic facilities and could have been a hub of industries and education, on par with Chennai, had there been better representation in the Legislative Assembly. He has come up with what he calls a ‘micro plan’ -- a 25-point strategy to focus on improving the basic infrastructure and providing job opportunities, among others, in the constituency. “There is no need to fully depend upon government funds. I also propose to involve CSR funds, funds from NGOs and organisations like the Lions Club and Rotary Clubs to help better the facilities,” he said. “While campaigning I ask people not to side with the candidate who they think will win, but vote for the candidate whom they think is sincere,” he added. Mr. Muruganandham, M. Abubacker Siddiq, the MNM candidate for Tiruchi West, K. Selvarathi and R. Prabhu, the NTK candidates for Srirangam and Tiruchi East, respectively, were all of the opinion that a section of the public which was unhappy with both the main parties could vote in their favour. “First-time voters from all sections of the society will vote for us. Social media has played a huge role in creating an image of a new wave,” Mr. Prabhu said. Mr. Prabhu said candidates of bigger parties had only ‘descended’ in the constituency ten days ago, while he has been doing the groundwork for the last two months. “I had also been a part of one of the Dravidian parties until 2009. I was unhappy too, so I know what the people are feeling,” he added. Mr. Siddiq said that they were not chosen based on the amount of money they had in the bank, but how well they knew the area. “I have been working in this area for the last 20 years. That is the biggest power we have over the other parties,” he said. Ms. Selvarathi, who had contested in the local body elections last year said that many young voters hand joined her in campaigning for her party. She believed that people had seen the ‘true colours’ of the government during the COVID-19 lockdown and were unhappy with their handling of the same.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/they-tap-the-youth-bank-to-garner-votes/article34219704.ece
02 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Another intense duel on the cards||The AIADMK and the Congress are locking horns yet again in the Aranthangi Assembly constituency in Pudukottai district, making it almost a repeat of the 2016 contest. The only change is the candidate fielded by the AIADMK, while the Congress which is an ally of the DMK-led secular front has retained the contestant who lost the battle on the previous occasion. The AIADMK has brought back former MLA M. Rajanayagam, who won from the same constituency in the 2011 polls, to taken on the Congress candidate T. Ramachandran, son of six-time MLA from the same constituency and former Union Minister Su. Thirunavukkarasar. Situated in the tail-end of Pudukottai district, the Aranthangi Assembly segment is largely a dry region where farming and fishing activities are the predominant occupation of the people. Encompassing the three taluks of Aranthangi, Avudaiyarkoil and Manamelkudi, the Aranthangi constituency is endowed with a long coastline comprising several coastal villages in its limits. There is hardly any industry in the constituency which has not witnessed any major development in the past decade, complain voters. Despite being one of the major towns in Pudukottai district, Aranthangi is yet to have an underground drainage system in place which has been a long pending demand. Although plans were conceived, the project is yet to take off. Fisherfolk in the coastal areas complain that they have to buy potable drinking water as the water supplied by the local body could only be used for cleaning utensils and washing clothes. “Notwithstanding repeated representations from the fisherfolk to carry out repair works in the Kottaipattinam fishing harbour which had suffered damage, concrete steps are yet to be taken by the Fisheries Department,” says Asan Mohideen, president of the Kottaipattinam Mechanised Boat Fishermen Association. Although officials inspected the harbour and kept assuring that the fishermen’s representation would be looked into no tangible work to address the problem has been carried, says Mr. Asan Mohideen. The Jagadapattinam fishing harbour had also suffered damages which were yet to be rectified despite representations having been given, says T. Mohan, vice president of the Visai Padagu Sangam, Jagadapattinam. “Just as loans were being given to farmers, fishermen should also be given loans to repair their boats, nets and other paraphernalia to enable them carry out fishing,” suggests Mr. Mohan pointing out that the fisheries sector contributes substantially to foreign exchange earnings. . The government could also think of opening a separate bank for fishermen in the coastal area to give them loans and address their other financial needs in view of the fact that the fisheries sector contributes hugely to foreign exchange earnings, suggests Mr. Mohan. Fishermen have also been seeking an increase in the allocation of subsidised diesel per month from 1,800 litres to 3,000 litres in view of the sharp hike in the price of fuel. The Aranthangi constituency could really boast of visible development if the elected representatives and the government brings in industries that would generate employment directly and indirectly. Although a section of DMK men took to the streets in Aranthangi recently urging the party leadership that the seat should not be allotted to an alliance partner this time, the party high command decided to allocate it to the Congress again. The Congress candidate Ramachandran who lost to the AIADMK candidate by a slender margin in 2016 is heavily banking on the support of the DMK and the perceived anti-incumbency, say locals. With the AIADMK candidate Mr. Rajanayagam posing a tough challenge, the constituency is witnessing an intense duel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/another-intense-duel-on-the-cards/article34219713.ece
02 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Most engineering colleges complete practical exams for final year students||Most of the engineering colleges here have completed practical classes and practical examinations for final year students before March 31, as per the directive issued by Anna University, in view emergence of COVID-19 clusters, but are pondering how the practical exams could be conducted for students in the first, second and third years. As per the Government Order dated March 22 issued by the Revenue and Disaster Management Department, the practical classes and practical exams must be completed in physical mode by March 31. For those UG/PG programmes in non-autonomous affiliated colleges where laboratory classes and examinations cannot be completed in physical mode by then, it could be conducted at a convenient time in future with due notification, the GO states. It is not possible to conduct online practicals exam for students in Civil and Mechanical streams, but the teachers have been trying hard to adopt demonstration methodology for conduct of practical classes, according to college administrators. The final-year students were also facilitated to complete their project work. “This is the time of the year when the students submit their project work in a one-month time slot. The students, by and large, were able to complete their tasks,” T. Senthilkumar, Professor and Dean, University College of Engineering, BIT Campus, Anna University, said. Meanwhile, the online classes being conducted since March 23 has gained momentum. According to college administrators, the decision of the State Government to resume academic activities in the online mode, in view of the increasing cases of COVID-19 in various parts of the State, was inevitable as there were practical difficulties in complying with Standard Operating Procedures, particularly in enforcing social distancing. While controlling the students in classroom situations was possible though difficult, there was no way to keep tabs on them in hostels, a college head said. Since there was going to be six working days for the rest of the academic year possibly with an extended duration, completing the remaining portions through online classes well in time before the semester examination would not be a problem, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/most-engineering-colleges-complete-practical-exams-for-final-year-students/article34219701.ece

A series of games to stimulate sensory integration among the students provided much excitement, as the enthusiastic participants were meeting their classmates after a year’s break due to the lockdown. “The event has helped parents to realise that children on the autism spectrum can lead a meaningful life if they are proactive about sensory and behavioural training,” G. Praveena Carmel, principal of the Dolphin and Seagull special schools, said in a press release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/world-autism-awareness-day-observed/article34219707.ece
02 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Pettavaithalai cash seizure case: police arrest six||The case relating to seizure of ‘unclaimed cash’ amounting to Rs. 99.73 lakh at Pettavaithalai in the district recently took a new turn with the police arresting six persons on dacoity charge on Thursday. The Pettavaithalai Police which initially booked a case under section 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to take up investigation has now altered the case under IPC sections including dacoity following the arrest of the gang of six persons. It has also come to light, during investigation, that the cash was being transported in the car by a few persons belonging to the AIADMK allegedly for distribution to voters. The gang which apparently came to know of this, followed the vehicle in two cars and intercepted it at Pettavaithalai. The sources said the gang allegedly snatched a couple of bags containing cash, which was resisted by those who were reportedly transporting it. The gang fled with the cash in two bags “each containing an equal amount of money” that was seized near the Pettavaithalai check post last week. The accused escaped before the Flying Squad arrived at the spot. The Flying Squad, acting on information from the police, rushed to the spot and found cash inside a bag near the check post. The four persons who had come in the car were standing close to the spot from where the "unclaimed" money was seized. The four persons had feigned ignorance about the cash during inquiry by the officials. The seizure of the unclaimed cash was intimated to the Income Tax Department officials and the amount was handed over to the Srirangam sub treasury office thereafter. Based on a report from the Income Tax Department asking the police to conduct further investigation to ascertain the ownership of the seized money that was seized, the Pettavaithalai Police booked a case under section 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and launched an investigation. The case took a turn based on investigation carried out by the special team, the sources said adding that the money looted by the gang was yet to be recovered. Police are on the look out for the prime suspect in the case. The Pettavaithalai has now altered the case under IPC sections including 171 (e) (bribery), 120 (b) (conspiracy), 395 (dacoity), 397 (robbery or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) besides under 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pettavaithalai-cash-seizure-case-police-arrest-six/article34219732.ece

Mutharasan on Thursday said that the AIADMK-BJP front should be defeated in the forthcoming Assembly elections to protect the welfare of Tamil Nadu and the people. Campaigning in support of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam candidates here, Mr. Mutharasan accused the Narendra Modi government of acting against the policy of secularism. He also alleged that the BJP was instigating violence to achieve their short-term political gains and accused the ruling AIADMK government of supporting such acts. Terming the upcoming election as a political war, Mr. Mutharasan claimed that the DMK and its alliance partners were fighting to protect the welfare of the State. Dubbing the BJP as a snake and the AIADMK as a frog, he said the snake had gobbled the frog . The AIADMK chapter was over long ago, he claimed. He appealed to the electorate to reject the AIADMK-led front. He said the DMK-led alliance partners had demanded that a sum of Rs. 5,000 be given to those whose livelihood were affected owing to COVID-19. However, the AIADMK regime gave only Rs. 1,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/defeat-aiadmk-led-front-cpi/article34219714.ece
02 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||ECI orders transfer of Karur Collector, SP||The Election Commission of India on Thursday ordered the transfer of Karur Collector and District Election Officer, S. Malaravizhi, and the Superintendent of Police, S.S.Mageswaran, to non-election posts at the State headquarters. The transfers have been ordered based on “adverse inputs” and are to come into immediate effect, according to an ECI communication to the State Chief Secretary. The ECI has also directed the posting of Prashant M.Wadnere as the new Collector of Karur and G.Shashank Sai as the Superintendent of Police. The contest in the Karur Assembly constituency has become one of the most keenly watched in the State, given the intense rivalry between Transport Minister M.R.Vijayabhaskar and former Minister Senthil Balaji of DMK. Confrontations and skirmishes between cadre of the two parties have already been reported on a few occasions. Allegations of distribution of cash and kind have been flying thick and fast right from the beginning of the campaign in the constituency. A large number of complaints have also been reportedly been sent to the ECI. The Aravakurichi constituency in the district too has come into focus with K.Annamalai, State vice president of the BJP, being one of the main contenders along with Monjanur R.Elango of the DMK. During the 2016 general election, the Election Commission of India had rescinded the polls in the Aravakurichi Assembly constituency in the district, following widespread seizure of cash and complaints of voters being bribed. The election was conducted in the constituency after a gap of five months in November 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eci-orders-transfer-of-karur-collector-sp/article34219717.ece
02 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||BJP, allies will suffer their worst-ever defeat: Congress||The people of Tamil Nadu, who will never allow the Bharatiya Janata Party to take roots in the State after having witnessed its misrule at the Centre, are all set to present the worst-ever electoral defeat to the party and its allies in the Assembly election, according to Dinesh Gundu Rao, AICC-in-charge of Tamil Nadu. Speaking to reporters at Nanguneri near here on Tursday, after electioneering in support of Ruby R. Manoharan, Congress candidate for this Assembly segment, Mr. Rao said the BJP, which did not have a single MLA in Tamil Nadu, was ruling the State by arm-twisting “corrupt” Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and his deputy O. Panneerselvam, who had to bow before Prime Minister Narendra Modi for their wrongdoings. After successfully experimenting its strategy in adjoining Puducherry, the BJP was planning to execute the scheme in Tamil Nadu also. Political leaders, who were resisting the sinister design of the BJP and objecting to itm were being coerced by the Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax Department. While the Farmers’ Acts and the Citizenship Amendment Act had earned the wrath of the people, Narendra Modi-led Union Government’s economic policies such as GST and demonetisation of high-value currency notes had ruined India’s economy. After the BJP’s poll promise of creation of two crore jobs every year, several crores of people actually lost their employment as small, marginal and medium industries were wiped-out across the country due to the cascading effect of anti-people and anti-industry economic policies. “Hence, the people, who are bearing all these pains for the past several years, want to see a change in the State and at the Centre at the earliest. The people of Tamil Nadu, who have seen legendary leaders such as E.V.R. Periyar, Kamaraj and V.O. Chidambaram will never support the BJP and allow it to take roots in Tamil Nadu,” Mr. Rao said. Neglected area The AIADMK government had neglected Nanguneri where no step had been taken to create employment opportunities for locals even though the Assembly segment was in the Multiproduct Special Economic Zone, for which foundation was laid 20 years ago. For farmers, there was no cold storage facility to preserve their produce to ensure better price. “We’ll concentrate on these crucial issues,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-allies-will-suffer-their-worst-ever-defeat-congress/article34220413.ece

02 April 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Rose Mount residents want road to be widened||More than a 100 families living in Rose Mount area in Udhagamandalam have appealed to the municipality and the district administration to re-lay and slightly widen a walking path-cum-road leading to their houses. Local residents said that due to the current width of the path, now measuring less than five-feet wide in some places, emergency vehicles such as ambulances, police vans and even garbage collection trucks are unable to make their way to the households in Rose Mount and Arul Nagar in the locality. S.G. Nicholas, who has been living in the area for the last few decades, said that the residents had made various representations to the Nilgiris district administration, the municipality and even the Chief Minister’s Special Cell. “We believe that the path leading to our locality should be at least twice as wide as its current width. As the path has not been expanded, and vehicles cannot come up to our houses, sick or injured people have to be carried to the main road using improvised stretchers,” said Mr. Nicholas. Leo Fernandes, another resident, said that during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Nilgiris, local residents had to carry seriously ill people without any protection. “As the ambulances couldn’t come to our houses, we had to carry a very sick person who was showing symptoms of COVID-19 to the road from where the ambulance was able to take him to hospital. These kind of incidents are very common,” he said. S. Sreedevi, another resident, called on the municipality to work in the interests of the more than hundred families living in the area. “We have been running from pillar to post for the last 10 years trying to get a single footpath and proper sewage lines to this area, which is mostly home to poor daily wage workers,” said Ms. Sreedevi. Municipal officials said that they had received petitions from the residents. “The issue is that there is some litigation ongoing surrounding the small bit of land that is required to widen the footpath-cum-road. Only after it is clear to us about the status of the land can we help the residents,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rose-mount-residents-want-road-to-be-widened/article34220177.ece

02 April 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||‘Graft, dynasty rule hallmarks of DMK-Cong. combine’||BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said the coming election on April 6 in the State is a fight between corruption and development, and appealed to the electorate to make the right choice. Addressing a public meeting of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at Tirukovilur near here, he said the people should vote for the NDA if they wanted development or progress in the State. Praise for MGR On the other hand, corruption and dynasty rule were the hallmarks of the DMK-Congress combine, he said. Describing former Chief Minister MGR as a real ‘Makkal Thilagam’, Mr. Shah said the AIADMK founder, through his practical policies for the betterment of the poor and the underprivileged, had earned a reputation in every nook and corner of the country. The policies that MGR cherished were successfully followed and implemented by his successor and AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa and the present Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, he said. Taking a dig at DMK MP A. Raja’s denigrating comments against the Chief Minister’s mother, Mr. Shah said he was shocked at the statement made against a deceased woman. “The DMK has no concern for women and the party is aiming to win the election by hook or crook. The DMK had also made similar comments against the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa,” he said. He dubbed the DMK as “anti-women” and called upon the women in the State to teach a fitting lesson to the party. Tall statements Mr. Shah said it was really amusing that DMK president M.K. Stalin had been making tall statements against corruption. Everyone knew that the DMK had distinguished itself as a corrupt party in the 2G scam. The NDA was committed to developing Tamil Nadu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was keen on the progress of the State while the DMK-Congress combine was encouraging corruption and development of its family members and was not bothered about the State, he added. Mr. Shah said the DMK and the Congress were now making tall claims that they were the champions of jallikattu. This was really unacceptable and was an attempt to hoodwink the people. “The Congress in its election manifesto in 2016 had promised to ban jallikattu. I thank Lord Murugan for not letting them come to power in the State in 2016 since they would have banned the traditional sport,” he said. Stating that the BJP-AIADMK alliance was the only front that stood for development, Mr. Shah urged voters of the State to boycott the “corrupt” DMK-Congress alliance. Karur campaign Later at Karur, Mr. Shah campaigned for Aravakurichi BJP candidate K. Annamalai and Karur constituency AIADMK candidate M.R. Vijayabhaskar. The Central and State governments, led by Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Palaniswami and the Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, had spent time and energy to implement a number of welfare projects in the State. It was with the aim of taking the agenda of development to the next level that the Centre had allocated funds to the tune of Rs. 1,60,000 crore to the State, he said. Mr. Shah said the BJP, which had spearheaded the agenda of development all over the country, would work further for the growth of the State. He said Mr. Annamalai had a great track record as an honest police officer. Hence, the voters should reward him by electing him to the Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/graft-dynasty-rule-hallmarks-of-dmk-cong-combine/article34219784.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Diving deep into the blue sea to create voter awareness||The district administration has roped in divers to create awareness among voters in a bid to ensure cent per cent polling on April 6 . Ancient Thoothkudi is known for pearl fishery with divers diving deep into the sea without any life-saving gadgets to collect pearl oysters. Hence, Collector K. Senthil Raj, who has prepared two documentaries for cent per cent voting by senior citizens and the physically challenged, has decided to rope in the divers also in this series. “This is the first of its kind attempt in the entire State… Besides creating awareness among the voters for ensuring cent per cent polling on April 6, the documentary by the divers also revives the glory of Thoothukudi known as ‘Pearl City’ as this is the pearl fishery coast of ancient Tamil Nadu. We have planned to share this documentary through social media and other formats,” Dr. Senthil Raj said, releasing the divers’ initiative on Thursday. After encouraging students of various schools in the town to send 1 lakh postcards to their parents, grandparents and relatives, appealing to them to cast their votes without fail on April 6, the district administration involved self-help group members to draw colourful rangolis as part of the drive. Garbage collection vehicles, while collecting degradable and non-degradable refuse from residents at their doorstep as part of the Corporation’s solid waste management programme, distributed awareness pamphlets appealing to voters to exercise their franchise without fail. Transgenders, college students and the public were also involved in the exercise. “However, this latest awareness event —divers’ initiative — is a unique venture that will have a lasting impact on voters and encourage them to go the polling station on April 6,” Dr. Senthil Raj noted while releasing the documentary. Since pearl fishery was not in vogue anymore, conch divers were deployed for the awareness programme. After venturing into the sea in a mechanised boat, the divers dive deep into the sea with voter awareness placards that appealed to voters to exercise their franchise. The Collector also honoured the divers and event organisers on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/diving-deep-into-the-blue-sea-to-create-voter-awareness/article34219751.ece

Kamaraj throwing his hat into the ring for the third consecutive time. His DMK rival here is S. Jothiraman. Mr. Kamaraj who won from Nannilam in 2011 when it was made a general constituency, managed to retain it in the subsequent 2016 elections almost doubling his victory margin. He polled 21771 votes over and above his nearest rival S. M. B. Duraivelan of DMK in 2016 elections compared to his victory in 2011 with a margin of 10404 votes against R. Elangovan of DMK. Farmers said, the Minister had ensured that all the paddy harvested by the farmers in the constituency was procured. Hundreds of paddy bags were seen stacked at the rural direct purchase centres such as at Ilaiyur near Kudavasal and on the outskirts of Nannilam and waiting for movement. Farmers constitute a major portion of the voter base and locally, drinking water supply, public transportation and health care are major issues. The DMK is focussing on the corruption charges levelled by them against the Food Minister in the paddy procurement exercise and implementation of the `kudimaramathu’ scheme. Further, the return of CPI(M) which bagged 11,327 votes challenging both DMK and AIADMK in 2016 elections, into their fold, clubbed with the renewed vigour on the part of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam and the perseverance of the Naam Tamilar Katchi to establish itself as a non-dependent of the major Dravidian parties have fuelled the DMK’s hopes. While the AMMK has fielded N. Ramachandran of Tiruvarur as its candidate, the NTK has nominated S. Fathima Farhana of Chennai for the Nannilam segment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/food-minister-hopes-for-a-hat-trick/article34219703.ece

02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK has dug its own grave by aligning with BJP, says CPI(M)||By joining hands with the BJP for the Assembly election, the ruling AIADMK has dug its own grave, CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan said here on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Balakrishnan said the BJP, which reposed its faith only in violence to get votes by coercing the electorate, unleashed fear and panic in Coimbatore when Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited the city a couple of days ago for electioneering. Besides threatening traders to down shutters, a mob carrying BJP flags, indulged in violence against them in a bid to forcibly make them close their shops. “If the BJP can unleash violence even when they are not in power in Tamil Nadu, voters should think what will happen in the State if the party wins a MLA seat in the State. By joining hands with the BJP, which believes only in violence to achieve its goal, the ruling AIADMK has dug its grave in the election arena,” Mr. Balakrishnan said. The Election Commission, which would portray itself to be active till 48 hours before polling, would disappear from the scene mysteriously in the crucial last two days. Seizing the opportunity, distribution of cash for votes would be completed by political parties. ‘EC’s responsibibility’ The CPI(M), which never accepted cash-for-votes practice, wanted the Election Commission to take every possible step to check the menace at least this time as it was its responsibility. “While the ruling party has got every aspect in its favour to distribute cash for votes, the Opposition parties do not have such an advantage. So, it is the duty of the Election Commission to curb distribution of cash to lure voters,” Mr. Balakrishnan said. He also predicted that the DMK-led alliance would register a resounding victory, “which will be more impressive and mammoth than the victory it achieved in 2019 Lok Sabha polls”. Award for Rajinikanth Welcoming the decision to confer Dadha Saheb Palke Award on actor Rajinikanth, Mr. Balakrishnan said the announcement made by the Centre on the eve of Assembly polls in Tamil Nadu had given room for suspicion||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-has-dug-its-own-grave-by-aligning-with-bjp-says-cpim/article34219752.ece

02 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||RWAs to be allowed to set up vaccination sites||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) wants to tap into the network of residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to double the number of citizens getting vaccinated, which currently stands at 35,000 people every day. It plans to approach RWAs to open vaccination session sites after tying up with private medical facilities in the area. In a two-pronged plan to target more people, the civic body also wants to rope in huge industrial complexes that have health centres so that they can create vaccination sites there. On Thursday, soon after assuming charge as BBMP Commissioner, Gaurav Gupta met with Special Commissioner (Health) Rajendra Cholan, Chief Health Officer Vijayendra and other health officials to discuss COVID-19 care and management. Mr. Gupta told The Hindu that the RWAs may have to create temporary facilities for pre-check-up and post-administration observation, apart from having a team on hand. This, he said, could be done with the support of medical establishments that have a record of administering the vaccine. “The government has now allowed vaccination sites to be created in health sub-centres, such as those in industries. This is with the sole objective of increasing vaccination coverage,” he said. At the meeting, Mr. Gupta said, they also discussed how to increase the number of vaccinations at session sites with low records, stepping up contact tracing, testing of the vulnerable sections, and hospitalisation. “There is an urgent need to be prepared for a surge in cases. As of now, there are enough beds available in government medical colleges and hospitals. If there is a surge, the additional burden has to be passed on to private medical establishments. Already, they have agreed to set aside 10% of the beds for now. We will draw up a detailed plan of action soon,” he added. Later in the day, the civic chief also met with the various special commissioners, who have been posted as zonal commissioners, to discuss various measures to be taken to strengthen administration of vaccine at the zonal level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rwas-to-be-allowed-to-set-up-vaccination-sites/article34220108.ece
02 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Reining in COVID-19 cases is priority’||Tackling the steep spike in COVID-19 cases in Bengaluru and preparing for the monsoon are the top priorities for the new guard at the Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. Senior IAS officers Gaurav Gupta and Rakesh Singh took charge as the BBMP Commissioner and Administrator, on Thursday. Soon after being handed the silver baton to signify the change of guard, Mr. Gupta told reporters that his appointment comes with more responsibilities. “The commissioner is the executive head of the BBMP. He or she has an important role to play in utilising all available resources to solve issues of the city,” he said. The increase in positive cases will have to be reined in, Mr. Gupta said and appealed to people not to let their guard down. “While we have put in place measures to contain the spread, citizens must cooperate and avoid crowded places,” he said. Responding to a question on Bengaluru Karaga, he said the government has imposed restrictions on social and cultural gatherings, protests, etc. “We will take a call on how it can be celebrated,” he said. Mr. Gupta said during his seven-month tenure as administrator, he has seen closely the issues plaguing the city and even issued directions to officials concerned on solving several of them. Mr. Singh, after taking charge, said the focus will be on two issues – the spike in COVID-19 positive cases and preparing for the upcoming monsoon months. Mr. Prasad attributed the rise in cases to the second wave in neighbouring Kerala and Maharashtra and increase in weddings, protests and various socio-cultural events/ programmes. Cases increased from an average 243 in February to almost 1,500 in March. “The earlier strategy of ‘test-track-treat’ will continue, as per the government’s directions. From an average daily testing of 20,000 in February, the daily average now is around 60,000 a day. The way to break the chain is to increase testing to detect positive cases, isolate them and intensify contact tracing,” said Mr. Prasad. An analysis of positive cases over the past month had shown that infection was more among citizens aged between 20 years and 40 years, while death rate was high among those aged between 60 years and 80 years. “Despite an increase in positive cases, the mortality rate is not as bad as it was last year. In the light of the spike, there will be a graded increase in bed allocation for COVID-19 patients in private health facilities, starting with 10% this week,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/reining-in-covid-19-cases-is-priority/article34220089.ece
02 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Lukewarm response on day one of fourth phase of vaccination drive||On day one of the fourth phase of vaccination — wherein everyone in the age group of 45 to 59, irrespective of comorbidities, is eligible — there was poor response in the State with just 63,898 persons in that age group coming forward to get the jab till 8.30 p.m. State health officials, who did not provide a break-up of beneficiaries above 45 in terms of those with and without comorbidities, said a total of 6,87,594 persons in the age group have been vaccinated so far. Karnataka has a target population of over 80 lakh in this age group and has readied 5,500 vaccination centres to take up the extended drive. Of the total 1.66 crore persons eligible, 70 lakh fall under the category of senior citizens and those aged above 45 with comorbidities. On Thursday, a similar number of senior citizens — 60,096 — took the shot. With this, 20,13,492 persons aged above 60 have been vaccinated in the State since March 1, which was when the second phase of vaccination was rolled out. Expecting a rush, the State had extended vaccination services at health and wellness centres and sub-centres. Besides, the State has provided broad guidelines to districts to strategise vaccination through support from all the line departments and NGOs. State Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra, who admitted the response was not as good as that shown by senior citizens when the drive was opened up for them, said things should pick up in the next few days. “As per the Centre’s guidelines, vaccination is also being done on Sundays and all holidays. We hope more people will come forward from now on,” he said. Vaccine personnel at most city hospitals said they did not face any CoWIN issues and the vaccination went on smoothly, although the response was poor. Overall, the State has vaccinated 39,45,439 people so far. This includes 5,63,436 healthcare workers and 2,39,789 frontline workers who have taken the first dose of vaccination. As many as 3,46,065 healthcare workers and 87,075 frontline workers have taken the second dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lukewarm-response-on-day-one-of-fourth-phase-of-vaccination-drive/article34220104.ece
02 April 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||BSY camp launches counter-attack||Launching a counter-attack at RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s supporters within the Cabinet and some MLAs on Thursday declared that they would write against the former to the party high command. They also urged Mr. Eshwarappa to hold talks with the Chief Minister to put an end to the row. Hold meeting More than half a dozen Ministers held a meeting with Mr. Yediyurappa at his home-office Krishna here on Thursday to take stock of the situation. Several MLAs too were part of the meeting. Later, while the Chief Minister desisted from commenting on Mr. Eshwarappa, Ministers and MLAs aired their views against his action. Chief Minister’s political secretary M.P. Renukacharya went hammer and tongs against Mr. Eshwarappa for approaching the Governor against the Chief Minister. Taking exception to this, he said they too would write to the party high command against his behaviour. Written requisition Referring to Mr. Eshwarappa’s contentions about releasing funds to MLAs from outside the Budget without bringing it to his notice, Mr. Renukacharya said the decision was taken following written requisition to the Chief Minister by over 60 MLAs. They also furnished a copy of the letter by MLAs with signatures seeking funds for their constituencies from the Chief Minister to prove a point that the allocation had not been made suo motu . Defend CM Meanwhile, several Ministers, including Basavaraj Bommai, R. Ashok, K. Sudhakar, and B. C. Patil, expressed dissatisfaction over Mr. Eshwarappa’s move and strongly defended Mr. Yediyurappa. While Mr. Bommai and Dr. Sudhakar urged Mr. Eshwarappa to resolve the issue through mutual dialogue with the Chief Minister, Mr. Ashok said approaching the Governor against the Chief Minister was an unprecedented move. He said this was not a good political culture. All the Ministers maintained that it was the prerogative of the Chief Minister to intervene in the administration of any Minister as technically he chooses the Ministers. They argued that a senior Minister like Mr. Eshwarappa, who hails from the Chief Minister’s home district, should not have gone to the Governor against him without holding consultations with him. According to sources, some of the MLAs close to the Chief Minister also wanted the portfolio of Mr. Eshwarappa to be changed. However, the Chief Minister has not taken any decision in this regard, it is learnt.  Let Eshwarappa meet the Chief Minister as early as possible to solve the problem. There is no need to take the matter to the party high command. It is better to solve the problem here. Basavaraj Bommai,Home Minister   Eshwarappa could have sorted it out in five minutes through talks. But the current situation is certainly an embarrassment to the government, the party, and even Eshwarappa himself. K. Sudhakar,Health Minister   When 70-80 MLAs requested him for funds, the Chief Minister, who is also the Finance Minister, exercised his power. R.

Based on the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) data, the report said 23 taluks were prone to landslips during the rainy season, causing damage to lives, properties, and movement ofpeople. The report said heavy rain, mudslips, rock-falls, deforestation,and climate change were major reasons for landslips. The committee said all three taluks of Kodagu; Sakleshpur taluk of Hassan district; Koppa, Mudigere, Sringeri, and Chikkamagalur taluks of Chikkamagalur district;Sagar taluk of Shivamogga district; Karwar, Ankola, Kumta, Honnavar, Siddapur, Sirsi, Yellapur, and Joida taluks of Uttara Kannada, Karkala taluk of Udupi district; Bantwal, Belthangady, Mangaluru, Sulia, and Puttur taluks of Dakshina Kannada are prone to landslips. In the wake of major landslips during the monsoon in the last two years, the State government set up the committee to study regions affected by landslips and reasons for them. The committee comprised experts from IISc., ISRO, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, the KSNDMC, and other agencies. New taluks The expert committee, which submitted its final report to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday, said that in the recent years landslips have also occurred in Kundapur taluk of Udupi; Thirthahalli and Hosanagara taluks of Shivamogga, and Khanapur in Belagavi district. Mr. Ashisara, who is also the chairman of the Karnataka Biodiversity Board, has recommended strengthening of the district-level disaster management committee to contain landslips in the Western Ghats. The committee has provided guidelines for the protection of rivers and valleys in the vulnerable areas of the Western Ghats and the coastal region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/23-taluks-in-state-prone-to-landslips-says-report/article34220115.ece
02 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||IISc. develops enzymes that can block HIV reactivation||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) have developed artificial enzymes that can successfully block reactivation and replication of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the host’s immune cells. Made from vanadium pentoxide nanosheets, these nanozymes work by mimicking a natural enzyme called glutathione peroxidase that helps reduce oxidative stress levels in the host’s cells, which is required to keep the virus in check, a release from the institute explained. The study, published in EMBO Molecular Medicine, was led by Amit Singh, Associate Professor and Wellcome Trust-DBT India Alliance Senior Fellow at the Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology and Centre for Infectious Diseases Research (CIDR), and Govindasamy Mugesh, Professor at the Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry .  The release said there is currently no way to eliminate HIV from a patient’s body completely, and anti-HIV drugs are only successful in suppressing the virus, but fail at eradicating HIV from infected cells. “The virus hides inside the host’s immune cells in a latent state and stably maintains its reservoir. When the levels of toxic molecules, such as hydrogen peroxide, increase in the host’s cells, leading to a state of increased oxidative stress, the virus gets reactivated and it emerges from hiding and begins replicating again,” it explained. The researchers prepared ultrathin nanosheets of vanadium pentoxide in the lab and treated HIV-infected cells with them. The sheets were found to reduce hydrogen peroxide just as effectively as the natural enzyme and prevent the virus from reactivating. “We found that these nanosheets were having some sort of direct effect where the expression of the host genes essential for virus reactivation is reduced,” explained Shalini Singh, first author and Research Associate at CIDR. When the team treated immune cells from HIV-infected patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) with the nanozymes, latency was induced faster and subsequent reactivation was suppressed when therapy was stopped, indicating that combining the two was more effective, she added. Elaborating further on the other advantages of combining ART with the nanozymes, Prof. Singh said nanozyme can help in reducing the side effects caused by ART drugs. Although the nanozymes were found to be harmless to normal cells in lab tests, Prof. Mugesh points out that further studies are needed to understand if they can have other effects once they are introduced inside the body.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/iisc-develops-enzymes-that-can-block-hiv-reactivation/article34219799.ece
02 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah demands President’s rule||A day after Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa petitioned to Governor Vajubhai R. Vala against Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa alleging “interference” and “authoritarian administration”, Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah demanded President’s rule in the State. ‘Serious allegations’ In a series of tweets, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the allegations made by Mr. Eshwarappa were of serious nature and appealed to the Governor to intervene, dismiss the government, and recommend the President’s rule. Appreciating Mr. Eshwarappa’s action in writing to the Governor, the Congress leader said that “for the first time in his political career” Mr. Eshwarappa had done a good job and had “shown that the State’s interest is more important than his political interest”. The Congress leader said the BJP should immediately respond to this and uphold internal democracy. Hits out at Modi Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Siddaramaiah said, “You had called our government ‘10% sarkar’. Now that your own party Minister has given the corruption report of your own party to you, give your rating about the government so that people can make an informed decision in the coming elections.” In another tweet, he demanded that Mr. Modi change his famous slogan “na khaunga, na khane dunga” to “mai bhi khaunga, thum bhi khao”. Mr. Sidddaramaiah said the Minister also cited corruption as the reason behind the State government’s bankruptcy. “@kseshwarappa has detailed in the letter that corruption is the reason for govt’s bankruptcy and not #Covid19. This clearly indicates that while few powerful within the BJP are getting rich, people of Karnataka are becoming poor,” the Congress leader tweeted. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar too has demanded the resignation of Mr. Yediyurappa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-demands-presidents-rule/article34220112.ece

The School of EEE has ideated, conceptualized, and developed a “single-phase preventer”, a circuit that will play a crucial role in extending the shelf life of 3-phase motors used by farmers in agricultural fields. Speaking about the innovation, Rajashekar P. Mandi, Professor and Director, School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, said most often agriculturalists and farmers spend a lot of money on motor repairs and replacements due to fluctuations in electricity, and the single-phase preventer was a ‘powerful shield’ in arresting such fluctuations. The patent on this product is published internationally. Field trials are being carried out and will be ready for technology transfer. The module is incorporated with control circuits to detect either single phasing or voltage imbalance of less than 15%, said a release from REVA. P Shyama Raju, Chancellor, said the School started with an intake of 18 and has now grown with over 1000 students in its EEE programmes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/reva-develops-single-phase-preventer/article34219803.ece

02 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Subdued Rangapanchami in Hubballi||The scare of a second wave of COVID-19 and restrictions imposed by the police as a precautionary measure, including prohibitory orders banning processions, resulted in subdued celebrations of Rangapanchami in Hubballi on Thursday. What otherwise would have been a riot of colours, resulting in the city getting soaked in myriad colours and music reverberating in the air, turned out to be a restricted celebration albeit with gaiety and revelry. Rangapanchami is celebrated on the fifth day after the Holi festival in Hubballi. Every year, though security restrictions and prohibitory orders would be in force in a few localities, they never used to dampen the festival spirit. However, the COVID-19 scare coupled with an appeal by the local authorities to keep the celebrations simple and limited had had an impact this time. Like last year, the authorities had not given permission for rain dance set-ups and police patrol vehicles visited all localities repeating the appeal for simple Holi celebrations at home and for people not to congregate at one place. Apart from barricades, the police deployed at various localities kept asking the people not to roam around in groups and to celebrate Holi in front of their respective houses. However, amid restrictions, revellers had their moments of celebrations and youngsters moved around on their two-wheelers although in reduced numbers applying coloured power to their acquaintances. It was the children who enjoyed Holi a lot this time as they had ample space to play around. Armed with pitchkaris and water balloons, they conducted target practice on every passer-by whether on vehicle or on foot. However, in the narrow streets of Kamaripet the practice of pouring bucket full of water over passers-by continued unabated. In the absence of permission for DJ music, some youngsters brought out the traditional drums, blew trumpets and danced to their hearts content. In view of the reduced participation, some of the busy roads in the central business district of the city had thin vehicular movement, making one wonder whether it was Rangapanchami at all in Hubballi. Like last year, residential localities and extension areas did not witness much celebrations with many parents not sending out their children. Compared to last year, the celebrations in the extension areas did not see much crowd because of the coronavirus scare. Meanwhile, senior citizens had their share of enjoyment and they too played holi near parks and places of worship. The practice of Muslims joining the Holi procession did not happen this year due to a ban on processions. However, many members of the Muslim community took part in the celebrations with their Hindu friends and acquaintances in some localities. As usual, the police personnel too got drenched in colours. Scenes of revellers approaching police personnel on duty and applying colours to them were common. With the police banning processions, the usual practice of carrying idols of Kamanna (Lord Manmatha) was not seen this time. However, men and women took part in rituals pertaining to the Kamadahana (burning Kamanna in effigy). But they were requested to immediately return home after the effigies were set on fire. Police sources said that the celebrations concluded peacefully late in the evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/subdued-rangapanchami-in-hubballi/article34219795.ece
02 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Health officer suspended for vaccine jab to Minister B.C. Patil at home||In the wake of the controversy surrounding Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil getting himself inoculated in the comforts of his home at Hirekerur in gross violation of COVID-19 protocol, the health officer of Hirekerur has been suspended now for dereliction of duty. In an order that was signed by Commissioner of Health and Family Welfare K.V. Trilokchandra, it has been said that despite repeated training programmes and instructions, Health Officer of Hirekerur Taluk Z.R. Makandar had committed dereliction in his duties by administering vaccine to the Minister at his home in gross violation of protocol. The order (issued on March 26) says that Dr. Makandar has been suspended pending disciplinary action for dereliction of duty. The Commissioner’s order comes following a report from District Health and Family Welfare Officer of Haveri district Rajendra Doddamani, based on the reply given by Dr. Makandar to the show-cause notice issued to him. The District Health Officer has recommended disciplinary action against the health officer and has also mentioned in his report that the health officer had consulted neither the District Health Officer nor the Deputy Commissioner before giving the vaccine shot to the Minister and his family members. It may be recalled that on March 2, the Agriculture Minister [Mr. Patil] summoned the taluk health official and staff to his house and got the vaccine shots for himself and his wife. The video and photographs of this were subsequently circulated on the social media platforms evoking strong reactions from netizens and also from Opposition party leaders to the misuse of power and blatant violation of norms. After initially maintaining that he did not know the protocol, the MMinister had subsequently claimed that he had not done anything wrong. In July 2020, five members of the Minister’s family, including Mr. Patil, his wife and son-in-law, were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and they had undergone home isolation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/health-officer-suspended-for-vaccine-jab-to-minister-bc-patil-at-home/article34219793.ece

02 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Two arrested on the charge of desecrating Daivasthanas||The untimely demise of the perpetrator in the desecration of Koragajja Daivasthanas, who had challenged the power of the Spirit, and his advice before his death to two of the accomplices that they admit their guilt before Koragajja, has led to the arrest of two persons by the police thereby bringing relief to thousands of Koragajja devotees. The two, Abdul Raheem and Taufeeq, were arrested on Thursday after they reportedly confessed to their guilt before Koragajja at the annual Nemotsava in Yemmekere on Wednesday night. Koragajja Daivasthanas in and around the city had witnessed dropping of condoms and blasphemous literature in their offering boxes in four instances, while one instance of defecation on a Daivasthana premises at Kankanady too was reported. The incidents had shocked devotees and they had the potential of triggering tension in the communally sensitive district. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar told reporters here on Thursday that Raheem and Taufeeq from Jokatte in the city got worried after the death of Nawaz (32), a resident of Kenjar, due to ill health about 45 days ago. Nawaz was reportedly into black magic and other such acts after his return from Dubai two years ago. He is said to have challenged the power of Koragajja and took Raheem and Taufeeq along with him when they deposited condoms and blasphemous material in the offering boxes of Koragajja Daivastanas. He had also defecated on a temple premises. When his condition turned critical, Nawaz reportedly called Raheem and Taufeeq and asked them to admit to their guilt in a Koragajja Daivasthana. The two contacted a poojari at the Koragajja Daivasthana at Yemmekere a few days ago and confessed to their crime at the Daivasthana on Wednesday night. The Daivasthana authorities then informed the Mangaluru South Police who took them into custody later. Mr. Kumar said that the admission of guilt at the Daivasthana was an extra-judicial confession. The police will now collect evidence about the involvement of the arrested persons and other supporting material too. The two arrested persons have been booked under Section 153 (A) of the Indian Penal Code, he said. Following the incidents, the police were in a tight spot in the absence of CCTV cameras near the Daivasthanas and were unable to find the exact date of the commission of crime. Recently, thousands of Koragajja devotees took out a march seeking divine intervention to find the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-arrested-on-the-charge-of-desecrating-daivasthanas/article34220276.ece
02 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Cave belonging to megalithic period found in Paniyadi, Udupi district||A cave that was found during the renovation work of Sri Ananta Padmanabha Temple at Paniyadi in Udupi recently belongs to the megalithic period, according to T. Murugeshi, Associate Professor of Ancient History and Archaeology, MSRS College, Shirva. In a statement here, Prof. Murugeshi said that he visited the renovation site on Thursday and found it was a rock-cut cave after examining it. The cave belongs to 800 BC and is of 2,000 years old in antiquity, he noted. Similar megalithic rock-cut caves have been found at Pavanje Subrahmanya Temple, Sooda Subrahmanya Temple, Sasturu Subrahmanya Temple and elsewhere in coastal Karnataka. Prof. Murugeshi said that the discovery is unique in understanding the antiquity of the Phanis. Pani and Haadi, together forming Paniyadi, means settlement of Phanis. Phanis were referred to in the Mahabharatha and the Puranas as an ancient original inhabitants of the country. Places such as Paniyur, Paniyadi in Udupi district indicate the existence of Phanis settlements in the past. Phanis were famous for their Naga worship while Naga was their totemic emblem. Paniyadi’s presiding deity Ananta Padbhanabha was also related with Naga worship. Iconographically, he was Para Vasudeva, a Vaisnavate god. He sits on the Naga coil and the Naga hood stands high on his head. A similar icon found in Keelinje near Udupi belongs to 10th Century AD, while the Paniyadi deity belongs to 14th Century AD. Rajesh Bhat, a resident of Paniyadi, said that the temple belongs to Udupi Puttige Mutt and its renovation was undertaken by the mutt with the help of villagers. While digging earth for constructing the outer wall of the temple on March 23, a cave was found 8 ft below the surface to the north of the temple. There was a stone slab covering the cave, while two or three vents were found on the smooth surface wall of the cave. A portion of the cave was damaged during the digging process as people were not aware of its existence, Mr. Bhat said. The idol of the presiding deity, Ananta Padmanabha, is a unique one as it is in a sitting posture atop Adi Sesha, he said. Paniyadi Temple is located about 500 m away from MGM College on the road to Budnar and Indiranagar, Mr. Bhat said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cave-belonging-to-megalithic-period-found-in-paniyadi-udupi-district/article34220271.ece
02 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Sea ambulances to be deployed along the coast shortly||Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Secretary P. Manivannan on Thursday said that the department will shortly deploy sea ambulances along the State’s coast to rescue and render emergency services to people, particularly fishermen in distress on the high sea. Chairing a review meeting of the department at the Udupi Zilla Panchayat’s Dr. V.S. Acharya Auditorium, Capt. Manivannan said that sea ambulances would go a long way in rescuing people and fishermen in distress and saving their life. The fishermen community had been demanding such a facility for long. Meanwhile, the Secretary told department officials to ensure that none of the banned or illegal methods of fishing were practised along the coast. They should keep tab on the activities of fishermen to ensure compliance with orders and rules. Officials should also ensure that all those entering fishing harbours follow the COVID-19 protocols, including compulsory wearing of face cover, social distancing and maintaining hygiene. Fines should invariably imposed on those violating the protocols, he said. Capt. Manivannan said that officials should periodically inspect closed circuit television cameras installed at fishing harbours to ensure their uninterrupted services. If necessary, they should procure superior quality cameras and get them installed in harbours. The Secretary asked personnel of the Coastal Security Police to frame specific guidelines for regulating and registering visitors and workers at harbours. Nearly 10,000 people, including locals, those from neighbouring districts and other States, visit the Malpe Fishing Harbour every day. The Coastal Security Police should keep a regular watch on them, he noted. There were many unregistered dinghy fishing boats in the district, Capt. Manivannan noted and asked the Fisheries Department officials to complete their registration within three months. Different categories of fishing boats should strictly follow the colour-coding scheme prescribed by the government. Speaking about activities of the Animal Husbandry Department, the Secretary said that officials should immediately identify suitable spaces to open Go Shalas across the district. Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha, Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Y. Naveen Bhat, Superintendent of Police N. Vishnuvardhan, Coastal Security Police Superintendent of Police R.

02 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Ensure every village gets rainwater harvesting facility in next 100 days’||Local administrations and departments concerned should ensure that every village in the district gets rainwater harvesting apparatus in the next 100 days, said Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat’s Chief Executive Officer Kumara here on Thursday. Presiding over the district Jal Shakti Mission’s review meeting, Mr. Kumara said that tanks have to be surveyed to asses the possibility of their rejuvenation under the comprehensive tank rejuvenation programme. Every gram panchayat should build at least one or two new tanks in its limits, the CEO said. Officials should also ensure that all encroachment upon water sources were removed. Mr. Kumara told officials that soak pits have to be built for houses in villages. They should undertake construction of soak pits under the Jal Shakti Mission or the MGNREGA after conducting a survey of households to identify availability of such pits. Meanwhile, the work of rejuvenating borewells also should be taken up at panchayat level after conducting a survey. Stating that all gram panchayats should get rainwater harvesting system installed for their buildings, the CEO said that panchayats should provide this facility for buildings housing hostels, schools, anganwadis, primary health centres and other government buildings. Mr. Kumara said that the Forest Department should plant more and more tree saplings under the afforestation programme on road flanks, tank bunds, school premises and hostels. Kitchen gardens should be raised on government building premises while farmers should be encouraged to raise such gardens. Zilla Panchayat Deputy Secretary K. Anand Kumar and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ensure-every-village-gets-rainwater-harvesting-facility-in-next-100-days/article34220268.ece
02 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Find reasons why the accused confessed’||Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) State president Muneer Katipalla has demanded a detailed investigation in the desecration cases that goes beyond beliefs and miracles and finds more reasons for the accused coming forward to confess to their crimes. In a statement here, Mr. Katipalla said that Nawaz died about 40 days ago and he was almost bed-ridden because of being HIV positive. In such a situation, a question arises whether he was the perpetrator of the crime as confessed to by the two accused. While oppressed communities of Tulunadu revere Koragajja and he too has high regards for the Daiva, Mr. Katipalla said that it was surprising Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar too has gone by the statements of the accused. Some desecration incidents had happened as recently as a month ago and a seriously bed-ridden Nawaz could not have participated in such incidents, Mr. Katipalla said. As such the police should investigate whether there were any unseen hands behind the confession and also, should ensure that there is no politics in such matters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/find-reasons-why-the-accused-confessed/article34220274.ece

02 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Traffic police get friendly as new guidelines come into effect||In its resolve to make traffic policing people friendly and transparent, the Mysuru City Police have introduced new guidelines for vehicle checking and imposing fines for traffic violations. The new rules that are a result of a recent backlash against the traffic police following the death of a biker, have come into effect from Thursday. The “new improved traffic management protocols” had been introduced on an experimental basis and can be modified/improved further based on the public feedback. Traffic policemen, as per the new guidelines, are not supposed to stop moving vehicles just for checking documents. However, in case the motorist was found committing traffic violation on the move (visible violations), the police are empowered to penalise violators at any time of the day. Violations such as driving without wearing helmet, driving without wearing seat belt, drunken driving, ferrying passengers in goods vehicle, driving by minors, triple riding, jumping of traffic signal, violation of one-way rule and use of high-decibel horns can be booked any time irrespective of timing given for vehicle checking. As a trial run, the police have launched “voluntary checking counters” at 10 places across the city where motorists can verify traffic violation cases booked under their vehicle registration number and pay unpaid fines to the policemen manning the counter. The motorists can also get their documents checked from the police. The policemen from five traffic police stations, including V.V. Puram, K.R., Devaraja, N.R. and Siddharathanagar, are carrying out this drive. The voluntary vehicle checking counters had been opened at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Circle, Srirampura Junction, Ramaswamy Circle, Sri Chamaraja Wadiyar Circle, Nadaprabhu Kempe Gowda Circle, Deve Gowda Circle, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Circle, S. Linganna Circle, Belavadi Junction and Vivekananda Circle. Commissioner of Police Chandragupta, who briefed the policemen about the guidelines at the parade grounds on Wednesday, said the policemen in charge of the counters had been told to provide proper parking facility and necessary information, including details of unpaid fines. No motorist would be stopped by the policemen at the counter and the motorist can visit the counter on his/her own in a step to bring police closer to the public. In the wake of complaints of congestion at key traffic junctions, an officer of the rank of ASI and above from the respective traffic police station would adopt a junction or a circle and take the responsibility of improving the traffic management system. The officer, after adopting the circle, is supposed to be visit the circle for one hour daily and ensure hassle-free traffic movement besides making necessary arrangements coordinating with the policemen for the smooth flow of traffic. The responsibility of the adopted circle lies with the officer and the best managed circle would get a prize at the end of each month. The Commissioner also told the officers to ensure smooth flow of traffic during peak hours and not to resort to vehicle checking in those hours besides taking care of motorists’ safety during enforcement of rules. The policemen cannot stop a motorist abruptly, appearing suddenly on the road. They had been strictly told not to use barricades or sticks to stop moving vehicles and end the practice of taking away keys for stopping motorists from evading checks. Use of foul language and speaking loudly with the public should be avoided as also getting into arguments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/traffic-police-get-friendly-as-new-guidelines-come-into-effect/article34220298.ece
02 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Jab for persons above 45 years begins in Mysuru district||Amidst the surge in COVID-19 cases, the fourth phase of vaccination against COVID-19 began in Mysuru district on Thursday. An estimated 8.5 lakh persons above 45 years are eligible to get the vaccine. Arrangements are being made in both government and private hospitals for providing immunisation. Unlike the first three phases, the number of people identified for the inoculation is more and therefore adequate facilities are necessary to ensure hassle-free jab to the targeted population. Sources in the Health Department said the response for the jab was expected to pick up in the days ahead and consequently the healthcare workers are gearing up with surplus vaccine stocks. The authorities want more staff to be deputed for vaccination duty. The services of post-graduate students of Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) had been reportedly sought. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 Care Centre (CCC) at the KSOU Academic building near Mysuru airport was reopened on Thursday to accommodate patients with mild and moderate symptoms. This centre, which can accommodate up to 650 patients at one time, had handled over 5,000 patients in the previous wave. It emerged as a ‘model’ COVID-19 Care Centre with volunteers from neighbouring districts coming here to see its functioning for replicating the model in their respective districts. Ashok S.U., Nodal Officer, CCC and District War Room, said, “We are ready to combat the second wave. Like how the CCC functioned as a model care centre last year, we are geared up to extend services for the patients.” A team of district officials visited the CCC and inspected the arrangements made. The target is to administer 20,000 doses of vaccine daily in Mysuru district. DC reviews situation Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, after a meeting with health authorities here on Thursday to review the COVID-19 situation and progress of vaccination coverage, said vaccine should be administered on all days, including Sundays, this month in view of surging cases. All government holidays had been withdrawn to facilitate more vaccination coverage. “In the beginning, due to shortfall of vaccine following overwhelming response, immunisation was slightly affected. There is no such scenario now as 20 lakh doses of vaccine have been made available,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jab-for-persons-above-45-years-begins-in-mysuru-district/article34220296.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Taxi fares for aggregators increased||Commuting in Ola, Uber and other taxis operated by mobile app aggregators will be more expensive. On Thursday, the Transport Department issued a notification revising fares applicable to aggregators with immediate effect. The revision comes two days after a KSTDC driver set himself ablaze inside his taxi at Kempegowda International Airport on Tuesday. Fares have been fixed in four categories depending on the type and cost of the vehicle. To travel in ‘D’ category taxis where the cost of the vehicle is up to Rs. 5 lakh, a passenger has to pay Rs. 75 for the first four kilometres. The aggregator can charge anywhere between Rs. 18 and Rs. 36 for each subsequent kilometre. For vehicles in the Rs. 5-Rs. 10 lakh price range, or the ‘C’ category, the basic fare for the first four km is Rs. 100, and thereafter between Rs. 21 and Rs. 42 per km. The next slab is ‘B’ category vehicles priced between Rs. 10 lakh and Rs. 16 lakh. The basic fare here is Rs. 120 for the first four km, following which Rs. 24 and Rs. 48 can be charged for each subsequent km by the aggregator. For ‘A’ category of vehicle that cost above Rs. 16 lakh, the basic fare (4 km) will be Rs. 150, after which the aggregator can charge anywhere between Rs. 27 and Rs. 54 per km. In addition to the fare, aggregators can collect GST and toll from passengers. The department has directed aggregators to charge fares fixed by the department on a kilometre basis and barred them from collecting fares based on time – indicating peak and non-peak hours. The notification further stated that aggregators cannot collect unauthorised fares from passengers. There is no waiting charge for the first 20 minutes, and thereafter drivers can charge customers Rs. 10 for every 15 minutes. The revised rate is applicable not just in Bengaluru but also in other cities where aggregators are providing these services. Fares of Ola, Uber and other aggregators were last revised in March 2018. At that time, the department had fixed the basic fare in the Rs. 44-Rs. 80 range for the first four km depending on type of vehicle. The minimum fare was Rs. 11-Rs. 20 and the maximum fare was set in the Rs. 22-45 range. Now, the basic fare is in the Rs. 75-Rs. 150 range for the first four km. The minimum fare for subsequent km is in the Rs. 18-Rs. 27 range, and the maximum fare is in the Rs. 36-54 range. The department cited increase in fuel prices, maintenance and operational cost as well as other factors for increasing taxi fares.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/taxi-fares-for-aggregators-increased/article34220097.ece

Also, the BTC told the court that work has begun on removing the asbestos sheet, as per recommendations of an expert appointed by the Animal Welfare Board of India on the court’s direction. Submissions in this regard have been made before a division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Compassion Unlimited Plus Action, an NGO. A counsel for BTC told the bench that negotiation with the private stable centre is in the final stage, and the horses would be shifted there shortly. The BTC’s response was to the court’s query on how the club would implement the recommendations of an expert to construct state-of-the-art stables in the race course while pointing out that 80% of the existing stables are over 50 years old, and temporary measures, like puff panelling, won’t be fruitful in the long run. As the report had said that infrastructure in the race course is not sufficient to accommodate 887 horses, the bench during the earlier hearing had asked the BTC to come out with a plan to decongest the race course while observing that keeping horses sans sufficient infrastructure would amount to cruelty to animals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/btc-to-shift-200-horses/article34220092.ece

Others who are midway through the examination process are disappointed that they have to suspend it. Access to gadgets “Students in government schools, however, do not have access to gadgets and stable Internet connection, which is why we have decided to do away with the assessment for some classes,” the official said. Tarun S., an autorickshaw driver whose son studies in class V at a government school in Rajajinagar, said, “I am glad they are not conducting any assessment for my son as he has not had any formal classes this year. But I am also extremely worried that he will not be able to cope the next academic year as classes have been disrupted.” Niranjan Aradhya V.P., Senior Fellow, Centre for Child and the Law, National Law School India University (NLSIU), said that rather than focussing on assessment this year, the government should plan an accelerated learning programme or a bridge course for students. “Before the next academic year begins in July, a plan needs to be chalked so that students are on a par with the age-appropriate learning level,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/physical-lessons-suspended-for-class-vi-to-ix-students-in-city/article34220100.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 cases breach one million mark||Subsequently, the numbers more than doubled every fortnight and touched 8,02,817 till October 25. After that, there was a decline in new cases, and by December the State started recording less than 1,000 cases. Following that the daily cases reduced to less than 500 cases by February-end. However, the number of cases again started rising from the first week of March. The State has been reporting more than 4,000 cases for the past two days. Weak contact tracing V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka and member of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee, said the State had failed in properly communicating to people about the seriousness of the second wave. “This coupled with weak contact tracing is hitting us hard at the onset of the second wave,” he said. “During the corresponding period last year, we were tracing 47 contacts for every positive case detected. Now, it is as low as 1:10. We need to trace at least 20-30 contacts for every positive case,” he said. He said it was important for the State to initiate district-specific data-driven interventions. “Testing targets and management strategies based on prevalence in various districts should be taken up on a war footing. Otherwise, by this month-end we will be going the Maharashtra way, reporting 25,000 to 30,000 cases a day,” he said. Complacency C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, attributed the rising cases to complacency in people, a false sense of belief that the curve had flattened since November onwards, mutations in the virus, and waning immunity among those who had been infected earlier. “The false sense of belief that the curve has flattened led to a release phenomena resulting in relentless crowding, gathering and violation of COVID-19 norms,” he said, adding that slowing down the rate of transmission was entirely in people’s hands now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-cases-breach-one-million-mark/article34220102.ece

There are 725 acacia trees and 308 eucalyptus. A lone Neem tree has also been earmarked for removal. The Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Limited (K-RIDE) identified the trees at Heelalige station and approached deputy conservator of forest of Bengaluru Urban division. K-RIDE maintains that trees have to be removed to build station yards and platforms at Heelalige station as part of the track doubling project. Officials said the eucalyptus and acacia trees had been planted years ago by the Railways. “Removal of these trees will not have much environmental impact. However, K-RIDE will do the afforestation work by planting saplings at places identified by the Forest Department,” said Amit Garg, MD of K-RIDE. Civil work between Baiyappanahalli and Hosur is going on in full swing. “The length of track doubling is 50 km. The work will take three years,” he said.

He was speaking to reporters in Haripad on Thursday. “They are spending a huge amount on advertisements. On the other hand, attempts are being made to scuttle the democratic process by manipulating the electoral rolls. The State has never before witnessed acts like these. This is the style of an autocrat. All the efforts will go in vain,” he said. Mr. Chennithala said that more than 10,000 fake voters had been added to the voters’ list in each Assembly constituency. “The CPI (M) is behind the massive electoral fraud. Bogus voters were added with the help of Left service organisations and government employees inclined to the CPI (M),” he said. ‘ECI duty-bound’ Mr. Chennithala said that the Election Commission of India (ECI) was duty-bound to prevent the fraud in voters’ list and ensure free and fair Assembly polls. He said that the ECI, however, was not efficient enough to identify fake voters and publish an error-free voters' list.  He alleged that the LDF had won the 2020 local body polls in various places with the help of bogus votes. The Leader of the Opposition urged the voters to visit the website www.operationtwins.com and check their names for multiple entries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cm-clinging-to-power-chennithala/article34219894.ece

Siddique of the Kalpetta constituency said that they would jointly prepare the master plan with the support of Rahul Gandhi, MP, it they were elected in the forthcoming Assembly polls. The prime focus of the master plan would be to establish the proposed government medical college in the district, they said. All agriculture produce would be procured at the minimum support price to help the debt-ridden farming community, they said. Higher educational institutions such as a law college, hotel management college, and Ayurveda medical college would be set up under the public sector. Projects would be launched to mitigate the increasing man-animal conflict. The Nilambur-Nanjangud rail project would be implemented as per the detailed project report prepared by the former UDF government, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-candidates-promise-master-plan-for-development-of-wayanad/article34219814.ece

Jayalakshmi on Thursday, the Congress leader said though the people in the district were facing various problems such as man-animal conflict, issues related to eco-sensitive zones around sanctuaries and fall in prices of farm produce, the State government had not addressed them. On the setting up of a medical college in the district, Mr. Gandhi said, “We had requested the Chief Minister to set up a Government Medical College in the district, but the government just changed the board of the district hospital to medical college.” While addressing the public in Sulthan Bathery, Mr. Gandhi said his aim was the all-round development of the district by strengthening farmers. Settler farmers Later, addressing an election rally after taking out a roadshow at Kooderanji in Kozhikode, Mr. Gandhi said the LDF government’s decision to classify agricultural land in the buffer zone had left the settlers in hill regions an anxious lot.

02 April 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Discuss development, CM dares Opposition||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said opponents of development have united and are spreading false stories to defame the State and the Left Democratic Front. Mr. Vijayan sought to know whether Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala was ready to discuss and compare the achievements of the previous United Democratic Front government with that of the incumbent LDF. In a tweet on Wednesday night, Mr. Vijayan said, “We are in the last leg of election campaigning. Kerala wants to know if the Opposition is willing to discuss development and welfare, if they would dare to compare their performance in 2011-16 with that of ours over the last 5 years.” “Are you ready LoP?” Addressing a press conference in Kannur on Thursday, he said the top brass of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party were trying to portray Kerala as a corrupt State. Transparency International had found Kerala, governed by the Left Democratic Front, as the least corrupt State. However, it found Rajasthan, ruled by the Congress, the most corrupt. They were now threatening to close down the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). “What do they intend to achieve by targeting KIIFB? Does this mean that schools, roads, hospitals, and bridges in the State should no longer be developed,” he asked. Mr. Vijayan said those behind the genocide in Delhi and Gujarat were coming to Kerala and talking about violent politics. Mr. Vijayan, responding to an allegation of Mr. Chennithala about the deep-sea fishing controversy, said Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan had ordered to cancel the memorandum of understanding. A report had also been submitted. Even the application for four acre for which the EMCC had not paid any amount had been cancelled. However, there was an attempt to mislead people claiming that the contract had not been cancelled. On the double voter issue, Mr. Vijayan said he suspected the role of the Congress in deliberately adding voters on the electoral rolls.

02 April 2021||Kannur,KERALA||It’s Left warhorses vs UDF greenhorns here||Kannur district, which traditionally favours the CPI(M) in Assembly elections, is set to witness a fierce battle between the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) even as the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is working hard to make a dent in the vote base of the rival fronts. This time, 75 candidates are in the fray for the 11 seats in the district. The LDF and UDF led have fielded their candidates in all, while the NDA is contesting in only 10, following the rejection of the nomination of BJP district president N. Haridas in Thalassery. Nearly half of the UDF candidates are fresh faces. While the LDF is confident of improving its 2016 score, the UDF and the NDA are leaving no stone unturned to blunt the impact. Though the fronts have promised development of road, infrastructure, health, education and tourism and job opportunities, the poll campaigns of the UDF and NDA are dominated by a raft of charges against the LDF, including the gold smuggling case, deep-sea fishing agreement, political murders and illegal appointments. The LDF won eight seats last time. These include Payyannur, Taliparamba, Kalliassery, Kannur, Dharmadam, Mattannur, Koothuparamba and Thalassery. Azhikode, Peravur and Irikkur favoured the UDF. However, this time the election is likely to witness a close contest at least in four constituencies. High hopes The Kannur constituency, considered a stronghold of the UDF, was won by the LDF in 2016. LDF candidate and Congress (S) leader Kadanappally Ramachandran, who defeated UDF’s Satheeshan Pacheni then, is seeking re-election. The UDF, however, looks confident of wresting it, riding on the hopes of its good performance in the local body polls last year and the Lok Sabha election in 2019. The NDA candidate is also expected to make an impact. Closely watched contest Azhikode is set to witness a closely watched joust, where K.V. Sumesh of the LDF and incumbent MLA K.M. Shaji of the UDF are pitted against each other. Mr. Shaji is standing for the elections for the second time now from Azhikode. By fielding K. Ranjith, former district BJP president, the NDA is endeavouring to increase its vote share. The Koothuparamba segment is predicted to see a three-cornered contest after the LDF decided to field Loktantrik Janata Dal leader K.P. Mohanan. In 2016, Mr. Mohanan, then a UDF candidate, lost to LDF candidate and incumbent Health Minister K.K. Shylaja. Mr. Mohanan this time will be up against Pottankandi Abdulla of the UDF. NDA candidate C. Sadanandan, who got 20,000 votes in the last election, is likely to make an impact on the results.  In Thalassery, where the NDA has no candidate, both the LDF and the UDF are eyeing the 22,000-odd votes it secured in last Assembly polls. Here, C.O.T. Nazeer, a former CPI(M) worker, is contesting as an Independent. Though the NDA has offered to back him, he has declined the support. Interestingly, this election will be without some of the well-known CPI(M) faces. However, LDF warhorses, including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan (Dharmadam), K.K. Shylaja (Mattannur), A.N. Shamseer (Thalassery) and M.V. Govindan (Taliparamba), make the fight interesting here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/its-left-warhorses-vs-udf-greenhorns-here/article34219880.ece
02 April 2021||Kannur,KERALA||Taking on the Chief Minister in his home turf||On Wednesday, residents of Kakkoth, a small ward in Chembilode grama panchayat in the Dharmadam constituency in Kannur, were in jubilation. Children waving red and white balloons and others holding decorative umbrellas stood on both sides of the road. The scorching afternoon heat hardly seemed to bother them. But their eyes lit up on hearing the sound of crackers bursting and drums beating. They would soon catch a glimpse of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, visiting the ward as part of the Left Democratic Front’s election campaign. Many jostled to click photos of Mr. Vijayan, who stood speaking from a makeshift podium. Mr. Vijayan said the Congress, the BJP and the Indian Union Muslim League had no clue about facing the LDF and hence were spreading baseless rumours. "They allege that the LDF is a government that helps corporates. But they are the ones who actually help them. People know the BJP’s policy, which is to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.” “People have to be conscious. I appeal to you to vote for the LDF to ensure a secular State, for development and to build a new Kerala,” said the Chief Minister. Meanwhile, a few kilometres away, C.K. Padmanabhan, the NDA candidate, too was in the thick of campaigning. "Though flex boards and walls here seem to be filled with pictures of the Chief Minister, the lotus occupies the minds of the people here,” he said. Mr. Padmanabhan’s electioneering received a boost a few days ago when BJP president J.P. Nadda campaigned for him at Chakkarakkal in Anjarakandy panchayat. ‘Kurukshetra battle’ Referring to the upcoming elections as “a historical Kurukshetra battle”, Mr. Padmanbhan appealed to the people to vote for the lotus symbol to ensure that the benefits of development projects implemented by the Narendra Modi government reached every nook and corner of the State. “Due to the fear unleashed by the Marxist party, many prefer to remain silent here. They see the BJP as an alternative in order to live fearlessly and peacefully,” he said. “We are trying to build a new country that is free of corruption and one that sees development on all fronts. For this, we have introduced the slogan ‘A new Kerala with Narendra Modi’,” he said. On another street in Chakkarakkal, a huge hoarding of the United Democratic Front candidate C. Raghunath stands tall. Though a strong candidate like Congress MP K. Sudhakaran was initially considered in the constituency, the UDF approved Mr. Raghunath's nomination in the final minutes. However, Mr. Raghunath said he took it all in a positive stride as he got enough “publicity” from the episode. During campaigning, he stops at an anganwadi functioning from a poky rented location in Muzhappalingad, where he turns visibly emotional. Assuring help in constructing a proper anganwadi, he said it was unfortunate that such a situation existed in an LDF panchayat. Expressing confidence of a victory, he said that unlike Mr. Vijayan, he was a grass-roots-level worker and would always be available for the people. As more than just a symbolic act, the mother of the two minor girls who were raped and killed at Walayar in 2017 will also be contesting against the Chief Minister from the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/taking-on-the-chief-minister-in-his-home-turf/article34219884.ece

Vinod, the UDF candidate from Ernakulam Assembly constituency, looked at the middle-aged man as Mr. Andrews lowered his face mask. A broad smile flashed across the face of Mr. Vinod as he recognised his college-mate, at a narrow ally at Madavanathazham near Pachalam. After exchanging pleasantries, Mr. Vinod, clad in starched, sparkling white shirt and dhothi, moved on quickly as a Seva Dal volunteer announced the arrival of the candidate through a hand-held mike in Malayalam and Hindi. Kajal Salim, a Congress councillor and Smrithi Haris, a Congress worker, introduced the candidate to residents. A few party workers, including Rinu Paily, the Mandalam president of the Indian Youth Congress, accompanied him. With one week left for the polling, campaign in Ernakulam has reached the fever pitch as every candidate is striving hard to woo voters. “I am seeking another term as a legislator. I have proposed an urban transport model connecting road, rail and water networks, which would make urban transport a smooth affair,” said Mr. Vinod. “This time, we expect around 70% voter turnout, which will ensure us an impressive win,” said Mr. Vinod, while adjusting the tricolour shawl wrapped around his neck. During the 2019 bypoll, only 56% of voters exercised their franchise. On their game Wearing a white t-shirt with photos of Shaji George Pranatha, the LDF candidate, and a football, his election symbol, printed on it, Vipin, an employee of the Cochin Shipyard, and his friends quickly converted thoroughfare that passes through Velleparambu colony near Foreshore Road into a football field. They put on display their dribbling skills, while waiting for the candidate. E.M. Sunilkumar, a former councillor of the Kochi Corporation, oversaw the preparations for the reception. Someone ignited firecrackers as Mr. George arrived at the place in an open vehicle. Mr. Vipin and his friends moved ahead of the candidate as they exchanged short passes with the football. In his short address, Mr. George sought support for ensuring the continuity of the Left Democratic Front government. Before getting back to the vehicle, he also sought the blessings of a few elders who were present there. Earlier, a group of autorickshaw drivers accorded Mr. George a reception near Lakshmi Hospital. “These workers, who take care of the polling booth in the area, have already completed three rounds of house visits,” said Mr. Sunilkumar. Enthusiastic workers Union Minister V. Muralidharan gave the required impetus for the campaign of the NDA candidate Padmaja S. Menon by participating in a roadshow from Menaka Junction to Kaloor. Waving flags and shouting slogans, scores of enthusiastic party workers joined the event as the candidate waved at the passers-by.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/electioneering-reaches-fever-pitch-in-ernakulam/article34220251.ece
02 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Caste, religion take centre stage in polls||The political narrative in Kerala is becoming increasingly focussed on caste and religious issues as the State is all set to vote for a new government on April 6. The BJP has stepped up its Hindutva campaign this week by harping on its pet topics ‘love jihad’ and ‘disproportionate allocation of minority benefits.’ Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday raised the tempo of the saffron campaign by accusing the Left Democratic Front and United Democratic Front of supporting ‘jihadist’ forces while blaming the State government for not passing ‘anti-love jihad’ legislation. Grave concern Interestingly, it is Jose K. Mani, the leader of the Kerala Congress (M), the latest entrant in the CPI(M)-led LDF, who ignited the debate on the sensitive issue of ‘love jihad’ last week through an inadvertent comment, only to retract it later. Making use of the opportunity to woo Christian voters, BJP State president K. Surendran said conversion to Islam on the pretext of inter-faith love marriages is a matter of grave concern for Christians. Incidentally, in his efforts to re-centre the political debate, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan dared the Opposition to discuss development and welfare issues. “We have been raising the issue of ‘love jihad’ for long though many were not willing to accept it,” said B. Gopalakrishnan, BJP leader, whose video of canvassing votes from a Christian priest by asking him to realise the issues faced by Hindus and Christians had evoked sharp response. The issue of “disproportionate allocation of minority welfare benefits” was also taken up by the party as the Christians had a grouse regarding the inequitable allocation of funds. These were some of the social issues in public domain, which the BJP raised along with that of corruption and misdeeds of the government, he said. Distances himself Interestingly, the otherwise vocal Vellappally Natesan, general secretary of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam, who raised the issue of ‘love jihad’ much ahead of political parties, distanced himself from the latest controversy. “Though we had raised the issue earlier, its inappropriate to bring it at this stage as political as well as development issues need to be discussed during election. Elections need to be fought on political issues and not by creating social and communal divide,” Mr. Vellappally Natesan said. SNDP stance The Yogam will not either favour or oppose any party or formation in the election, including the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) led by Thushar Vellappally. The Ezhava community and Yogam members can vote for candidates of their choice, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/caste-religion-take-centre-stage-in-polls/article34219901.ece
02 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||UDF takes WhatsApp route for public connect||Widely perceived to have ceded ground to its opponents on the social media till recently, the Congress-led United Democratic Front seems to have come with a winner, albeit belatedly for the forthcoming Assembly election, going by the response to its WhatsApp-based interactive platform to reach out to the electorate and elicit suggestions from them. A brainchild of the All India Professionals' Congress (AIPC) and backed by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and Shashi Tharoor, MP, the platform evoked such a great response within a short span of time since its launch on Thursday so much so that its server in Karnataka was in danger of crashing. “It was designed and customised in a month by a software company that has already been using its basic version for business development. We went for it as there was no simpler way to reach out to the public. Plans are now afoot to use it beyond the State Assembly elections with an impressed All India Congress Committee exploring the scope for adapting it nationally,” said Anand Mohanraj, Pathanamthitta district president of the AIPC, who has been tirelessly working on the platform for the last two months. The platform based on a WhatsApp number (88912-28449) works rather straightforward. One can get aboard the platform in three ways – directly through the number or by using a link or scanning the barcode. The first message is responded with a text addressing the user by her name and requesting to vote for the UDF followed by the UDF manifesto. This is followed by a message to select the district listed out serially from 1 to 14. The user can choose the district by keying in the serial number on which all constituencies within that district are listed and from which one can select individual constituency again by keying in the relevant number. Campaign info The user then receives the campaign pictures of the UDF candidate concerned and her social media handles. This is followed by an option to either send a suggestion or terminate the communication by pressing 1 or 2 respectively. “The suggestions received are shared with the campaign teams concerned and the valuable ones will be incorporated into the updated manifesto. The system can be further fine-tuned for the campaign of individual candidates though we were left with little time for that in this election,” said Mr. Mohanraj.  The platform is based on WhatsApp number 88912-28449||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-takes-whatsapp-route-for-public-connect/article34219885.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran issued the directive when a petition filed by the Kochi Residents’ Association Coordination Committee came up for hearing. The Superintendent Engineer had suggested that the blockages at various locations be cleared for the inter-connectivity of canals. The report also recommended that the portion from Kazhuthumuttu bridge to Rameswaram canal be widened by nearly 500-metres length to ensure the connectivity between Valummel canal and Rameswaram canal, without affecting the existing road. The sluice of Pandarachitra and Luka Kadath be modified by widening the waterway as it was built without taking into consideration of the flow of water. Yet another suggestion is that Chiracakl and Kalathara bridges be reconstructed with wider vent-ways to allow free flow of water. The report also suggested reopening of the portion of Pallichal Thodu near Thompumpady covered with slabs and increasing the cross section to the maximum possible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-seeks-corpn-response/article34220254.ece

02 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Police rule out sexual abuse in Muvattupuzha case||The Muvattupuzha police probing a case in which a four-and-a-half-year-old Assamese girl was found with suspicious injuries seem to have ruled out the probability of sexual abuse as was being accused by certain quarters. The police had initially registered a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act after the doctor treating the child flagged that the kind of injury found on her backside could also have been caused by sexual abuse among other things. “However, since then we have counselled the child with the help of a counsellor from the Childline proficient in Assamese. The girl said that she had a fall from the window when her younger sister pulled her frock from behind. According to her, she fell on a vertically split children’s cycle on the floor injuring her back. She, however, hid it from her parents for fear of getting a thrashing. Subsequently, the injury got infected leading to severe complications,” said a senior police officer associated with the probe. He said that steps would be taken to change the POCSO sections invoked in the case in the wake of the child’s statement. The girl resides at a rented home at Perumattom in Muvattupuzha with her father and stepmother and the children born out of their wedlock. Her condition got revealed last week when she was taken to a private hospital after she complained of abdomen pain. The hospital found her condition complicated and referred her to Kottayam Medical College where her intestine was found ruptured and she was subjected to surgery. In the meantime, the incident turned into a controversy following the registration of police case under POCSO Act and after a section of the media gave further credence to the sexual abuse theory. The police said that it no longer seems the case going by the child’s statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-rule-out-sexual-abuse-in-muvattupuzha-case/article34220255.ece

02 April 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Where LDF looks to paint the town red again with a clean sweep||With the Left Democratic Front (LDF) keen on repeating the clean sweep of 2016 and the United Democratic Front (UDF) all geared up to improve its tally, Kollam has become an interesting battlefield to watch out for. The equations have changed since the early days of campaigning and the incertitude has kept both the fronts on tenterhooks, at least in some segments. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has also buckled down to the fight after establishing itself as one the main rivals in Chathannur during the last Assembly elections. Currently, the UDF has zero seats in the district, with the Left claiming all 11 segments. The district has seen no Congress MLA since 2006, and in a bid to bounce back, the party is contesting in seven seats. There have been internal wars between its factions regarding candidatures, the loudest being the one for the Kollam constituency. Reportedly, the UDF leadership had a tough time dealing with Kottarakara, Punalur and Chandayamangalam as well. No easy task Finding candidates for the seats vacated by sitting MLAs K. Raju and Mullakkara Ratnakaran was no easy task for the CPI either as the leadership had to face strong dissent. The infighting took a nasty turn in the form of protest marches and parallel conventions in Chadayamangalam where the party decided to field national council member J. Chinju Rani to ensure female representation. The decision to field actor-turned-politician M. Mukesh for a second time sparked resentment among a section of the CPI(M) cadre. The CPI(M) leadership seems confident about Eravipuram where sitting MLA M. Naushad is seeking the mandate for a second time. The UDF has fielded veteran Revolutionary Socialist Party leader Babu Divakaran to wrest the segment. While Kollam is all geared for a neck-and-neck fight between District Congress Committee president Bindu Krishna and Mr. Mukesh, perhaps Chathannur is the only Assembly segment that is poised to witness a triangular contest. In Chathannur, sitting MLA G.S. Jaylal will be fighting senior Congress leader N. Peethambara Kurup and BJP district president B.B. Gopakumar who polled more votes than the UDF candidate in 2016.  In Kundara, Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma, who had to face attacks following the deep-sea fishing deal controversy, has a strong opponent in the young Congress leader P.C. Vishnunath. CPI(M) State secretariat member K.N. Balagopal is contesting in Kottarakara. Pitted against him are Congress nominee R. Rashmi and Vayakkal Soman of the BJP. While Kovoor Kunnumon of the RSP(L) is seeking the mandate for the fifth term from Kunnathur as LDF candidate, both the UDF and the NDA have high hopes about their candidates Ullas Kovoor (RSP) and Raji Prasad (BJP). Congress State general secretary C.R. Mahesh is expected to offer a stiff competition to CPI's R. Ramachandran in Karunagapally after losing the seat to the latter for a slim margin in 2016. Another segment that has grabbed the attention of political observers is Chavara where the RSP is facing a crucial electoral battle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/where-ldf-looks-to-paint-the-town-red-again-with-a-clean-sweep/article34219878.ece
02 April 2021||Kottayam,KERALA||‘Women pride’ raises pitch in Ettumanur||Will the Ettumanur constituency witness a re-run of the 1987 Assembly elections? This is a widely speculated question ever since Lathika Subash, a distraught former Mahila Congress leader who recently quit the party, entered the poll scene here as an independent. A closer look at its electoral history suggests that Ettumanur may not hesitate to look beyond party preferences while sending its representative to the State Assembly. The victory of George Joseph Podipara in 1987, a former Congress leader who contested as an independent, stands as a case in point. And when events have now conspired to set the stage for a similar battle here after 34 years, there is no wonder that the United Democratic Front and the Left Democratic Front are straining every nerve for the crucial votes. After a two-decade long reign by the the Kerala Congress(M) , the seat swayed to the Left through the CPI(M) leader Suresh Kurup in 2011 and has remained with it ever since. During the period, the Left coalition made significant inroads across the constituency and captured several of the local bodies in the process. Now, with the KC(M) in its fold, the LDF seeks to assert its dominance over the seat and has fielded one of its strongest leader, V.N. Vasavan, to hold the fort. Anti-incumbency factor The UDF, on the other hand, has overcome much of the initial hiccups over the selection of candidate and could cover much of the ground through systematic campaigning. It counts on the anti-incumbency factor and a high-voltage campaign to work in its favour, besides the considerable clout its candidate, Prince Lukose, wields across the region. The UDF, however, is not free from worries as the presence of Ms. Subash, a much popular figure in the region, threatens to split its traditional vote bank. The NDA, which secured 27,540 votes in 2016, expects a major improvement in its vote share and has fielded the BJP leader T.N. Harikumar. But as to how far the coalition would be able to put up a united show, especially in view of the strained relationship between the BJP and the Bharatiya Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), a constituent of the NDA, remains to be seen. Among the key poll planks raised by the leading coalitions include development, tourism and access to safe drinking water. Ms. Subash, meanwhile, has made ‘women pride’ a key pillar of her campaign. Of the seven local bodies in the Assembly segment, the UDF holds power in the Ettumanur municipality and two panchayats, while the remaining four are with the LDF.  Among the key poll planks raised by the leading coalitions include development and tourism||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/women-pride-raises-pitch-in-ettumanur/article34219889.ece
02 April 2021||KOVALAM,KERALA||From water to handloom, a gamut of issues in Kovalam||Ranging from the deep-sea fishing row to the delay in realising the Vizhinjam seaport and from the plight of the handloom weavers of Balaramapuram to the shortage of potable water along the coastal belt, a whole gamut of issues have come to the fore in the Kovalam Assembly constituency where electioneering has neared a finish. The segment, which is known for its unpredictable swings from one coalition to the other, has been witnessing a fierce contest. United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate and incumbent MLA M. Vincent, who snatched victory from Jameela Prakasam of the Janata Dal (Secular) [JD(S)] by 2,615 votes five years ago, is confident of repeating his performance after completing three rounds of campaigning. Govt. apathy Engaged in last-leg campaign in Kanjiramkulam on Thursday, the Congress leader says he has been able to brave an indifferent stance by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government to implement 635 projects across the constituency. “The government only granted sanction for 15 of the 169 major project proposals submitted during the past five years. This reflected its disregard towards the fishing community as well as the handloom industry,” he says. Mr. Vincent, who was in the forefront of the recent ‘Theeradesha Samrakshna Yatra’ (coastal protection march)’, has adopted the raging controversy over the deep-sea fishing project as a political weapon. He accused the LDF of failing to clear 1,500 pending applications for title deeds in the constituency. Public support LDF candidate A. Neelalohithadasan Nadar, who took a brief break from campaigning after concluding a week-long constituency tour late Wednesday, says the government enjoyed public confidence having succeeded in fulfilling all of its promises, including those made to the families of the Cyclone Ockhi victims. Dismissing the controversy surrounding the deep-sea fishing agreement as ‘paid news’, the veteran Janata Dal (S) leader claimed such diversionary tactics will turn futile. The 73-year-old candidate, who has represented the region five times, also felt his personal bond with the electorate will enable him to address several complex problems faced by the region’s working class, including fish workers, handloom weavers, farmers and, to a small extent, coir workers. NDA’s trump card The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which has seen an increase in its vote share over the years, viewed its decision to field Kerala Kamaraj Congress leader Vishnupuram Chandrasekharan as a game changer. The coalition is betting on the Vaikunda Swamy Dharma Pracharana Sabha (VSDP) leader to garner a majority of the Nadar votes which, along with those of Latin Christian and Ezhava communities, could prove crucial in determining the outcome here. “The constituency has suffered under the UDF and the LDF legislators for decades. Several parts of Uchakkada continue to reel under severe drinking water crisis. The traditional fishermen of Mulloor and other parts have suffered by way of the Vizhinjam seaport project. The famed handloom industry is also in the doldrums. Moreover, the tourism industry in Kovalam has been lying stagnant for several years now. The region is in dire need of Central assistance,” Mr. Chandrasekharan says on the sidelines of a meeting at Vellar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/from-water-to-handloom-a-gamut-of-issues-in-kovalam/article34220389.ece

Criticising all major political fronts for their “anti-farmer policies and monopolistic administration”, the posters called for a protracted people’s war against the forces concerned for liberation. The posters also claimed that election was hardly a solution for liberating the State from corporate forces and Hindu fascism. Sources said senior Intelligence officials collected details from local residents and shop owners. Surveillance Since the declaration of elections, the police had intensified local surveillance measures based on the booth-level vulnerability assessment report. Constituencies suspected of having the presence of Maoist supporters or activists had been identified to take security measures. According to sources, there were directives from the EC to ensure special protection for 3 polling stations at Vilangad St. George High School, Abhayagiri Welfare School, and Indira Nagar Village office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/maoist-posters-appear-near-thiruvambadi/article34219899.ece
02 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||BJP conspiracy will not work, says Karat||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s conspiracy to target the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government using Central investigating agencies is going to fail, Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] Polit Bureau member Prakash Karat has said. Addressing an election campaign event at Chathamangalam near here on Thursday, he said the LDF was fighting not only the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), but also a third force in the form of such agencies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were trying to topple the government using the Enforcement Directorate, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Customs. In some other States, similar threats were being used to lure Congress leaders. Fearing cases, they joined the BJP. In Kerala, however, that strategy was not going to work, said Mr. Karat. The UDF was resorting to spreading lies and misleading campaigns as they did not have any alternative to offer to the LDF government’s development works. The UDF was with the BJP when the State faced one crisis after the other, added Mr. Karat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-conspiracy-will-not-work-says-karat/article34219806.ece

02 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||UDF-BJP pact in 12 segments: Viswam||Communist Party of India (CPI) national secretary Binoy Viswam has alleged a tacit deal between the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to cross vote in 12 Assembly constituencies. At a meet-the-press programme organised by the Kerala Union of Working Journalists here on Thursday, Mr. Viswam said the anti-Left Democratic Front (LDF) campaign by the UDF and the BJP was aimed as a diversion from this strategy. The UDF alleged that the LDF and the BJP had an understanding, while the BJP alleged that the LDF and the UDF had a deal. These charges were aimed at hiding the UDF and BJP’s “under the table” deal.  Mr. Viswam said finding itself without candidates in Guruvayur, Thalassery, and Devikulam was a deliberate move on the part of the BJP. Now, they were saying the UDF candidate should win in Guruvayur. In Thalassery, the BJP wanted the LDF to lose. This was proof of the UDF-BJP understanding, Mr. Viswam said. The Guruvayur, Thalassery, and Devikulam model would be effected in nine other constituencies, he said, saying the names of the segments would be revealed at the right time. The UDF-BJP joint campaign would be rejected by the people, the CPI leader said. He contended that this deal was nothing new in Kerala politics, and in fact existed for decades. Despite trying to outshout the other that there was no such understanding, it was evident to all that they shared an understanding based on anti-Left politics, he said. Mr. Viswam said only if the sun rose in the west would the LDF join hands with the BJP. The LDF could not imagine any understanding with the BJP ever. Such propaganda would not stand the test of reality. LDF confident Expressing confidence in a victory for the LDF in the elections, Mr. Viswam said in the last few days before polling day, it was evident which way the wind was blowing. The BJP, he asserted, was not a serious contender in the State. The contest here was between the LDF and the UDF-BJP, with the BJP being a partner of the UDF, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-bjp-pact-in-12-segments-binoy-viswam/article34219891.ece

02 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Yogi bats for law against ‘love jihad’||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath toured the Assembly segments in the district on Thursday, attending roadshows and a public meeting as part of giving a leg-up to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) election campaign. Addressing a public meeting at Peyad in the Kattakada constituency where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded P.K. Krishnadas, Mr. Adityanath said legislation against ‘love jihad’ was most needed in Kerala. However, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF), which had ruled the State, refused to enact such a law, he said.  ‘It’s Kerala’s turn now’ Both fronts had compromised on the security of the State. They were not worried about Kerala, but their own vote banks. The BJP had succeeded in forming a government in Tripura, and now it was Kerala’s turn, he said. Earlier in the evening, Mr. Adityanath took part in a roadshow in the Kazhakuttam segment where the BJP has fielded Sbha Surendran. The LDF government in Kerala considered it ‘birthright’ to trifle with the Hindu faith, he alleged, adding that Ms. Surendran’s LDF rival in Kazhakuttam was the individual who had acted against the interests of devotees. The LDF and UDF were birds of the same feather. Both the fronts were mired in corruption. While the Narendra Modi government had launched measures to fulfil the job aspirations of the youth, the government in Kerala had adopted a contradictory stand. Roadshow The roadshow was held from Arassumoodu Junction, Anayara, to Venpalavattom Junction, barely a kilometre away. But it took over an hour to cover the short distance due to the narrowness of the road and the crowd. BJP workers accompanied the campaign vehicle waving flags and holding up photographs of Mr. Adityanath and Ms. Surendran. He also attended a roadshow in the Parassala constituency on the district’s border where the BJP has fielded Karamana Jayan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/yogi-bats-for-law-against-love-jihad/article34220400.ece
02 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||52,097 above 45 take vaccine on Day 1||A total of 52,097 persons above 45 years were administered the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the State on Thursday, the first day of starting vaccination for those above 45 years across the country. The Health Department said in an official release that there was enthusiastic response to vaccination from those in the 45+ age group and that the government had readied 1,152 sites, including 791 government health facilities and 361 private health facilities, where the public could receive COVID-19 vaccination Till now, 32,21,294 persons have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the State, while 4,10,078 persons have received both doses. Of this, 34,89,742 received Covishield vaccine while 1,41,630 persons have received Covaxin. Second wave The Health Department has appealed to all above 45 years to ensure that they received the first dose of vaccine as soon as possible. This was important as the second wave of COVID-19 is surging across the country and is believed to be moving faster and is more severe than the first wave. In Kerala too, the case graph is on the rise and a fresh wave could peak in the next two or three weeks, experts say. Those above 45 years can register in the Cowin portal (www.cowin.gov.in) to schedule their appointment for vaccination. While this would help in reducing crowding in hospitals, people can also walk in to vaccination sites and get vaccinated on the spot. The number of vaccination sites will be increased in the coming days, the statement said. More doses The State has newly received 9,51,500 doses of Covishield vaccine and more would be procured as required.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/52097-above-45-take-vaccine/article34219895.ece
02 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Left front switches to door-to-door campaigning mode||With the campaigning to end on April 4, Left Democratic Front leaders seem to reduce the number of public rallies and roadshows, favouring more house-to-house visits and neighbourhood-level conclaves. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan leads the pack. He has concluded his State-wide electioneering programme and returned to his constituency in Dharmadam in Kannur to meet party workers and constituents. Cultural event Nevertheless, a cultural event on April 3 would mark the culmination of Mr. Vijayan’s campaign in Dharmadam. Music band Thykoodam Bridge would perform. Actor Prakash Raj, Suhasini, Nikhila Vimal, Navya Nair, and sarod legend Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Aman Li and Ayan Li would attend it. A similar show had marked the end of Mr Vijayan's campaign in 2016. The LDF feels buoyed by favourable pre-poll surveys and its victory in the 2020 local body polls. However, the Congress and BJP feel the election has reached a dead heat, with both parties’ national leaders drawing huge crowds as the three competing campaigns hurtle down the home stretch to the final day on April 4. The CPI(M) appears to have a head start in door-to-door campaigning. Top CPI(M) leaders, Ministers, MPs, MLAs and local body representatives have been making house calls along with party workers. Election slips The party workers distribute election slips and explain the LDF’s position on issues such as Sabarimala and ‘love jihad’. The LDF’s low-key campaign mode at the fag of the end of the electioneering season appears to reflect the unique dynamics of the 2021 Assembly campaigning that has unfolded under the seemingly lengthening shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. The BJP and Congress are scheduled to follow in the footsteps of the CPI(M). Mobilised Both parties have mobilised large groups of supporters to make house calls for silent campaigning on April 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/left-front-switches-to-door-to-door-campaigning-mode/article34219905.ece

02 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||ATRS for aircraft security installed at airport||Three Automatic Tray Return Systems (ATRS) installed at the security check-in of the international departure section of the Calicut International Airport to enhance aircraft security has become functional. Chief Secretary V.P. Joy inaugurated the Rs. 8.78-crore ATRS through videoconferencing, and the system became operational with the security check-in of Dubai passengers of FlyDubai. Regional Executive Director R. Madhavan, General Manager (CNS) V. Muruganandam, Airport Director Srinivasa Rao, Acting Airport Director Muhammad Shahid, CNS In-Charge and Joint General Manager Muneer Madampat, and JGM A. Haridas were present. Each ARTS consists of an X-ray baggage inspection system (XBIS), server system, and a baggage handling system (BHS). Throughput of ATRS, manufactured by Nuctech, is 400 bags per hour. BHS consists of sensor-driven rollers through which baggage trays are transported to output lines and automatically returned towards the baggage input area. Bags will be placed in trays with independent RF tags and routed through rollers to the X-ray machine for screening and identification of threat items. While passing through XBIS, X-ray images will be generated leading to the screener for scrutiny of the bag. Screener will get a minimum of eight seconds to examine the image. If the baggage is free of threats, he will ‘clear’ the bag, and it will be taken to the baggage collection area, where the passenger can retrieve it. Specialised camera A specialised camera will continuously monitor the contents, and whenever its algorithm finds the tray is free, the boom barrier will be retracted, and the tray will be taken to the collector. The tray collector can hold up to seven trays at a time. In case the screener finds the baggage as having ‘threats’, he can ‘reject’ the bag and from the divert Station it will be diverted to the ‘reject line’. In the ‘re-check station’, the second screener can check it manually. With the help of ‘RF tag reader’, the image from XBIS will be recalled at re-check monitor. Another line with a single slot is available to send the ‘high-threat’ baggage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/atrs-for-aircraft-security-installed-at-airport/article34219822.ece

02 April 2021||Vadakara,KERALA||Which way will Vadakara swing?||A small group of people is seen listening to a speech by a local politician who is extolling the virtues of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government under a pandal at Kanarankandimukku in Chorod grama panchayat around noon on Wednesday. Some others are waiting on the fringes of an adjacent road for the LDF candidate from Vadakara Assembly seat, Manayath Chandran. As the local leader announces the arrival of Mr. Chandran in a campaign vehicle, crackers are burst. The Loktantrik Janata Dal leader’s words sound like a continuation of the local leader’s speech as he goes on to list the achievements of the government, in the form of social welfare pension and development projects, and the crisis management skills of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate is trying to cash in on the sympathy of voters. None of the LDF votes will go in her favour. The main issue here is development. The majority of voters, including the minorities, are with us. We believe that the discord between the Congress and the Revolutionary Marxist Party [RMP] will help us,” Mr. Chandran tells The Hindu . ‘People’s rights’ The scene at Government College, Madappally, where UDF-RMP candidate K.K. Rema is interacting with students, is completely different. Ms. Rema, widow of slain RMP leader T.P. Chandrashekharan, has skipped a couple of meetings from her schedule and is in a hurry. “The LDF is talking a lot about social welfare schemes. They should not be seen as the benevolence of the rulers, but as people’s rights,” she says. The RMP leader claims that this election verdict would be the people’s response against political violence as well. “Vadakara has been represented mainly by socialist leaders in the Assembly. But most of the areas here are underdeveloped. I will get votes even from LDF supporters,” she says before rushing to the next campaign spot. National Democratic Alliance candidate (NDA) M. Rajesh Kumar, meanwhile, is sure the people will opt for a change from the LDF and the UDF. While he is serving free lunch at the district government hospital, he says that many are talking about the development projects of the Narendra Modi government. “I am hopeful that those schemes will turn into votes in my favour,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/which-way-will-vadakara-swing/article34219810.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Falling short despite having enough material for more||A certain easy-going, calm atmosphere pervades Aarkkariyam even in supposedly the more tense moments in the narrative. So much so that close to the interval, when a key character makes a rather shocking claim, even that is delivered in a cool, collected manner, as if he is speaking about one of the dinner dishes. This somehow gives a chilling quality to that scene, yet this light treatment limits the film at other key points. Cinematographer Sanu John Varughese’s directorial debut is firmly set in the post-pandemic world, with the after-effects of the virus being a part of the narrative. Shirley (Parvathy Thiruvothu) and her husband Roy (Sharafudheen), who are settled in Mumbai, are returning home to Kerala to be with her father Ittyavira (Biju Menon), ahead of the COVID-induced lockdown. Beset with financial crises, Roy is also looking to raise urgent funds to repay his friend, who helped him in need, while Shirley is devising various ways to bring back her daughter who is stuck in a convent in another State. One of the impressive things about Aarkkariyam is in how much of it holds back, revealing just enough information at every point, keeping the rest for later. This subtle approach to even the most serious of issues is kept consistently. The mood of the film is accentuated by the light acoustic guitar strains in the background all through, even in moments when it did not really fit in. Easy-going atmosphere But, the easy-going atmosphere mentioned earlier and the patchy nature of the script, holds back the film from soaring even higher. This is especially so since the interval revelation held such immense potential as something to be built up on leading to a much more satisfying climax than what they managed to achieve here. It has still to be said that the film uses the usual elements of a family story to construct a world, which makes one comfortable, even as a viewer from the outside. This comfort lulls the unsuspecting viewer into trusting everyone on the screen, until the rug is pulled from under their feet, revealing the dark secrets lying beneath. In the latter half, the film focusses on justifying this dark event from the past with an ‘everything is for the better’ message, letting go of the opportunity of building a taut thriller. Biju Menon aces the role of a 73-year-old, making us feel the weight of the age in his demeanour and voice, while Sharafudheen and Parvathy too make their mark. In his debut, Sanu John Varughese gets quite a few things right, but Aarkkariyam winds up to a rather tame finish despite having the material for more. S.R.

02 April 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Two hospitals fined Rs. 4 lakh for denying Aarogyasri benefits||The disciplinary panel of YSR Aarogyasri scheme managed by the Aarogyasri Health Care Trust penalised two hospitals for seeking money from beneficiaries to extend them healthcare services free of cost. At a meeting of the disciplinary committee here on Thursday, the ex-officio member and Joint Collector A. Siri imposed a penalty of Rs. 2 lakh each on Mythri Hospital in Anantapur, and Asha Hospital in Tadipatri. Aarogyasri District Coordinator Kiran Kumar Reddy said that the Asha Hospital even denied food to the patients and a report in this regard had been sent to the head office of the trust in Vijayawada for action. Panel issues warning Other panel members District Coordinator of Hospital Services N. Ramesh Nath and Lakshman Prasad were present in the meeting. They said many complaints against these hospitals were lodged by patients who alleged that the hospital employees were collecting money for doing the paper works. If the hospitals do not mend their ways, they may be suspended from the scheme, the panel members said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/two-hospitals-fined-rs-4-lakh-for-denying-aarogyasri-benefits/article34220307.ece

02 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jumbos trample farmer to death in Chittoor dist.||Panic gripped the hamlets close to the Chittoor-Tamil Nadu border after a nine-member herd of wild elephants fatally attacked a 52-year-old farmer at Tanjavur village of Yadamarri mandal in the district, 25 km from here, on Thursday morning. According to local residents, the victim, Valligan (52), a speech and hearing impaired farmer, was relieving himself at a pond near his fields around 6 a.m., after finishing his night vigil, when the attack took place. The farmers in the neighbouring fields, who were also getting ready to return home, spotted the nine-member herd of wild elephants marching towards the forests of Paradarami (T.N.), after emerging from the pond. In a few seconds, the herd starting running towards Valligan, whose back was facing them. The farmers shouted to warn him but in vain. Attacked from behind The Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West), who enquired with the eye-witnesses, said that a male tusker leading the herd lifted Valligan into the air and flung him to a distance of 20 feet. The jumbos trailing their leader trampled him to death, while the panicked villagers ran helter skelter. “The deceased could not hear the warnings shouted by his fellow farmers. Further, he was wearing a white shirt. It is a known fact that wild elephants get enraged when they look at any object that is white,” the DFO said. Financial aid Meanwhile, senior revenue, police and forest officials inspected the spot. The victim’s body was shifted to the government hospital at Chittoor for autopsy. Puthalapattu MLA M.S. Babu spoke to the victim’s family members and arranged Rs. 2 lakh for immediate expenses on behalf of the government. The deceased is survived by wife, two unmarried daughters and a son. Personnel deployed According to the DFO, the herd had been on the prowl across the Paradarami-Yadamarri forest belt for a month. “We are more worried as the herd has two young ones, which often stray away from the group, forcing the other members to go in search of them, thus criss-crossing the fields abutting the forests. We have deployed additional force of forest watchers and elephant trackers in the region,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jumbos-trample-farmer-to-death-in-chittoor/article34219568.ece
02 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chittoor bears the brunt||The foresters in Chittoor district were elated when the Asiatic elephants reappeared in the Kuppam region in the early 1980s, after a hiatus of a century. By 1990, the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary spreading over about 1 lakh acres of forests in Palamaner, Kuppam and Chittoor west ranges, flanked by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, was ready for the pachyderms. Man-animal conflict The number of elephants which stood in single digit four decades ago has now increased to more than a hundred, including those in the Koundinya sanctuary. Now, the elephant menace has become a concern for the foresters and the farmers as the animals frequently venture into agriculture lands and damage crops, leading to man-animal conflict. Nine elephants died of electrocution in 2019-20 and half a dozen of people died during the same period. Many villagers were injured in jumbo attacks. Even as the forest officials have dug elephant-proof trenches, erected solar fencing and installed rock pillars to prevent elephants from straying into human habitations, none of the measures has proven to be adequate to contain the menace. Radio-collar project Between 2016 and 2018, around Rs. 40 crore was spent on trenches and erecting fences to cover the porous inter-State borders. The Forest Department also mooted a radio-collar project for stray elephants at a cost of Rs. 50 lakh, but it was shelved due to technical reasons. What worries the forest officials in Chittoor district is that the forest ranges that have a sound elephant population are poorly staffed, while a big chunk of the available staff are on the verge of their retirement. The operations to drive away the stray elephants into the forests in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka need at least a dozen of elephant-trackers and watchers. The officials say that the elephants continue to outsmart them, adding that it is impossible to monitor the forest stretch over a hundred kilometers with the available staff strength. Frequent crop raids The tri-State junction has been witnessing frequent crop raids by elephants from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, which have a pachyderm population of more than 7,000, the officials say. Even as plans made to hold meetings of the forest officials of the three States to tackle the inter-State problem, no tangible results could be seen as of now. In January this year, three elephants from Tamil Nadu ventured into the plain areas of Nagari and Puttur after passing through several ranges covering over 170 km. Three months have passed, the officials are yet to draw an action plan to tackle the group and prevent the crop raids. “One of the major reason for the elephant menace in Chittoor district is the rising the population of the animals in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The herds continue to move from Mudumalai in Tamil Nadu into the the tri-State junction area in Chittoor in search of food, water and new territory. We are exploring all possibilities to tackle the inter-State problem,” Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West) S. Ravi Shankar told The Hindu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chittoor-bears-the-brunt/article34220345.ece
02 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||SRM University professor gets grant for virus study||A Professor of Biology at SRM University, C. Durga Rao (Principal Investigator), has received a grant of Rs. 1.10 crore from the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, to work on a project titled ‘Understanding the molecular basis for the extreme differential level of expression of genes from human and animal rotaviruses in gene-transfected cells: Implications for improving the growth of human vaccine strains’. Understanding how a virus overpowers the host resistance mechanisms and seizes the host cellular processes for its own growth is very challenging and is essential for the development of not only efficient viral vaccines but also for antiviral therapeutic strategies. “Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe and acute dehydrating diarrhoea in infants and children below five years of age. Efforts by us and Dr. M.K. Bhan, former Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, led to the discovery and development of the first indigenous rotavirus vaccine, produced by Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad,” said Prof. Durga Rao. In the earlier project, Prof. Durga Rao observed that while some human rotaviral proteins could be expressed at high levels when the cloned genes were introduced into mammalian cells, other proteins could not be expressed at detectable levels. However, the virus expresses copious amounts of all its proteins when it infects the cells. “Within a few hours of infection, each virus employs several ploys in the infected cell to subvert the cellular defence and regulatory mechanisms and captures the host for its own progeny production,” Prof. Durga Rao said. Based on the earlier observations, this project will advance to unravel the tricks employed by the virus, and viral transactions in the infected cells. The outcome of the project will have implications for genetically engineering the poorly growing human vaccine strains for their efficient growth in cell culture, leading to reduced cost of not only rotavirus vaccines, but also other viral vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/srm-university-professor-gets-grant-for-virus-study/article34219665.ece

Krishna. Addressing the valedictory of a UGC-sponsored seminar on the ‘Impact of COVID-19 on Indian Economy’ on Thursday, he said the sudden shift to online learning without planning in India, where the infrastructure for it was not ready and the curriculum not designed for such format, had posed a risk of many students becoming passive learners due to low attention span. Most of the teachers were also not prepared for imparting online education especially in the absence of a dedicated online platform specifically designed for the purpose, Dr. Krishna observed, adding that the universities and colleges faced the risk of both students’ admission and their retention. However, the situation offered a great opportunity for companies which were into learning management systems for use by higher education institutions. The pandemic had thrown many sectors out of gear and it was more so in the case of the mass media sector. Quoting figures released by the Indian Newspaper Society, he said the print media had suffered a staggering loss of Rs. 4,500 crore in March and April, 2020. The loss in the next seven months was estimated to be Rs. 15,000 crore, affecting the livelihood of three million people. “The sitution calls for a sustained response from the government,” said Sri Nagarjuna Education Institutions chairman Vakulabharanam Rama Prasad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pandemic-has-delivered-a-blow-to-education-sector/article34220312.ece

02 April 2021||Tirupati,ANDHRA PRADESH||Panabaka Lakshmi certain of win if elections are free and fair||As the campaign vehicle rolled over the sun-baked roads amid beating of drums and the roar of microphone sets, the passers-by cared to turn their heads towards Panabaka Lakshmi, the TDP candidate for the byelection to the Tirupati (SC) Lok Sabha constituency. This is in sharp contrast to the 2019 general elections, when the people hardly took note of the TDP campaign, as the ‘Jagananna’ wave touched the crest. “Now, the same voters are walking towards us to overtly express their support to our party. My win is certain if the elections are conducted in a free and fair manner,” Ms. Lakshmi told The Hindu in an interview in the course of her campaign. Braving the scorching heat wave and the lurking risk of COVID-19, the TDP candidate is trying to cover every corner of the constituency that comprises seven Assembly segments – three in Chittoor and four in Nellore districts. ‘Misuse of power’ A day after TDP State president K. Atchannaidu launched a mobile number, urging the people to send complaints of intimidation by the village / ward volunteers, Ms. Lakshmi fumed at the manner in which the “unofficial entity” had become an intrinsic part of the State’s administrative hierarchy, especially in reaching out benefits and social welfare schemes to the deserving people. While the revenue officials, policemen, elected representatives and party leaders have always sided with the ruling party, the extended set-up of volunteers has given an extra edge to the ruling dispensation, which, she alleges, is adopting a “carrot and stick” policy towards the voters. “An illiterate woman in the remote Kota (Nellore district) village has confessed that the village volunteer will get to know her voting choice as a mobile alert, and issues a veiled threat that it will affect her pension if she fails to vote for the ruling party. Does this not amount to cheating the gullible voters?” she sought to know. The TDP has reiterated its oft-made accusation that the BJP and the YSRCP have formed an “unholy alliance,” albeit clandestinely, to eliminate the TDP from the political landscape. “Both have found us to be a hard nut to crack. Ours is a cadre-based party, which will certainly have an impact in the rural areas,” Ms. Lakshmi pointed out, before hopping into the campaign vehicle for a second spell of canvassing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/panabaka-lakshmi-certain-of-win-if-elections-are-free-and-fair/article34220338.ece

02 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||A step towards giving a boost to green mobility||To give a push to the concept of ‘Green Mobility for Clean Air’, zealously pursued by the government, the New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP), the State nodal agency for promotion of electric vehicles, has developed e-mobility, a single window mobile application for sanctioning and monitoring of electric two-wheelers in the State. Of the different categories of electric vehicles, the corporation is currently focussed on two-wheelers with an objective to phase out the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2024 in four major cities and in all cities by 2030. Air pollution “Emissions from ICE-powered motor vehicles are responsible for about two-thirds of air pollution in the urban areas. To phase out the older, inefficient and polluting vehicles and, in turn, promote the use of environment-friendly vehicles, the Centre has also announced a vehicle scrappage policy in the recent Union Budget. Among the ICE vehicles, two-wheelers comprise about 79% of the total number of vehicles,” says S. Ramana Reddy, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director, NREDCAP. To prove the advantages of using the eco-friendly mode of transport and popularise e-mobility, the corporation intends to promote 1 lakh electric two-wheelers among the government employees (especially, the village and ward secretariat employees) over a period of one year, and based on the demand, increase the number further. Zero down payment The NREDCAP will provide support up to three years for battery, Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) and insurance, assures Mr. Reddy, explaining that the cost of average fuel charges of a two-wheeler that runs on petrol is more compared to the EMI plus power charges of an electric two-wheeler, besides the additional advantage of environment and health benefits. Under the scheme launched by the corporation exclusively for the government employees, the buyer will be spared the burden of down payment. “With zero down payment, the buyer can take home the electric two-wheeler and pay the vehicle cost in 36-60 equated monthly instalments of Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000 (including AMC and insurance for three years), and operate the vehicle in the range of 80 km per single charge at a speed of 50 kmph,” says Mr. Reddy. Explaining about the mobile application, he says the buyer will be intimated through an SMS about the approval and virtual ID. He will also be directed to approach the Drawing and Disbursing Officer (DDO) for payment of the first instalment. The DDO will update the database of the buyer’s willingness to deduct the EMI from the salary and make the payment of the instalment. The DDO will also update the Unique Transaction Reference (UTR) number and the buyer’s details in the portal, along with the virtual ID, and the banker will verify the amount received through the UTR number / Virtual ID.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-step-towards-giving-a-boost-to-green-mobility/article34220334.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy to mount pressure on the Union Government to accord Special Category Status (SCS) for Andhra Pradesh as per the promise made in the A.P. Reorganisation Act, 2014. In a statement, Mr. Lokesh wondered how could SCS be a closed chapter when the BJP promised Special UT status to Puducherry in its election manifesto. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy should make genuine efforts to ensure justice for the people of the State. “In the run-up to the 2019 election, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had vowed to achieve SCS. But after coming to power, he remained silent. He has not been showing any commitment on developing industries and creating jobs for youth,” Mr. Lokesh alleged. “Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy will not be able to continue his secret journey with the BJP any longer.

02 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Man, son nabbed in Polamamba theft case||The city police on Thursday arrested a father-son duo on the charge of stealing gold and silver ornaments and cash from the Karakachettu Polamamba temple, on March 20. The accused were identified as P. Umesh (43) and P. Dhiraj (19). Another son of Umesh, a 16-year-old, was also taken into custody by the police for his involvement in the crime. All three hail from Chittoor district and are presently residents of Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu. Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Commissioner of Police Manish Kumar Sinha said that the police received information on March 21 that unidentified miscreants had gained entry into the temple and fled with valuables. Painstaking probe The accused also decamped with the video storage devices to erase evidence of the crime. Police formed five teams to investigate the case. According to the Commissioner, when the CLUES team inspected the spot, they collected evidence of footprints, fingerprints, cables and a sharp object, which was used to break something during the theft. “We suspected that the equipment might have been purchased in the city. Taking that as a clue, we enquired about it at all the hardware stores in the city,” said Mr. Manish Kumar. “On March 22, we were able to ascertain that a shop at Poorna Market had sold the equipment to the trio. Fortunately, the shop was equipped with CCTV cameras, and we obtained footage of the trio buying the equipment from the shop,” the Commissioner said. “CCTV footage from the shop enabled us to correlate with the footage from CCTVs intalled at various locations in the city, and we could see them boarding an auto-rickshaw to reach the shop. As the number plate of the auto-rickshaw was not clearly visible, we zeroed in on the driver through a painstaking physical check.” “The auto-rickshaw driver, a 60-year old man, informed us that the accused persons boarded his vehicle on KGH road. After checking the hotels and lodges in the vicinity, we learnt that they stayed in a lodge near Jagadamba Junction. When we checked the lodge register, more clues were unearthed,” the CP said. How the theft was planned Mr. Manish Kumar told reporters that Umesh sells garments on the beach in Kanyakumari, while Dhiraj works as a cook in Tirupati. Dhiraj slowly became acquainted with drug peddlers and planned to smuggle ganja from Visakhapatnam district. On February 26, 2021, he was arrested by the Payakaraopeta police while trying to smuggle the contraband. On March 16, Umesh and his younger son had come to Visakhapatnam to consult a lawyer for getting Dhiraj released on bail. The duo stayed at a lodge near Jagadamba and in the meantime, they visited Karakachettu Polamamba temple. Umesh then conducted a recce of the temple and planned the theft. On March 19, Dhiraj got bail and on March 20, the trio vacated the lodge. On the same night, the accused committed the theft at the temple and fled the city. Acting on a tip-off, the police nabbed the accused from an undisclosed location. The police recovered 248 grams of gold and silver ornaments and some cash from them. Police also found that the accused had buried the video devices at an isolated place about 300 to 400 metres from the temple. “In the course of the investigation, we found out that the accused had committed several thefts in Kanyakumari during the lockdown, but was caught only for the first crime,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/man-son-nabbed-in-polamamba-theft-case/article34220477.ece
02 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||GVMC’s first Council meeting expected to be a stormy affair||The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation’s first Council meeting after a gap of over nine years is expected to be a stormy affair, with opposition parties looking to take aim at the ruling party on a number of issues. While the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) enjoys an absolute majority with 60 wards, including two independents, the opposition, led by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) with 32 wards, including two independents, and joined by the Jana Sena Party (JSP) with three wards and the Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with one ward each, will prove to be a formidable opponent on several issues. “The first thing that is going to hit the floor will be the issue of privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. We will urge the Council to pass a resolution against the move and send it to the Union Government. I am sure the TDP will support us,” said B. Gangarao of the CPI(M), who was elected from Ward 78. This apart, the proposed hike in property tax will also gain centre-stage as the entire opposition is staunchly against the move. “The move to calculate property tax based on the market value of the property will increase the tax slab abnormally, and will hurt the middle-class. Moreover, the hike cannot be implemented without the consent of the Council,” said Mr. Gangarao. “It has to be discussed in the Council only after which it can be implemented. Otherwise, if the State government takes decisions, what is the use of the Council?” said Vanapalli Ravi Kumar, who won from Ward 31 on a TDP ticket. The Government Order on property tax should be rescinded with immediate effect, Mr. Gangarao added. Scrutiny of Smart City works The Left parties and the TDP are also gearing up to question the GVMC over the bad condition of the roads. “The roads across the city are in a very bad condition, and no repairs have been taken up in the last two years. The GVMC has received close to Rs. 1,600 crore under the Smart City project, and we would ask for an audit and status report,” said A.J. Stalin of CPI, who won from Ward 72. “We do not understand why the width of the road near Pandurangapuram has been reduced to accommodate a wider sidewalk under the Smart City project. What is the logic behind it?” questioned Mr. Stalin. “Both financial and physical reviews of Smart City works is necessary, as we feel that work has been taken up where it was not needed, such as widening the pavement on the Rushikonda beach road,” said Mr. Ravi Kumar. Works to be reviewed A few years ago, about Rs. 120 crore was spent on constructing an all-utility duct with funding from ADB. But till date, the duct has been left unused and funds have been wasted. The funds could have been diverted for more utility work such as slum development, said another TDP corporator. The opposition is gearing up to pressure the ruling party to go for a review of all the works that have been taken up in the last nine years. “Till date, there has been no audit on the works done during IFR (International Fleet Review). The amount owed to contractors is over Rs. 400 crore, and they have not received payments for two years. We will raise these issues,” said Mr. Ravi Kumar. Underground cabling works have damaged the roads and restoration works are lagging behind. Though there is a duct in Arilova health city area, still trenches are dug for cabling. What was the rationale behind spending money to construct a duct,” said Mr. Ganga Rao. These apart, sanitation issue, COVID preparedness and other issues are likely to come up for discussion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gvmcs-first-council-meeting-expected-to-be-a-stormy-affair/article34219664.ece

02 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||ITDA to impose ban on plastic in Visakha Agency from mid-April||The Integrated Tribal Development Authority (ITDA) has announced a ban on the use of single-use plastic in Visakhapatnam Agency from mid-April. From April first week, the ITDA will conduct coordination meets for a week or 10 days with the sarpanches, panchayat secretaries, Village Revenue Officers (VROs) and the tourism agencies in the Agency areas and discuss how to implement the action plan at the ground level. After the meets, the officials will start enforcing the ban. In 2019, the ITDA has announced a ban on use of single-use plastic in Araku mandal, which receives a major share of tourists. Despite creating awareness, the plan had failed to yield the desired results owing to the busy election schedule and other reasons. This time, the ITDA officials have planned to enforce the ban in all the 11 mandals of the Agency. “There are 244 panchayats in the 11 mandals of the Agency. We expect all the sarpanches will put of their effort to combat the plastic menace. We will take inputs from the sarpanches, VROs, panchayat officials before implementing the action plan,” said ITDA Project Officer S. Venkateswar. Penalty proposed The plan is to stop the sale and use of plastic sachets, bottles, and other forms of plastic in the Agency, for which the ITDA will hold talks with commercial establishments, tourism agencies, small-scale businessmen. Alternate arrangements such as paper bags with the support of NGOs is also being planned. Another area of focus is the weekly-shandies where the ban needs to be strictly enforced, he said. After creating awareness on plastic ban, the officials propose to collect fines up to Rs. 10,000 from the violators. Garbage disposal The officials have planned to procure garbage bins in two colours for wet and dry waste for villages. Having bins in every 50 metres will go a long way to prevent littering. “Plans are afoot to procure garbage bins with the 15th Finance Commission grants. The estimates are being prepared. Once the MPTC, ZPTC elections are over, the ITDA will call for tenders. In the further stages, the waste will be disposed of using solid waste management (SWM) techniques,” said the ITDA PO. The ITDA is also planning to put up caution boards at tourist spots against littering and use of plastic. The sarpanches can take up initiatives in their villages in this regard. “If needed, we may impose fines on the tourists for littering and using plastic,” Mr. Venkateswar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/itda-to-impose-ban-on-plastic-in-visakha-agency-from-mid-april/article34220347.ece

The raids were conducted on Wednesday not only in Visakhapatnam but also elsewhere in the State and in Telangana. In the city, the NIA raided the house of V.S. Krishna, A.P. and TS coordinator of HRF; Padma of the Committee for Release of Political Prisoners (CRPC); Chalam of the All People’s Lawyer Association, and Sreeramurthy and Balakrishna of the APCLC. The NIA had also asked Mr. Krishna and Mr. Chalam to present themselves before the investigating officer at its camp office on Thursday. Speaking to The Hindu , Ms. Lakshmi of the POW said the raids were conducted till 2.30 a.m., causing harassment to the family members. “It is learnt that the NIA officers could not find anything incriminating, except for some fact-finding material of the alleged fake encounters in the LWE-affected regions. Computers, hard disks and cell phones have been seized,” she said. “The raids are illegal and are based on a confession of an accused,” the activists argued. The Munchingput police in the district had arrested Pangi Naganna on November 23, 2020, and reportedly seized from his possession Maoist literature, press notes, wire bundles and other incriminating material. During interrogation, Naganna had reportedly confessed that he was a Maoist sympathiser and had been operating as their informer. He had reportedly named 64 persons who had connections with the banned outfit. The NIA had taken over the case on March 5 this year, and the raids were part of the investigation. “It is only to stifle the voice of dissent. The rights groups have been raising their voice against the misdoings of the Union government, which included the farm Acts, NRC and CAA,” she said. ‘High Court order’ “When the rights organisations took up the case, the A.P. High Court had passed an interim order to stop investigation and further action. The NIA raids are, therefore, illegal,” said Ms. Lakshmi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/munchingput-case-rights-groups-term-nia-raids-illegal/article34220335.ece

The book is titled ‘Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education’. “April 1 is a historic day in the education movement in the country. It was on this day, in 2009, that the right to free and compulsory education, or the Right to Education Act, 2009, came into force,” said Prof. Murthy. “The RTE Act ensured free and compulsory education to all children between the ages of 6 and 14. Despite given repeated timelines, the implementation of the RTE Act has remained unsatisfactory. Only 12.7 % schools are learnt to be complying with the provisions of the Act. The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent closure of schools for almost a year may result in increased dropout rate, child labour and trafficking, affecting the school education scenario,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/book-on-right-to-education-released/article34220473.ece

02 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC directs VMRDA to restore possession to Fusion Foods||The Andhra Pradesh High Court has directed the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Development Authority (VMRDA) to restore possession of the building at the Gurajada Kalakshetram Open Air theatre premises to ‘Fusion Foods’ within seven days, and also imposed exemplary costs of Rs. 25,000 for evicting the ‘license holder’ without following due procedures. The single-judge bench comprising Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu issued the orders on Wednesday. It may be recalled that in the early hours of November 15, 2020, VMRDA had evicted Fusion Foods from the premises, based on a ‘vacation notice’, which was supposedly served on November 14. As per the notice, the licence of Fusion Foods was extended for nine years in 2015 by the erstwhile Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA), without conducting an auction, causing major financial loss to the authority. As per G.O. MS 56, the renewal of lease beyond three years shall only be with prior sanction of the government. As irregularities were observed in the extension of lease, the premises has to be vacated and handed over, the notice said. Questioning the manner and method in which they were dispossessed, Fusion Foods filed a writ petition in the High Court. Admitting the writ petition, the court observed that the G.O., relied on in the vacation notice, pertains to lease and was not applicable to Fusion Foods as VMRDA had entered into a license agreement and not a lease agreement with it.  The court observed that use of police force, without any prior resistance or obstruction, was uncalled for, particularly by a State instrumentality. Eviction should not be resorted to early in the morning or late at night, unless there was a grave pressing emergency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-directs-vmrda-to-restore-possession-to-fusion-foods/article34220474.ece

Addressing reporters during a press conference in the city on Thursday, Mr. Manish Kumar said that the police had launched a drive on February 14 asking commercial establishments to install CCTV cameras. However, the police soon became busy with the panchayat as well as Urban Local Body (ULB) elections. “It is very important to have CCTV cameras in all localities, commercial establishments, shops and residential colonies as they would help in crime prevention.

02 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||City losing battle against garbage||Hyderabad is losing its battle against garbage. The city is stinking and sinking in trash as the garbage keeps piling every higher. A change of strategy to clean up the trash is not helping as the size of the roadside and street corner mounds keeps growing every day. The intense heat of summer is not helping matters as the rotting organic matter is making passers-by squirm and pinch their masked nose. For Ravi and his team of sanitary workers with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation the day begins at the crack of dawn when they take their lumbering 10-tonne tipper through Nalanda Colony to pick up trash. “Earlier, we had garbage bins that would overflow. Now people are dumping the trash in the open areas and we lift it up. We are making four to five trips a day to clean up this area,” says Ravi who supervises his team of four sanitary workers. The removal of garbage bins has turned vast areas into dumping grounds. A short drive through the city between Rambagh and Charminar via Kalapather shows a dozen dump sites. And it is not limited one area or part of the city. Sri Ram Nagar Colony First Lancer, Alijah Kotla, Sitaram Bagh, Vijayanagar Colony, P&T Colony, Mehdiptnam, Attapur and Shahalibanda; name any area and there are garbage dumps. No open space is being spared. The land adjacent to Murali Manohar Temple, the Dargah near Falaknuma Road, graveyard near Petla Burj, school near Kishanbagh, Owaisi Vegetable Market and other open spaces have become dump yards. “@KTRTRS Hi Sir hope you are doing well. I stay in old city of Hyderabad and I see that garbage containers have been removed and because of that we are seeing influx of mosquitoes in all areas. Is it intentionally done for some new project. Please consider the impact,” tweeted Praveen Thakur to raise the issue. Another citizen tweeted: “GHMC trying to convert #Hyderabad bin free city or Garbage City?” While tagging municipal administration minister, GHMC officials and the mayor. The removal of garbage bins has made the turned the transport of trash into a more inhumane operation as the sanitary workers have to manually handle the waste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/city-losing-battle-against-garbage/article34220227.ece
02 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||GHMC’s coffers ring louder||GHMC has surpassed all its previous records in property tax collections, even while falling short of the designated target for the last financial year 2020-21, that ended on March 31, Wednesday. One-time settlement As on the last day of the year, the total collection of property tax stood at Rs. 1,701.29 crore, which is close to Rs. 230 crore more than the previous year’s collection of Rs. 1,472.31 crore. Of the total, Rs. 399 crore was garnered through the One Time Settlement scheme (OTS) declared by the State government. OTS gave an opportunity for the property tax defaulters to pay the dues with 90% waiver on penal interest. Khairatabad zone has topped the charts with close to Rs. 492 crore collections, followed by Serilingampally zone at over Rs. 290 crore. Kukatpally zone stood third with around Rs. 286 crore, while Secunderabad zone collected a total Rs. 260 crore, L.B.Nagar zone, Rs. 247 crore and Charminar zone, Rs. 127 crore, a statement from GHMC informed. Among circles, Jubilee Hills topped the list with Rs. 181 crore collection, followed by Serilingampally at Rs. 172 crore. Khairatabad circle stood next with a collection of close to Rs. 156 crore. Lowest collection was from Chandrayangutta circle at Rs. 9.3 crore. The number of assessees too has seen an increase when compared with last year, despite the slowdown of the construction industry owing to the impact of the pandemic. As against 10.5 lakh assessees, during the current year, 12.2 lakh property owners have paid the tax, the statement informed. However, despite the OTS scheme, GHMC has failed to achieve its targeted collection of Rs. 1,900 crore, which was a Rs. 100 crore more than last year’s target.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ghmcs-coffers-ring-louder/article34220228.ece

02 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC takes serious note of delay in releasing seized vehicle||The Telangana High Court on Thursday wanted to know why the in-charge Deputy Commissioner of Prohibition and Excise of Mahabubnagar, Syed Yasin Qureshi sat for nearly three months on a single judge order to release a vehicle. Taking serious exception to the action of Mr. Qureshi, who is also Joint Director of Breweries and Distilleries, the HC remarked that the officer released the vehicle only after contempt of court plea filed by the vehicle owner. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy rejected the repeated requests of Additional Advocate General J. Ramchander Rao to allow the appeal petition filed by the officer against the single judge order holding him guilty of contempt of court. On July 29 last year, Kollahpur P&E officials of Mahabubnagar district seized a Light Motor Vehicle illegally transporting black jaggery. The vehicle owner moved the HC challenging seizure of the vehicle. A single judge on August 24 last passed an order directing the authorities to release the vehicle, after taking an undertaking from the vehicle owner. Three days later, the vehicle owner approached the in-charge DC of P&E of Mahabubunagar but the latter declined to release the vehicle. The vehicle owner filed a contempt of court plea which came up for hearing before the division bench headed by the Chief Justice. Notices were issued to the officer to file counter affidavit. After receiving contempt of court notices, the officer sent a letter to the vehicle owner to furnish an undertaking as directed by the court to secure the vehicle. “Was the officer twiddling his thumbs after the single judge passed the order?” the CJ asked the AAG. The AAG informed the court that the officer ultimately released the vehicle on January 15 this year in compliance with the single judge order. Perusing the file, the Justice Hima Kohli found that the vehicle owner presented the undertaking after the release of the vehicle. “So the officer released the vehicle feeling the heat of the contempt of court petition filed by the vehicle owner,” the CJ observed. The bench also sought to know why Mr. Qureshi insisted on furnishing of two sureties even after the single judge directed him to release the vehicle on receipt of an undertaking. “Who are you to decide to furnish two sureties? Is the officer above the law? How did he put the conditions?”, the CJ asked. The matter was posted after two weeks for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-takes-serious-note-of-delay-in-releasing-seized-vehicle/article34220234.ece
02 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Cong. seeks disqualification of Tandur legislator||Telangana Congress has sought disqualification of Tandur MLA P. Rohit Reddy for submitting ‘fake’ documents of his educational qualifications. A delegation of the Congress led by former Minister Marri Shashidhar Reddy, former MLA T. Rammohan Reddy and senior leaders Niranjan and Ramesh met Chief Electoral Officer Shashank Goel and submitted a memorandum seeking the MLA’s disqualification. Later, speaking to reporters, Mr. Shashidhar Reddy said that Rohit Reddy is not a graduate but enrolled himself for the Graduate MLC elections and voted. As his certificates are not valid, he should be disqualified for submitting ‘fake’ documents, he demanded. The former Minister said that Rohit Reddy had given a wrong document stating that he had done his degree course from Sweden while his website says he had done his B.Tech and later MS from the USA as well. He said he had a doubt whether Rohit Reddy was involved in any fake certificates racket. Mr. Ram Mohan Reddy said the degrees being claimed by Rohit Reddy are not valid in India and no Indian agency has given any equivalent certificate for them. He should be immediately disqualified, he said and urged the CEO to conduct an enquiry as it is a serious case of violation of the Constitution. He alleged that cheating has become a habit of the Tandur MLA. He said the party would also meet the Governor soon with its complaint and also the Election Commission of India seeking an enquiry.

02 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||IICT, Cipla Foundation distribute one lakh cloth masks||The Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) and Cipla Foundation (CF) distributed one lakh cloth face masks free in 27 districts, including villages, government schools, orphanages, old age homes, market yards and a couple of hospitals, in the last six months since August last year. This was announced on Thursday. The four-layered ‘SaanS’ mask, designed by senior principal scientist S. Sridhar and his membrane team of PETT (Process Engineering and Technology Transfed department), is affordable that provides comprehensive repulsion of respiratory droplets through hydrophobic nature, electrostatic repulsion, tight porosity, and a strenuous non-linear flow path with high breathability and comfort. The mask is certified by ‘SITRA’, Coimbatore (South India Textile Research Association) for > 95% bacterial filtration efficiency, splash resistance and can undergo at least 30 washes for re-use up to three months. The scientifically-designed mask was launched as a joint initiative last year by IICT director S. Chandrasekhar in the presence of CSIR DG Shekhar Mande.

Shailaja.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/iict-cipla-foundation-distribute-1-lakh-cloth-masks/article34219788.ece
02 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Containerised movement of cement launched||Container Corporation of India (CONCOR), in association with SCR’s Secunderabad division, has started the first rake of ‘door-to-door containerised’ movement of cement on Wednesday. The Rs. 20-lakh first rake that started from Jaggayyapet station to Shalimar, Kolkata in West Bengal has been flagged off on Thursday by Divisional Railway Manger A.K. Gupta through virtual mode. CONCOR has come up with a solution of not only picking up the commodities directly from the factory to the railway station, but also of delivering the same to the end customers including bulk consumers, dealers, etc. The benefits of this new initiative include one-stop transport solution to the supplier as well as customer and reduction of any en route pilferages/damages. Establishment of a container handling terminal at a place like Jaggayyapet will give fillip to the industry, especially the cement industry, enabling them to avail the benefits, said GM Gajanan Mallya in a press release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/containerised-movement-of-cement-launched/article34220223.ece
02 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||South Korean textile major to start operations in Warangal||South Korea's textile major Youngone will start its operations within six months at Kakatiya Mega Textile Park in Warangal, providing employment opportunities to 12,000 people in the region. In a video conference with IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao and Panchayat Raj Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao here on Thursday, Youngone Chairman and CEO Ki-Hak Sung reiterated their plan of making five of their factories functional in next six months and taking up another three later in Phase-II. Mr. Ki-Hak Sung told KTR that "Made in Telangana" textiles would be rolled out from Warangal’s Kakatiya Mega Textile Park across the world. Though the factories were to be operational by early 2021, the COVID19 pandemic delayed the completion of the works, said Mr. Sung, adding that the company would run its operations from Warangal, making it their base for operations in India. Mr. Ki-Hak Sung appreciated KTR for providing complete assistance from the day of the announcement of the company at Warangal’s Kakatiya Mega Textile Park. During the video conference, KTR stated that the Youngone Corporation operating from Warangal should be seen as a milestone in the Indian Textile industry. He also added that more Korean companies were looking forward to investing in KMTP after Youngone Corp. Mr. Dayakar Rao appealed to KTR to provide skill development programmes for youth of Warangal which would make them industry-ready and secure jobs at the factories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/south-korean-textile-major-to-start-operations-in-warangal/article34220376.ece
02 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CAG faults non-implementation of e-HMS project||Claims of the State government on creating health profile of all people across the State notwithstanding, the State has not fully implemented the e-health management systems (e-HMS) project even in the three hospitals where it was launched on pilot basis five years ago. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India which highlighted the issue in its latest report said certain modules of e-HMS lacked validation controls and accepted incorrect data input. The inability/reluctance of hospital staff to capture real time data coupled with simultaneous continuance of manual processes defeated the envisaged objective of e-HMS. “Though the project has been live since May 2016, the problems have not been resolved. The State wide roll out of the system has also not been implemented,” the CAG report said. The project was aimed at addressing core areas in public health care facilities and it envisaged creation of unique Electronic Medical Record for each patient. The EMR was supposed to function as a central source of information covering the patient’s profile, history of family, clinical diagnosis, disease, treatment and investigation details among others. It was aimed at enabling easy access of medical information any time, anywhere. Other core functions of EMR was expected to address include tracking medical history during subsequent visits to hospitals and navigation between referred departments, elimination of duplication in data entry and maintenance of duplicate register and transmission of the EMR to referred hospitals. The State Medical Infrastructure Development Corporation procured hardware and network equipment through the TS Technology Services for implementation of the pilot project while the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) customised its hospital information system (e-Susruth) to the requirements of the State. The pilot project went live between October 2015 and May 2016. “In spite of 22.47 lakh registrations in OPD in the three hospitals - Gandhi Hospital, Secunderabad, Area Hospital, Malakpet, and District Hospital, King Koti, Malakpet - 1.51 lakh inpatient records and 0.38 lakh case sheets, audit observed that EMR report was generated only in respect of one patient at Area Hospital, Malakpet. Clearly, the EMR Module was not utilised for the purpose for which it was created,” the CAG said. Referring to the user management module which controls access to the application and its related area, the CAG said the system administrator would create user access and rights according to his/her role. CDAC completed training to 1,172 users (staff at different levels) of pilot hospitals during 2015-18. However, it was observed that 144 (12%) users, especially doctors and nurses, had not logged into e-HMS even once since the creation of their user ID. Further, 229 (20%) users accessed e-HMS only once since the creation of their user ID while information relating to designation of 744 users was not available in the master table. Audit therefore could not verify their identity and role in the hospital. The CAG said hospital superintendents attributed the non-utilisation of modules to lack of adequate human resources and that under the present heavy patient load, the users require separate data entry operators for utilisation of e-HMS. Although the issue of non-availability of sufficient data entry operators was represented by the respective hospitals to TSMSIDC, they were not provided with sufficient staff for effective operation of various modules of e-HMS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cag-faults-non-implementation-of-e-hms-even-in-pilot-hospitals/article34220235.ece
02 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HMR to reinforce COVID-19 protocols||Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) and L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad (L&TMRH) have said deployment of trained marshals and security guards is being ramped up to reinforce awareness among passengers about the importance of social distancing and the face mask in view of the rising number of COVID positive cases in twin cities on Thursday. Passengers have been requested to strictly adhere to these safety guidelines and any violations would attract appropriate fine. Mandatory thermal scareening of every passenger is done at each entry security point by the security personnel. Hand sanitizers are available at each entry security point for passengers to sanitize their hands before entering the metro station. These sanitizers are regularly replenished all through the day, said L&TMRH MD & CEO K.V.B Reddy. “Recent surge in COVID cases across the country has put us all on a high alert. We are seeking passengers’ cooperation as the guidelines are for their safety and also for their co-passengers and metro staff,” he pointed out. No passenger is being allowed without wearing a mask and apart from the regular COVID-related safety announcements, each metro train carries stickers on alternate seats and on the floor for passengers to follow social distancing. Sanitization is among the top priorities for the 55 daily metro trains which run through three corridors connecting 57 metro stations. Each metro train is sanitized before start of every ride. Designated station staff members sanitise passenger touch points including escalators, and lifts, among others, at every station with a frequency of 2-3 hours, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hmr-to-reinforce-covid-protocol/article34220222.ece

Importantly, 612 track km of this have been electrified in the new sections, while around 64 track kms of double lines and 69 track kms of third lines have also been electrified. This achievement is particularly remarkable as the works were carried across the zone, inspite of the COVID-19 pandemic, said General Manager Gajanan Mallya. Pace maintained The pace of electrification continued right up to the last week of the financial year with the electrification works being carried out for 182 track kms across the three states in SCR — Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra. While, Umdanagar–Falaknuma and Vikarabad–Kohir sections were electrified in Telanagana during this period, Tenali–Repalle and Kavali–Ulawapadu (third line) sections were electrified in Andhra Pradesh and Akola–Lohad sections were electrified in Maharashtra. Sections electrified in Telangana are Lingampet Jagityal–Mortad — 50.50 km, Vikarabad–Kohir — 44.82 km, Medchal–Manoharabad — 13.08 km, Falaknuma–Umdanagar — 13.69 km, Raghavapuram–Kolanur — 30 km, Kolanur–Potakapalli — 12 km Timely completion Mr. Mallya complimented the proactive involvement of railway officials and coordination with the electrification authorities. He stressed on timely completion of pre-electrification works and advance planning of schedule for traffic blocks to carry forward this momentum in this financial year too. Meticulous planning and duly taking all the COVID related precautions helped in doing the mammoth task, which will help the SCR in providing seamless movement of trains by avoiding change in traction power, reduced enroute detention of both coaching and freight trains, improves average speed of the trains, provides environment-friendly means of powering the trains, while saving fuel costs at the same time, said Chief Public Relations Officer Ch.Rakesh in a press release on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scr-electrified-750-km-track-despite-covid-restrictions/article34220244.ece

02 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Awareness drive on vaccination for dialysis patients||NephroPlus, the dialysis care network, is organising a national education drive on COVID vaccination for dialysis patients across their centres. Dispel myths The aim of the initiative is to dispel certain myths associated with taking the vaccine and encourage them by addressing their concerns on the safety and efficacy of vaccine. High risk Dialysis patients are at a very high risk of getting COVID-hit, as they have very low immunity compared to healthy individuals. The international journal, ‘Kidney International Reports’, had said that COVID-19 prevalence among dialysis patients is about 20 times higher than healthy population. Around 99% of patients admitted to hospital had to stay for a minimum of 12 days with mortality amongst those infected about 23%, and mortality among those > 55 years of age three times higher than those <30 years old. Matter of concern “Increasing cases are a matter of concern. Dialysis patients are highly immune-compromised and so they have to visit a dialysis centre three times a week, and therefore are at a high risk of contracting coronavirus. So, we really need to work hard to get most of them vaccinated as soon as possible,” said founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Vikram Vuppala and co-founder Kamal D. Shah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/vaccination-awareness-drive-for-dialysis-patients/article34220219.ece

02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,TELANGANA||CBI nabs MP Kavitha Maloth’s driver in Delhi||The Central Bureau of Investigation has arrested three persons for allegedly demanding bribe from a Delhi resident for not getting an under-construction building demolished. One of the accused worked as a driver of Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) MP Kavitha Maloth. The complainant, Manmeet Singh Lamba, had been asked to deliver the bribe amount of Rs. 1 lakh in Saraswati Apartment complex on B.D. Marg, according to the First Information Report (FIR). The accused have been identified as Rajib Bhattacharya, Shubhangi Gupta and Durgesh Kumar, who worked as the MP's driver. Ms. Maloth told The Hindu that she had hired Durgesh as a driver about six months ago through a reference, but she did not know the other two persons. She said that she had not hired any personal assistant in Delhi since she was elected as a parliamentarian in 2019. She was in Telangana when the purported incident took place close to her official residence in Delhi. In his complaint, Manmeet alleged that he first got a call from Rajib, who introduced himself as a personal assistant to the MP from Telangana. Stating that there were several complaints about the construction being carried out by him in Delhi's Sardar Nagar, Rajib said he knew the Municipal Corporation of Delhi official concerned and that he would help him save his house from demolition. The accused told Manmeet to contact Shubhangi, purportedly the MP's coordinator, and also threatened to get his house demolished if he did not settle the matter. It is alleged that Shubhangi demanded Rs. 5 lakh and then scaled down the amount to Rs. 1 lakh after negotiation. She allegedly introduced the complainant to Durgesh, claiming that he was the MP's personal assistant. As alleged in the FIR, Durgesh pressured Manmeet to get the matter settled at the earliest. Subsequently, the complainant was asked to deliver the bribe amount in Saraswati Apartment complex, alleges the FIR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cbi-nabs-mp-kavitha-maloths-driver-in-delhi/article34220242.ece

02 April 2021||GURUGRAM,||MCG plans pedestrianisation trial again in Sadar Bazar||Encouraged by the visitors’ response to the week-long pedestrianisation plan trial for Sadar Bazar here in a bid to decongest the market, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram has decided to hold another trial for a fortnight from Thursday. Additional Municipal Commissioner Jaspreet Kaur, also Nodal Officer for the programme, said the response from the visitors was encouraging and therefore, it was decided to hold another trial till April 15. Behavioural change On the shopkeepers’ objection to mark 700-metre-long stretch only for pedestrians, Ms. Kaur said the customers were allowed to ride only two-wheelers on the stretch. “The aim is not to impose the plan on the shopkeepers and the customers, but to bring about a behavioural change. But the relaxation is only for customers. The shopkeepers need to park their vehicles at the designated parking spaces. We eventually plan to make this stretch vehicle-free,” said Ms. Kaur. She added that the MCG would have zero tolerance for any encroachment on the stretch. The shopkeepers had downed the shutters on the first day of the MCG’s first phase of trial on March 20. They feared that the customers would be inconvenienced inside the market and that would affect their sales. Multilevel parking Sadar Bazar Vyapar Mandal president Bablu Gupta suggested that the civic body should wait for the multilevel parking lots to be constructed before stopping the vehicles’ entry to the market. “There is not enough space for customers to park their vehicles. If they are stopped from bringing their vehicles to the market, they won’t come,” he said. World Resources Institute India manager, Priyanka Sulkhlan, argued that there was no dearth of parking space and seven lots were identified with a capacity of 1,500-odd two-wheelers and 200 four-wheelers. She added that the vehicles carrying goods were also allowed to enter the market during specific hours. Besides the 700-m stretch proposed only for pedestrians, two-wheelers and four-wheelers are allowed in the rest of the market which is spread across 20 hectare. Sarika Panda Bhatt, founder trustee of Raahgiri Foundation, said that the plan was aimed to decongest Sadar Bazar on the lines of Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh. She added that the MCG was also open to the idea of allowing a fixed number of e-rickshaws on the stretch. Both, the WRI and Raahgiri Foundation are knowledge partners in the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mcg-plans-pedestrianisation-trial-again-in-sadar-bazar/article34219844.ece
02 April 2021||JAIPUR,||Gehlot accuses Centre of financially weakening States||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday accused the BJP government at the Centre of making the States “financially weaker” by reducing its share in the Centrally sponsored schemes and taking policy measures which had led to a significant reduction in the States’ share from the divisible pool. Mr. Gehlot extended support to West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, who has written a letter to all Opposition parties and raised the issue of the Centre stopping the devolution of funds to the States as well as the violation of constitutional and democratic norms. Mr. Gehlot said he had raised similar issue of “step-motherly treatment” from the Centre in the State Assembly.  ‘Double speak’ “On the one hand, the Prime Minister talks about cooperative federalism, and on the other hand the States are being made financially weak... The States are not even getting their full share in the Goods and Services Tax,” Mr. Gehlot tweeted. The Chief Minister said the Union government had imposed cess on diesel and petrol and was constantly reducing basic excise duty, while the special excise duty and additional excise duty was being increased. Because of this, the share of States from the divisible pool had significantly reduced, he said. Providing details of the devolution of funds, divisible pool and changes in the sharing pattern of Centrally sponsored schemes, Mr. Gehlot said the actual share of States had come down from 41% to 34%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gehlot-accuses-centre-of-financially-weakening-states/article34220204.ece
02 April 2021||JAIPUR,||Raje among BJP’s star campaigners in Rajasthan||Former Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has found a place in the list of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) star campaigners for the upcoming by-elections for three Assembly seats amid speculations over a rift in the party’s State unit. Ms. Raje’s supporters have been demanding that she be projected as the Chief Ministerial face in the 2023 Assembly polls. Ms. Raje was conspicuous by her absence in rallies and public meetings organised to mark the filing of nominations by the BJP candidates in Sujangarh, Sahara and Rajsamand on Tuesday. She was also missing from all the party’s posters in the three constituencies where the polling will be held on April 17. While the BJP has maintained that the former CM’s name has been added on fifth position in the list as a due respect for her seniority, party insiders said here on Thursday that it was still uncertain if she would join the poll campaign. Ms. Raje’s absence in Rajsamand was especially surprising as the party has fielded Deepti Maheshwari, daughter of the late Kiran Maheshwari, who was close to her and was a minister in her Cabinet. ‘Temple yatra’ Ms. Raje’s two-day “temple yatra” undertaken in the Bharatpur last month had depicted her strength within the BJP, with two dozen MPs and MLAs rallying behind her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/raje-among-bjps-star-campaigners-in-rajasthan/article34220206.ece
02 April 2021||Mumbai,||Congress to take stock of political situation||From the bomb scare incident outside the house of industrialist Mukesh Ambani to the alleged meeting between Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar, Congress ministers from the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi government are likely to review the current situation in Maharashtra. “We will be taking a stock of the State’s political situation and a report will be sent to the Central leadership of the party,” said one All India Congress Committee officer-bearer attached to the party’s State unit. Rising COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra have forced the State Congress to minimise the number of office-bearers called for the review meetings to be conducted over the next two days. Only Congress ministers have been called on Friday for a meeting to be chaired by the party’s State unit  in-charge, H.K. Patil. On Saturday, a meeting of the Mumbai Congress will be held. “Earlier, office-bearers from all districts would be invited along with ministers to review the party and government performance. However, the increasing COVID-19 cases have compelled us to reduce the number of participants,” the leader said. The meetings hold importance in the backdrop of the State Home Department facing allegations of misconduct and the alleged meeting between Mr. Pawar and Mr. Shah. “We are an ally in this government. An allegation against any department defames the government. We will be discussing the situation and our observations will be sent to the Central leadership,” a minister who did not wish to be named said. When asked why the Congress had no reaction to the meeting between the two leaders, the minister said, “None of the leaders are from our party. Why should we be concerned about this?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/congress-to-take-stock-of-political-situation/article34219859.ece
02 April 2021||Mumbai,||Yes Bank fraud: ED files chargesheet against Omkar Realtors chairman, MD||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) against chairman of Omkar Realtors and Developers Kamal Kishore Gupta, managing director Babulal Varma, actor and producer Sachin Joshi, and others in the alleged Yes Bank loan fraud case of Rs. 410 crore. The chargesheet was filed before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court after an FIR was registered on March 7, 2020, in Aurangabad under Sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. On January 27, the Central agency arrested Mr. Varma and Mr. Gupta a day after conducting raids on 10 residential and official properties of Omkar Realtors and Developers. The ED had seized several incriminating documents and digital evidence. According to the ED, Omkar Realtors and Developers Private Limited and its directors bought a firm, Surana Construction, which had the Slum Rehabilitation Authority’s (SRA) rights for redevelopment of Anand Nagar SRA Cooperative Housing Society, Wadala. However, Omkar Group and its promoters did not pay dues to the seller, mortgaged future floor space index (FSI) of the project, and took huge amounts of loan. The agency said investigation revealed that Rs. 410 crore loans were diverted and not used for intended purposes. “No work of the SRA building was undertaken. The requisite rules and procedures under SRA were ignored and documents relating to names of slum dwellers were forged to claim more FSI for mortgaging it with banks for taking loans,” the ED said. Mr. Joshi was arrested on February 15, 2021, and explanations by him revealed that “funds were received by him and his companies from various companies of Omkar Group. Part of funds was shown as investment and part was shown as received against rendering of services. With respect to funds received as investment, Mr. Joshi said the same were towards development of land near Pune”, the ED claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/yes-bank-fraud-ed-files-chargesheet-against-omkar-realtors-chairman-md/article34219865.ece

02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||People over 45 flock to vaccine centres on Day 1 of new round||Several people, who didn’t fulfill the eligibility criteria for vaccinations earlier, reached the inoculation sites on the first day of the drive being extended for those above 45 years. The recipients welcomed the decision to extend the coverage to a broader category. They said apprehensions regarding the vaccine have gone down as many people have already been inoculated in the past few months. Vandana Sharma, a 51-year-old housewife, who visited a multispeciality hospital in Kalkaji, said: “I do not have any co-morbidity and hence I was unable to take the vaccine earlier. Even though I am above 50, I missed the criteria because of this particular issue. I had to wait till it got extended to other categories. In fact, I feel that now it should be extended to other categories as well, including children.” Several of those waiting in line had their family members vaccinated in the earlier phase. Neeta Hasija, a 55-year-old resident of Govindpuri, said: “While my husband got vaccinated earlier, I had to wait to be eligible as I missed the mark in the previous category. I am happy that it is being slowly extended to all age groups. The response to the vaccine has also been okay so far and hence, I am more confident of taking the jab now.” Many of those turning up at the vaccine centre without prior registration were, however, not permitted to take the vaccine. The extension of the category to be covered under the vaccination drive has also brought relief among many who missed the 60-year age mark, in the previous category. Champa Roy Barman, 59, said: “I couldn’t get vaccinated in the last phase because I missed the age eligibility by just one year. I cannot wait to get vaccinated. It will be a huge relief to get this done, otherwise, there is this constant fear of contracting the virus every time I step out or someone visits.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/people-over-45-flock-to-vaccine-centres-on-day-1-of-new-round/article34219858.ece

Justice Anu Malhotra also directed the police to submit a status report on the case by next date of hearing on April 8. The court’s order came on a plea by one Umair Siddiqui alleging that there has been a flagrant violation of Article 21 of the Constitution. Mr. Siddiqui contended that the police have illegally detained him and others and mercilessly beaten them. He said the entire incident that has taken place has been recorded in the two CCTV cameras installed at the Turkman Gate police post. The police, on the other hand, argued that the contentions raised on behalf of Mr. Siddiqui are erroneous and the matter in fact related to a dispute between a husband and wife and he is the cousin of the man.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/submit-report-on-plea-over-illegal-detention/article34219842.ece

02 April 2021||New Delhi,||AAP criticises BJP for ‘ruining’ city parks, latter cites NGT orders||The Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday attacked the BJP over the “bad” condition of parks in the city, and alleged that they are drying up despite Delhi government’s offer to provide water. AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said that under 14 years of BJP rule, the corporations have ruined the Capital’s parks. “The lack of irrigation is turning these parks into dry lands. This step is also distancing the people of Delhi from their 18,000 public parks,” the AAP leader said. “They want this increase in pollution to be attributed to the Kejriwal government. The Delhi Jal Board [DJB] had also prepared a proposal of Rs. 850 crore for laying down a pipeline from the STPs to the parks as a permanent solution for the civic bodies. The DJB even split the cost of the project among various agencies. The civic body refused not only to pay but also to comment on the proposal when it was sent by the DJB to it for review,” he said. In response, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that Mr. Bharadwaj has again played dirty politics on the parks borewell issue being removed on NGT’s guidelines. He has tried to portray as if the civic bodies are liable to make alternate arrangements for watering of parks while the truth is that as per the orders of NGT, including the latest order on March 26, the DJB is bound to provide free water for parks to civic bodies. He said that it is said that Mr. Bhardwaj has chosen to misread an order of a constitutional body and we will bring this to the notice of NGT Chairperson.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aap-criticises-bjp-for-ruining-city-parks-latter-cites-ngt-orders/article34219852.ece
02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Explain how contraband reaches prisoners: SC||The Supreme Court has directed the Tihar Jail authorities to explain how contraband reaches prisoners, including death row convicts, and sought detailed information on the CCTV coverage both inside and outside the prison walls. The order concerns an incident on March 14 when three condemned men were found in an intoxicated condition inside their cells. The officials said the authorities had to use force to bring them to their senses. However, one of the convicts showed the effects of brutality as he could barely walk. The jail authorities claim there was no CCTV footage of the incident or the medical treatment the men received after they were subdued. In fact, the Jail Superintendent informed a Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit that camera footage is stored only for four days before it is wiped clean. The court responded by ordering Raj Kumar, the Jail Superintendent, to file an affidavit by April “disclosing all the steps undertaken by him in connection with the incident that occurred on March 14”. “The affidavit shall disclose where exactly the CCTV cameras have been installed and whether the control room and the boundary wall of the jail are covered by CCTV cameras or not,” the court said in a recent order. The Bench said the Jail Superintendent should, in the affidavit, also disclose “under what circumstances, materials, such as, tobacco pouches or any other contraband/such things, find their way inside the jail premises...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/explain-how-contraband-reaches-prisoners-sc/article34219851.ece

The DPCC has sent a notice in which it has also directed the EDMC Commissioner to take immediate and necessary action for the prevention of fire at the Ghazipur site. The DPCC has also asked EDMC to ensure that such fire incidents do not occur in the future. “In DPCC’s notice, it is stated that EDMC has not only ignored the Environment Protection Act of 1986, but also violated the directions of the National Green Tribunal on the matters of solid waste management or garbage management,” an official statement read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dpcc-fines-edmc-rs-40l-over-fire-at-ghazipur-site/article34219853.ece

02 April 2021||Pune,||Pune Mayor rules out lockdown for now||Stating that there was no need for a lockdown in Pune at the moment, Pune Mayor and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Murlidhar Mohol on Thursday said that the city’s medical infrastructure was well-primed to cope with the increasing case surge. He said that the administration had aimed to inoculate a record one lakh people across the district on Thursday and that the focus was on further enhancing medical facilities and sample testing capacities. The city has been recording staggering spikes of more than 4,000 cases a day for the last fortnight, while Pune district (which includes Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune rural besides Pune city) has been witnessing an average 7,500 cases a day. Worst-affected district The district, which is the worst-hit in India, has now reported over 65,000 cases and nearly 10,000 deaths. “We do not need a lockdown. I think the city’s medical facilities have the wherewithal to cope with the dramatic case surges. The focus should be on enhanced sample testing, increased vaccination, and continuously improving and streamlining the medical infrastructure,” Mr. Mohol said. He said that currently Pune city witnessed a robust sample testing of 16,000 a day, while the capacity of the re-opened jumbo COVID-19 facilities had been ramped up from 400 to 500 beds. “Additionally, we are planning to add 5,000 more beds across all COVID-19 care centres. About 20-25% of these beds would be converted into oxygen beds to tackle critically ill patients,” Mr. Mohol said. Earlier, Baramati MP Supriya Sule had tweeted that the Pune administration had opened 174 vaccination centres to achieve its ambitious target of one lakh vaccinations and that the inoculation drive was progressing apace and in a satisfactory manner. Opposition to lockdown Meanwhile, Mr. Mohol’s fellow party member Pravin Darekar, the BJP’s Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council, reiterated his part’s stance of fierce opposition against the ruling Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government were a lockdown to be imposed over Maharashtra. “It appears that there is no coordination whatsoever between the three parties [Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress] over the decision to enforce a lockdown. The Chief Minister ought to have acted earlier to check the renewed surge in cases…the BJP will vehemently oppose any decision that affects ordinary citizens,” Mr. Darekar said. The BJP is seeking to exploit the alleged ‘differences’ between the tripartite MVA as the spectre of an imminent lockdown looms large amid alarming case and fatality spikes across Maharashtra. Senior Congressmen like Prithviraj Chavan and Balasaheb Thorat, too, have expressed their disapproval over another lockdown while stressing that it must be carefully calibrated, and that relief must be provided to daily-wage earners in form of direct cash transfers. In a riposte to Mr. Darekar, Sena MP and spokesman Sanjay Raut said that nobody ought to ‘politicise’ the lockdown issue at the moment. “I do not think that the decision to implement a lockdown or not ought to be a political hot potato. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi was compelled to impose a countrywide lockdown last year. There are times when governments do not have a choice but to take stern measures to preserve human life. So, I do not think this is a matter for playing politics over,” Mr. Raut said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pune-mayor-rules-out-lockdown-for-now/article34219861.ece
02 April 2021||Pune,||New plant species named after Pawar||A new species of flowering plants belonging to the genus Argyreia , recently discovered in south Maharashtra’s Kolhapur district, has been named after Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar. The species has been named Argyreia sharadchandrajii in recognition of Mr. Pawar’s contribution as Union agriculture minister, according to researchers Dr. Pramod R. Lawand and Dr. Vinod B. Shimpale. Kolhapur district falls in the famous Western Ghats ecological zone, known for its rich biodiversity. The new species was found in the Alamprabhu Dev-raai (sacred grove), said Dr. Lawand and Dr. Shimpale, who teach botany at a college in Kolhapur. Their research paper ‘ Argyreia sharadchandrajii (Convolvulaceae), a new species from the Western Ghats, India’ was recently published in the Journal of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy.  Dr. Shimpale said around 40 sub-species of the Argyreia genus are found in India. “These species are found in only Asiatic countries. Of the 40 sub-species, 17 are endemic to India, and now we have discovered an 18th one in the Alamprabhu sacred grove in Ramling hills,” he said. The plant flowers between July and September and the fruiting period lasts till December. “It grows in open habitats and trails on grassland but remains rooted near other shrubs,” Dr. Shimpale said. Asked why it was named after Mr. Pawar, he said a few years ago, the veteran politician provided financial help for publishing his research on the flora in Baramati — the leader’s political bastion — in the form of a book. Dr. Shimpale also mentioned Mr. Pawar’s “immense contribution to Indian agriculture” as a Union minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/new-plant-species-named-after-pawar/article34219864.ece

02 April 2021||Washington,||Biden allows H1-B visa ban to expire||The White House has allowed a 2020 ban on H1-B skilled worker and certain other temporary visas to expire on March 31. H1-B visas, used more by Indian professionals than any other nationality, weresuspended byPresident Donald Trump in June last year, ostensibly to protect American jobs, already reeling under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Visas for intra-company transfers (L1), exchange visitors (J1), temporary non-agricultural workers (H-2B) and dependents of H1-B holders (H4) were also impacted by the expiring ban. The White House did not make an official statement on the suspension’s expiration, as President Joe Biden travelled to Pittsburgh on Wednesday to unveil his $2 trillion American Jobs Plan — a massive, eight-year infrastructure plan. While the stated reason for Mr. Trump’s suspension was protecting American jobs in the face of unprecedented unemployment last year, the ban did not have its intended impact, according to the preliminary findings of a Wall Street Journal study. The analysis found that businesses employing foreigners “struggled to fill jobs” despite very high domestic unemployment. The ban, which was opposed by several prominent industry bodies, was litigated last year. The American Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers had won a preliminary injunction against the ban for their members from a federal court last October (the start of the U.S. fiscal year). Indian IT industry body NASSCOM said it applauded the decision to let the visa ban expire. “Allowing the suspension to lapse makes great sense for the United States. As the courts seemed to agree, there was no credible evidence that the visa holders do harm to the U.S. labour market. Quite the contrary, these individuals are a vital part of the U.S. workforce and their presence enhances and helps enable the U.S. economy, innovate, and grow jobs across the country. NASSCOM believes this will help U.S. businesses access talent critical to the economic recovery phase in the post-COVID world,” the NASSCOM statement said. The Information Technology Industry Council, an IT and tech industry association with members such as Amazon, Google, Cognizant and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), also said it welcomed the ban expiration. Immigration reforms “ITI welcomes the expiration of the prior administration’s H1-B visa ban today, and we look forward to working with@POTUSand the U.S. Congress on advancing sound immigration reforms moving forward,” a tweet from the organisation read. U.S. Senator Josh Hawley, a member of the right flank of the Republican Party, wrote to Mr. Biden asking him to consider a ban extension. “I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of non-immigrant visa programs to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected form harm,” he said. U.S. joblessness claims fell to 6,84,000 in March – the lowest since the pandemic began a year ago. While the ban has expired, some workers wanting to travel to the U.S. will not be able to due to pandemic-related U.S. travel restrictions on regions and countries, including South Africa, most of Europe and Brazil.

02 April 2021||Hong Kong,||Seven Hong Kong activists convicted over 2019 protests||Seven of Hong Kong’s leading pro-democracy advocates, including a media tycoon and an 82-year-old veteran of the movement, were convicted on Thursday for organising and participating in a march during massive anti-government protests in 2019 that triggered a crackdown on dissent. The verdict was the latest blow to the flagging democracy movement as the governments in Hong Kong and Beijing exert greater control over the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. Hong Kong had enjoyed a vibrant political culture and freedoms not seen elsewhere in China during the decades it was a British colony. Beijing had pledged to allow the city to retain those freedoms for 50 years when it took the territory back in 1997, but recently it has ushered in a series of measures that many fear are a step closer to making Hong Kong no different from cities on the mainland. Jimmy Lai, the owner of Apple Daily tabloid; Martin Lee, the octogenarian founder of the city’s Democratic Party; and five former pro-democracy lawmakers were found guilty. They face up to five years in prison. According to the ruling, six of the seven defendants convicted on Thursday, including Mr. Lee and Mr. Lai, carried a banner that criticised police and called for reforms as they left Victoria Park on August 18, 2019, and led a procession through the centre of the city. The other defendant, Margaret Yee, joined them on the way and helped carry the banner. Former lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan, who was among those convicted, expressed disappointment at the verdict.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/seven-hong-kong-activists-convicted-over-2019-protests/article34219557.ece
02 April 2021||Jerusalem,||Jailed Barghouti backs challenge to Abbas||Imprisoned Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti has endorsed a list of challengers opposing President Mahmud Abbas’s Fatah movement in legislative elections next month, the head of the dissident list said on Thursday. Mr. Barghouti, who is serving multiple life sentences in an Israeli jail and is described by some as the “Palestinian Mandela,” has been a closely watched figure ahead of the first Palestinian elections in 15 years. The deadline for submitting candidate lists for the May 22 legislative polls expired on Wednesday. Mr. Barghouti’s wife Fadwa is the second candidate on the “Freedom” list headed by Nasser al-Kidwa, nephew of the late iconic Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Freedom “is supported by Marwan Barghouti, and the proof of course is the presence of his wife” on the list, Mr. Kidwa said, adding that Mr. Barghouti’s input helped shape the movement. Mr. Kidwa was expelled from Fatah earlier this year after announcing his intention to run for the Palestinian presidency in a July 31 vote, a move seen as a direct affront to the Mr. Abbas,85. There remains widespread speculation that Mr. Barghouti may mount a presidential run from prison. Israel has convicted him of orchestrating deadly attacks during the 2000-2005 second Palestinian intifada , or uprising. Mr. Barghouti refused to recognise the court during his trial. A recent poll showed that 22% of Palestinians support him as their next President. Leader of the Hamas Islamist movement that controls Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, polled second with 14% support, followed by Mr. Abbas at 8%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/jailed-barghouti-backs-challenge-to-abbas/article34219554.ece

It is the third such shooting in the United States in weeks, with 18 people killed in two separate gun violence incidents in March. The shooter, whose motivations are so far unknown, sustained a gunshot wound and was taken to hospital, police lieutenant Jennifer Amat said, adding the suspect was in a critical condition. She continued that officers were still working to determine whether the wound was self-inflicted or a result of an exchange of fire with the police. The police did not release any more information about the victims, but said that a fifth individual — a woman — had been hospitalised and was in a critical condition. “The situation has been stabilised and there is no threat to the public,” the Orange Police Department said in a post on Facebook. The incident began around 5.30 p.m. local time on the upper floor of a small office building in the city of Orange. Police and the suspect exchanged fire, according to the Los Angeles Times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/child-among-four-dead-in-california-office-shooting/article34219560.ece
02 April 2021||Beijing,||China pushes to expand virus origin search beyond its border||Chinese health officials pushed on Wednesday to expand the search for the origins of the novel coronavirus beyond China, one day after the release of a closely watched World Health Organization report on the issue. They also rejected criticism that China did not give enough data to a WHO team of international experts that visited Wuhan, the Chinese city where the first cases were detected, earlier this year. “If we limit the study of origin within China, I think this is a scientific misunderstanding, because the source is still unclear,” said Liang Wannian, the head of the Chinese team that worked with the WHO group of experts. He said the experts agreed that the place where the first case was identified is not necessarily where the virus emerged. “Based on this scientific consensus, we should have a broader viewpoint in terms of sourcing,” he said. Experts agree that the virus could have come from elsewhere, with neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia a prime possibility, but China’s insistence on broadening the research seems partly politically motivated in the face of Western criticism. The WHO report concluded that the virus or a progenitor of it was most likely carried by a bat, which infected another animal that infected a human. Researchers have not been able to trace the bat or the intermediate animal yet, but suspicion has fallen on bat habitats in southwest China or nearby Southeast Asia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-pushes-to-expand-virus-origin-search-beyond-its-border/article34219561.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Goodness of Good Friday||Good Friday, the remembrance day of Jesus Christ’s crucifixion, is highly significant. For Christians, it is the day when the Son of God was nailed on the cross to redeem humanity from curse and sin. The crucifixion of Jesus was foretold by the prophets in the Old Testament. “But he was wounded for our transgression, He was bruised for our iniquities.” - Isaiah 53:5. The Bible also says, “God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh” - Romans 8:3. God loves sinner and hates sin. But the wage of sin is death, says the Law of Moses. What the law could not do, Jesus did and paved the way for salvation. Lord Jesus taught forgiveness even to his enemies. His own disciple Judas betrayed him. The trusted Peter too denied him thrice and he was forgiven when he wept in repentance. The crown on his head, the thorns on his brow, the lashes on his back and the nails in his hands and feet, brought no retaliation from Jesus. His stretched hands on the cross still beacons his preaching: “Come unto me; I will give you rest.” Suffering temptations, trials and even death are part of Christianity. Saint Augustine says, God had one son on earth without sin, but never without suffering. Jesus said, “Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me” - St. Mark 8:34 Jesus rose from death on the third day, Sunday, that is celebrated as Easter Day. The resurrection gives a message that any stone laid at the sepulchers to hinder the truth could be rolled away.  T.

02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Stop the Ambassadorships for sale||Imagine this conversation. U.S. Senator: “Good morning, Ambassador designate. I see that you have been nominated as our Ambassador to Sri Lanka. Have you ever been to Colombo? Ambassador designate: “Yes, Senator. But I am going to Sri Lanka, not to Latin America.” U.S. Senator: “Colombo happens to be the capital of Sri Lanka. Have you heard of Bandaranayake? Ambassador designate: No, Senator. But I assure you, as soon as I arrive in Sri Lanka, I shall visit that place.” Money counts This conversation may be apocryphal. But given the way the Presidents of the United States appoint ambassadors out of those who have paid big financial contributions to the Democratic party, even more bizarre conversations may take place during the Senate confirmation hearings; the qualification is not knowledge of history or geography, but the weight of the money bags deposited. This is part of the ‘spoils system’, except that, over the years, a price tag has been fixed for ambassadorships. U.S. President Richard M. Nixon had once even suggested that a floor price of $250,000 should be suggested for ambassadorships. Now that U.S. President Joe Biden is in the process of filling up thousands of high-level posts, and the Senate has begun considering the various names for confirmation, the ambassadorial aspirants, who had paid money to the party, have also begun to assert their claims. Making the right appointments is crucial for Mr. Biden to clean up the mess created by his predecessor, Donald Trump. Mr. Biden has appointed Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a retired career diplomat as Ambassador to the United Nations and she has been confirmed by the Senate, but many heavy contributors are waiting in the wings. Anticipating that Mr. Biden will offer ambassadorial positions to some of his major donors — most of who are not particularly suited for such assignments — a member of the editorial board of The New York Times , Michelle Cottle, has made a fervent plea to Mr. Biden, in an article (March 18, 2021, “Stop letting rich people buy ambassadorships”;https://nyti.ms/3wbbdlA)to “jettison the skeezy practice of rewarding big campaign contributors with Ambassadorships”. Entrenched as a ‘tradition’ This is not the first time that a torch is being shone on this unfair practice. A study, some years ago, by some legal experts had recommended that rich people buying ambassadorships should be stopped. In 1980, a decision was taken that most ambassadors should be career foreign service officers. Still, succeeding Presidents have filled from a minimum of 30% to a maximum of 57% (under Mr. Trump) of the posts with donors. Since such a tradition has been established, Mr. Biden may not be able to stop it either. The crucial question would be on what to do with those who had made donations for diplomatic stardom. The appointments have solid backing of the U.S. Constitution. Article II provides that the President “shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors.” (https://bit.ly/3fxBWmE). The President enjoys wide latitude in selecting a nominee and the Senate is comparably free to choose whether to advise and consent. The onus for the quality and integrity of the nominees rests on the President, but the Senate has the right to hold back confirmation of any nominee, including career diplomats. Complicated process The path to ambassadorships for donors is not at all smooth. The Senate confirmation is quite a complicated process in which the investigating agencies examine their entire past to see whether they have ever been guilty of any misdemeanour, which disqualifies them for the high appointment. Anything adverse that comes to the notice of the agencies will be conveyed to the nominee concerned. It is then up to him to decide whether to face the charges or quietly withdraw his candidature. There is an example of an Indian-American having been considered as Ambassador to Fiji and some other Pacific island states but who had to withdraw his nomination after the Federal Bureau of Investigation had communicated to him that it would be in his interest to withdraw rather than face an investigation into his past. There was another example of a donor ambassador, a rich businessman from Buffalo, who had apparently paid a huge sum for the U.S. Presidential campaign. He made no secret of his having been appointed on the strength of his financial contribution. He had his own grievances such as being denied permission by the State Department to bring his own private aircraft to Fiji. When he figured out that he would be accredited to six island states from Fiji and that there were only weekly flights from Fiji to the other capitals, he thought his own plane would be a great asset. The ambassador spent his own money to refurbish the Embassy residence and to entertain well, with the choicest food and wines flown in from the U.S. He did not bother much about the politics of the South Pacific as he knew that he was there not to pursue a career but to enjoy a well-earned holiday. He went to an island state called Tuvalu, which has a total population of 5,000 to present his credentials. He saw a little store at the airport which sold local handicrafts and asked the owner how much it cost. The bewildered owner asked which item he was looking for. “The whole shop,” he said. The owner said that he would not be able to sell the whole shop as it would take several months to get the stock replenished and there would be no handicrafts shop at the airport. The Indian way India has a more sophisticated system of appointing “political” ambassadors, not for donation to political parties, but as an avenue to recognise and reward talent. Till very recently, career diplomats could not aspire to ambassadorial posts in London, Washington or Moscow as distinguished people from different walks of life were appointed to add weight to the positions. In the early years, Maharajas were appointed to several posts. And later, politicians were sent abroad when they had to be kept away from the country. The Government apparently has the discretion of appointing political ambassadors in up to 30% of the posts. But now, the number of political ambassadors is small, if at all, and the senior posts are open to career diplomats. India has had some very distinguished and successful political ambassadors, who had access to the Prime Minister back home and to high levels in the host countries. Examples are three political ambassadors in Moscow (Dr. K.S. Shelvankar, D.P. Dhar and I.K. Gujral) and one in Washington (Naresh Chandra); all of them fulfilled certain criteria set by the Government, which included greater acceptability of political ambassadors in major capitals. Senior career diplomats were assigned to these posts as Deputy Chiefs of Mission, often with ambassadorial rank, to do much of the work, leaving the political ambassadors to deal with high policy. The most celebrated political ambassador was Kushok Bakula Rinpoche, a Buddhist monk from Ladakh, who was appointed to Mongolia. He is credited with reviving Buddhism in Mongolia. The Head of State himself used to pay obeisance to him as the Mongolians followed the same Mahayana Buddhism practised in Ladakh. Even after he completed his diplomatic assignment (January 1990 to October 2000; https://bit.ly/2PK55A4), Kushok Bakula Rinpoche retained strong ties with Mongolia till he died in his eighties. False notion In recent years, career ambassadors are occupying those posts which were considered political in nature. But the practice continues in many countries because of the general feeling that long careers in the Foreign Service are not necessary to be effective ambassadors. In other words, diplomacy is not considered a profession for specialists, a notion as ridiculous as appointing a politician as the Surgeon General or a General. We do not know whether Mr. Biden will heed the advice not to appoint donors as ambassadors. But if he does, there will be many frustrated donors in Washington and one source of political funding will dry up. On the other hand, the credibility of Biden diplomacy will increase and career diplomats will have better prospects. T.P. Sreenivasan is a former Ambassador of India, who spent 10 years in the U.S. in different diplomatic assignments||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/stop-the-ambassadorships-for-sale/article34219533.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||An Act of colourable legislation||In his article, “The needless resurrection of a buried issue” ( The Hindu , March 29, 2021), Dushyant Dave, senior advocate of eminence, has articulated why he opposes the challenges on constitutional grounds to the Places of Worship Act, 1991, now before the Supreme Court. We have by way of a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court (WP(C) 619 of 2020, which was filed earlier but notice was issued later vide order of the Supreme Court dated March 26, 2021), challenged Sections 3 and 4 of the Places of Worship Act, 1991 being unconstitutional, void ab initio , and against the Basic Structure of the Constitution of India. No precedential value Mr. Dave has relied mainly on the Supreme Court’s observation in the Ram Janmabhoomi Case of November 9, 2019 ( M. Siddiq vs. Mahant Suresh Das ) with respect to the Places of Worship Act, 1991. However, there was no application of the provisions of the Places of Worship Act, 1991 to the case (Shri Ram Janmabhoomi dispute). Section 5 of the Places of Worship Act, 1991 clearly states that nothing in the Act shall apply to any suit, appeal or other proceedings relating to the said place or place of worship, i.e. the Ram-Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid situated in Ayodhya, in the State of Uttar Pradesh. Thereby, the 2019 judgment of the Supreme Court’s (Shri Ram Janmabhoomi dispute (2020 1 SCC 1)) observation(s) with respect to the Places of Worship Act, 1991 lacks any precedential value. The pith and substance of the Act of 1991 is that it is ultra vires the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution since it bars the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and furthermore nullifies the Fundamental Right(s) guaranteed by the Constitution of India as elucidated in Article 32 of “enforcement of fundamental rights” which cannot be suspended except as otherwise stated in the Constitution. This importance of Article 32 can be understood by the words of the Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, B.R. Ambedkar who asserted, inter alia , that Article 32 is the very soul of the Constitution and the most important Article in the Constitution. Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court has the power to issue writs appropriate for enforcement of all the Fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution. The top court, on various instances, ruled that in view of the constitutional scheme and the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court under Article 32 and on the High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution that “the power of judicial review being an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution, no Act of Parliament can exclude or curtail the powers of the Constitutional Courts with regard to the enforcement of fundamental rights”. The Act of 1991, is appropriately called an Act of colourable legislation. As the Courts have held, “you cannot do indirectly which you are prohibited from doing directly”. A weakening The Preamble in the Constitution gives prominent importance to liberty of belief, faith and worship to all citizens, and the same is sought to be weakened and effectively nullified or severely damaged by the enactment of the Act of 1991 in its current format. The concepts of faith, belief and worship are the foundations of Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, prohibiting citizens from approaching appropriate courts with respect to suit or any other proceedings to handover the land of any temple of certain essential significance (such as being the birthplace of Lord Rama in Ayodhya and Lord Krishna in Mathura or Lord Shiva sending his fiery Jyotirlinga in the Gyanvapi premises of Varanasi), is arbitrary, unreasonable and mala fide in the context of the fundamental rights to pray and perform religious practice as guaranteed by Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India. The intent of the Act of 1991 under Section 5, i.e. exception extended to the “Ram-Janmbhoomi matter” identifies the need and importance of resolution of such a controversy and settling long on-going disputes before the courts. But such an exception should be made for other two matters of dispute stated above. Other disputes The exclusion of the Mathura and Varanasi disputes as being additional exceptions from the Act of 1991 is wholly unacceptable and against what is given by the people of India to the makers of the Constitution, enshrined in the Preamble, which is part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution. Those who rely on the Act of 1991 to avoid the settlement of the dispute in Varanasi Mathura have failed to anticipate the legal principles enunciated in the judgment of the top court (in Ismail Faruqui vs. Union of India ( 1994 6 SCC 360 )), on the religious significance of mosques and temples. Even in countries like Saudia Arabia, only Mecca and Medina have the immutable religious protection from demolition. And only authorised demolition is permitted. Section 4 (1) of the Act declaring that religious character of a place of worship existing on the 15th day of August, 1947 shall continue to be the same as it existed on that day, is no longer good law after this Court’s judgment in ((1994) 6 SCC 360) which held that a mosque is not an essential part of the practice of the religion of Islam and namaz (prayer) by Muslims can be offered anywhere, even in the open maidan , on the road, railway platforms or airports. Ultimately, students of law are also students of history and we must not lose sight of the past. We must learn from it. But we accept one sentiment of Mr. Dave — that we cannot open the flood gates of rebuilding all 40,000 temples which were demolished on firmans of the Mughal emperors. Yet, where by faith Hindus believe there was a forcible demolition of an irreplaceable non-shiftable temple, it has to be rebuilt. There are only two more such temples in the list of 40,000 — the Gyanvapi Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi and the Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple in Mathura. Hence, by the doctrine of casus omissus , the Supreme Court can in an appropriate case before it order that the number of exceptions in Section 5 of the Places of Worship Act, 1991, be three as an alternative solution. The Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution can pass any order to carry out for doing complete justice being in the public interest, while upholding the Constitution of India.

02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Overseeing oversights||India’s small savings instruments witnessed unprecedented overnight volatility in rates this week. On Wednesday evening, the Budget division in the Department of Economic Affairs revised downwards the interest rates payable on small savings instruments for the April-June 2021 quarter, by 40 basis points (0.4%) to 110 basis points (1.1%). The return on the most popular PPF scheme was pegged at 6.4%, the lowest level in 46 years. The government had refrained from tweaking these rates for the last three quarters after effecting a similarly sharp cut in Q1 of 2020-21, when the PPF interest was pruned from 7.9% to 7.1%. However, by early Thursday, the rate cuts had disappeared and the status quo reinstated, following a tweet by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The only explanation: ‘Orders issued by oversight shall be withdrawn.’ It is not clear whose ‘oversight’ led to the rates being cut. In the process, the intent has been revealed even if the impact is deferred. Surely, Wednesday’s order, approved by the competent authority, was not based on random numbers keyed in and notified inadvertently amidst a flurry of last-minute economy-related government notifications on the last day of the financial year. It is difficult to believe that the oversight is on the bureaucracy’s part, for it simply executed the stated policy decision to link small savings rates to the interest paid on government securities of a comparable tenure every quarter. So one must deduce the oversight is on the political executive’s part on the timing and implications of executing the required decision as per the extant policy. The clinching factor — the five Assembly polls. The government, that has brazened it out on Opposition jibes about rising unemployment, high inflation along with soaring fuel prices, could ill afford to yield a fresh talking point — the squeezing of the middle class and senior citizens, even as they brace up for the fresh tax on provident fund incomes. This rollback is not the first instance of post-haste policy ad hocism, but it may make the government’s Rs. 12.05-lakh crore borrowing plan for the year harder as the central bank has been complaining of high small savings rates as a deterrent to lower interest rates. Another instance is the mysterious practice of oil companies freezing pump prices during electoral campaigns, even though oil prices are deregulated. The PM, as part of his ‘One Nation, One Election’ pitch, has often said that the virtually perennial poll season hits development. On the same note, if governments need permission to announce initiatives while the model code of conduct is in force, any deviation or reversal from routine administrative decisions should also attract the Election Commission’s scrutiny.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/overseeing-oversights/article34219527.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Special no longer||Hong Kong, China’s Special Administrative Region (SAR), has served as the mainland’s most important gateway to the world for the past 24 years. Since its handover from British rule in 1997, the SAR has defied expectations that it would lose its unique identity. Unlike the mainland, the unique “one country, two systems” model guaranteed a high degree of autonomy and freedoms, including a free press, the right to protest, and a rambunctious political scene with a noisy pro-democracy opposition. Perhaps, most importantly, for the hundreds of multinationals, it also enjoyed an independent judiciary, a stark contrast from the Communist Party-controlled courts across the border. This week, Beijing dealt a blow to many of those unique freedoms. On March 30, the Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress (NPC), approved sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system that will reduce significantly the share of directly elected representatives in the SAR’s Legislative Council (LegCo). President Xi Jinping signed orders to promulgate amended annexes to Hong Kong’s Basic Law, the constitution that has governed the SAR and ensured its autonomy, marking the biggest change since 1997. While previously 35 of LegCo’s 70 members were directly elected, that number has now been reduced to 20, even as the size of the legislature has been expanded to 90. The remaining 70 will be nominated from broadly pro-establishment groups, thereby ensuring a majority for the pro-Beijing camp in perpetuity. The most controversial change is the establishment of a Candidate Eligibility Review Committee to decide the eligibility of candidates and deem whether they are “patriotic” enough. Its verdicts cannot be challenged in the courts, the only standing independent institution. Beijing has justified the changes to ensure “patriots” were administering Hong Kong and as a response to the 2019 protest movement, which was silenced by last year’s stringent national security law. The protesters had demanded universal suffrage, promised in the 1997 handover. That the protest movement had wide backing was clear in the 2019 district council elections, after which the pro-democracy camp ended up with 90% of the seats. That will now count for little, as the amendments no longer give district councillors a place either in LegCo or in the Election Committee. With the new change and the national security law in place, Beijing’s grip on Hong Kong is tighter than ever. While Beijing may succeed in assuaging the business community’s concerns with the continued attraction of the mainland’s market, it remains no closer to winning the hearts and minds of Hongkongers. By reducing the space for democratic representation, Beijing appears to have given up efforts to do so, at least for now. That the changes are being framed by China as a historic political victory does little to change the perception.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/special-no-longer/article34219528.ece
02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||GST Council meeting unlikely before May-end, June: Bajaj||Any reforms or rate changes under the Goods and Services Tax regime, including the much-anticipated discussion between the Centre and the States on high fuel taxes, may have to wait till the end of May or June, as the GST Council is not expected to meet before the ongoing assembly elections conclude and new governments take charge in those five States. “Five States are going for polls, and they are important States,” said Economic Affairs and Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj. “Their participation is very essential in the GST Council,” he added. The council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, has not met since October, when the issue of raising GST compensation for the States was discussed in light of the hit on revenues due to the pandemic and the lockdown. On the Rs. 63,000 crore of outstanding dues to States on account of GST compensation for 2020-21, Mr. Bajaj said it was too early to speak on the specifics but all dues would be paid. “A decision has already been taken that July 2022 onwards, whatever is left out, the compensation cess will continue till it is paid. It is a good thing in a way, because from July 2022, when the 14% revenue growth promise will go away, then some States’ revenue may fall steeply. The fall may not be so steep because of this; it will help them,” he added. The Centre will assess how long the compensation cess is to be levied beyond June 2022 in order to pay States’ outstanding GST dues and repay the Rs. 1.1 lakh crore borrowed in FY21 to bridge the gap between dues and compensation cess receipts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/gst-council-meeting-unlikely-before-may-end-june-bajaj/article34219510.ece
02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Economy, jobs to continue to bounce back this year’||India is much better geared to cope with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the economy as well as informal sector job creation is expected to continue to bounce back through this year, Tarun Bajaj , Secretary, Revenue & Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry said in an interview. Edited Excerpts:  With the financial year 2020-21 behind us, where do you see the state of the economy this year? Is the second wave a worry? The state of the economy is far better. You have seen the growth rate being projected by various agencies. We have assumed a 10.4% growth this year, but IMF has projected more than 11%, while Fitch Ratings yesterday projected a rate of 12.8%. So, I think we are now looking at the economy in a much healthier state. However, the second wave is a small worry, I would say. But at the same time, we are better equipped to handle it. Now, no State is saying it is going for a lockdown. Maharashtra announced, but it is not doing, which is very sensible. To live with COVID is a new normal. So now that our health infrastructure is upgraded and vaccines are there, we should handle it with these methods rather than a lockdown. If we do that, we will also ensure jobs in the informal sector, and that the economy keeps growing. And, we have got great adaptability. Now, when I see Delhi compared to when it was a full lockdown, one could drive down at 100 kmph. Right now, the traffic is perfectly normal. So, I think that people are conscious that we now have to live with the coronavirus in a sense. But I am sure we will be able to overcome this situation. Have revenue collections improved over the past two months, perhaps more than the revised estimates presented in the Budget? The revenue figures presently have been much better in the months of February and March, both in direct and indirect taxes. The direct tax gross collections will not be lower by more than 2%-3% of what we collected last year, 2019-20, which is a big thing. As a matter of fact we have given Rs. 70,000 crore more to the taxpayers as refund over the last year which was about Rs. 1.86 lakh crore. This year we have refunded more than Rs. 2.5 lakh crore. The GST collections for the month of March have created a record; it has never been so high. We have crossed the record collections by a good margin. What is the update on tax disputes resolved under the Vivaad Se Vishwas dispute resolution scheme? More than 1.33 lakh applications have come worth Rs. 99,960 crore of which about Rs. 53,800 crore have already been adjusted (as on March 31, 5 p.m.). Industry players, foreign businesses in particular, are concerned about the implications of the equalisation levy as its phrasing suggests it could cover even firms not operating from an e-commerce platform but merely exchanging e-mails or using digital modes of payment as part of a transaction...   We will also issue a clarification in this regard.  Second wave is a small worry, but we are better equipped to handle it||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/economy-jobs-to-continue-to-bounce-back-this-year/article34219513.ece
02 April 2021||COIMBATORE,||Cotton exports may touch 70 lakh bales: CCI||Cotton exports so far this season (October 2020 to September 2021), have clocked 47 lakh bales and are expected to touch 60-70 lakh bales by the end of the season. Pradeep Kumar Agarwal, CMD, Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), said total cotton exports may touch 70 lakh bales. The CCI, which has 47 lakh bales in stock and has exported almost one lakh bales so far, is looking at shipping an additional 10 lakh bales. There may be exports of 10-12 lakh bales to Bangladesh, he said. However, Atul Ganatra, president, Cotton Association of India (CAI), said the association estimated total cotton exports this season at about 60 lakh bales. International prices have dropped and those of Indian cotton are now on a par with international prices. So, exports may not account for much. Prices in India are expected to remain stable or vary slightly. It will depend on government agencies that have almost 50 lakh bales in stock, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cotton-exports-may-touch-70-lakh-bales/article34219517.ece
02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Personal mobility needs boost car sales in March||A majority of vehicle makers posted significant growth in wholesale numbers for March, mainly on the back of last year’s low sales base. A year earlier, the nationwide lockdown and the move to new emission norms had dampened sentiment. Vehicle makers said the pandemic-driven preference for personal mobility boosted demand. Maruti Suzuki sold more than 1.46 lakh passenger vehicles (PVs) last month in the domestic market compared with 76,240 units in March 2020, and 1.45 lakh in March 2019. The company’s “domestic sales in FY20 had fallen by 18%... and [sales] in FY21 have been impacted due to COVID-related factors... It will be seen that domestic sales in March 2021 have only recovered to March 2019 levels,” it said in a statement. The company added that total sales in FY21 were about 14.57 lakh units, 6.7% lower than for FY20. Hyundai Motor’s domestic sales in March saw a 100% year-on-year growth to 52,600 units. Tata Motors’ domestic PV sales stood at 29,654 units as against 5,676 units in March 2020. Its commercial vehicle sales also saw exponential growth to 36,955 units from just 5,336 units a year earlier. Mahindra & Mahindra’s (M&M) passenger vehicles sales grew 94% to 16,700, while commercial vehicles sales climbed to 17,116 as against 2,742 units. Commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland saw sales zoom to 15,761 units last month, as against 1,734 units in March 2020. Tractors continued their good run, with M&M’s Farm Equipment Sector (FES) selling 29,817 units in India as against 13,418 units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/personal-mobility-needs-boost-car-sales-in-march/article34219519.ece

As per the Revised Estimates for FY21, Rs. 5,49,959 crore, being 41% of the shareable pool of taxes and duties, were estimated to be released. However, the Finance Ministry has devolved Rs. 5,94,996 crore, based on initial estimates of the shareable pool that would be collected in FY21, the Ministry said in a statement. The 15th Finance Commission has recommended that States be given 41% of the divisible tax pool of the Centre during FY21. The Ministry said the additional amount of Rs. 45,000 crore was released in two instalments of Rs. 14,500 crore and Rs. 30,500 crore. The Rs. 14,500 crore was released along with the 14th regular instalment of devolution on March 26; the second instalment was released on March 31. “The Ministry... has released the amounts to share the revenue buoyancy seen in Q4 FY21 and in the true spirit of fiscal federalism,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/states-get-rs-45000-cr-as-additional-devolution/article34219520.ece

02 April 2021||London,||North Macedonia ambushes Germany||Germany’s first World Cup qualifying loss in 20 years added another blemish to the final months of coach Joachim Low’s 15-year reign in charge of the team. Germany’s 35-match unbeaten run in World Cup qualifying — a streak dating back to 2001 — ended with a stunning 2-1 home loss to North Macedonia on Wednesday that left the team sitting third in its group after three games. Europe’s other major powers ended the first batch of qualifying games on a successful note, with England, Italy, Spain and France all picking up wins before they switch their focus to the Euros. Disregarding protocol Spain’s 3-1 victory at home to Kosovo attracted attention because of the host country’s non-recognition of the visitors, with the Spanish national broadcaster disregarding normal protocol by not mentioning Kosovo as a country and using lowercase letters for “kos” in its graphics. John Stones made amends for an embarrassing defensive blunder by setting up a late winner for fellow centre back Harry Maguire as England beat Poland 2-1 to stay perfect in Group I. Italy’s unbeaten run extended to 25 games with a 2-0 win in Lithuania as Roberto Mancini’s halftime changes had an immediate impact. Italy moved three points ahead of Switzerland atop Group C. France continued its recovery from an opening-round draw to Ukraine, beating Bosnia-Herzegovina 1-0 to follow up a 2-0 win over Kazakhstan on Sunday. France is four points clear in Group D.  The results: Group B: Greece 1 (Kakabadze 76-og) drew with Georgia 1 (Kvaratskhelia 78); Spain 3 (Olmo 34, Torres 36, Moreno 75) bt Kosovo 1 (Halimi 70).   Group C: Lithuania 0 lost to Italy 2 (Sensi 48, Immobile 90+4-pen); Northern Ireland 0 drew with Bulgaria 0.   Group D: Bosnia and Herzegovina 0 lost to France 1 (Griezmann 60); Ukraine 1 (Yaremchuk 20) drew with Kazakhstan 1 (Muzhikov 59).

02 April 2021||Chennai,||When a nation erupted in happiness||The spectators swung to the beating of the drums. The Wankhede Stadium was a blaze of colours. And the cup of joy was filled to the brim in the Maximum City. Outside the arena, there were traffic jams under the night sky. Yet, nobody cared. Those at the wheels honked in delight. The whole of India and Mumbai roared in appreciation. The fragrance of victory swirled around. And a six to bring up a six-wicket World Cup conquest! What a finish! ‘Spiritual’ inspiration Sachin Tendulkar was, finally, a part of a World Cup-winning squad. The maestro was the ‘spiritual’ inspiration of India’s triumph. After the miracle of ’83 by Kapil’s Devils in England, followed by an agonisingly barren run, Dhoni’s Dashers had lifted the ICC ODI World Cup in the sub-continent. April 2, 2011 has now become a part of Indian cricket’s folklore. A day, 10 years ago, when the country celebrated as one. The World Cup was won by tact and brawn. Both symbolised by skipper M.S. Dhoni. He showed his cricketing nous by boldly promoting himself ahead of an in-form Yuvraj Singh to bring into play a left-right partnership and then dismantled the Sri Lankan bowling with strokes of brutal force. A chase of 275, a target set up principally by the fleet-footed Mahela Jayawardene’s 103 not out of pristine beauty and timing, appeared challenging under the lights. Ambushes lurked. But then, Dhoni’s 79-ball unbeaten 91 and his match-altering 109-run association with the left-handed No. 3 Gautam Gambhir, all finesse and class, propelled India from a wobbly 114 for three. Brilliant Gambhir Gambhir, brilliant during his 97, used the depth of the crease and coaxed the ball through the gaps on both sides. His footwork was nimble and stroke-making crisp as he blunted the threat from Muttiah Muralitharan; he picked the Lankan wizard from the hand and gauged the length to perfection.  Initially, Dhoni, his swagger unmistakable in a pressure situation, ran like a slithery cat between the wickets, and then opened out with some audacious strokes of dexterous wrists and sensational bat-speed. And you could freeze the frame when he bludgeoned a full-length ball from Nuwan Kulasekara over the long-on ropes to bring the curtains down on the final and open up new avenues for Indian cricket. The stadium had gone quiet when slinger Lasith Malinga struck with the new ball, trapping Virender Sehwag in front and getting Tendulkar to nick one that moved away. But then, a young Virat Kohli steadied the innings with Gambhir and then came the Skipper’s Gambit. Fittingly, Dhoni ended the contest with a booming blow as a nation erupted in happiness. What a night!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/when-a-nation-erupted-in-happiness/article34219635.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Can consistently inconsistent Kings finally ascend the throne?||Kings XI Punjab enters the 2021 edition as Punjab Kings. Whether this rechristening brings a change in its fortunes remains to be seen as K. L. Rahul returns to lead a side whose performances so far have not matched the potential. Runners-up in 2014 and semifinalists in the inaugural edition in 2008, Kings continue to search for a maiden title. On paper, the team looks armed with the arsenal needed to win any battle. However, its consistent inconsistency has stood in the way of seizing the big moments. The calming presence of Anil Kumble, Director of Cricket Operations, and assistant coach Andy Flower in the dugout should help keep the flamboyance of Chris Gayle or the emotions of Rahul in check. Fielding coach Jonty Rhodes, in his second season with Kings, brings obvious value to the team. Picking the batsmen in the playing XI should not be so difficult, with Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Gayle, Mandeep Singh easily forming the top-order. Sarfaraz Khan can follow to play a cameo. All-rounders Moises Henriques, Jhye Richardson, Jalaj Saxena, Deepak Hooda and Fabian Allen bring variety to the attack that includes Riley Meredith, Chris Jordan and M. Ashwin. The manner in which Kings went all out for Richardson in the recent auction, spending a whopping Rs. 14 crore (base price Rs. 1.5 crore) and adding his Australian compatriot Meredith for Rs. 8 crore (base price Rs. 40 lakh), reflects the team management’s thought-pattern. Kumble clearly thinks quality pace will win the race on Indian pitches. Last year, in the playing XI, Indians formed the backbone of the Kings attack, while the overseas recruits were mainly batsmen. This year, the line-up appears balanced, even without Glenn Maxwell. Rahul, expected to open with Mayank, may share the wicketkeeping responsibilities with Nicholas Pooran. In 2020, the duo was part of the playing XI. This year, too, Pooran could be preferred over Gayle or Dawid Malan. In any case, Gayle may not be a choice for all the league matches. “This year, Punjab Kings will bring in new energy to all of us and we start a new journey,” Kumble said.   X factor   All-rounders: Kings have clearly invested in all-rounders ahead of the 2021 edition. This offers the think-tank more options to construct a winning combination and seal a playoff berth. Having retained the core in batting ahead of the auction and then strengthening the bowling resources, Kings could well be the ‘dark horse’ this season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/can-consistently-inconsistent-kings-finally-ascend-the-throne/article34219633.ece
02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indeed a job done well: Yuvraj||A decade has passed since M.S. Dhoni hit one of the most recalled sixes in Indian cricket to end the country’s wait for an ODI World Cup triumph since 1983. It was April 2, 2011, when a nation rejoiced like never before. The victory over Sri Lanka brought the country to a standstill, with cricket-lovers taking to the streets in celebrations that went into the wee hours of the next morning. Dhoni and his men had lived up to the expectations. And the man who saw Dhoni’s finishing touches from 22 yards was Yuvraj Singh — the Man of the World Cup. From the euphoria of holding the World Cup to the excruciating pain of undergoing chemotherapy, Yuvraj went through extreme emotions during the past decade. He penned his biography, got married and then retired from active cricket. Sense of pride Today, at 39, Yuvraj looks back with an obvious sense of pride. Ever so thankful to the almighty for the life he is leading today, the left-hander strikes the right note. “God has indeed been very kind to me. I’ve been part of two World Cup triumphs and each one gives me an added reason to feel good about contributing to the team. “In 2007 (in the inaugural T20 World Cup), those six sixes in an over brought a different kind of joy to the people, especially the young cricket fans. I still get lots of people coming to me and recalling how it was for them to watch the ball sail over the boundary, ball after ball. “Again in 2011, I think I could play a hand in most of the games. When I did not contribute with the bat, like against Pakistan (in the semifinals), I took two top-order wickets (Asad Shafiq and Younis Khan) and again two against Lanka, including Sangakkara’s." Mention Dhoni’s Cup-winning six and the joy in Yuvraj’s voice is hard to miss. “Winning matters but winning in style matters a little more. That’s the difference between taking a winning single and sending the ball into the stands. It was indeed a job done well!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chief-protagonist-of-the-plot/article34219622.ece

02 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Mahesh Mangaonkar outplays Abhay Singh||Mahesh Mangaonkar has been playing rock solid so far in the PSA Challenger Tour squash tournament here. Be it his touch play or the powerful strokes unleashed with a lot of variety from the backcourt, the 27-year-old top seed has been one-up against all opponents. Against an improving Abhay Singh, Mangaonkar never let his guard down as he tamed the 22-year-old fellow Indian 12-10, 8-11, 11-4, 11-9 to reach the men’s final on Thursday. The top seed will meet a tough challenger in Todd Harrity of the USA, who dismantled Egypt’s Karim El Hammamy 11-8, 11-9, 8-11, 11-1. Mangaonkar will be the lone Indian player in the finals as Tanvi Khanna was outplayed by Hana Moataz of Egypt 11-6, 11-4, 9-11, 11-5 in 32 minutes in the women’s semifinals. Tanvi showed signs of a comeback when she won the third game, but Hana proved to be way too powerful and crafty for the Indian, closing out the fourth in a jiffy. Malak beats Rana Earlier, in the all-Egyptian semifinal, the left-handed and unseeded Malak Kamal defeated Rana Ismail, seeded seventh 11-13, 11-6, 11-2, 12-10.

02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Academy girls reflect the success of SAI programme||Criticising government agencies for shortcomings is common; appreciating them not so much. With their recent victories in the Hockey India Academy National championships, the Sports Authority of India’s hockey programme has reason to be proud. The SAI-Academy girls’ teams won the inaugural editions of the sub-junior and junior competitions in Bhubaneswar last week, on consecutive days. While the junior girls won 2-1 against a strong MP Academy side in the final, the sub-junior team registered a hard-fought 5-4 win against home team Odisha Naval Tata Hockey HPC in shootouts at the Kalinga Stadium. That the teams remained unbeaten throughout the tournaments playing at international level infrastructure for the first time ever was a bonus. “Events like this are helpful for the players as they offer international-level exposure in a national event. Playing under floodlights in an international stadium is very special for the junior, it motivates them,” said junior team coach Prakhar Patel, who is also in-charge of SAI’s Kolkata Centre of Excellence. “At this young age, they really know how to hold their nerves in tough games like these. To play according to the situation is a big thing at this age. “Shoot-outs aren’t easy and these girls did a great job, so credit to them,” sub-junior in-charge and coach at STC Sundergarh Pradeep Kumar Sarangi added. The girls were drawn from SAI academies across the country and selected through open trials. While nine of the sub-junior girls belong to STC Sundergarh, Kolkata and Lucknow had a big share in the junior side. SAI currently has 25 STCs, and one CoE and National Hockey Academy each catering to hockey. Both Sarangi and Patel agreed that getting players from diverse regions and backgrounds to play together was the biggest challenge. “We had less time due to the pandemic. With girls from Punjab, Haryana, UP, Jharkhand, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, building a strong team was a challenge. At sub-junior level, players are asked to play in a specific manner so it depends how they adapt to the team and situations quickly and they did exceptionally well,” Sarangi said. Good work “This shows SAI-Academy is doing good work at grassroots level. When you have players from different regions, the focus is on coordination and collective mindset. “We worked on this at a one-month camp before the tournament and improved through the competition,” Patel added. Last year, Hockey India had restructured its National championships, separating competitions for State units, PSUs and academies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/academy-girls-reflect-the-success-of-sai-programme/article34219914.ece

Despite getting off to an indifferent start when he trailed 0-3, the wiry Niki recovered his composure and put together a sparkling game to outwit the Swede. Arjun Kadhe failed to bring out his best game and got beaten 6-0, 6-4 by qualifier Alexander Kotzen of the USA. Guns blazing Also, former Asian junior champion Nitin Kumar Sinha went down with guns blazing against third seed Aidan Mchugh of Britain. After a slow start when he trailed 2-4, Nitin won the first set 7-5, and was up 3-0 in the second. In the decider, Nitin led 4-2 but had to survive a matchpoint in the 12th game, with an ace.

02 April 2021||KOZHIKODE,||We want to play in ISL, says Praveen||With the I-League title in its kitty, Gokulam Kerala wants to graduate to the ISL. “We want to play in the ISL by the qualification route,” the club’s president V.C. Praveen told The Hindu on Thursday. “So if we win the I-League in the 2022-23 season, we would become eligible to play in the ISL. We don’t want to play by paying Rs. 15 crore.” He said Gokulam winning the I-League title at Kolkata was nothing short of a dream-come-true for him. “When we formed this club in 2017, the target was that we should become the I-League champion within three or four years, and we are all delighted that we could do it,” said Praveen, who used to be a footballer during his student days. “We were well-placed last year too, before the league had to be stopped following the coronavirus outbreak.”  He hoped Gokulam’s victory would revitalise football in Kerala. “Several club owners from Kerala had called me up on the eve of our last I-League match (against TRAU on Saturday) to say that they were praying for our victory,” he said. “They said it was important that the title came to Kerala.” He said it was after the discussions with the Kerala Football Association some five years ago that the Gokulam business group decided to form the club. “They had requested us to be part of a consortium, but we were not keen,” Praveen said. “We have already seen that such ventures may not succeed. Viva Kerala and FC Kochin are examples for that.” All for it So Gokulam decided to be the single-owner. “When I broached the idea, our chairman (and my father-in-law) Gokulam Gopalan was also all for it,” he said. “Yes, running a professional club is an expensive affair; we have spent something like Rs. 5 crore for this financial year.” It is money well spent, though. Gokulam has the unique distinction of being the I-League and the Indian Women’s League champion at the same time. “The brand of Gokulam Kerala has grown considerably over the years, and it is a valuable property now,” he said. “That is one way of looking at the management of sports club. You cannot see a club as a standalone business for a corporate company.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-want-to-play-in-isl-says-praveen/article34219873.ece
02 April 2021||KOCHI,||Kerala to have a new Super League||With Gokulam Kerala FC winning the I-League title, playing a couple of games against Indian Super League side Kerala Blasters when the coronavirus clouds clear could create a lot of interest. “I’m sure if Gokulam and Blasters play two matches at (Kochi's) Nehru Stadium along with one or two clubs from outside, all these matches will be fully packed,” said P. Anilkumar, the general secretary of the Kerala Football Association. Sharing of ideas Anilkumar is sharing such ideas with individuals, clubs and corporate houses as the KFA invites bids to sell Kerala football’s commercial rights for the next decade and more. “Basically, we are giving the commercial rights to a company. It has to give a guaranteed amount for the ongoing activities of the KFA, including the Kerala Premier League, Santosh Trophy, district championships, academy leagues and so on,” said Anilkumar in a chat with The Hindu . “The company will be the sole branding rights holder for the next 12 years. Along with that, they have to create a Kerala Super League with a minimum of six to eight franchises in the first season next year and later on expand to 14 franchises in 14 districts.” Once the KSL becomes full-fledged in about five years, it could be a 10-month league which will offer a steady source of year-round income for the players. The Super League, which will virtually be owned by the new company, will make the Kerala Premier League — currently the State's top league — a second division league. Feeder league “The KPL may also become an under-21 event and it could be a feeder league for the Super League. And the Super League could be a feeder league for all the ISL teams. We will have a talent pool of some 240 players who can bought by the ISL clubs. That will also generate big money for the clubs,” explained Anilkumar. But with ISL clubs themselves claiming to lose big money every year, how will the KSL be a money-spinner? The answer, Anilkumar feels, lies in Kerala's unique passion for the sport. “We have large groups in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and in the US who are passionate about Kerala football. Clubs could invite them to become members, with about 10,000 people contributing Rs. 10,000 each. The live-streaming of the KPL this year has also shown that there is immense potential,” said Anilkumar. The bids will be closed on April 15 and in May an expert panel will pick the company which could open new doors for the sport here. It could be closely followed by many football associations and clubs all over the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kerala-to-have-a-new-super-league/article34219867.ece
02 April 2021||Auckland,||New Zealand sweeps T20 series||New Zealand beat Bangladesh by 65 runs in a rain-shortened third Twenty20 International here on Thursday to claim a clean 3-0 series sweep.

02 April 2021||DUBAI,||‘Umpire’s Call’ to remain, says ICC||The contentious ‘Umpire’s Call’ will continue to be a part of the Decision Review System, the International Cricket Council’s ruled on Thursday, but introduced a few changes to the current DRS protocols. As per the existing rule, 50% of the ball should be hitting at least one of the three stumps for the batsman to be adjudged LBW on review in case an umpire’s not out call has been challenged. “The Cricket Committee had an excellent discussion around Umpire’s Call and analysed its use extensively,” ICC’s Cricket Committee head Anil Kumble said in statement issued by the governing body after the end of its board meetings on Wednesday. “The principle underpinning DRS was to correct clear errors in the game whilst ensuring the role of the umpire as the decision-maker on the field of play was preserved...Umpire’s Call allows that to happen, which is why it is important it remains,” he added. Three minor changes The ICC introduced three minor changes to the DRS and third umpire protocols: “For LBW reviews, the height margin of the Wicket Zone will be lifted to the top of the stumps to ensure the same Umpire’s Call margin around the stumps for both height and width. “A player will also be able to ask the umpire whether a genuine attempt has been made to play the ball before deciding to review an LBW decision. “The third umpire will check a replay of any short run that has been called and correct any error prior to the next ball being bowled.” COVID-19 regulations will continue to be followed and the ICC also decided to allow seven additional players or support staff to accompany squads for its senior events. India can now travel with a 30-strong squad for the WTC final.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/umpires-call-to-remain-says-icc/article34219676.ece

02 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Navjot upbeat about India’s chances in Tokyo||Forward Navjot Kaur is upbeat about India’s chances in the upcoming Tokyo Olympics after two tough tours of Argentina and Germany following the resumption of international hockey earlier this year. The Indian women’s side displayed a lot of character against World No. 2 Argentina and heavyweight Germany despite not getting a win on both tours. “First and foremost we were excited to get back on the field after one whole year of no international competition for us,” said Navjot. “Of course, the results were not what we had desired against Argentina. Otherwise, I would say our performances — both individually and as a team — was good, be it against Argentina or Germany, we actually learnt a huge deal from these tours. “We also got a better understanding about how top sides in the world prepare for games, and aspects that we can fine-tune as a unit. There is a big difference between the top three sides and the rest of the world. Implementation “All of us became a lot more aware of our overall game, and where we need to get better. We implemented what we had worked on during our training sessions over the past year.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/navjot-upbeat-about-indias-chances-in-tokyo/article34220278.ece
02 April 2021||Chennai,||Hazlewood pulls out ‘for personal reasons’||Josh Hazlewood has pulled out of the upcoming IPL “for personal reasons”, his franchise Chennai Super Kings revealed on Thursday. The decision of the Australian paceman took “CSK by surprise”, its CEO K.S. Viswanathan admitted to The Hindu . Second Australian Hazlewood is the second Australian, the first being Mitchell Marsh, to give the IPL a skip. Marsh cited bio-bubble fatigue as the reason. Viswanathan said, “Whether there will be a replacement for Hazlewood will be decided by the team-management.” Hazlewood figured in three matches for CSK in the last edition. Back home, Hazlewood said, “I want to be in the best mental and physical shape for Australia's challenges in the long winter.” This includes a tour of the West Indies and perhaps Bangladesh, the World T20 and the marquee Ashes. Given the workload, Hazelwood reckoned a period of rest at home would enable him fire for Australia. Ngidi may miss a few games Meanwhile, South African paceman Lungi Ngidi is likely to miss the first few matches for CSK. Viswanathan said, “He has a series against South Africa at home and, following a period of quarantine, should be available for us from the third game.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hazlewood-pulls-out-for-personal-reasons/article34219632.ece

02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||How to lay an Easter egg||From pretty pastel marzipan shades to velvety chocolate hues and everything in between, there is a childlike wonder to receiving Easter eggs. It really does not matter if they are elaborately designed or just wrapped in shiny tin foil, the anticipation of being gifted one is well worth the wait. The fact you get them just at this time of year, makes them all the more desirable. Every other delicacy and baked delight can be conjured up at birthdays or Christmas or any other special occasion — except Easter eggs. And while egg-shaped chocolates with little toys inside can be bought off the shelf any day of the year now, there is still a lot of fun to be had in making your own Easter eggs. They may not look perfect the first time round, but the glorious mess and lingering aroma of hot chocolate or the sticky sweetness of marzipan that goes into fashioning one, will have you at it till you get it right. Though the process seems pretty straightforward, there are some directions you must keep in mind to achieve the desired ovoid result. First, the basics  You will need: Cooking chocolate, food thermometer, candy treats To begin with, one needs to melt chocolate to the right temperature. Called ‘tempering,’ this step is needed to keep the chocolate smooth and glossy and more importantly, to keep it from melting easily; a big plus when fashioning an Easter egg. So how do you temper chocolate? Firstly, never heat chocolate directly. Put two-thirds of your cooking chocolate in a bowl and hold it over a saucepan of boiling water. Keep stirring till it melts. Take it away from the heat and add the rest of the chocolate, all the while stirring so it melts too. “Make sure you use a food thermometer while tempering chocolate. It will break easily if the consistency is not right,” says Sunita Rebecca, a home baker from Hyderabad. Ideally, the temperature of the chocolate should not exceed 120°F for dark chocolate or 105°F for milk or white chocolate. Sounds tiresome? Rohit Thomas Kadicheeni of Silvis Creations, Kochi, recommends that first timers use compound chocolate instead of cooking chocolate, as it does not need tempering. “It doesn’t melt so fast either, making it easier to work with. Melt it, set it and your egg is done,” he says. However, he does warn against trying to melt a bar of store-bought chocolate. “It would need tempering too,” he cautions. Next, smear the melted chocolate on the insides of a mould with a basting brush. If you do not have a brush, swirl the chocolate around the insides of the mould and remove the excess. “If you don’t have a mould, reuse a Kinder Joy casing or any other rounded object to make your eggs,” says Meena Faszer, a home baker from Bengaluru. Online tutorials advocate the use of balloons for the same purpose. Next, refrigerate the mould for 10-15 minutes till the chocolate solidifies. Apply another layer of chocolate and refrigerate for another 10-15 minutes. Repeat the process for a third coat. Remember, the more layers you have, the stronger the ‘egg shell’. Once you are done with the layering process, ease the egg halves out of the moulds. Oiling the moulds before you begin makes this step easier and gives your egg shell a glossy finish. Fill one half of your egg with smaller sweet treats. Place the other half on a warm surface, just enough to melt the edges a bit and then ‘glue’ both the halves together. Voila! And there you have it — your very first Easter egg! “Once you have a number of eggs ready, decorating them is a fun family pastime — whether you are icing shapes or names on them or just getting them ‘basket ready’,” says Meena. You can decorate your eggs with melted chocolate or icing sugar. White chocolate or milk chocolate stands out if you are writing something on the egg, though you can use the same chocolate base for simple decorative designs. (It is also a great way to use up any extra melted chocolate). You can use icing sugar paste that can be coloured for brighter designs. Just fill up a piping bag and use different nozzles to make a variety of patterns.  If you don’t have a piping bag: Find a small plastic bag that is of a sturdy quality, roughly about the size of your palms. Fill it halfway with your icing of choice. Squeeze the filling to a corner of the plastic bag, giving it a conical shape and secure the opening with a rubber band or tape. Finally, cut the tip of the cone — you now have a home made piping bag. Keep in mind the surface area you will be working on. Snipping out a biggish piece of the corner will leave you with a lot of icing gushing out; which might be difficult to manage on a small egg. If you are fairly confident of your skills and/or have a steady hand, you can also roll up butter paper or parchment paper into a cone and use it instead of a piping bag. If not chocolate... “Easter eggs can be made with marshmallows too,” says Sunita Rebecca. “Melt marshmallows and add crushed rice Krispies to the mix and you get a pliable, colourful medium you can use to shape eggs.” Rice cereal is required to bring stiffness to the melted marshmallows, which would otherwise be too dilute to use. “Moisten your hands with water or dab butter on your palms to make the moulding easier,” advises Sunita. According to Srivatsan S. of Sri’s Cake Lab, Bengaluru, “Marzipan is a great medium to make Easter eggs as you can use a lot of colours on them.” Srivatsan, who has been creating themed Easter eggs this season, uses cashew paste instead of the traditional almond paste for his marzipan. “You have to realise this is a very delicate material and an oily substance as well, so don’t be discouraged if it doesn’t turn out well the first few times. You’ll eventually get the hang of it,” he says. Once you do, it is almost as versatile as edible play dough, and can be moulded into any shape on its own without casings. Though marzipan eggs are not hollow, Srivatsan says people have been known to customise them by placing useful items like stationery instead of candy inside. Once you have your fillings decided, all that is left is icing. Pour some icing sugar into a piping bag and just have fun!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/how-to-lay-an-easter-egg/article34219833.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||In the pink of summer||The summer heat is upon us. Thankfully, so is that underrated queen of summer fruits, the watermelon. The fruit is more versatile than most of us realise, lending itself not only to juices and salads, but also to sorbets, soups and kheer s. A bowl or plate heaped with watermelon slices is a simple summer joy. But if you are up for a challenge, and do not mind tinkering around the kitchen to bring out more from the fruit, there is plenty of fun to be had. Take, for instance, the simple chilled watermelon soup, inspired by the slightly more complex Spanish gazpacho that uses a blend of various produce. All you need for this soup is a blender, some spices to temper and ice cubes to chill it down, and you are good to go for a hot Sunday afternoon. Among salads, the first option, of course, is a simple watermelon and feta salad with a dash of lime juice and a toss of basil — recipes galore wherever you care to look for them. A less famous option is the nutty, light Thai watermelon salad. This is where the ingredients begin to get complicated — the dressing requires fish sauce, among other things. If you want to step it further up a notch, guidance is at hand. London- and Delhi-based Chef Alfred Prasad has popularly paired his grilled tiger prawns with a salad of melon, watermelon and arugula or rocket leaves, in a recipe featured byGreat British Chefs. For something more substantial (or more traditional), watermelon rind can be diced and cooked into both quick, crunchy stir-fries and sweet, tangy curries. These have always been a part of traditional North Indian kitchens, but, as Mumbai-based Chef Aaron Coutinho points out, have never been the most popular part of restaurant menus. “People are not used to sweet things like watermelon and sugarcane being used in savoury dishes. They might compliment you for trying something interesting, but they would hesitate to order it. There is a bit of a mental block there,” says the chef, who currently runs the virtual kitchen Chefcouts Food and Wellness. He adds, “Diners are far more open to the idea of the rind being used in condiments and kimchi s. Watermelon rind can be also be made into a pickle or a sweet and sour relish.” But do not let the publlc trends dictate your culinary adventures — the rind of a watermelon lends itself quite well to an Indian main course, reiterates Chef Aaron. “The watermelon itself can be chopped into cubes and cooked, but the rind is far more firm and retains its shape and crunch,” he says, “It also has a mild taste — slightly like raw papaya — and so it will take up the taste of whatever dish you decide to cook it into.” In desserts, again, you can choose between the simple and the not-so-simple options. Making granita — a sorbet-like dessert of frozen fruit — is straightforward in theory and needs minimal ingredients. However, the chilled blend of watermelon cubes, lemon juice, sugar and salt will have to be taken out of the fridge time and time again, to be scraped, frozen and re-scraped over and over again till it reaches just the right, crushed texture and dryness. Another option, as Chef Aaron suggests, is watermelon kheer . Once again, the mild flavour of the rinds are a point of advantage here. “Just grate it in,” he says, “Because it has such a mild taste, it will add plenty of body, without really changing the taste that you enjoy.”  Watermelon rind can be diced and cooked into both quick, crunchy stir-fries and sweet, tangy curries||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/in-the-pink-of-summer/article34219827.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Brick by brick Hard at work||The story so far: Neel and Mohit would like to avoid the heavy work but are dragged back by Mohit’s father JJ to do their bit.  Mohit’s Dad ‘JJ’ spoke rapidly as he walked ahead of the two boys. “By popular vote, it has been decided that, instead of working on several houses side by side, we will all work on one or two big houses first. Once these few are done, anyone who doesn’t have a roof over their heads can stay there until the other houses are ready. That way, if we have unexpected rain or something, everyone will be safe.” Neither of the boys said anything. “Your job,” said JJ, pointing to one of the biggest houses in the village, “is to pick up all the loose bricks around the broken fireplace and stack them neatly into the fireplace. Then we will cement over it and have just one smooth wall there. You think you can do that?” The boys nodded. There were people hard at work all around them, so the boys bent and started picking up fallen bricks. “A fireplace?” said Neel. “Is it ever cold enough to light a fire here?” Mohit stopped what he was doing. “Now that you bring it up, it most definitely is not! Arramandal is not a hill station! Maybe the owners wanted it to look like the houses in England or something.” “So, we have to work on the fireplace only because someone thought it fashionable to have a fireplace in their house!” “Well, we have to do it,” said Mohit. Job well done They set to work, sure that it would take just half an hour or so. But, to their surprise, it was almost dark by the time they finished. Mohit sighed. “Whew! That was a lot of work!” Neel looked around to make sure no one was listening and said, “Sure made up for all the work we’ve avoided so far, huh?” “Glad you acknowledge that you were avoiding work,” said a voice from behind the wall and both of them looked around guiltily to see Susan peeping at them. Neel and Mohit made faces at her and ran off to wash and have dinner. Then they went to their tents and fell into an exhausted sleep. They met again in the morning at breakfast. They had just finished eating when JJ came up to them with a stern face. “I thought I’d told you to fill up that fireplace…” he began. “We did!” said Mohit. “We did a great job!” Neel nodded vigorously. “Well it certainly doesn’t look that way now,” said JJ curtly as he walked away. “Go sort it out. Get it done!” The boys ran to the big house. The fireplace had been emptied of bricks. Once again, the bricks were lying all around. They stared disbelievingly — and then turned and saw Susan watching them. “You did this!” accused Neel. “You emptied the fireplace and tossed all the bricks around!”  To be continued   “A fireplace?” said Neel. “Is it ever cold enough to light a fire here.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/brick-by-brick-hard-at-work/article34220519.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A king’s welcome||The palm tree stood tall and erect. It refused to heed the mocking words of the olive, cedar and oak trees. They teased him all the time. Today, was no different. As the sun came up over the horizon, he heard their words of greeting. “Good morning, Tall-eeee,” said the cedar, loudly. “Why are you wasting your breath on that scarecrow early in the morning?” laughed the oak. “Oh! Just give him a break. After all, he is out on a limb,” sniggered the olive. The palm tree listened to their jibes. He was hurt, as always, but that didn’t help in any way. For as long as he could remember, he had been standing beside the cedar, the oak and olive on the eastern side of the old city wall. But this morning felt different. There seemed to be a tension in the air, a kind of excitement. Finally, unable to take their taunts in silence any longer, he said, “Say what you will. My day will come.” The other three trees burst into loud, raucous laughter. The palm tree ignored them and looked out into the horizon. Turn of events “That’s strange,” he thought. “There seems to be a lot of dust in the air. It’s moving too.” “Ummm…er…” he said trying to get the attention of the other trees. But they were still busy laughing at him. He shrugged and continued watching. The ball of dust seemed to be coming towards the eastern gate. It was going into Jerusalem. “Whatever can it be?” he wondered. As the column of dust drew nearer, he could see a man on a donkey. Behind him came others. As they neared the eastern gate, there was a cry of salutation. People rushed out of the gates, plucked the leaves off the palm and began to wave them in front of the man on the donkey. The cedar, olive and oak watched in stunned silence. Then the oak revived. He was old, and had seen many winters and summers. He was also wise and strong. He said, “Kings and conquerors used to be welcomed with palm leaves, in olden times. Also, palm leaves signify goodness, well-being, grandeur, steadfastness and victory.” The olive tree was overcome with shame. “I should have known better. After all, I am a sacred tree, and I symbolise peace and friendship. But, I have ignored my heritage and mocked the palm.” The cedar too was ashamed of his behaviour and apologised to the palm. “Who is that man? He doesn’t look like a king or a conqueror,” wondered the cedar. The olive tree said, “That is Jesus of Nazareth. He is making his triumphant entry into the city. It has been written in the holy book.”  This morning felt different. There seemed to be a tension in the air, a kind of excitement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/a-kings-welcome/article34220549.ece

02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The man with one sandal||Let’s begin the story of Jason and the Argonauts, one of the most popular tales in Greek mythology. Since this is a very long story, we’ll start with the birth of Jason. Pelias and Aeson were half-brothers who lived in Iolcus. Aeson was the son of the Cretheus, who ruled that city. But, when the king died, Pelias imprisoned Aeson and took over the kingdom. In a bid to keep him safe, Aeson’s son Jason was sent away to be brought up by Chiron, the centaur. (In Greek mythology, centaurs were half-horse, half-human creatures.) Chiron was known for his wisdom and strength; so Jason grew up to be a strong and smart young man. In the meanwhile, Pelias had consulted the oracle at Delphi to find out if he would stay on as king and received a cryptic message: “Beware the man with one sandal”. What he did not know was that Goddess Hera was very angry with him because he had stopped people from worshipping her and also murdered his stepmother at the altar of the goddess’ temple. Claiming his birthright When Jason turned 20, Chiron told him the truth about his birth, who his parents were and why he’d been brought up with the centaurs. The young man then decided that he would get his throne back. So he set off for Iolcus. On the way, he had to cross the river Anauros. When he reached the banks, he saw an old woman there. Jason asked, “What are you doing here, mother?” The old woman looked at him and said, “I need to cross the river but I am afraid that the current will sweep me away.” Jason had a kind heart so he offered to take her across. So the woman climbed on to his back and Jason stepped into the waters. Though he made it across, the swiftly flowing river took away one of his sandals. When they reached the other side, the old woman blessed him and went away. Jason continued his journey, not knowing that he had actually helped Hera, who had disguised herself to see what kind of a man he was. When Jason arrived at Iolcus, the people were celebrating the festival of Poseidon, the sea god. Pelias was shocked to see Jason arrive with one sandal; the prophecy had come true. When Jason explained who he was, Pelias cunningly agreed to step down from the throne if Jason would prove his worth by bringing the Golden Fleece from the land of Colchis. Everyone knew that the Golden Fleece was guarded by a dragon and Pelias was sure that Jason would never come back alive.  (To be continued)   To keep him safe, Aeson’s son Jason was brought up by Chiron, the centaur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/the-man-with-one-sandal/article34220527.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Did the zebra cross the road?||Do you know what a zebra crossing is? No, not the magnificent striped animal that we’re all familiar with. A zebra crossing refers to the white lines on our roads, especially at traffic signals. These are, perhaps, the most people-friendly parts of our cities because traffic has to stop to allow pedestrians to cross the road safely. Unfortunately, we don’t always follow this rule. Where did the idea come from? Initially, these stark white stripes on black tarred roads were not called “zebra crossings”. In the 1930s, this was an experiment in England to allow pedestrians to cross roads because London’s traffic was quite messy and there was no systematic way or space for people to get across. One day, a British politician visiting a trial crossing spontaneously called them ‘Zebra Crossing’ and the name stuck! Zebra crossings are today well recognised globally and have also inspired other crossings. A town in Spain, for example, decided to replace the stripes with polka dots. This was because cows in their area had dotted patches on their skin. These were called “Cow Crossings” to highlight how important cows were to their area. In Hong Kong, a yellow-and-black pattern was called “Tiger Crossings”. In Australia, Zebra crossings on top of a flat hump are known as “Wombat Crossings”. The inspiration: the marsupial common to the continent. Then there are rainbow striped pedestrian crossings inspired by the gay pride in Finland, Sweden and Paris. Though the zebra did not inspire the original “zebra crossing”, have you wondered why the animal is striped? Especially as this makes it visible to predators like the lion. The answer lies in its habitat. There are three species of zebras and all are found in areas in which the irritating horsefly and tsetse fly are common. Researchers think that the zebras evolved this pattern to keep the flies away. In one experiment, they covered horses with a cloth that had a pattern similar to that of a zebra and found that though the flies came close to the body, the black-and-white stripes confused them. So the flies either did not alight on the body at all or crashed into the hide.  Zebra crossings are the most people-friendly parts of our cities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/did-the-zebra-cross-the-road/article34220555.ece

Joe is not used to having anyone around but slowly builds a bond with the lively little girl. One day, Joe gives Peyton nuts to eat, not knowing she is allergic to them. Peyton is hospitalised and her legal guardian, her aunt Karen, arrives. What does this mean for Joe and Peyton? Why did Sara not tell him about his daughter? Will Karen take the girl away or will she continue to live with her father?  Fun innings  Originally, Joe Kingman was supposed to be a part of the New England Patriots, but negotiating with the National Football League (NFL) became difficult for producers. So they made up their own name for the team. Two bulldogs, Tubbs and Tank, shared the role of Spike. To get the dog to lick Dwayne Johnson’s hand, they covered it in a blended mix of tuna and other foods. Director Andy Fickman and Dwayne Johnson, who are fans of Elvis Presley, added many references to the rock star in the movie.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/living-life-king-size/article34220579.ece

Carrot: Hold it! So what if you are bright red? Though I often appear orange, my cousins have an array of colours — purple, yellow, red, and even white.  Tomato: But botanists classify me as a berry. I am not really a veggie.  Onion :That doesn’t make you any better than us. In fact, you are a misfit in our salad. And what about your dark secret? You were once looked upon with suspicion. If anybody drank your juice from a lead container, they would end up getting poisoned.  Tomato: But that is because the acid in me would dissolve the lead. Nobody uses lead containers now.  Carrot: I, Bugs Bunny’s favourite, have every reason to be considered the most important. I can prevent night blindness in humans as I am rich in vitamin A. And I make their skins glow.  Potato :Now, now, look who is pompous. It is common knowledge that too much of carrots can make the skin of humans appear yellow. I have my store of Vitamin C and other nutrients too. I should be considered the superhero on this plate.  Onion: Ha, ha, you are a shapeless champion. Those who eat you turn into shapeless couch potatoes too.  Potato: Only if they eat me as fries and chips and not when they boil or roast me. Did you know, in the Andes, they grow 4,000 varieties of potatoes? Purple, yellow, pink, red, blue, orange, pink with yellow spots and yellow with pink spots.  Spinach :Hear, hear. May I ask why you have so many eyes on you?

Spinach: Well, don’t forget, Popeye the Sailor Man has become legendary because many children began eating me after watching him. I am rich in iron.  Chilli(getting angry): Will you all stop blowing your own trumpets? You may be rich in various nutrients, but humans can’t do without me.

02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Let the world know how curious you are.||Why do snakes shed their skin?  In humans, the skin grows as the person grows. But for snakes it doesn’t happen that way. As the reptile grows, the skin stretches and finally reaches a point where it can’t do so any more. A new layer of skin develops under the old one and once that is ready the snake peels off the top layer. This is called ecdysis. This also helps remove any parasites that have attached themselves to the snake. A snake that is ready to shed its skin will rub itself against a stone or a log of wood to create a tear and then glide out leaving an intact shell. On an average, older snakes shed their snakes around four times a year while younger ones may do so every two weeks.    Why do peoplecut cakes on their birthdays?  The practice of cake cutting is said to have originated from Greek traditions. Ancient Greeks made bread mixed with honey and nuts called ‘plakous’ (from which the word flat originates) to celebrate birthdays. They also made ‘satura’, which was a heavy, round cake, as an offering to Artemis, the moon goddess. To make the cake glow like the moon, they placed lighted candles on them. This eventually evolved to the cake cutting practice that we have today.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-the-world-know-how-curious-you-are/article34220514.ece

02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Melody, the hero||For some weeks now, the songs of the Kannada film Hero , produced by and starring Rishab Shetty, and directed by newcomer M. Bharath Raj, have been quite the talking point. The film was shot during lockdown, and its heartwarmingly melodious songs and background score that speak of love and loss have been composed by Ajaneesh Loknath, who is currently basking in the success of the film’s music. Growing up in Bhadravathi, in the rain-drenched Malnad region of Karnataka, music composer Ajaneesh Loknath was surrounded by music from childhood. His influences were many — his grandmother, who was a veena artiste as well as his musician-parents. TheRojaimpact Ajaneesh is a child of the 90s, and predictably A.R. Rahman’s Roja was an album that he instantly connected to. Ironically though, his own BGM tracks and orchestration are often likened by fans with the musical sensibility of maestro Ilaiyaraaja. The 35-year-old Ajaneesh waves that away. “He is a class apart,” he says, “I’m still at the beginning of my journey.” Though he was trained in classical music, his journey with sound began with Roja . He reels off a series of Rahman’s albums — Kizhakku Seemayile , Rangeela , Taal , Kaadhalan , Boys , Thiruda Thiruda — that were a part of his playlists during his growing-up years in Bhadravathi, the steel town near Shivamogga. He also listened to the compositions of the legendary M.S. Viswanathan, along with songs from films like the Malayalam His Highness Abdullah and the Kannada Sandhya Raga . “I learnt to play the Carnatic flute and piano. And with all the music that I have listened to, I tried to create a sound of my own,” says Ajaneesh. In fact, while recording the hit number ‘Nenapina’ from Hero , he was reminded of the late violin maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman. “I wondered how he might have handled the raga. That violin section is an ode to him,” he says. Ajaneesh, who has been delivering a slew of hit songs, says he never approaches a project with a preconceived idea. “That reduces the ability to be creative. We then tend to work within a template,” he adds. Not just Karnataka, the young composer has fans in Tamil Nadu and Kerala too. “Classical music is in our DNA,” he says. The song, ‘Baananchige oduva baara’, from Hero is proof of his inventive use of melody, where he makes the most of the plaintive notes of the violin. “I worked on it after they shot the visuals. Luckily, I’d done something like that for Priyadarshan’s Nimir in Tamil, for the song ‘Eppodhum unmael nyabagam’, so it helped. . The lyrics of ‘Baananchige’ were haunting and helped me get into the mood. The violin is an integral part of the movie.” He wanted to use the sitar and veena too, and Rajhesh Vaidhya came on board for that. “He recorded and sent it back to me within 20 minutes. He is amazing.” The trailer of Hero also celebrates the violin, with the tune a beautiful combination of Thodi, Chakravakam and Bhairavi. Over the years, Ajaneesh has struck a great rapport with many in the industry. He especially speaks of music composer C.R. Bobby, for whom he played the keyboard during his early days. The composer credits Bobby, also his founding partner at Abbs Studio with being the wind beneath his wings. “At one point, she pushed me to the forefront and stepped back. She knew about my capabilities, which even I was not aware of.”  While his songs might be hits, what Ajaneesh enjoys most is composing the background score. “BGM can enrich or mar a film. It can elevate a scene, and you work with so many emotions.” “I have experimented with many sounds,” he says. “I use jazz and other influences, but the soul has to be Indian.”  The writer is   a Mangalore-based freelance journalist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/melody-the-hero/article34220043.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The balancing act||One of the striking features of Kerala’s classical theatre forms is the concept of the use of space. Even while presenting larger-than-life mythological narratives, the size of the stage used in Koodiyattam or Kathakali is ideally around 150 sq. ft. The theory of body kinetics in these art forms emphasises the use of the eyes, face and the entire body in minimal space with the least movements to create the maximum impact. The act of lifting a mountain or crossing an ocean, for example, is done more with limbs and muscles and not through spatial movement. Koodiyattam goes even further in certain plays, and practically shrinks the stage to a wooden stool or peetam that is about 2 ft in diameter. One such instance is in the play Asokavanikankam, where Ravana, seeing Sita for the first time from his airborne chariot, is overcome with wonder and passion. Two descriptive segments Acting out the sloka ‘Indranimaham’ while standing on the peetam also involves two popular descriptive segments of Koodiyattam — ‘Kailasoddharanam’ and ‘Parvathiviraham’. While the former requires the actor to have a supple body to describe how Ravana tossed up Mount Kailas when his flying chariot was blocked by the mountain, the latter demands an expressive face to narrate the Siva and Parvati dialogue. Watching this solo act by Nepathya Rahul Chakyar at Nepathya Moozhikkulam in a four-hour ‘Nirvahanam’ or Retrospective segment is a lesson on how to use the body in Koodiyattam. Rahul was on the peetam for nearly two and a half hours, beginning from Ravana describing Sita’s beauty to recalling his visit to the prison where he had imprisoned the celestial beauties. To narrate how he saw Parvati doleful and angry, Ravana first describes the story of how he lifted and threw Mount Kailas. Only in the last segment of ‘Parvathiviraham,’ did the dancer get to sit down. Creating an imaginary mountain for the audience is no easy task. As he marvels at the majestic Kailas, Rahul stands tall on the stool, bends sideways, leans backwards, stands on tiptoe, and stoops low to trace the contours of the mountain. Then he goes on to describe its various features such as caves and sheer rock faces. Supported by the vibrant mizhavu and idakka drums, Rahul makes the audience experience water dropping from the mountain’s crevices and gathering strength to form a river. Rahul uses the peetam as if it was an extension of his limbs and finally he uproots the mountain and tosses it up high into the sky. Less action space How does this act differ from his other Koodiyattam roles? Rahul says there is much less freedom when standing on the stool and one has to scale down movements. The attaprakaram or the stage manual makes no allowance for changes in costume or actions in the descriptive passages to offset the space constraints. The challenge, says Rahul, is to create the same impact within the limited space. Performing while standing on a stool demands more concentration and stamina, since one has to always be aware of the foot position while at the same time maintaining the right expressions. The inputs needed, therefore, to create the same viewer experience are more when performing in a space that is a fraction of the normal stage. Rahul has performed this role twice before but in a pacha costume. This is the first time he is doing it in Ravana’s kathi make-up, which is more difficult because of the bigger headgear. “Rigorous practice is essential to avoid even a small misstep,” says Rahul. Initial lessons, when his guru taught him this sequence, took roughly one month. Nowadays, he practises for about a week before such a performance. Rahul believes that the beauty of Koodiyattam lies in creating a big impact by using one’s eyes and body to project maximum energy.

02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||From pirouette to pen||“My dance is my mirror,” said Pt. Birju Maharaj, when asked about his vast repertoire of skills. Through the lockdown last year, he was busy writing Brij Shyam Kahe ( So says Brij Shyam), a collection of poetic compositions arranged into 15 types of musical and literary genres. The poetic format offers ideas for imagery that can be used in dance. Published by the Emami Foundation, the compilation is more a reflection of the journey undertaken by the dancer, teacher and guru, who communicates here the aesthetics of dance through poetry. Pt. Birju Maharaj, who uses the pen name Brij Shyam, expands on some of his philosophy in this interview. Edited excerpts: How did you take to writing poetry and what do you want to convey through it?  Kathak is the basis of my poetic journey. There are different levels to the process — from dance to poetry and back to dance — Shruti (the heard word), Smriti (the remembered word), and Srijan (creativity). From my mother, Mahadai, and several other elders, I listened to the poetry written by my grandfather, Pt. Bindadin Maharaj, for dance. In the beginning, I did not write my name with my compositions and used the name ‘Binda Shyam’; even now, when I use my name ‘Brij Shyam,’ it is as an offering to my gurus. These poems have been penned to help dancers think before creating a piece. They are also about the cultural ecology that has nurtured Kathak. For instance, the idea of Krishna (Natwar); Kathak is ‘Natwar Nritya,’ the dance of Krishna. While some poems are on festivals, such as Hori of Braj, others are on the leelas (plays) of gods. In these poems, I seek to capture the world from which Kathak derives its content. The dominance of the emotions of shringar (love) and bhakti in the verses are illustrative of conditioning the mind for dance. “Do nayan ke madhya mein, base Radhika Shyam, palak band kari dhyan mein, sada rahat ‘Brij Shyam’.” ( Brij Shyam’s eyes remain closed in meditation, and always hold dear the vision of Radhika and Shyam.) The poem titled ‘Bichaaraa Shabd’ (helpless spoken word) shows your use of simple language. How does the spoken/ written word connect with dance? Indian classical dancers work with two kinds of languages. The first is the usual Hindi, English, Tamil, etc. Then there is the language of dance expressed in the grammar of movement, rhythm, or bhava; or through mnemonic syllables ( bols ). Using simple language, I hope, will boost their imagination to churn, create, and compose.  In your poems, you often mention guru , dhyaan and jap . How do they relate to dance? These terms provide direction to a journey . The true meaning of ‘guru,’ as I have understood, is the one who provides light and the technique to remove ignorance through a knowledge system. From my lived experience, the idea of ‘dhyaan’ is focused reflection, and ‘jap’ is reflective meditation. These are the ways I prepare myself to enter the world of dance. Different artistes have their means to engage with the creative world. For instance, my grandfather, a dancer, writer and composer, when asked to perform in the Awadh or Bhopal court, would place a  salagram  in front of the tabla before beginning his performance. Salagram is a fossilised shell that represents the omniscient energy of Vishnu. For Maharaj Bindadin, the performance was always a ritual exploring truth and understanding the self. Once the performance was over, my grandfather would first bow and retrieve the  salagram  and then turn to salute his patron king.  When you say dhyaan and jap dictate your creative consciousness, how do you relate that to the chakkars that dominate Kathak performances?  The chakkars (pirouettes) are one of the many elements that make a composition. However, chakkars and acrobatic stunts such as jumps are disruptive to the poetry of the pieces. In fact, in my view, used them excessively reflect a wavering mind caught in a world of m aya (illusion). The performer is more concerned about arriving at the climax with a bang and revelling in the thunder of audience applause.  Your engagement with the concept of ‘line’ is evident in your poetry and dance. For instance, there are poems written as couplets (dohas) or as quatrains (chaupai). Can you tell us about the importance of ‘line’? Lines are the basis for my experiential journey in creativity. They provide a specific direction, chronology, continuity and clarity of thought. In Kathak, the movement and line connection is essential. As in poetry, there should be continuity in the dance movement. Thus, any dance movement has a line that marks the three parts — beginning, body and end. Unfortunately, today, many Kathak dancers merely focus on the beginning and the end of movements without engaging with the body, making the dance soul-less. You have expressed your creativity through dance, singing, playing instruments, painting, and now writing. What is it you search for? In a poem, I write, ‘Ek anek roop mein dekhiyo.’ I travel to see and seek the unity of being in different forms and different routes, a pilgrimage towards one goal — to find myself.  So, who are you? My dance is my mirror. I am without a form and merely a vichaar dhara (thought process).  The writer is a Kathak artiste and cultural critic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/from-pirouette-to-pen/article34220067.ece
02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The spirit of sufi||For the past 58 years, Bhubaneswar Music Circle (BMC) has been quietly but committedly promoting Indian classical music. One of the oldest institutions of its kind in India and the only one in Odisha, the Music Circle works more as a movement, with no established office and with financial support from members. While the monthly concert series it has been hosting for over three decades showcases young talents from across the country, its much-awaited national music festival features the stalwarts. For the past nine years, BMC has widened its reach by conducting an annual Sufi music festival titled, Samarpan (surrender). The three-day festival, which has the support of the State government, celebrates the diverse forms of sufi — spiritual, mystical and devotional. From the baul of Bengal and bargeet of Assam to Maharashtra’s abhang and Afghanistan’s qawaali, the festival has over the years been presenting the essence of the sufi tradition. Perfect start The just-concluded ninth edition of the festival held at Rabindra Mandap, Bhubaneswar, featured six artistes from across the country. The mood of the inaugural evening was set by Odisha’s Sangita Gosain with a song that said, “Thou makes my life eternally musical”. It was one of the eight songs in Odia that she presented in her concert titled Bibhu Vandana (ode to the omnipresent). The simplicity of the lyrics coupled with her emotive and melodious rendition magnified the beauty of the compositions. Anadi Mishra, who was introduced as “the youngest Grade A singer of India and a three-time award winner at the National Youth Festival, who works as a singer, actor and music director in Jalandhar and Mumbai”, did not live up to the claims. Since Sufi music is about soul, the mood matters more than the the technique or style. However, in an attempt to impress listeners, the team that used keyboard, octopad, dholak, tabla and dholak created less music and more cacophony. The second evening helped the audience experiencethe true spirit of Sufi music. Sponsored by the Indian Council of Cultural Relations, Jenab Rajab Ali Bharti from Kota in Rajasthan, who belongs to the Seniya gharana, performed for the first time in Odisha. He presented songs by Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, Kabir and Baba Bulleh Shah. Despite being a playback singer in television and cinema, Rajab opted for minimum accompaniments, – tabla and guitar – which had the maximum impact.  Sohini Basu from Kolkata, the other artiste of the evening, presented an exclusive concert of Nazrul Geeti, songs of Kazi Nazrul Islam, equally loved and revered in India and Bangladesh. The revolutionary poet, a Muslim by birth, penned over 500 songs in praise of the Hindu gods. Sohini performed eight such songs. The singer’s brief but lucid introduction of the spiritual music tradition of Bengal with special reference to Rabindranath Tagore and Nazrul, helped the audience appreciate the songs better. She touched hearts with her very first rendition that was on Shiva, the presiding deity of Bhubaneswar. Sohini sang from within, without any attempt to impress her listeners. She even declined demands for singing other songs, staying faithfully focused on Nazrul, her brief for the evening. Assam’s Sangeeta Chamuah, the first performer on the last day of the festival, didn’t stay true to the tradition of Bargeet — the 500-year-old songs composed by Srimanta Sankardeva and Madhavdeva. Instead of the khol, she used the tabla. Also, none of the accompanying instrumentalists were from Assam. Hence, the traditional flavour was missing in her concert. As expected, the acclaimed Sanjiv Abhyankar’s concert provided a fitting finale to the festival. Accompanied by three gifted accompanists — Abhinay Ravande on the harmonium, Ajinkya Joshi on the tabla, and Apurv Dravid on side-rhythm — the versatile vocalist presented ‘Abhang Rang’ .  With his eight carefully chosen abhangs, six in Marathi and two in Hindi, byEknath Maharaj, Sant Namdev, Meera Bai and Sant Tukaram and apt explanations, he familiarised the audience with this music tradition of Maharashtra.

02 April 2021||April 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The four-hour challenge||A four-hour Carnatic concert can be quite the feat to attempt. Sunaadalahari, the musical wing of the Indira Ranganathan Trust, has been organising a monthly series of such marathons in an effort to revive the old practice when concerts would go on for hours. It was the young and upcoming vocalist Bharat Narayanan who entered the lists this time. While his assets include a voice with a good range and timbre, the young artiste needs to focus a little more on time management, and his rendition left a little something to be desired. ‘Vanajakshi’, the Kalyani Ata tala varnam, was indeed a good start. So was Muthiah Bhagavatar’s composition ‘Ghum Ganapathey’ in Hamsadhwani. As it was a Sunday, Dikshitar’s Navagraha kriti ‘Suryamurthe’ in Sowrashtram was an apt choice too. Bharat did manage to package a variety of ragas and compositions, including Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Iyengar’s ‘Samayamitheyani’ in Devamanohari and Dr. M. Chandrasekaran’s ‘Dharmavati’ in Dharmavati raga. He went on to a treatment of Nattakurinji in which his sincere effort to bring out the beauty of the raga was evident in his rendition. But, due to a somewhat disorganised collection of phrases, this didn’t have much of an impact. His delivery of the composition — Syama Sastri’s ‘Mayamma nannu brova’ — does deserve credit for its sobriety as well as a creative take on ‘Shyamale neelotpale’ and the swara section. The same problem with disorganised phrases could be seen later, when he essayed Sankarabharanam for his centrepiece. The composition this time was a swarajati by his mother, the musician Baby Sreeram, along the lines of Syama Sastri’s ‘Amba Kamakshi’. Unfortunately, here he tried to weave in swaras landing on every charanam line; the result was more a maze of swaras than a calculated approach. Unusual thani The camaraderie between Bharat and violinist R. Raghul enhanced the concert. And with time at their disposal, nearly an hour was offered to the percussionists, B. Sivaraman (mridangam) and K.V. Gopalakrishnan (kanjira). The rhythmic exchanges between the duo were subtle, strong and electrifying . Other ragas and kritis included in the lengthy agenda were Nayaki (‘Dayaleni prathukemi’ by Tyagaraja), Hindolam (‘Maanavakula bhooshanam,’ composed by G.N. Balasubramaniam in praise of Tyagaraja), Malavi (‘Rama nee dasudane’ by Voleti Venkateswarulu), Varamu (‘Maname unakku’ by T.M. Tyagarajan), Suddha Saranga (Thiruppugazh) and a thillana, again by Baby Sreeram. Personally speaking, I think four-hour concerts are bound to be daunting for musicians and rasikas both. Times have changed and so have tastes. Such marathon concerts need extraordinary expertise and may be challenging for budding artistes. A concert’s quality is decided not by its length but by its eminence.

Written more or less in a chronological fashion, the book begins in colonial Calcutta where Banks found his place in the flourishing music scene. His talent bloomed especially as a bandleader with the ability to bring out the best in the musicians working with him. The book evokes memories of those glamorous Calcutta evenings and traces Banks’ collaborations with the legendary Pam Craine, Don Saigal, Braz Gonsalves and Carlton Kitto until his migration to Bombay at the invitation of R.D. Burman Banks’ versatility and his ability to adapt to changing trends and times are highlighted in the book. Here was a composer who could easily shift from the intelligent music-making of jazz or producing lengthy soundtracks for musicals to easy film tunes and 60-second ad jingles. Banks’ promoted the Indi-pop sound of Alisha Chinoy and other artistes of the time, and his pioneering Indo-jazz fusion creations with the bands Sangam and Silk also emerged. But Banks has not forgotten his first love — jazz. He has gone on to produce original material with drummer-son Gino Banks while establishing a vibrant Indo-jazz scene by kickstarting numerous bands. The book, however, loses out by straying from the music. Metaphors and hyperbole take the reader away from the central theme. The last chapters, for instance, are dedicated to eulogies to Banks by different musicians. The book falters in not being an objective biography of an extraordinary musician, but more a hagiography by a starry-eyed fan.

Dharmendra Malik, media in-charge, BKU, said following the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s decision, the BKU, which is leading the protest against the contentious farm laws, has decided to take the protest peacefully to Parliament in the next session. “BJP spokespersons are repeatedly saying that there is nothing black in the farm laws. We challenge them to come on a public platform and we will explain to them what is wrong with the laws,” Mr. Malik said. He took on the government for being eager to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the European Union on dairy industry. “After snatching our farming, the government is planning to wean us of our dairy farming. Along with the farm laws, we oppose the FTA on dairy industry as well. It will help importing dairy products from big players like Denmark and will affect local farmers,” he said. Addressing, the labourers, salaried class and Army men, Mr. Malik said after farmers, the government would target other groups for its vested interest. Rajveer Singh, vice-president of the State unit of BKU, said farmers hadn’t lost hope. “The government is trying to tire us out. We are responding accordingly. As farmers are busy with wheat and sugarcane crops till the end of April, we call farmers of one village to carry out the protest for a day. Ghaziabad alone has more than 160 villages,” he said.

Mr. Sisodia said that the meeting with Mr. Joshi was a fruitful one with discussions on how the Delhi government and DU could collaborate to provide innovative and high-quality higher education to the students of Delhi. Over the past few months, 12 DU colleges that are fully funded by the Delhi government have raised complaints over delays in the release of grants and appointment of senior administrative officers to the colleges. Earlier, the varsity had written to the Delhi government seeking a withdrawal of the order. “The governing body [GB] of the colleges is the appointing authority of all the non-teaching posts... and accordingly, appointment of non-teaching posts are made by the GB in consonance with the eligiblity criteria and mode of recruitment envisaged under the new Recruitment Rules, 2020, notified by the university in this behalf,” the letter had read. Further, in its communication to the government, the varsity had added that issuance of such orders were contrary to the recruitment rules and other university statutes and ordinances. The university had also sought a withdrawal of the order, citing that it is “not tenable”. Meanwhile, the university also said that a multi-tier process of deliberations on the Higher Education Commission of India was being developed. “A core team has been constituted to collect the observations, concerns and suggestions from all the stakeholders. All the colleges of DU were divided into five clusters and one college within each cluster was given the responsibility to hold meetings with the other colleges in the respective clusters,” said Vikas Gupta, DU Registrar.

02 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Withdrawing transport allowance is mindless’||Responding to a circular issued by the JNU administration on recovery of transport allowance during the COVID-19 lockdown, citing a Ministry of Finance directive, the JNU Teachers’ Association on Thursday said that the attempt to recover the allowance was bereft of any logic. The circular states that transport allowance is not payable during the period to those who have not attended office physically. “Seeking details of physical attendance in office from March 23 to May 20, 2020, when people were forced to work from home due to the lockdown, appears odd. The fact that the lockdown specifically mandated people to stay at home and not step out unless there were emergencies, seems forgotten,” the JNUTA said. The JNUTA said that for the administration to now gather details of physical attendance of employees a year back seems mindless. “There are a number of other circulars that have been issued by the Finance Ministry which are of benefit to all employees. However, unlike the circular dealing with recovery of transport allowance, the university administration has not shown the same alacrity in dealing with matters that directly benefit employees,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/withdrawing-transport-allowance-is-mindless/article34220193.ece
