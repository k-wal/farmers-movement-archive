25 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||20 people die overnight due to oxygen crisis at Delhi hospital||Twenty seriously ill COVID-19 patients died overnight at Jaipur Golden Hospital in northwest Delhi on Friday due to an “oxygen crisis”. The death toll due to medical oxygen shortages in the capital rose to at least 45 — with the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital reporting 25 oxygen-related deaths early on Friday. “20 critically ill COVID patients died last night over [an] oxygen crisis. The oxygen stock was never completely dry, but the pressure was low as we were running out of stock,” Dr. D.K. Baluja, medical director of the hospital, told The Hindu . The Delhi High Court also heard the plea of hospitals on oxygen shortage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/20-people-die-overnight-due-to-oxygen-crisis-at-delhi-hospital/article34404956.ece
25 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||State witnessing steady rise in COVID-19 cases||The State on Saturday added 26,685 new cases of COVID-19 to its tally when the results of 1,31,155 samples tested over the past 24 hours came in. The test positivity rate showed a slight dip, dropping from 21.78% to 20.35%. Even this seems to have brought relief in small measure to a State which saw seven new records in daily case numbers in the past seven days. Six districts reported over 2,000 cases each, while another four had over 1,000 new cases each, indicating that disease transmission, which used to be intense in northern districts, is now beginning to be felt uniformly throughout the State. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions have been steadily on the rise and as on Saturday the State has 1,279 critically ill patients being cared for in ICUs, with 370 requiring ventilator assistance. The cumulative case burden of the State ever since the pandemic began now stands at 13,77,186 cases. The active case pool is poised to hit the two lakh mark and on Saturday had 1,98,576 patients. This is in sharp contract against the State’s active caseload during the first peak in October last, when the number of patients was slightly over 97,000 cases. The number of COVID patients currently being treated in hospitals in the State is 18,415, with 3,476 persons newly admitted on Saturday. Large-scale testing is thus helping in tracing and isolating thousands of patients with mild or asymptomatic infections. At present, a total of 4,13,172 persons are in home or institutional isolation. On Saturday, 7,067 persons were reported to have recovered from the disease. The total recoveries now number 11,73,202. 25 deaths The addition of 25 new deaths to the toll took the cumulative toll in the State to 5,080 deaths. Kozhikode reported 10 deaths, Thiruvanthapuram, Ernakulam and Wayanad three each, while one death each was reported from Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Idukki, Thrissur and Malappuram The active case pool in Ernakulam went up to 32,164 patients. Of these, 2,043 patients have been hospitalised. In Thiruvananthapuram, where the active case pool has risen to 14,051 cases, has the highest hospital admissions at 2,270 patients. Pathanamthitta, which has 7,607 active cases, has hospitalised 1,187 patients. Five districts have 2,000 or slightly less hospitalised patients – Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Thrissur, Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram. District-wise split Among districts, Kozhikode reported the highest number of new cases at 3,767, followed by Ernakulam 3,320, Malappuram 2,745, Thrissur 2,584, Thiruvananthapuram 2,383, Kottayam 2,062, Kannur 1,755, Alappuzha 1,750, Palakkad 1,512, Kollam 1,255, Pathanamthitta 933, Kasaragod 908, Wayanad 873 and Idukki 838.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-witnessing-steady-rise-in-covid-19-cases/article34405110.ece
25 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBI files FIR against Anil Deshmukh||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducted searches at various places after registering a case in connection with the corruption allegations against former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and unknown others. “The searches were carried out on the premises of Mr. Deshmukh in Mumbai and Nagpur. The premises of his personal secretary in Mumbai was also searched,” said a CBI official. The First Information Report (FIR), which was registered on April 21, was based on the findings of a preliminary enquiry initiated on the directions of the Bombay High Court on April 5. “The preliminary enquiry prima facie revealed that a cognisable offence is made out in the matter, wherein the then Home Minister of Maharashtra, Anil Deshmukh, and unknown others attempted to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty,” said the FIR. A petition filed by former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh in the High Court mentioned that the then Home Minister and others exercised undue influence over the transfer and posting of officials. Mr. Deshmukh allegedly told some police officers to collect Rs. 100 crore every month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Parties react The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Shiv Sena and the Congress, allies in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, on Saturday condemned the CBI’s action of registering an FIR. NCP’s State president Jayant Patil said, “This is nothing but an attempt to defame Anil Deshmukh. He has been co-operating with the CBI in this investigation from the start. This is nothing but misuse of power.” Sena MP Sanjay Raut questioned the CBI’s move as the court had only ordered it to conduct a preliminary inquiry. Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said, “Sachin Vaze himself is under arrest while Mr. Singh is under scanner for helping Mr. Vaze.” The BJP retorted that CBI was working on the orders of the court. Leader of Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar said, “The court had ordered that the inquiry be completed in 15 days and granted permission to CBI to move ahead if it found strong pieces of evidence.” (With inputs from Alok Deshpande)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cbi-files-fir-against-anil-deshmukh/article34405609.ece

25 April 2021||Mumbai,||Third sero survey: antibodies in 36.30% samples in Mumbai||The third sero survey conducted within Mumbai has shown the presence of antibodies in 36.30% samples out of the total 10,197. The survey’s results show the sero positivity rate has increased in non-slum areas compared with slum areas. “Around 35.02% of the total male samples have shown sero positivity, while it was 37.12% in the total female samples,” an official said. The sero survey in slum areas has shown the sero positivity at 41.6%, which has come down from 57% in July 2020 and 45% in August 2020. In non-slum areas, the sero positivity was registered in 28.5% samples, which increased from 16% in July 2020 and 18% in August 2020. According to the health department officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the second wave of the novel coronavirus in Mumbai has resulted in an increase in the number of patients from non-slum areas compared to slum areas. “The sero survey results are in tandem with this,” said an official. The department has recommended that intensifying vaccinations among the general public will be the best way to control the spread of the coronavirus. The first sero survey in Mumbai was conducted in July 2020 and later in August 2020. The third survey was conducted in March 2021 in all 24 wards of the BMC. The survey included blood samples from the corporation’s labs and private labs. The samples of only those who had not been vaccinated were collected. The sero positivity test was conducted at the Molecular Biology Laboratory of the BMC at Kasturba Hospital.  35.02% of the total male samples have shown sero positivity, while it was 37.12% in the female samples Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/third-sero-survey-antibodies-in-3630-samples-in-mumbai/article34405607.ece
25 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Breakthrough infections new concern||The increasing number of COVID-19 reinfections following natural infections and vaccine breakthrough infections amongst fully vaccinated health-care workers in Kerala is emerging as a new concern even as experts reiterate that these are “rare but expected events” when lakhs are vaccinated. They point out that immune-escape variants of SARS-CoV-2 can also contribute to an increase in reinfections and potentially have an adverse effect on the efficacy of vaccines, leading to breakthrough infections. Rate of reinfections The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) puts the rate of reinfections in the country at 4.5% and that of breakthrough infections at two to four infections per 10,000. It said on Wednesday that the emergence of the virus variants and the fact that health workers are constantly exposed to the virus are the key reasons for these infections. Post-vaccination infections have been mostly mild or asymptomatic, doctors say, because the individuals still have partial protection. In Kasaragod, all of the 12 breakthrough infections detected among health workers have been asymptomatic cases, picked up through random sampling. In Kerala, about 73% of health workers have been fully vaccinated now. U.S. study People with no symptoms transmit more than half of all cases, according to a recent model developed by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. This essentially means that having a grip on silent transmission from persons without symptoms is very important for controlling the pandemic. No clear answers Science still has no clear answers whether vaccinated individuals with asymptomatic breakthrough infections can still transmit the disease. Public health experts are beginning to wonder whether hospitals can become disease transmission centres if fully vaccinated staff with asymptomatic infection are unknowingly transmitting the infection. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, vaccines have been only evaluated for their efficacy against symptomatic cases. But none of the vaccine trials have been designed to measure reduction in transmission risk from infected vaccinated individuals. Further spread “There is a substantial likelihood that asymptomatic breakthrough infections can result in further spread of the disease in the community. This could happen especially as people may become complacent following vaccination, and many such infections are asymptomatic. Even with a reduced viral load, a vaccinated, infected individual can still spread the disease because the virus spreads depending on the individual’s ability in generating aerosols and the physical environment it takes place in” says Rajeev Jayadevan, vice chairman, Kerala State IMA Research Cell.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/breakthrough-infections-new-concern/article34405108.ece
25 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Unreliable information on Delhi govt. website adding to woes of families, patients||At 1 p.m. on Saturday, the Delhi government website Coronabeds.jantasamvad.org showed there were 1,798 COVID-19 beds available in 46 hospitals across the Capital. However, when The Hindu contacted these hospitals, only one said it had vacancy, and that too for pregnant women. Contact numbers for the hospitals, both government and private, are available on the website. Reflecting the immense pressure on hospitals as new infections and deaths continue to surge in the city, many of the phone calls by this reporter went unanswered, or were met with either a busy signal or an ‘out of order’ message. Tough to get hold of Of the 46 hospitals, phone numbers of 21 were busy, including that of Satyawati Hospital, AIIMS Trauma Centre, and Venkateshwar Hospital.Nine did not attend the call, including Lok Nayak Hospital, which the website showed had 93 vacant beds, and Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute.Four were out of service, including that of Max East/West Block, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Guru Nanak Eye Centre; and four were switched off, including Tirath Ram Shah Charitable Hospital, Sehgal Neo Hospital, and Bensups Hospital. Only St. Stephen’s Hospital confirmed it had empty beds. “We have a few vacant beds in the labour room but they are for pregnant women only,” the operator said. At Base Hospital in Delhi Cantonment, the operator said they do not have any vacant beds. When told that the website showed the hospital had four beds available, he said: “We do not know why it is showing that.” Of the five contact numbers available on the website for B.L. Kapoor Hospital, one was out of service and the other four remained busy. The operator at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, where two beds were vacant according to the website, forwarded the call to the COVID-19 desk where no one picked up the phone. At Max Smart Gujarmal Hospital, which had 57 beds vacant according to the website, the operator asked for the details of the patient and said they would call back in case a bed was available. At 5.46 p.m., the website — which updates in real time — showed there were only 22 COVID-19 ICU beds available in Delhi, including one at AIIMS Trauma Centre, 11 at Madhukar Rainbow Children’s Hospital and 10 at Metro Hospital. Phone calls to the hospitals were met with a busy signal. Sharing his ordeal of trying to contact hospitals, 29-year-old Ankit Prakash, a resident of east Delhi, said he tried to call at least 10 hospitals to get his mother admitted on April 19 and could not get through to any of them.  “All these numbers are useless. I must have tried 10-12 hospitals from this website and other sources, and most of them were busy. One or two that picked up said they don’t have beds. What is the point of this website if the information is incorrect? Why fool the public?” he said, adding that he finally got his mother admitted in a hospital in Ghaziabad. Anil Maini, 61, said he tried over 25 hospitals in an attempt to get his elder brother admitted, but to no avail. “The information on websites is eyewash. The only way one is getting admission into hospitals is through contacts, if at all,” Mr. Maini said, adding that he finally managed to get his brother admitted in a hospital in Outer Delhi after a lot of effort. People also complained that they were unable to get any information on COVID Care Centres in the city. Arjun Matta, a resident of west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden, said his brother had tested positive for COVID-19 and they were looking for isolation facilities as they live in a two-room house. “I tried to look for information on COVID Care Centres on the website but there is no information available there. I had to call people up asking for a nearby centre. When I found two-three, their numbers were either busy or switched off. What should one do?” he said. His brother eventually had to isolate himself at home and has now recovered. According to the Delhi government’s Friday health bulletin, a total of 2,096 COVID-19 beds were available in hospitals, 5,006 in COVID Care Centres, and 65 in the COVID Health Centre. Repeated phone calls and messages to several Delhi government officials to seek their response on the matter went unanswered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/unreliable-information-on-delhi-govt-website-adding-to-woes-of-families-patients/article34405217.ece

Most of them are districts that see a steady movement of people to and from Bengaluru. On Saturday, accordingto the Health Department’s bulletin, Tumakuru had 1,559 new cases, the second highest in the State. Districts such as Bengaluru Rural, Chikkaballapura, Mandya, Mysuru, Ballari, Kalaburagi, Dakshina Kannada and Hassan also reported over 500 cases. Some districts - Kalaburagi, Ballari and Tumakuru - have over 5,000 active cases. Compare this with the scenario in February, before the second wave hit. On February 24, for instance, all districts were reporting new cases in single digits, while Bengaluru’s numbers were below 200. The number of active cases too for most districts were in double digits, barring five -- Bengaluru Urban, Tumakuru, Mysuru, Kalaburagi and Dakshina Kannada. A month later, a look at the figures for March 24 too was not panic-triggering. New cases continued to be in single digits for most places, though Bengaluru Urban, by then, had started reporting over 1000. Kalaburagi had over a 100 new cases and active cases in several districts too had shot up. Experts and the medical fraternity have pointed out that unhindered movement between places and disregard for COVID-appropriate behaviour are the main reasons for the speed of the spread of infections. Speaking to The Hindu , Tumakuru DHO Dr. Nagrendrappa said universally, similar reasons had led to the spike in cases. But for districts such as Tumakuru, frequent movement to and from highly affected Bengaluru added to it, he said.  Golden standards “Movement has been curbed to an extend due to the weekend curfew. The transmission has to be broken and the golden standards of social distancing, sanitisation and masks have to be followed. The character of the virus has also changed. The district administration is doing the fullest to its capacity with testing, tracking and treatment,” he said. It is not just transmission that approachability to Bengaluru is adding to though. Officials in some districts, on condition of anonymity, said with hospital beds in Bengaluru become scarce, many are heading to nearby districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/it-is-a-worrying-spike-beyond-bengaluru-too/article34405064.ece
25 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||KCR orders free vaccination of entire population||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has ordered free vaccination of the entire population in the State, including migrants, regardless of their age. He expected the native population of the State and migrant workers employed in various sectors to be around four crore. Of them, about 35 lakh people have already been vaccinated. All the remaining people irrespective of their age will be vaccinated free of cost, Mr. Rao decided, said a press release of the CMO. The entire programme will cost over Rs. 2,500 crore but the government will not pay heed to the price as it did not consider money more important than human life. The release added that Mr. Rao’s decision was communicated to the Chief Secretary and health officials for taking steps. Mr. Rao did not see shortage in availability of vaccines for the State government as Bharat Biotech, which was based here, was already supplying the vaccines and some other companies like Dr. Reddy’s Labs had come forward to join production. He promised to monitor the vaccination programme personally after recovering from COVID-19 infection in a couple of days. He will also hold a high-level meeting with health officials to discuss the roadmap. Mr. Rao said district wise in-charges will be appointed for strict implementation and success of the vaccination programme. Steps will also be taken to ensure there was no shortage of medical oxygen and Remdisivir for patients. The Chief Minister appealed to the public not to panic as the government will do its best to see that there was no shortage of hospital beds or medicines for patients. Everything to bail out the patients from the crisis will be done. He, however, asked public not to observe any kind of negligence in these trying times. They should not gather in groups nor participate in rallies. They should not leave home unless necessary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kcr-orders-free-vaccination-of-entire-population/article34405525.ece

25 April 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Oxygen supplies dip in Gujarat hospitals||Hospitals in Gujarat continue to face shortage of oxygen as COVID-19 cases rise in the second wave. On Friday, the State government appointed two IAS officers, Dhananjay Dwivedi and Sanjeev Kumar, as nodal officers to streamline and coordinate the supply of oxygen. Four patients reportedly died in a private hospital in Rajkot on Friday due to lack of oxygen supply. Earlier, six patients had died in a private hospital in Navsari. Deaths were reported in a Banaskantha hospital after it ran out of oxygen. “Oxygen supply shortage is being faced by hospitals in several districts like Rajkot, Mehsana, Sabarkantha and Surendranagar,” a senior doctor said. He said the supply of medical grade oxygen is not able to match the demand, which is rising due to inflow of patients. Gujarat was better placed to produce oxygen with its large industrial base, said Union Home Minister Amit Shah inaugurating a 280-litre per minute capacity oxygen plant at a government ayurvedic college in his constituency Gandhinagar. He said 11 more such plants will be set up in Gujarat using the Prime Minister’s Citizens Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situation Fund. The State on Saturday reported 152 deaths and 14,097 cases. So far, 6,171 people have succumbed to the virus, according to the government’s health bulletin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/oxygen-supplies-dip-in-gujarat-hospitals/article34405604.ece
25 April 2021||Mangaluru,||Major fire breaks out at MSEZ chemical unit||A major fire broke out at a chemical unit in the Mangalore Special Economic Zone (MSEZ) in Permude under Bajpe police limits near here on Saturday. While the unit reportedly suffered extensive damage, there were no casualties and the fire was brought under control. The fire broke out in a portion of a plant of Catasynth Speciality Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. at around 2 p.m.   The plant engineer told officials that he noticed a spark in the tanker of the plant. + Fire tenders made use of foam to bring it under control by 4.30 p.m. A constant watch will be kept throughout the night on the solvent fire and it will be put off using water.  Mangaluru City Corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said the source of fire was unknown. Catasynth is a subsidiary of The Anthea Group. This greenfield facility in the MSEZ manufactures Catechol based products like Methylenedioxybenzene, Piperonal, Helional and Piperonyl Butoxide. The products are produced using patented, eco-friendly and sustainable processes.  Meanwhile, DYFI State president Muneer Katipalla, quoting sources, said workers were engaged in welding work and the fire was ignited through welding sparks. The plant that started operation about 11 months ago was situated on a 20-acre plot and employed 85 permanent workers and 270 contract labourers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/major-fire-breaks-out-at-msez-chemical-unit/article34405589.ece
25 April 2021||New Delhi,||Will hang anyone obstructing oxygen supplies, warns Delhi HC||With many hospitals in the national capital expressing urgent need amid a dire shortage of oxygen for serious COVID-19 patients, the Delhi High Court on Saturday warned that it will not hesitate to “hang” anyone who is found obstructing oxygen supplies. “We will not spare anyone,” a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said during another special hearing on Saturday, following urgent petitions filed by Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, Jaipur Golden Hospital and others on shortage of oxygen. “The problem that Delhi continues to face arises primarily on account of the fact that the supply of oxygen to Delhi even at the allocated rate of 480 MT per day is not taking place,” the High Court noted. “You (Centre) had assured us (on April 21) that 480 MT per day will reach Delhi. Tell us when will it come? We want a definitive date,” the bench said, adding that COVID patients in Delhi cannot be left to die like this. The Centre said, one of the primary reason is that three of the plants from which oxygen is to be supplied are situated at Rourkela, Durgapur and Kalinganagar. Cryogenic tanks While empty cryogenic tanks have been airlifted and are in the process of being filled with liquid oxygen from Durgapur, the High Court was informed that Delhi government had not made arrangements for cryogenic tanks for supplies from Rourkela and Kalinganagar. The High Court remarked that the efforts the Delhi government has to make here “cannot be trivialised, and they should not leave it entirely to the Central Government to act in this regard”. “We direct all the suppliers to provide complete details of the oxygen that they supply in the NCT,” the court ordered.

25 April 2021||Hassan,||SSLC revision classes take a hit in villages with online classes back||With SSLC exams less than two months away and offline classes suspended again owing to the second wave of COVID-19, teachers in rural areas are anxious about students not being able to attend revision classes. Ironically, while Internet connectivity remains a major issue in many rural pockets, teachers say online access itself is proving too distracting for a section of students. In many schools, hardly 50% of students attend online revision class ahead of exams starting July 21. Some of them quit the class within minutes after logging in, say teachers. A major reason is that Internet connectivity is fickle or non-existent.  Venkatesh Vaidya, who teaches Mathematics at Hosanagar in Shivamogga district, said that it was impossible to conduct online classes for his students. The taluk has many villages tucked away among hills. Teachers distribute worksheets and insist they return them after finishing the assignments. “We are in touch with parents and request them to visit school, when they come to the town for other work, to take worksheets,” he said. Raghavendra Bhat, science teacher at Megaravalli in Thirthahalli taluk, said that several of his students now have mobile phones to access classes. Parents bought phones for children, even if there were financial constrains, because it was key to their education. But with connectivity issues unresolved, students have to look around for an elevated place, where they can get better Internet connectivity. There have been instances of students perching on trees to find connectivity. Teachers say that some students seem to be under the impression that they would be promoted without an exam like in the lower classes, making them lose interest. M.P. Mamatha, who teaches English at Government High School at Halebidu in Belur taluk in Hassan district, told The Hindu that of the 113 students in SSLC roughly 50-60 students attend her online class. “Almost all have got mobile phones now, but it is difficult to make them attend online classes, ” she said. More into games Parents also fears that their children have taken to using phones more to play games. In fact, when offline classes began after a long break, students accustomed to phones carried them to classrooms and were caught playing games. “A couple of parents called teachers to complain that buying phone was wasteful as their children played games that involved money transactions. Parents have to keep vigil on their children,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sslc-revision-classes-take-a-hit-in-villages-with-online-classes-back/article34405062.ece
25 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Remdesivir, oxygen allocation enhanced||On a day Karnataka reported close to 30,000 new cases, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced that the Centre has enhanced the State’s allocation of two crucial requirements — Remdesivir and oxygen supply. On Saturday, Mr. Yediyurappa thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda for increasing Karnataka’s allocation of Remdesivir from 50,000 doses to 1,22,000 till April 30 and the daily oxygen allocation from existing 300 MT to 800 MT. This came a day after Mr. Yediyurappa, during a virtual meeting of Chief Ministers with the Prime Minister, appealed to the Centre to allocate more oxygen and Remdesivir to Karnataka, expressing concern that several healthcare centres would have to be shut if there was no increase in oxygen supply. He had also said that 500 tonnes of oxygen was consumed across the State on Thursday and 1,142 tonnes was estimated to be the demand by April 25, and the quantum is likely to go up to 1,471 tonnes by April 30. He had also appealed to Mr. Modi to provide two lakh doses of Remdesivir over the next 10 days.  Earlier on Saturday, Health Minister K. Sudhakar, speaking about the increasing demand for oxygen in the State, had said, “Even during the highest peak last year, we had used around 300 to 350 tonnes of oxygen. In the second wave, we have already used up 500 tonnes.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/remdesivir-oxygen-allocation-enhanced/article34405063.ece

25 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Remdesivir vials selling for as high as Rs. 22,000 in black||Panic and desperation brought about by a more ferocious second wave has resulted in a thriving blackmarket for Remdesivir, the drug used to treat COVID-19 patients. A single vial is selling for as much as Rs. 22,000, and people are willing to pay for it. Since it started a special drive to crack down on the illegal sale of Remdesivir last week, Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), said the Central Crime Branch had seized 55 vials. “The police have booked six cases and 16 accused, including two medical distributors, have been arrested so far,” he said. The raids have uncovered a nexus between pharmacy staff and employees of smaller hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes. On Thursday, CCB officials uncovered twomore instances of people in the healthcare sector selling Remdesivir in the blackmarket. Seven people were booked in both cases which involved pharmacy staff working with employees of a hospital and a nursing home. In the first case, a CCB team received a tip-off that a pharmacy at Kothanur Dinne was selling a vial for Rs. 22,000 each. Head constable Shantharaju visited Parvathy Medical Store under the guise of a prospective customer. “The staff said they had stock and asked him to fork out Rs. 22,000 per vial. Mr. Shantharaju ordered four vials before alerting his senior officials, who were waiting some distance away,” said a senior CCB official. During the raid, the team arrested three employees, Prakash Choudhary, 24, Vinod Choudhary, 25 and Abhishek M., 30. They had allegedly sourced the vials from an affiliated clinic adjacent to the pharmacy, Parvathy Clinic, though a contact identified as Rohini,” the official added. “The drugs seized had a ‘not for sale’ sticker affixed on the boxes, indicating that they were strictly for hospital and institutional setup use only,” said CCB official Basavaraj A. Teli, from the Organized Crime Wing. Efforts are on to locate Rohini, a staffer at the clinic. The accused were booked under the Drugs (Control) Act and taken into custody. In another incident, a CCB team arrested Shivashakthi, 24, and Ramdas, 25, in front of the main gate of St. John’s hospital where they were allegedly trying to sell Remdesivir vials. The duo told the police that they had sourced the drugs from their contact, a nurse at Spurthy Hospital on chocolate factory road. She allegedly told the duo to sell the medicine for Rs. 15,000 per vial and promised to share the profits equally with them. “Efforts are on to track down the nurse, Syeda Kousar,” said the police. The police plan to intensify the raids in the coming days and have alerted hospitals and clinics to monitor their supply of the drug.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/remdesivir-vials-selling-for-as-high-as-rs-22000-in-black/article34405066.ece

Mr. Poonawalla expressed his inability to meet the State’s full requirement, he claimed. “He told us he will give us vaccine doses as per his capacity and asked us to procure remaining doses from other companies,” said Mr. Pawar. “We will ensure that the State gets vaccines from foreign manufacturers in coordination with the Union government,” he said.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||A space for science, experiments and unity||The International Space Station (ISS) is a landmark of international cooperation. For over 20 years, it has seen intense collaboration between the U.S., Russia, the EU, Japan and Canada, and has played host to people from 19 countries since its launch in 1998. This scenario appears to be coming to an end, as Russian space agency Roscosmos’s chief has declared that Russia is ready to build its own space station and launch it by 2030 if President Vladimir Putin would give the go ahead. Further, in an interview to Russian TV, Deputy Prime minister Yuri Borisov said Russia would give notice and leave the ISS by 2025. The idea of the ISS was born in 1984 when Ronald Reagan, then the US President, announced it in a State of the Union address. “Our progress in space, taking giant steps for all mankind, is a tribute to American teamwork and excellence. Our finest minds in government, industry and academia have all pulled together. And we can be proud to say: We are first; we are the best; and we are so because we're free,” he said. In his speech, he outlined the idea of international cooperation in this venture, as he announced: “A space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science, communications, and in metals and lifesaving medicines which could be manufactured only in space. We want our friends to help us meet these challenges and share in their benefits. NASA will invite other countries to participate so we can strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expand freedom for all who share our goals.” Since then, the ISS project saw a collaboration grow between several countries, mainly the following space agencies: NASA (U.S.), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan) and CSA (Canada). Though the programme began in 1993, the construction of the station started only in 1998. The ISS has been assembled section by section over several years. The first segment was launched on November 20, 1998 in a Russian proton rocket named Zarya (which means ‘sunrise’). The first human expedition to the station was launched in a Soyuz TM 31 rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. This crew became the very first to inhabit the ISS — these were NASA astronaut Bill Shepard and Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev from Roscosmos, who reached the station on November 2, 2000 and stayed for several months. The assembling of the ISS has been a complex undertaking in itself. It took over 10 years and over 30 missions to bring it to its present form. Though the basic unit was launched in 1998, a photograph of the station taken in September 2000 from spaceship Atlantis looked markedly different from a picture taken in October 2018 by Expedition 56 members after undocking in a Soyuz spacecraft. Installation of different parts took place on close to 40 different occasions from 1998 to 2020. Human presence One of the most spectacular achievements of the ISS is that ever since November 2, 2000, it has seen the steady presence of human beings. So far, 240 individuals from 19 countries have visited the ISS, including from Malaysia and the UAE. Most have been from the U.S., numbering 151; Russia has sent 48 people; Japan 9; Canada 8 and so on. In the realm of science fiction, the sight of the ISS hurtling through space at a speed of 28,000 km per hour is something that can be watched from the Earth and wondered at. According to Niruj Mohan Ramanujan, a radio-astronomer who is with Indian Institute of Astrophysics, “If the ISS flies over your location a bit before sunrise or a bit after sunset, for those few minutes, it is usually the brightest object in the sky.” There are apps that indicate where exactly it is in the sky at any time. The length of the ISS is just about a metre short of the length of an American football field at 109 m. It has a habitable volume of 388 cu. m. and includes six sleeping quarters, two toilets and a gym. It weighs 419,725 kg, which to give a perspective, is the weight of 1,090 cows. The ISS, at a height of about 402 km above the Earth, orbits it 16 times every day, once every 90 minutes. Over a period of 24 hours, the people inhabiting the ISS see 16 sunrises and sunsets. The ISS’s recent tweet celebrated the conclusion of the 64th expedition that began in October 2020 and ended on Friday April 23, after approximately six months. It said: “There was a change of guard this week onboard the station. Expedition 64 concluded their mission and returned to Earth, and the Crew-2 astronauts docked with the station on Saturday.” With the ending of Expedition 64, NASA astronaut Kate Rubins and Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergei Rhyzikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchokov returned to Earth on a Soyuz MS-17 spacecraft. Crew-2 members, NASA’s Shane Kimbrough, Megan McArthur, JAXA’s Akihiko Hoshide and ESA’s Thomas Pesquet joined the others in the ISS and until the Crew-1 astronauts, NASA’s Shannon Walker, Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Jaxa’s Soichi Noguchi return, there will be 11 crew members onboard the ISS. The first experiments were those that studied the dynamics of cells under microgravity. Some of the experiments being conducted by the latest expeditions include a study of how muscles work under long-term stay under low-gravity conditions. This is an experiment by ESA and observes biochemical properties of muscles under long-term exposure to spaceflight. This can help in developing rehabilitation both on Earth and in Space. Another experiment mimics the way geckos attach themselves to surfaces, using an adhesive that has been shown to work in space. This can help devise methods for robots to attach themselves to surfaces and then to detach just the way geckos do. Physics experiments Some of the early physical sciences experiments related to crystal growth. The newer ones study the behaviour of free-flying soccer balls in microgravity. More exotic sounding subjects include Janus particles, or particles that have two ‘faces’ with distinct properties — one side is hydrophobic and avoids water, while the other is hydrophilic and loves water. Studying these in microgravity reveals the fundamental physics behind microparticle self- assembly and the kinds of colloidal structures that can be fabricated. Do these experiments justify the amount of money that is spent on the ISS? There is a debate. It costs NASA about $3 billion to $4 billion a year just to maintain the station, and the total spending had gone up to $100 billion in 2018 itself. Would it be more fruitful to invest in space-based telescopes or missions other than the ISS? Under the Donald Trump administration, the U.S. reached out to private firms to participate in the space expeditions. American space research had been a governmental activity until this development. This showed NASA the way to cut the huge payments it had been making to Russia to ferry astronauts back and forth. The commercial equation was disrupted once again. For over 20 years, the ISS has remained an ideal of global unity and peace, at least in the realms of space. Will there be another such expensive investment in the areas of science and technology? There is no answer now, but, so far, the ISS is unique in being one such ideal.   In Focus  The ISS has been assembled section by section over several years.

25 April 2021||New Delhi,||States asked to set up more vaccine centres||Ahead of expanding vaccination for everyone above 18 years from May 1, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan and Chairman of the Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management R.S. Sharma told the States on Saturday to register extra private COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) in “mission mode”. This could be done by engaging with private hospitals, hospitals of industrial establishments, and other industry associations. The States were also asked to monitor the number of hospitals that have procured vaccines and have declared stocks and prices on Co-WIN, and publicise the fact that only online registration would be available for those in the age group of 18-45. The States were advised to review their existing hospital and other COVID-19 treatment infrastructure in light of the daily new cases, daily fatality, and those that would require hospitalisation. Mr. Sharma, according to a press statement, noted that the Co-WIN platform had now stabilised and “is working at scale flawlessly”. It had been equipped to handle the complexities of the new phase of vaccination starting from May 1, he said. He emphasised that States/U.T.s ought to be uploading correct and timely data as any incorrect data would compromise the integrity of the entire system. States were asked to maintain a real-time record for available beds, create guidelines, direct private health facilities to provide COVID-19 care, and expand designated COVID-19 care facilities for isolation the of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients. Online registrations for the expanded age group is expected to begin on April 28. At least 600 million new registrants are expected to begin seeking appointments for a vaccine shot amidst a steep rise in coronavirus infections. On Saturday, Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan visited the Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre (SPCCC) at Chhatarpur, New Delhi and oversaw its restarting and the addition of 500 oxygenated beds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-asked-to-set-up-more-vaccine-centres/article34404898.ece
25 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Global response to India’s call for help||Four cryogenic oxygen tanks were airlifted by the Indian Air Force from Singapore, in the first such import a day after External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar put out an appeal for international assistance for India’s ongoing coronavirus crisis. The tanks, used for the transportation of oxygen, were brought from Singapore’s Changi Airport on an Indian Air Force (IAF) C-17 which landed on Saturday at Panagarh air base in West Bengal. “We stand with India in its fight against Covid-19,” Singapore’s Embassy in New Delhi said in a statement, calling it a “bilateral and multi-agency effort.” About 80MT of liquid oxygen are also expected to be flown to India from a company in Saudi Arabia, the Indian Embassy in Riyadh announced. The effort comes more than two weeks after oxygen shortages were reported across the country, and led to criticism of the government’s handling of the crisis. The government is now coordinating a multi-pronged approach to ramp up oxygen availability from abroad, including tapping embassies in countries where they can be sourced, speaking to governments to waive regulatory delays, and ensuring no disruptions in supply chains, diplomats and officials said. However, the government is only seeking foreign government facilitation, not foreign aid for India’s needs, they said. While shipping in liquid oxygen is not seen as feasible at present, embassy officials are coordinating with suppliers for oxygen generators, industrial and individual concentrators as well as cryogenic tankers. Apart from Singapore, the United Arab Emirates government is also coordinating with Indian Embassy officials for the transfer of oxygen tankers, and the European Union and Russia are expected to send both oxygen-related and pharmaceutical supplies. Among those offering support, Pakistan’s Abdul Sattar Edhi Foundation, a charity group, also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi offering 50 ambulances and emergency staff. On Saturday, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed “solidarity with the people of India as they battle a dangerous wave of COVID-19.” “We must fight this global challenge confronting humanity together,” Mr. Khan added. On Friday evening, Mr. Jaishankar held a virtual meeting along with Shipping Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, Indian Ambassadors to Germany, European Union and United States and several executives from multinational pharmaceutical and vaccine companies to discuss bottlenecks with supply chains for India. “The world must support India, as India helps the world,” Mr. Jaishankar tweeted.

25 April 2021||Kolkata,||Polling in four Bengal districts tomorrow||Elections to the seventh and penultimate phase in West Bengal will be held across 34 Assembly segments in four districts, including Kolkata, on April 26. The Election Commission had scheduled polling in 36 seats, but polling in two seats — Shamsherganj and Jangipur in Murshidabad district — has been postponed because of the deaths of Samyukt Morcha candidates in these seats. The Morcha is an alliance of the Left parties, the Congress and the Indian Secular Front. Six constituencies each are going to the polls in Dakshin Dinajpur and Malda districts, four in Kolkata and nine each in Paschim Bardhaman and Murshidabad districts. Of the 34 seats, four seats are reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates and two for Scheduled Tribe candidates. 9,000 booths set up About 280 candidates are in the fray and the total number of polling booths is about 9,000. The nine seats of Paschim Bardhaman are located across the Asansol-Durgapur industrial belt and some of the constituencies border Jharkhand. Among the candidates in this region are former Mayor of Asansol Municipal Corporation Jitendra Tewari, who is contesting from the Pandabeshwar seat. Mr. Tewari switched sides from the Trinamool Congress to the Bharatiya Janata Party at the eleventh hour. Senior Trinamool Congress Minister Moloy Ghatak is contesting from Asansol Uttar and actor Sayoni Ghosh from Asansol Dakshin on the ticket of the State’s ruling party. Student leader in fray One of the youngest candidates in the election is 26-year-old Aishe Ghosh, president of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union, contesting from the Jamuria Assembly seat. The voters of this region had supported the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls electing Babul Supriyo as the MP for the second time. The Trinamool has a strong organisational presence in the area. In certain pockets, Left parties have a strong presence because of the trade union movement. The four seats going to polls in Kolkata — Kolkata Port, Bhawanipur, Rashbehari and Ballygunge — are Trinamool bastions and party has fielded political veterans. Senior leader Subrata Mukherjee is contesting from Ballygunje, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, another Minister, is defending Bhawanipur, former Kolkata Mayor and Minister Firhad Hakim is contesting from Kolkata Port and Debasish Kumar from Rashbehari. The BJP has tried to bring in an element of surprise by fielding actor Rudraneel Ghosh from Bhawanipur and Lt. Gen. (retd.) Subrata Saha from Rashbehari. Malda, Murshidabad and Dakshin Dinjapur districts are in for an interesting contest. Till the last Assembly pols, the region elected most of the Congress MLAs in the State. Despite extending its influence all across the State, the Trinamool did not win many seats from the region. Things started changing after the 2016 Assembly election when many legislators of the Left and Congress defected to the Trinamool. The region, which has a significant minority population, where many Assembly seats share a border with Bangladesh has witnessed protests over the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). While the BJP has campaigned on the issue of ‘infiltration”, the Trinamool has sought votes on the promise that it will not allow any implementation of the CAA or the National Register of Citizens. The final phase of polling will be held on April 29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/polling-in-four-bengal-districts-tomorrow/article34404884.ece
25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Justice for all||Justice Nuthalapati Venkata Ramana was sworn in as the 48th Chief Justice of India by the President in the Ashoka Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan in a short ceremony on Saturday. He took his oath, signed his name, and then rose and held his folded hands high in one sweeping motion at the people assembled, including his predecessor Justice S.A. Bobde, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and other Supreme Court judges, before retiring to his seat. Born to agriculturists Ganapthi Rao and Sarojni Devi in Ponnavaram village of Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, the 63-year-old new Chief Justice’s life has, in a way, been a quiet revolution. He turned to books at an early age. His other passion was Carnatic music. But what moved the young Ramana most was the lack of civil liberties in the pre-Emergency era. The incidents of his youth, especially during the Emergency period, spurred Chief Justice Ramana, who was already working as a journalist with a Telegu newspaper, to become a lawyer. “I became a lawyer by coincidence,” he had said once. He was called to the Bar on February 10, 1983 — a first-generation lawyer. He was a counsel for various government organisations and the Additional Standing Counsel for Railways in the Central Administrative Tribunal in Hyderabad before his appointment as the Additional Advocate General of Andhra Pradesh. He was appointed to the Andhra High Court in June 2000 as a permanent judge. He would go on to function as Andhra HC’s Acting Chief Justice 13 years later, before he was elevated as the Delhi High Court Chief Justice. He was appointed as a Supreme Court judge in February 2014. He is scheduled to retire as the CJI on August 26, 2022. Equal access Chief Justice Ramana, in his recent speeches, has focussed on three aspects: ensuring equal access to justice, upholding of civil liberties against human rights violations by the State and the setting up of a National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation to bring the much-needed “uniformity and standardisation” into the court infrastructure. His judgments in the Supreme Court has questioned, and often challenged, the status quo brought about by the government as far as civil liberties are concerned. “The most vulnerable are often the victims of human rights atrocities, by either the State or by anti-social elements,” he said recently. In January last year, Justice (as he was then) Ramana made it mandatory for the Jammu and Kashmir authorities to publish each and every one of their orders, which crippled the fundamental freedoms of over 7 million Kashmiri people following the abrogation of Article 370. His Bench had held that a right cannot be used against itself. The extensive reach of the Internet cannot be cited as a reason to restrict the right. “Freedom of speech and expression includes the right to disseminate information to as wide a section of the population as possible,” he had observed in his judgment. In his years as Supreme Court judge, he was part of various decisions ranging from electoral issues to rights of women to bringing the Chief Justice of India’s office under the ambit of the Right to Information (RTI). He was part of a Constitution Bench in 2019, which held that the the CJI’s office was a ‘public authority’ accountable under RTI to provide information sought in public interest. However, in a separate opinion, he said “RTI should not be used as a tool of surveillance”. His judgment in the Karnataka MLAs’ disqualification case had said it was time to “reconsider strengthening certain aspects of the Tenth Schedule”. Chief Justice Ramana had remained stoic in the face of a recent storm whipped up by a complaint filed by Andhra Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy naming him. It was timed shortly after a Bench led by Justice Ramana started hearing hundreds of criminal cases against Ministers, legislators and politicians, pending in trial courts across the country. Mr. Reddy himself is involved in several such cases. An in-house Procedure of the Supreme Court dismissed the complaint. “It is an important quality for a judge to withstand all pressures and odds and to stand up bravely against all obstacles,” Chief Justice Ramana had said in an address to the Madras Bar Association in October last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/justice-for-all/article34404922.ece
25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The successor of the Castros||When Miguel Diaz-Canel, the newly designated first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba and who has been the President of the country since October 10, 2019, was born on April 20, 1960, it was barely a year since the revolutionary movement led by Fidel Castro had won power by overthrowing Fulgencio Batista’s regime. Fidel’s brother Raul Castro, who gave way to Mr. Diaz-Canel as the first secretary after a 10-year tenure, was then Defence Minister, a post he held till February 2008. When Mr. Diaz-Canel became a member of the Central Committee of the CPC in 1994, after having taught engineering at Villa Clara University and having worked his way up the party’s ranks in Villa Clara province, Cuba was three years into the “special period” — an economic crisis that began after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Fidel had then allowed the functioning of a limited private sector and opened up Cuba to tourism and Mr. Diaz-Canel was in charge of the works in the province. His work during his period propelled his rise further in the party to first secretary in Holguin province in 2003 and the appointment to the Politburo in the same year. In 2009, he became the Minister of Higher Education. Within four years, when Raul Castro took over as President and later as First Secretary from his brother, Mr. Diaz-Canel was elevated to the post of first vice president and signalled to be the heir-apparent to the two powerful posts in the country as it transited from its revolutionary-era leadership. Steady reforms In some ways, Mr. Diaz-Canel offers continuity to the Raul Castro regime, which undertook a series of cautious but steady reforms. The revolutionary-era Cuban communists transformed Cuba, which was run by a corrupt military dictatorship into a socialist economy with heavy emphasis on education and universal health care, resulting in a highly literate society with a high human development index. But the collapse of the planned economy after the fall of the Soviet Union and the continued embargo imposed by the U.S. since 1960 resulted in recurring economic crises due to shortage of materials and resources. Reforms that furthered more liberalisation of the economy — allowing small businesses, self-entrepreneurs and cooperatives, providing more autonomy to state-owned corporations, and recognition of private property with restriction, greater flexibility in foreign investment — were all done during Raul Castro’s tenure. While the reforms, along with the détente with the U.S. in the later stages of the Barack Obama presidency which also allowed remittances from Cuban émigrés, helped the economy register steady growth in the 2010s, the re-imposition of sanctions by the Trump regime followed by the Covid-19 crisis resulted in an 11.9% contraction in the GDP in 2020. Mr. Diaz-Canel finally managed, early this year, to implement the long-standing plan to abolish the system of dual currency in Cuba, which was necessitated during the special period to prevent Cubans from dumping pesos and for state-owned enterprises to import cheaply using dollars. The dual system had created inequalities in payments for workers in the mixed economy with some working in sectors such as tourism and other private enterprises earning much more than those in public institutions. The six-decade-long rule by the participants and leaders of the revolution had enjoyed significant support among older Cubans, who have benefited from its achievements over time, but younger ones, well-educated and informed, seek more freedoms. The generational change in the leadership of the CPC and the state could help stem the discontent with the regime but it will be a tough task for Mr. Diaz-Canel to live up to younger people’s aspirations as the economy struggles. The older generation communists were also adamant that the one-party state was the only way-out for the socialist policies to remain, even as they embarked upon economic reforms that gradually allowed for the presence of a market economy. It remains to be seen if Mr. Diaz-Canel and the post-revolutionary leadership could further democratise Cuba at the grassroots and allow for more political freedoms, even as it continues its gradual economic reform.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-successor-of-the-castros/article34404924.ece
25 April 2021||New Delhi,||Centre must be held accountable: Congress||Deputy leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma on Saturday said the Narendra Modi government must be held “morally and politically accountable” for the deaths of COVID-19 patients due to a shortage of oxygen and life-saving medicines. While former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi asked the Centre to focus on oxygen shortage, vaccines and other health infrastructure instead of undertaking public relations activities and unnecessary projects (a reference to the Central Vista project), Congress general secretary Ajay Maken pointed out that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health had flagged the issue of supply of oxygen in their November 2020 report. Mr. Maken also accused the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government of spending crores on publicity but doing nothing to augment oxygen storage capacity. Former Finance Minister P. Chidamabaram said the Centre was making “hollow” claims about no vaccine shortage, and cautioned the government that it could face protests if it did not prepare for the May 1 vaccine roll-out for all adults. “Accountability of government is integral to democracy. This government must be held morally and politically accountable,” Mr. Sharma, who is recovering from COVID-19 at a Gurugram hospital, said on Twitter. “Reminding the Prime Minister and his colleagues that India cannot be micromanaged in a pandemic. The responsibility for the deaths of Indian citizens for shortage of oxygen and medicines lies squarely at the doorstep of the government,” he added. Mr. Sharma said the unfolding tragedy of citizens dying for want of medicines and oxygen had shocked the collective conscience of the nation, but the government was living in “brazen denial”. “Why was no exigency plan put in place? Why was oxygen emergency reserve not created? Who is responsible for rampant black marketing of life-saving medicines,” he asked. At a virtual press conference held to launch Congress’s digital television INC TV, Mr. Maken said if the media had asked questions to the government about the parliamentary panel report earlier, the government may have been better placed to handle the “man-made oxygen crisis”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-must-be-held-accountable-congress/article34404903.ece
25 April 2021||Chennai,||Centre contradicts SII on vaccine pricing||Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute, issued a statement on Saturday to address the “ongoing public scepticism and confusion towards the pricing of Covishield”. The statement tried to address the controversy over whether the price of the vaccine at Rs. 600 (nearly $8) per dose for private hospitals was more than its cost when it was exported. But it did not refer to the issue of whether the vaccine would be priced differently for procurement by the Centre and the State governments. Only a few hours before the statement, Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan tweeted saying that the Central government’s procurement price for both COVID-19 vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — remains at Rs. 150 per dose; the Health Ministry, too, tweeted a similar clarification. These tweets contradicted what Mr. Poonawalla had claimed in an interview to CNBC-TV18 on April 21, that the price of Rs. 150 per dose was not applicable for any future procurement by the Central government, and that the vaccine would be sold at Rs. 400 both to the Central and State governments. He said: “It is not a different price [for State and Central government supplies]. All government prices will henceforth be Rs. 400 for new contract. The Rs. 150 per dose for the Central government was for prior commitment and contracts. It ceases to exist after we supply 100 million doses to them. We will also charge Rs. 400 to any government, let me clarify that.” These remarks had come in after the SII’s statement of April 21 announcing the price of the vaccine for State governments (at Rs. 400 per dose) and private hospitals (Rs. 600 per dose) but which did not mention the price at which the vaccine would be sold to the Centre. . The April 24 statement, by remaining silent on the Health Minister’s clarification, has kept the question over “differential pricing” alive. As regards the higher pricing for private hospitals, the statement said, “The initial prices were kept very low globally as it was based on advance funding given by those countries for at-risk vaccine manufacturing.” However, while SII charged South Africa $5.25 per dose, AstraZeneca was supplying to European countries at $2.18 per dose. Volumes matter In the April 24 statement, Mr. Poonawalla also made the point that vaccines used in the universal immunisation programme were sold at a far lower price as the volumes were large. He cited the example of pneumococcal vaccines that are sold at a higher price in the private market, while the government is charged only one-third the cost. Mr. Poonawalla brought in the issue of the investment needed to scale-up manufacturing capacity to fight the pandemic to justify the higher costs. But what he left unsaid was that based on his demand for Rs. 3,000 crore to meet the cost of ramping up production capacity, the government had already agreed to advance that amount to SII, and Rs. 1,500 crore to Bharat Biotech. While Mr. Poonawalla says that “only a limited portion of Serum’s volume will be sold to private hospitals at Rs. 600 per dose”, India is the only country that is selling the vaccine to private players. With the Central government procuring 50% of the vaccines and supplying it to State governments for free administration to people above 45 years and when vaccinated in government facilities, States will be competing with private hospitals and with one another to procure the remaining 50% vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-contradicts-sii-on-vaccine-pricing/article34405460.ece
25 April 2021||New Delhi,||Serum Institute defends pricing||Serum Institute of India (SII), which makes the most used COVID-19 vaccine in the country, on Saturday defended pricing Covishield vaccine at 1.5 times the initial rate, saying the earlier price was based on advance funding and now it has to invest in scaling up and expanding capacity to produce more shots. The world’s largest vaccine maker, which manufactures Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine at Pune, earlier this week announced a price of Rs. 600 per dose for private hospitals and Rs. 400 per dose for State governments and for any new contract by the Central government. It currently charges the Central government Rs. 150 per dose for the existing supplies. Opposition parties had criticised the differential pricing for COVID-19 vaccines, saying it was discriminatory and will benefit only a “few big industrialists” while common people will suffer. They had demanded the Centre and state governments pay the same price for the COVID-19 vaccine. SII, in a statement, clarified that there was an “inaccurate comparison” done between the global prices of the vaccine with India. “Covishield is the most affordable COVID-19 vaccine available in the market today,” SII said. The initial prices were kept very low globally as these were based on advance funding given by those countries for at-risk vaccine manufacturing, it added. “The initial supply price of Covishield for all government immunisation programme, including India, has been the lowest,” SII said.  Government procurement for countrywide immunisation programmes in all countries, including India, has been at a far lower price as the volumes are very large, it added. Emphasising that the company has to ensure sustainability, SII said, “The current situation is extremely dire; the virus is constantly mutating while the public remains at risk. Identifying the uncertainty, we have to ensure sustainability as we must be able to invest in scaling up and expanding our capacity to fight the pandemic and save lives”. The company went on to add that only a limited portion of SII’s volume will be sold to private hospitals at Rs. 600 per dose. “The price of the vaccine is still lower than a lot of other medical treatment and essentials required to treat COVID-19 and other life-threatening diseases,” it added. Earlier this week, the vaccine-maker had said, “Going ahead, 50% of our capacities will be served to the Government of India’s vaccination program, and the remaining 50% of the capacity will be for the state governments and private hospitals.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/serum-institute-defends-pricing/article34404910.ece
25 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.K. variant more prevalent in north India||The U.K. variant of the coronavirus, marked by increased infectivity, is distinctly more prevalent in several northern and central Indian States when compared with the southern ones, a perusal of genome sequencing data from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) shows. Two scientists from Central government labs that analyse national genome sample data told The Hindu that large gatherings in Punjab have significantly amplified transmission of the variant in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana. “Punjab has a very unique trajectory in the rise of the B.1.1.7. There were at least four major clusters (super spreader events) marriages, farmer protests from February 1 to February 28 , that are responsible for large spikes. By March, Delhi was warned about a possible 15,000 critical cases,” Dr. Sujeet Singh, Director, NCDC said. Though only a fraction — about 15,000 samples — of India’s caseload has been sequenced, data from 1,757 samples showed that in the northern States the proportion of the U.K. variant in the community was significantly higher than those isolated from international travellers and their contacts. The U.K. variant, according to the data available with The Hindu , comprises 1,666 of the 1,757 samples. In Punjab, for instance, there were eight instances of the U.K. strain among international travellers and their contacts but 543 in the wider community; in Delhi this ratio was 91: 324. In Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, there were no reported variants in those with an international travel history but 26 and 23 cases respectively in wider community. In Haryana the ratio is 6:13. In Madhya Pradesh, the ratio was 4:51 and in Chattisgarh 1:14. However, such a pattern doesn’t hold, in fact is directly reversed, in Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu — other States with large case loads. There were more instances of the U.K. variant in the travellers and their contacts than in the wider community.

25 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||2 abducted ONGC workers rescued in Nagaland||Security forces rescued two of the three employees of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), abducted by members of the banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I), after a gunfight in Nagaland’s Mon district early on Saturday. Five armed men had abducted the three employees — junior technicians Mohini Mohan Gogoi and Ritul Saikia and junior engineering assistant Alakesh Saikia — from ONGC’s Lakwa oilrig in eastern Assam’s Charaideo district on Wednesday. A team of the Army, Assam Rifles and Nagaland police personnel rescued two of the hostages from a jungle near Totokchingnyu village in Mon district near the border with Myanmar. Police officials in Mon district said the duo was rescued after a gunfight around 2 a.m. The officials could not specify the number of extremists but said they were a mixed group of members of the ULFA-I and the Yung Aung faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland. This faction took over the NSCN (Khaplang) that operates from across the border in Myanmar and shelters other outfits of the northeast. “Operations are still in progress to rescue the third abductee. Our team recovered an AK-47 assault rifle from the area where the two were rescued,” a Defence spokesperson said. In a statement on Saturday evening, the ULFA-I claimed they had released all three hostages following the gunfight with the security forces. “We suspect the armed forces may have killed Ritul Saikia during the exchange of fire,” itsaid. On Friday, the Assam police arrested 14 people, including “overground workers” of the ULFA-I, in connection with the abduction, the second such incident in four months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-abducted-assam-ongc-staff-rescued-in-nagaland/article34404892.ece

This move would affirm U.S. leadership, including in initiatives such as COVAX, and as we work with partners around the globe because no one is safe from the pandemic until we are all safe from it,” Mr. Brilliant said. Lawmakers, health specialists and experts from several Washington think-tanks have called on the Biden administration to send spare vaccines and oxygen to India — which is being ravaged by a second wave. A group of 10 Senators had written to President Joe Biden asking him to support an India-South Africa initiative for a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights at the WTO that would facilitate the production of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines around the world. Social media push Twitter timelines were rife with speculation on why the U.S. had not yet acted. “I find it hard to believe the United States does not have some ventilators to spare. Get them on planes @StateDeptSpox, @USAndIndia. Get remdesivir on planes. Get oxygen on planes. If vaccines are off limits get creative. People are dying. People are watching. Live our values,” Chris Clary, a political science professor at the University of Albany, tweeted. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said discussions were on-going at various levels between the Indian and U.S. sides.

25 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBI files FIR against Anil Deshmukh||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducted searches at various places after registering a case in connection with the corruption allegations against former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and unknown others. “The searches were carried out on the premises of Mr. Deshmukh in Mumbai and Nagpur. The premises of his personal secretary in Mumbai was also searched,” said a CBI official. The First Information Report (FIR), which was registered on April 21, was based on the findings of a preliminary enquiry initiated on the directions of the Bombay High Court on April 5. “The preliminary enquiry prima facie revealed that a cognisable offence is made out in the matter, wherein the then Home Minister of Maharashtra, Anil Deshmukh, and unknown others have attempted to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of their public duty,” said the FIR. A petition filed by former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh in the High Court mentioned that the then Home Minister and others exercised undue influence over the transfer and posting of officials. Mr. Deshmukh allegedly told some police officers to collect Rs. 100 crore every month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. During the preliminary enquiry, the CBI recorded the statements of Mr. Deshmukh, his two staffers, Mr. Singh, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, Assistant Commissioner of Police Sanjay Patil and suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, recently arrested for his alleged role in a bomb scare case in Mumbai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-files-fir-against-anil-deshmukh/article34404888.ece
25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||China imposes restrictions on nationals returning from India||China’s Embassy in India has since Friday put in place curbs that have made it harder for its nationals to return to China, amid the surge in COVID-19 cases. The Embassy told Chinese travellers it will no longer issue “health codes” they need to return if they transit either through Nepal or Sri Lanka. Indian citizens and foreigners based in India have been barred from travelling to China since November last year. Nepal has been the most popular route for Chinese nationals to return in the absence of direct flights between India and China, as there are daily flights from New Delhi to Kathmandu and weekly flights from Kathmandu to Guangzhou and Chongqing. Travellers require a green health code from the Embassy in New Delhi to apply for a health code in Nepal, the country of transit. While the Embassy’s website says travellers can apply for health codes if they have negative test results for COVID-19, the Embassy had, starting Friday, unofficially begun denying travellers green health codes even if they fulfil the criteria, though there has been no such formal announcement. By closing off the Nepal route, the Embassy is now limiting how even its own nationals may be able to return. Last month, the Embassy said it will begin ‘facilitating’ travellers provided they have taken “Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccines” which are not available in India. The travel ban has been a particular concern for many Indian students enrolled in Chinese universities, many of whom have been unable to return to China. There are at least 23,000 Indians studying in China.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-imposes-restrictions-on-nationals-returning-from-india/article34404904.ece

RSS general secretary and second-in-command Dattatreya Hosabale asked the organisation’s workers, social and religious institutions to come forward to resolve the current challenges. “The countrymen, apart from their positive efforts to resolve the situation, should also be cautious of the conspiracies of these destructive forces,” Mr. Hosabale said in his statement.  ‘Positive atmosphere’ On behalf of the Sangh, he also requested all sections of the society, including the media, to contribute in maintaining an atmosphere of positivity, hope and trust in the society. “Those who are active in social media should play positive role being more restraint and vigilant,” he said. Mr. Hosabale said although the situation was critical, the strength of the society was also enormous. “It is our firm belief that we shall certainly overcome the situation by maintaining patience and keeping the morale up along with self-restraint discipline and mutual support,” he said. He appealed to people to create awareness about wearing masks, hygiene, physical distance, taking ayurvedic Kadha, inhaling steam and also emphasised on vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/beware-of-conspiracies-by-anti-bharat-forces-rss-warns/article34404906.ece
25 April 2021||New Delhi,||People without ration cards left out of COVID-19 food safety net||People without ration cards have again been left out of the safety net provided by the second round of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), announced by the Centre on Friday to provide free food grains for 81 crore ration card holders in May and June. Last year, the Aatmanirbhar scheme was announced to bridge that gap, and provided free food grain to more than 2.7 crore people without ration cards, out of an initial target of 8 crore people. Asked whether a similar scheme would be implemented this year, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said that the ration card portability scheme and new enrolments under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) would help to mitigate the situation instead. However, Right to Food activists warn that a humanitarian crisis will erupt unless free food grain is also provided for the most vulnerable population who still do not have ration cards. “Lots of State governments, ever since the One Nation One Ration Card scheme came, they included a lot of people who were not having ration card, using the Aadhaar enablement and biometric authentication,” Mr. Pandey told journalists on Saturday, in response to a query from The Hindu . “What it led to, for example in Rajasthan alone, [is that] more than 50 lakh people from December 2020 onwards were removed and equal number of persons have been added. Same thing has happened in U.P. and a similar thing in Bihar.” The Food Department said a total of Rs. 60.7 lakh additional people had got covered under the NFSA since last year. Population growth “If there are 60 lakh new beneficiaries, that means less than 20 lakh additional ration cards, which is nothing in comparison to the large numbers still without ration cards,” said Dipa Sinha, a Right to Food activist and economist teaching at Ambedkar University, Delhi. She pointed out that simple population growth since the last census means that nine to ten crore additional people ought to be added, to meet NFSA norms. In Delhi, for example, 71 lakh ration cards have been issued. However, during last year’s lockdown, an additional 60 lakh e-coupons had to be issued for those without ration cards to access free food grain given by the Delhi government, said Anjali Bhardwaj of the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/people-without-ration-cards-left-out-of-covid-19-food-safety-net/article34404915.ece
25 April 2021||Mumbai,||HC rejects bail to six Army officials charged with murder||The Bombay High Court recently denied anticipatory bail to six Army officers charged with the murder of a retired colleague. The police said Ganesh Thokal and his wife were residing at Kamargaon in Ahmednagar district after retirement. Last year, the accused visited them and a quarrel broke out over Bhagwan Yadav, an accused, not repaying Thokal a loan of Rs. 1 lakh. On September 5, Thokal was called by Mr. Yadav to Pune and he told his wife he was with his colleagues at Murud-Kashid and would return the next night. On September 7, at 7.30 a.m., Thokal’s body was brought to his house. The wife saw injuries on Thokal’s right eye and right ear and filed a complaint against the six colleagues. An FIR was filed and they were charged under Sections 302 (punishment for committing murder), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. According to her, Thokal could not have drowned as he was a good swimmer. Her advocate submitted photographs to Justice S.V. Kotwal that showed Mr. Yadav overpowering Thokal and said it corroborated the injuries on the face. He argued that none of the accused tried to save Thokal and the murder was a deliberate act. The court said the post-mortem report mentioned the cause of death as ‘asphyxia due to drowning’. The Bench said, “There is a clear opinion that the black eye in this case was termed ecchymosis. These bruises appear after sustaining injury by blunt force. They do not occur due to post-mortem violence. This opinion is very significant. It is more than clear that the black eye was the result of blunt trauma caused by injury. It was not a post-mortem injury. It was caused before death. Since morning, the deceased admittedly was with the accused till his death.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-rejects-bail-to-six-army-officials-charged-with-murder/article34405613.ece
25 April 2021||Hyderabad,||Biological E gets nod for Phase 3 vaccine trial||Pharmaceuticals and biologics firm Biological E has received approval to start Phase 3 clinical trial of its COVID-19 subunit vaccine candidate from a Subject Expert Committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO). The Phase III clinical study to be conducted in 15 sites across the country will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Biological E’s SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for protection against COVID-19 in about 1,268 healthy subjects aged 18-80 years. It is intended to be part of a larger global Phase III study. The SEC approval follows successful completion of the Phase I/II clinical trial that began in November second week. Two doses According to Biological E, the Phase I/II clinical trial evaluated safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate in about 360 healthy subjects aged 18-65 years. The schedule consisted of two doses for each participant, administered via intramuscular injection, 28 days apart. BE’s novel COVID-19 vaccine was found to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic, a release from the company said. “The results of these [Phase I/II] clinical trials are very positive and promising. We believe our vaccine candidate will become another effective global COVID-19 vaccine as we move forward into Phase III clinical trials,” its managing director, Mahima Datla, said. The vaccine candidate includes an antigen developed by Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and in-licensed from BCM Ventures, Baylor College of Medicine’s integrated commercialisation team, along with Dynavax Technologies Corporation advanced adjuvant CpG 1018TM. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) have provided support for the Phase I/II clinical trials and also for the upcoming Phase III trial of the vaccine candidate, the release said. Associate dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor and co-director of Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development Maria Elena Bottazzi said “having our Texas Children’s and Baylor vaccine construct advance into phase III clinical studies in India and globally highlights the importance of advancing traditional protein-based vaccine platforms. [These] now brings added hope for a people’s vaccine to be scaled and deployed in low- and middle-income settings.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/biological-e-gets-nod-for-phase-3-vaccine-trial/article34404917.ece

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Delhi HC talks tough on oxygen shortage||“The problem that Delhi continues to face arises primarily on account of the fact that the supply of oxygen to Delhi even at the allocated rate of 480 MT per day is not taking place,” the High Court noted. “You (Centre) had assured us (on April 21) that 480 MT per day will reach Delhi. Tell us when will it come? We want a definitive date,” the bench said, adding that COVID patients in Delhi cannot be left to die like this. The Centre said, one of the primary reason is that three of the plants from which oxygen is to be supplied are situated at Rourkela, Durgapur and Kalinganagar. While empty cryogenic tanks have been airlifted and are in the process of being filled with liquid oxygen from Durgapur, the High Court was informed that Delhi government had not made arrangements for cryogenic tanks for supplies from Rourkela and Kalinganagar. The High Court remarked that the efforts the Delhi government has to make here “cannot be trivialised, and they should not leave it entirely to the Central Government to act in this regard”.  “We direct all the suppliers to provide complete details of the oxygen that they supply in the NCT,” the court ordered.

JKAP State secretary Muntazir Mohi-ud-Din said the order was arbitrary and unjustifiable, “in which any government employee can be dismissed without proper enquiry”. “Such decisions create a feeling of alienation among government employees who otherwise deliver their public services in a diligent manner. Such unwanted decisions shall prove counterproductive as government employees are the backbone of any public administration,” Mr. Mohi-ud-Din said. He said the J&K government “must avoid introducing such controversial laws”. “L-G Sinha should review the draconian law and direct the competent authorities to quash this law at an earliest,” he said. People’s Conference leader Mohammad Khurshid Alam also expressed concern over the order. “Government employment is a basic source of livelihood for the majority of people in J&K. Such orders will only snatch away such basic facilities from the conflict-torn masses. The decision to create a task force and terminate a government employee without an inquiry looks frighteningly draconian and shocking,” he said, seeking the immediate rollback of the order. The J&K government on April 21 constituted an STF to scrutinise government employees and lodge cases against those involved anti-national activities or cases that pose a threat to national security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/scrap-task-force-set-up-to-scrutinise-jk-staff/article34404882.ece

We are telling relatives to take their patients wherever there is oxygen available,” Dr. S.C.L. Gupta of Batra Hospital in south Delhi, was quoted as saying. In a tweet, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he had written to chief ministers across the country requesting them to provide oxygen to Delhi. Though the Centre was helping, Mr. Kejriwal said in a tweet “the severity of corona is such that all available resources are proving inadequate”. Dr. Baluja said the Jaipur Golden Hospital had over 210 patients and oxygen stock to last for 45 minutes at 10.15 a.m. on Saturday. “We were supposed to get a supply of 3,600 litres of oxygen at 5 p.m. on Friday, but we got 1,500 litres at 12 noon. There was a seven-hour delay and by that time the pressure of oxygen supply was low. Even while refilling, it takes time for the pressure to build up,” he said. “We have oxygen only till 8 p.m. now and the situation will be the same as last night after it. We are getting very little supply. Cannot run a hospital like this,” Dr. Baluja said at 3 p.m. “Most hospitals are operating with oxygen stock which will last only for two-ten hours,” a Delhi government spokesperson said.

For private hospitals, the price will be Rs. 1,200 per dose. The company intends to export the vaccine, which it developed in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research, for $15-$20 per dose. The company on Saturday said more than 50% of Covaxin capacities have been reserved for Central government supplies. It is supplying the vaccine at Rs. 150 per dose. Chairman and managing director Krishna M. Ella said recovering costs is essential in the journey of innovation towards other vaccines, such as the intranasal vaccine for COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covaxin-to-cost-rs-600-per-dose-for-states/article34405453.ece

This unprecedented health and humanitarian crisis created by the second wave of COVID-19 is turning into a tsunami. The situation has been aggravated by the approach and attitude of the Union government,” Mr. Yechury said, calling the rising death toll “preventable”. He said the Centre should bring production of Indian vaccines under emergency provisions and import other vaccines from “all available sources”. In order to meet the expenses for a nationwide vaccination programme, Mr. Yechury proposed that the government spend the budgetary allocation of Rs. 35,000 crores and “cancel the project for the construction of the new Central Vista, put on hold all extravagant expenditures and transparently release all the money collected under PM-CARES and transfer the same for the supply of oxygen and vaccines”. He laid the blame for the tragedy unfolding in the country squarely on the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ensure-free-vaccines-for-all-yechury-to-pm/article34404899.ece

25 April 2021||C. JaisankarTIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||No need to fear oxygen shortage, says Dean||As the requirement of oxygen has gone up dramatically, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital has formed an exclusive team to liaise with the oxygen supplier to ensure a steady supply of oxygen. A 10-member team formed by Dean Vanitha will work round-the-clock to check usage and monitor oxygen level. They have been asked to report to the Dean every hour about the availability of oxygen. They will coordinate with a Thanjavur-based oxygen supplier to ensure adequate supply. “As of now there is no shortage of oxygen in any of the Government Hospitals. Sufficient supply is being maintained. However, we are closely monitoring the situation,” says Collector S. Divyadharshini. To a question, she said that a private hospital in the city, in a report, had stated that it was anticipating a shortage of oxygen. Action had been taken to ensure availability of oxygen. Hence, there was no need for concern, Ms. Divyadharshini said. According to the standard practice, Dr. Vanitha said that the private company would refill the oxygen plant at the hospital once in two days. Care will be taken to maintain a steady supply and the company has been asked to give priority to the hospital. The team has been entrusted with the task of ensuring uninterrupted supply of oxygen. “There is so far no issue over oxygen availability. We hope that the COVID-19 cases will not go up further,” the Dean said. She said that there are 350 oxygen points for COVID-19 patients. The number of COVID-19 beds had been increased to 723 from 650. All possible avenues have been explored to increase the beds. As of Saturday, 523 COVID-19 patients were being treated at the hospital, she said. Another official said that besides the GOVID care centres functioning on the city campus of Bharathidasan University at Khajamalai and Government College of Engineering at Sethurapatti, new COVID care centres at Nehru Memorial College at Puthanampatti and Bishop Heber College in Tiruchi have started admitting patients from Saturday. A batch of six patients were admitted to Nehru Memorial College. Patients from Thuraiyur, Uppiliapuram and Mannachanallur would be admitted to the Puthanampatti centre. Pudukottai An additional 6KL oxygen storage tank has been established at Pudukottai Government Medical College Hospital in addition to the existing tank of a similar capacity. Both the tanks were being replenished every week for uninterrupted supply of oxygen to severely-affected COVID-19 patients. This apart, 359 oxygen cylinders were also available in government hospitals in the district, Collector P. Uma Maheswari said after inspecting the oxygen storage facilities and supply system at the Government Medical College Hospital here on Saturday. There were 512-oxygenated beds at Government Medical College Hospital, government hospitals, primary health centres and private hospitals in the district, she said. A COVID care centre with 100 beds has been created at Pudukottai Backward Classes Welfare Students Hospital. A Siddha care centre would start functioning at the Government Arts College for Women after the counting of votes on May 2. Steps were being taken to establish COVID care centres at Aranthangi ITI and STAMIN campus at Kudimiyanmalai, she added. About 2,000 RT-PCR tests were being conducted every day in the district and those with symptoms should immediately undergo the test, she said pointing out that the district was reporting daily COVID 19 cases in three digits now. She also urged the public to get themselves vaccinated without hesitation. A 24-hour control room was functioning in the district to provide information, counselling and organise ambulances for positive persons. It can be accessed by dialling 04322 222207, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-need-to-fear-oxygen-shortage-says-dean/article34404986.ece

25 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Constant vigil necessary in a democracy, says Kamal||Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan on Saturday said “constant vigil” was necessary to keep democracy alive. Speaking at a webinar on “Autonomy of local bodies”, organised by his party to celebrate National Panchayati Raj Day, Mr. Haasan said that the “mindset” of the people had been reduced to that of a 12-year-old kid who thought that everything would be taken care of by the parents. Mr. Haasan alleged that the “100 day guaranteed work scheme” in rural Tamil Nadu had become an eyewash as the wages earned by the beneficiaries were immediately spent in Tasmac liquor shops. ‘Gram sabha reinvigorated’ Mr. Haasan said, “Just like how we popularised gram sabhas, we have to do the same for urban local bodies. We did not invent gram sabhas, we reinvigorated them. It is okay if the AIADMK and the DMK come forward and compete with us in this.” He said, “People have a duty. If people earn through the 100-day work scheme and spend it in Tasmac shops, people won’t have responsibility. We have to change it. An 18-year-old today is going to be a parent tomorrow. We have to make them leaders,” he said. “One of the glaring things I noticed during the [Assembly] election campaign was that people were not participating in democracy. We have to ensure that. It is not enough to pass laws. The governments have alienated the people from democracy. People have not checked whether it is working or not,” he said. Mr. Haasan said the MNM was not without blemish. “I am searching for leaders. Those who are not worthy will be removed.” Stating that solutions would arrive with action and not with mere words, he said, “We have to do what we need to no matter how the election results turn out to be. Only then we can be qualified citizens... we can aspire for power later. I keep speaking about Kerala... and they say, I have a soft corner for Communists, but both the parties there have contributed to it,” he said. MNM general secretary Dr. Santhosh Babu hosted the meeting, in which party vice-president V. Ponraj and Senthil Arumugam participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/constant-vigil-necessary-in-a-democracy-says-kamal/article34405018.ece
25 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Police intensify security for complete lockdown||With the complete lockdown back after a gap of seven months, the police have made elaborate arrangements by deploying 12,000 police personnel and setting up more vehicle checkpoints across the city. The lockdown was implemented first on March 24 last year to contain the spread of COVID-19. The complete lockdown was implemented for nine Sundays until September, though restrictions were relaxed on other days and in other parts of the State. Following the spurt of the second wave, the State government enforced the night curfew from Tuesday and a complete lockdown without any relaxations on Sundays. Chicken and other meat stalls, fish markets, vegetable shops, theatres, malls and all other shops will be closed. Strict action will be taken against violators. Essential services, such as supply of milk, distribution of newspapers, hospitals, medical labs, pharmacies, ambulance and hearse vehicles, allied medical activities, goods vehicles carrying agricultural produce of farmers and fuel vehicles will be permitted during the complete lockdown. Police personnel have made an elaborate plan to implement the lockdown effectively and to ensure that no untoward incidents occur. A senior police officer said personnel would be deployed on arterial roads, near markets, government offices and hospitals. Over 12,000 police personnel will be on duty and iron barricades will be installed at over 200 places for checking any vehicle seen roaming without any reason. The City Police Commissioner has warned of seizure of vehicles if they violate the lockdown restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-intensify-security-for-complete-lockdown/article34405491.ece
25 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu receives 4 lakh doses of vaccines||Tamil Nadu has received four lakh doses of vaccine, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said on Saturday. Two lakh doses each of Covishield and Covaxin arrived on Friday and Saturday after the State flagged the shortage, he told journalists here after inspecting the Tamil Nadu Government Multi-Super-Speciality Hospital, a dedicated COVID-19 treatment facility. Wastage comes down In response to questions on vaccine shortage and wastage, Dr. Radhakrishnan said the State had received 55 lakh doses of Covishield and 10.82 lakh doses of Covaxin. Of these, it had so far used 51.32 lakh doses: 44.32 lakh doses of Covishield and 7.29 lakh doses of Covaxin. In the past 20 days, he said, the wastage had fallen to 5%, and the government wanted to reduce it further to 3%. He said 40% of the beds at government hospitals were vacant, and the government had tied up with private medical college hospitals in the Chennai suburbs, such as ACS Medical College and Hospital and Madha Medical College, to accommodate COVID-19 patients. “The Chief Minister has given approval to add 2,400 oxygen beds at all medical college hospitals in Chennai. Oxygen beds at maternity hospitals, such as Government RSRM Hospital and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, would also be made available,” he said. There was no shortage of beds at COVID-19 Care Centres either, he said. Medical college hospitals had been told to put in abeyance elective surgeries. Doctors from mini-clinics had been asked to report for duty at the nearby COVID-19 hospitals in all districts. The State had a method of segregating patients, based on their medical condition, Dr. Radhakrishnan said. Of the 95,048 active cases on Friday, 48,289 people (50.8%) were being treated at home; 8,414 people (8.8%) were at COVID-19 Care Centres and 24,569 people (25.8%) were being treated at hospitals. ‘Go to care centres’ “These are sensitive cases. Yesterday [on Friday], 13,776 people who tested positive will come for admission today [on Saturday], when 8,000-9,000 people will be discharged,” the Health Secretary said, easing fears over the lack of beds. He appealed to the people not to panic and instead go to COVID-19 Care Centres if they felt any need for treatment. Allaying fears over the increasing cases, Dr. Radhakrishnan said the State accounted for around 3.9% of the active cases and 2.9% of COVID-19 deaths in the country.  Of the 95,048 active cases on Friday, 48,289 people are being treated at home; 8,414 people at COVID-19 Care Centres and 24,569 in hospitals J.

Stalin on Saturday urged the “caretaker government” in Tamil Nadu and its officials to take steps to control the spread of COVID-19 as people could not afford another lockdown after May 2 (when the votes polled in the April 6 Assembly election will be counted). In a statement issued here, he requested the Chief Secretary to direct other Secretaries and the Collectors to take precautionary measures and ensure that treatment facilities are available, and the vaccination programme goes on smoothly.  ‘No let-up’ “There should be no let-up in the efforts by officials before the formation of a new government after May 2. The Collectors should ensure that mask-wearing becomes a social movement. There is a need to increase the testing as asymptomatic patients are spreading the infection to others,” the DMK president said. Urging the government to stock up on oxygen, vaccines, medicines, ventilators and beds at hospitals, Mr. Stalin said all primary health centres should be converted into COVID-19 centres. He said that though Tamil Nadu had good medical infrastructure, only proper planning could protect people from the infection. “In Chennai, 3,842 people were infected on Friday. Chengalpattu and Coimbatore districts are also being severely affected by the disease. It is a matter of great distress that the north Indian States are struggling for oxygen supply and beds,” Mr. Stalin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-cannot-afford-another-lockdown-says-dmk-chief/article34405006.ece

25 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stanley hospital revises treatment strategy||The Government Stanley Hospital revised its COVID-19 treatment strategy to address the new group of younger patients and those with comorbidities. Accordingly, a core management team, comprising all experts, will deliberate on the management of serious and critically ill patients to reduce mortality. The hospital will handle only medical and surgical emergencies, trauma cases and also deliveries. Six-hour shifts Medical experts and super speciality experts will work in the COVID-19 ward in six-hour shifts for a week, followed by a week of quarantine. All outpatient departments will work as a single unit to redistribute manpower for COVID-19 patients. The general outpatient department will consist of specialists from every branch, who will sit together and handle cases. This will enable specialists to devote their full attention to critical COVID-19 cases admitted in the hospital, according to the authorities. Doctors who wished to be exempted from COVID-19 duty have been diverted to areas such as the control room, help desk and non-COVID-19 outpatient departments. The arrangements are aimed to effectively use the available medical manpower since some healthcare workers were testing positive for the infection despite adequate protection, hospital authorities said. The hospital had convened a committee, comprising the heads of departments of all medical super specialities, to develop management strategies to combat the varied presentation and manifestations of COVID-19 during the second wave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stanley-hospital-revises-strategy/article34405016.ece
25 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. has seamless system to manage pandemic: Health Secy.||Those testing positive for COVID-19 should not panic as the State has created a seamless system to manage patients, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan has said. Following a meeting with doctors of the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, on Saturday, he said health officials were holding meetings regularly to assess the situation. Once samples were lifted and processed, results were provided to the patients, the Corporation and the Health Department, he said. The Corporation has 96 vehicles to pick up patients and bring them to the 12 designated fever surveillance clinics for further tests. Based on the results, doctors decide on hospitalisation, home isolation or treatment at COVID-19 Care Centres, he said. “We therefore request people to go to fever surveillance camps in the beginning. If patients feel that they have symptoms and require treatment, they may call the Corporation’s control room helpline numbers — 044-4612 2300 or 044-2538 4520 or 104. The medical team will assess the situation and help them accordingly. Residents can also call the above numbers if the Corporation staff do not reach out to them within 24 hours of receiving the test results,” he said. He assured the people that the State had adequate medical facilities. “We have a system in place to avoid crowding at hospitals,” Dr. Radhakrishnan said, adding that the State had a sufficient stock of medicines. For the next 10 days, medical college hospitals and specialist outpatient clinics at primary health centres had been instructed to put elective surgeries in abeyance. “These account for around 5,000 persons. This will reduce crowding at hospitals,” he said. The State has augmented its oxygen storage capacity, and has also increased its oxygen tank capacity at hospitals, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-has-seamless-system-to-manage-pandemic-health-secy/article34405004.ece

Administrative, zonal, regional offices and back offices and so on where the staff did not have direct contact with the public shall function as per normal working hours, it said in a communication to all member banks in the State. Staff with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and the visually challenged may be given the option to work from home, it said. Wherever possible cluster-based functioning of branches in consultation with the local administration shall be adopted, SLBC said. Aadhaar enrolment centre functions shall be suspended, it said. Branches that usually attracted large crowd should seek police help for crowd management through the Lead District Manager, SLBC said. Banks should ensure that all alternative delivery channels such as ATMs/CDM/cash recyclers were functional. Business Correspondents services should be fully functional at all times, it added. SLBC told banks to focus on vaccination of staff and their family members on priority by co-ordinating with the district administration. Banks are requested to educate and encourage their customers to make use of alternative delivery channels and opt for digital transactions instead of visiting branches physically, it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/business-hours-of-banks-curtailed/article34405009.ece
25 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Triaging of COVID-19 cases must’||With roughly 7,500 people or nearly 25% of the active COVID-19 cases in the Greater Chennai Corporation in hospitals, the civic body is pushing for effective triaging to prevent hospitals from getting overwhelmed. Of the roughly 14,000 beds available in both government and private hospitals, more than half are occupied now. These include COVID-19 hospitals, which are meant for severe COVID-19 cases and Dedicated COVID-19 Health Centres (DCHC), which deal with moderate illness. In the five government COVID-19 hospitals in particular, nearly 80% of the 4,368 available beds are occupied. When 6,118 beds in COVID-19 hospitals and DCHCs in the government sector are considered together, the occupancy was around 70%. Of the roughly 7,900 beds available in private COVID-19 hospitals and DCHCs, around 40% are occupied. As officials expect the present trend of sharp growth in COVID-19 cases to continue for the next couple of weeks at least, it is likely that hospitals will reach full capacity. The number of active cases in Chennai as on Saturday stood at 31,506. This was an increase of 119% from the 14,382 cases two weeks ago. In the event of active cases doubling again in the next two weeks and if the proportion of cases under hospitalisation remain the same as present, the city will be running short of beds with its existing capacity. However, a senior official from the Corporation said the active cases were unlikely to double in two weeks as the number of recoveries had also increased sharply. He pointed out that the number of active cases getting added daily had come down in the past two days. Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash told The Hindu on Friday that a considerable number of people who were in hospitals at the moment did not require hospitalisation as their symptoms were mild. “The Health and Family Welfare Department has instructed private hospitals to triage and avoid admitting those who do not need hospitalisation. By doing so, a person actually in need may not get a bed,” he said. “We want those who are testing positive to first approach screening centres, where the severity of the illness will be assessed and accordingly, they will be sent to hospitals or COVID-19 Care Centres or for home quarantine,” he said. Twelve screening centres have been set up by the Corporation for triaging those who test positive. This would be increased to 30, with at least two per zone, in the coming days, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/triaging-of-covid-19-cases-must-corpn/article34405488.ece

25 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Industrial oxygen prices up in Coimbatore||For several MSME units in Coimbatore, prices of industrial oxygen have shot up in the last two weeks. Industry sources say that foundries and fabrication units need oxygen on a large scale. Local suppliers S. Balraj, chairman of Indian Institute of Foundrymen, Coimbatore chapter, says most of the foundries in Coimbatore buy industry oxygen from local suppliers and manufacturers. The prices have shot up by nearly 20 % in the last two weeks. “Since the government has ordered supply of oxygen on priority basis for healthcare, I voluntarily stopped all works that need industrial oxygen and I have written to my customers too. Some have accepted and some have not. Since, I am not buying oxygen for my industry, I have not gone into the price issue,” says Rajasekar, who runs an industry at the SIDCO Industrial Estate at Kurichi here. According to Ayyachamy, who also has a unit at the SIDCO Industrial Estate here, he plans to stop operating the unit from Monday. “I have two imported laser cutting machines that need oxygen. Since, it is not available even at a higher price, I cannot run the unit,” he says. Job work Only those units that do only job work are affected. The others have other machinery and will continue with other production activities, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industrial-oxygen-prices-up-in-coimbatore/article34405498.ece
25 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Foundries seek higher prices for products||Over 700 foundries in Coimbatore that manufacture castings for different verticals of engineering sector are hit by the high raw material prices. Capacity utilisation at the foundries was 50 % in 2019-2020. After September last year, it increased gradually and is at about 80 % because of high demand, especially from the automobile sector. However, the hike in raw material prices by over 50 % for most inputs since November 2020 has turned the situation challenging for the foundries, says S. Balraj, chairman of the Indian Institute of Foundrymen, Coimbatore chapter. Nearly 70 % of the foundries in Coimbatore supply to the OEMs and most of the foundries cater to the domestic market. "We have long-term contract with the OEMs. They revise the prices only once in three to five months. But, the raw material suppliers are increasing the input prices almost twice a month. The price realised for the components does not meet the raw material prices. Except for a few, most of the foundries are incurring loss," he said. "The foundry industry is going through very rough times. In the emerging scenario, unless supported by suppliers and customers, government interventions apart, many foundries, especially the ones in MSME sector will find it extremely difficult to tide over the situation," he said in a press release. The industry is largely dependent on migrant workforce and post lockdown the industry is reducing reliance on human intervention. The industry is witnessing investment cycles for both upgrades and modernisation, he said. The foundries, which are sandwiched between the suppliers and customers, are caught in the vicious cycle of cost push inflation, with inadequate support from either side of the value chain. Though there has not been adequate compensation by the customers, the industry was able to manage. The delay by the OEMs in compensating for the raw material price surges have had severe financial implications on many foundries, especially the small and medium-scale enterprises. It has challenged even their sustainability, he said. Hence, the OEMs should revise the prices once a month to match the input costs till the raw material prices stabilise, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/foundries-seek-higher-prices-for-products/article34405045.ece
25 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Private hospitals in dire need of essential drugs||At a time when the COVID-19 situation is escalating in the district, which reported an all-time high of 1,004 cases on Saturday, private hospitals here say that there is an acute dearth of certain essential drugs, including Remdesivir. While a few hospitals claimed that they did not have stock of Remdesivir, some others said that their existing stock will not last for more than two-three days. Hospitals have been widely using anti-viral drug Remdesivir in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. “We don’t have its stock at all,” said the chairman of a private hospital in Coimbatore on Friday. According to him, the hospital had requirement of Remdesivir for at least 100 patients as of Friday. “We are trying our best to source it,” he said. A senior doctor in charge of administration in another private hospital said that it was having stock of Remdesivir for maximum two days. “Doctors have been advised to use Remdesivir for the treatment of moderate to severe cases of COVID-19, considering the shortage of its supply. Antiviral drug Favipiravir is used for mild cases, if required,” he said. According to him, antivirals, steroids, antibiotics and anticoagulants are the four category of mainstay drugs that are widely used for treating COVID-19. Except Remdesivir, supply of drugs in the other category are stable. “We hear that the supply of Remdesivir will be streamlined and stocks will be made available to all the required hospitals in four-five days,” he added. “Our doctors have been using Remdesivir to treat moderate to severe cases of COVID-19. They say that it made significant improvement in the condition of such patients. There is a shortage in the supply of anti-interleukin drugs which are also used to treat COVID-19 patients,” said the medical director of another private hospital. The Tamil Nadu branch of IMA said in a statement that there was increased need of essential drugs like injection Remdesivir and low molecular weight Heparin. It wanted the government to take over marketing of essential drugs and supply them to private healthcare facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-hospitals-in-dire-need-of-essential-drugs/article34405502.ece
25 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Error crops up in final COVID-19 vaccination certificate||An error has cropped up in the final COVID-19 vaccination certificate issued to those who have received their second dose. It lists the details of the beneficiary and the vaccination in English and Tamil. Under the head, ‘vaccination details’, the Tamil version wrongly mentions the date of the second shot as that of the first jab. While the English version mentions it as the ‘date of dose’, the Tamil translation reads as ‘ Muthal dose vazhangapatta thethi ’. The error came to the attention of many who had taken their second dose. A 66-year-old man, who took his second shot at a private hospital in Coimbatore on Friday, said he had taken the first shot on March 3. While the certificate issued after the first shot was in English and Hindi, the final certificate issued on Friday was in English and Tamil. He said this error might cause trouble to the beneficiaries as the certificate could be made mandatory for travel within and outside India. Though the title was clear, ‘Final Certificate for COVID-19 Vaccination’, the mistake in the Tamil translation would raise a doubt whether both shots had been administered, he said. “This error cannot be corrected from here. It has to be rectified by the high-level committee in Chennai,” said G. Ramesh Kumar, Deputy Director of Health Services, Coimbatore. He said the error would not be a problem as the document bears the title ‘final certificate’. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said the Health Department had informed the Delhi team, which is handling the computer-generated certificate, of the error.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/error-crops-up-in-final-covid-19-vaccination-certificate/article34404996.ece

Krithika, independent director of Coimbatore Smart City Limited and manufacturer of air compressors. In a memorandum to the District Collector, Ms. Krithika said that with the spread of COVID-19, more number of people are at risk. Activities as usual However, all activities are going on as usual and hence people are in contact with each other. With Coimbatore witnessing surge in cases, the risk of transmission must be widespread. In an effort to control the spread, the government and district administration should look at four-day lockdown a week, from Friday to Monday. Saturday and Sunday are non-productive days for most businesses. The migrant workers will not be affected and people movement can be controlled. So, there should be four-day lockdown every week, till the cases reduce to less than 100 a day, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-for-intermittent-lockdowns/article34405499.ece

A team from the State Department of Archaeology, Chennai, led by J. Ranjith, Archaeology Officer and Project Director for the Kodumanal excavation and K. Suresh, Archeological Officer, has identified two iron smelting furnaces, air blow pipes, iron melting pipes, earthen pots, storage containers, huge deposits of iron slag, crucible pot, all just in 10 cm depth. Unlike the earlier excavations that were done about 500 metres from the river, the current excavation, that began on February 26, is being done on the river bed to study the earlier human settlements in the area. “Furnaces in which iron ore is heated at 1,800 degree Celsius, after which iron melts into crucible pots, were found”, said Mr. Ranjith. The team had dug 28 quadrants and unearthed six copper coins, over 1,000 antiquities and graffitis. “The river bed could be the place of earlier settlement after which due to flooding or other reasons, humans had moved away from the river”, he added. The officer said that mass industrial activity had taken place at Kodumanal as units were involved in making iron, terracotta, copper and beads. “The current excavation shows the presence of iron smelting units in large numbers”, he added.

In a letter submitted to K. Subbarayan, Tiruppur MP, its Director S.C. Natraj said child workers under 14 years were rescued and admitted to the centres run by NGOs in the district from 2005. Currently, there were 15 centres in the district with 300 plus students functioning at Kadambur, Bargur, Sathyamangalam and Talavadi areas. To encourage them to continue their studies, Child Labour Division of the Ministry of Labour and Employment was paying a monthly stipend of Rs. 100 a student which was increased to Rs. 150 a student in 2010. A child having a minimum of 60% attendance in a month was eligible to receive the stipend. Stipend was credited to the bank account of the children and was utilised for pursuing their studies after joining regular schools. The letter said the stipend was increased to Rs. 400 a month in February 2017, but was stopped from March, 2017. “From the academic year 2017-18 to 2020-21, children were not given their stipends causing hardship to them and their parents,” the letter said and urged the MP to take up the issue with the Centre. Also, the staff working at these centres was not given salaries from March, 2020. Hence, steps should also be taken to pay their salaries regularly and the dues settled on time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rescued-child-workers-not-paid-stipend-for-five-years/article34405047.ece

25 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Thousands witness live telecast of celestial wedding||Thousands of people all over the world witnessed the live telecast of Meenakshi Thirukalyanam, the celestial wedding of Goddess Meenakshi and Lord Sundareswarar, on their television sets, mobile phones and laptops as the wedding was performed without public participation inside Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple for the second consecutive year owing to COVID-19 pandemic. The celestial wedding began around 8 a.m. and concluded by around 9 a.m. at Old Thirukalyana Mandapam. Lord Sundareswarar and Piriyavidai were brought to the mandapam. They were followed by the entrance of Goddess Meenakshi. All the deities were dressed in bright and festive colours with elaborate floral decorations. The holy knot was tied at 8.50 a.m. Only a few priests, a handful of temple staff, and a few others were present during the ceremony. Temple Joint Commissioner K. Chelladurai said that the public was not allowed to have a darshan of the deities in the Thirukalyanam form. “But, devotees were allowed inside the temple for a regular darshan from 10 a.m. onwards,” he said. Police personnel were posted in the four entrances of the temple to ensure that there is no public entry inside the temple. Outside the temple, as per custom many women changed their mangalsutra or the sacred thread outside the temple as a mark of renewal of their bonds. Mr. Chelladurai said that the entire wedding was live telecast in television channels, YouTube, and the official Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department website. Although, the wedding was live in several platforms, the restriction imposed in public gathering in the wake of the rising COVID-19 cases was a major disappointment to devotees, said R. Lakshmi, a devotee who has been attending the celestial wedding for the past two decades. ‘Meenakshi Thirukalyanam is the highlight of the annual Chithirai festival. But, witnessing the wedding through digital platforms for the second consecutive year because of the spread of the coronavirus pandemic felt incomplete,’ she said. Concurring with this viewpoint, B. Subha Nandhini, a resident of Kamarajar Salai, said that usually many women from their locality wear new saris on the day of Meenakshi Thirukalyanam and change their sacred thread during the wedding. ‘For us, the wedding is an event to renew our relationships and commitments,’ she said. The members of Pazhamudhir Solai Thiruvarul Murugan Baktha Sabai trust distributed 15,000 food packets as part of the wedding feast. P.N. Vivekanandan, one of the organisers of the Trust, said that 3,000 food packets were distributed to the inmates of old age homes and the remaining packets were distributed to devotees at Sethupathi Higher Secondary School. ‘It was ensured that devotees were not crowding inside the school premises and had their food only outside the premises. All COVID-19 safety precautions were strictly followed,’ he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thousands-witness-live-telecast-of-celestial-wedding/article34405032.ece
25 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC stays suspension of advocate from bar association||The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has stayed a suspension order passed by the Nagercoil Bar Association against an advocate. He had attended court proceedings despite a resolution passed by the association to boycott the court proceedings in support of the farmers who were agitating against the new farm laws. The court was hearing the petition filed by R. Shunmughanandha Karthees of Colachel who said that he was suspended from the association. The members were preventing him from entering the premises and were also not allowing him to use the library, he said. He was not even served a copy of the suspension order, he said. A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi observed that the association cannot interfere with the advocate’s Right to Practice the profession and the association ought not to have suspended the advocate. It would create an unhealthy atmosphere in the court, the judges said. The court directed the association to issue the identity card. The court in a similar petition filed by another advocate last year took a serious view of the fact that the association had gone on a strike. The court had observed that advocates should not resort to strikes under any circumstances since the aggrieved public were approaching court for relief. As a result of such boycotts, the justice delivery system was affected. The Supreme Court had deprecated the practice of the advocates abstaining from work, the court had observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/advocates-suspension-stayed/article34405579.ece
25 April 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Murder of Dalit youth was planned’||The death of P Muthu Mano, 27, a Dalit, inside the remand prisoners cell in Palayamkottai Central Prisons on Thursday was a planned murder and the prison and police officers were aware of the crime, said A Kathir, Executive Director of Evidence, an NGO, here on Saturday. Speaking to reporters here, he said that a fact-finding team from Evidence visited Tirunelveli and interacted with the parents of the Dalit man and met some of his relatives in Vagaikulam. The team said that there was no reason from the authorities for shifting Muthu Mano from Srivaikundam sub-jail to Palayamkottai Central Prisons all of a sudden. He was remanded in judicial custody on April 8 in an attempt to murder case along with three others and detained in the sub-jail. His father Pavanasam, who lost his father just four days ago, claimed that the police had foisted false charges and detained Muthu Mano in the sub-jail. The father had also said that he was unaware of the shifting of his son from the sub-jail to the central prison in Palayamkottai. Pavanasam told the visiting team members that the police and the prison officials had connived with some of the prisoners and had eliminated Muthu Mano. "I have a strong suspicion on the prison staff. Hence, they cannot be the complainant in the case," he said and demanded the police to register a case with his complaint. The team said that though the State government had suspended six staff as a sequel to the murder inside the prison, it was not enough. The police should register cases against them for abetting the crime. The murder has taken place inside the government premises. Hence, the jail authorities should be examined by a special investigation team and monitored by the High Court Bench in Madurai. The police have arrested some suspects in the crime. They should not be given bail at any cost until the trial was completed. The State government should compensate the family with Rs. 50 lakh and give a government job for the family member on humanitarian grounds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/murder-of-dalit-youth-was-planned/article34405030.ece
25 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Vehicle checks to be intensified from today||The police have chalked out an elaborate plan to implement total lockdown on Sunday with picketing for vehicle check to prevent unnecessary movement of people. “We have planned picketing in almost all important junctions. A team of personnel led by Sub-Inspectors would be posted to check vehicles,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, R. Shivaprasad, said. While there was no restriction on movement of vehicles carrying essentials, passenger vehicles like taxis and autorickshaws will be checked. “If there was any genuine reason for going to hospital, they would be allowed or asked to return home,” he added. Taxis and autorickshaws will be allowed to pick up and drop train passengers to and from railway stations. Stating that all police personnel from law and order and traffic and officials would be on duty from the early hours of Sunday, he said that special focus would be on fish and meat markets.

25 April 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Sterlite’s suggestion to produce oxygen opposed||Under no circumstances, the Tamil Nadu government should allow the reopening of Sterlite Copper Smelter plant in Thoothukudi for manufacturing medical oxygen, said Samam Kudimakkal Iyakkam State president C.J. Rajan here on Saturday. In a press release, he welcomed the State government's firm response in the Supreme Court on Friday, which had taken up suo motu, after the demand for oxygen in hospitals across the country had risen manifold due to the covid-19 pandemic. The Sterlite had offered to produce oxygen from its facility in Thoothukudi, which is now under lock and seal, and supply free of cost to the needy hospitals across the country. The Sterlite Company, he alleged, would not be allowed to restart the unit in any manner. The deaths, which sparked after the police opened fire against the anti-protesters on May 22, 2018, would remain in the minds of the people of Thoothukudi forever. Thus, the controversial unit should be dismantled at the earliest, the Iyakkam said and added that the government could establish a new unit to produce oxygen. To overcome the oxygen shortage in the country, the Centre should give permission for the existing oxygen manufacturers in the eastern region to enhance their capacity on a war-footing, the release added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bank-branches-to-operate-from-10-am-2-pm-from-monday/article34405023.ece

25 April 2021||Nagercoil,TAMIL NADU||11 fishermen missing after ship rams mechanised boat||Eleven fishermen from Vallavilai in western Kanniyakumari district, who had ventured into the sea in a mechanized boat for multi-day deep-sea stay fishing, went missing after a ship reportedly rammed their boat when they were fishing 630 nautical miles off Goa coast on Saturday. The missing fishermen have been identified as L. John, P. Suresh, J. Jebish, L. Vijish, L. Jeniston, R. Cedrick, S. Fredy, J. Jegan, P. Jesudasan, C. Joseph Franklin, owner of the boat, and M. Marbin, all from Vallavilai. The mishap apparently occurred after a ship rammed the mechanised boat. In a similar offshore accident, two fishermen from Colachel were killed on April 13 when they were fishing along with 12 other fishermen. Only two of the 14 fishermen were rescued by the ship that was involved in the collision. Vallavilai villagers said the families of the missing fishermen received a phone call from the fishermen of mechanised boat ‘Periyanayagi’, also from Vallavilai, around 1 p.m. on Saturday to inform them that fishing boat ‘Mercedes’ was found capsized in the high-seas. After they alerted the fishermen in the zone about the mishap, search operation was launched instantly to rescue the missing fishermen of ‘Mercedes’. “The boat had gone for multi-day stay fishing from Thengaaipattinam fishing harbour on April 6 with 11 fishermen, all from Vallavilai,” said Sunil Sabariyar of Vallavilai. Usually, the fishermen going for multi-day stay fishing would return to their base after 25 to 40 days after wrapping up their fishing operations beyond 600 nautical miles. “In this case, the fishing boat has been rammed by a merchant navy vessel, apparently proceeding towards VOC Port, Thoothukudi, as per the information provided by our fishermen on high-seas now,” Mr. Sunil said. The fishermen of mechanised boat ‘Periyanayagi’ noticed the wreck of ‘Mercedes’ and its fiberglass country boat. The country boat is usually used to surround the shoals of tuna while fishing, on the high-seas and informed their families. The villagers also said the fishermen of ‘Mercedes’ had spoken to their families and the nearby boats on Friday evening via satellite phone and hence the mishap could have taken place either on Saturday night or early morning, Vallavilai villagers suspect. Officials of Department of Fisheries had been informed about the tragedy, the villagers said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/11-fishermen-missing-after-ship-rams-mechanised-boat/article34405015.ece

25 April 2021||PALAKKAD,TAMIL NADU||Police stop equestrian race in Palakkad||An equestrian race was conducted at Thathamangalam near here on Saturday morning in blatant violation of the COVID-19 restrictions. Hundreds of people gathered to witness the biennial event, throwing caution to the wind. The police stopped the race and slapped cases against many people, including the organisers. The police said they were cheated by the organisers, who had assured the authorities that the event would only be symbolic. The police said 54 horses took part in the race held as part of the Angadivela, which was an integral part of the Vettai Karuppasamy Temple festival at Thathamangalam, a Kerala-Tamil Nadu border village. Cases were registered against all participants and 500-odd villagers who gathered violating the COVID-19 regulations. Many horses had been brought from places such as Ooty, Chennai, Pune, and Agra for the biennial Angadivela festival. The curtains went up on the festival on April 17. A customary elephant parade was also on the cards to be held on May 1. More than 40 elephants used to take part in the elephant parade. The biennial equestrian race along the main roads of the temple street is a traditional event of the festival that used to attract thousands of people from different parts, especially from Tamil Nadu. Festival committee secretary M. Murukanandan had announced that the event would be cancelled in view of the COVID-19 situation. However, the conduct of the race and the gathering of the crowds on both sides of the road surprised the authorities, who swung into action. During the race, one horse lost control and ran into the crowd, before hitting against an iron post and falling down. A village jockey, who rode the horse along the tarred road at great pace without wearing any personal protective gears, escaped unhurt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-stop-equestrian-race-in-palakkad/article34404941.ece

25 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Former CM blames Centre’s ‘inept handling’ for COVID-19 tragedy in States||Former Chief Minister of Puducherry and senior Congress leader V. Narayanasamy on Saturday blamed the Centre’s “inept handling” of the second wave of coronavirus for the tragedy unfolding across several States. In a video message to the media, Mr. Narayanasamy said the poor planning on the part of the Centre to anticipate the need for drugs and oxygen in hospitals for pandemic-stricken patients had resulted in the unabated rise of cases during the second wave. Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of inept handling of the COVID-19 situation, Mr. Narayanasamy said there was a dire shortage of anti-viral drugs, medical oxygen and vaccines in several parts of the country. Had the Centre come out with proper plans to make the required medicines or vaccines and oxygen available well in advance as the second wave was forewarned by experts, it could have ameliorated the impact of the pandemic. “I will only blame the Prime Minister for the present situation in hospitals,” he said. On the situation in Puducherry, Mr. Narayanasamy said while his government had made several arrangements and ramped up infrastructure, set up containment zones and ensured constant vigil by the Revenue and Police departments, the virus was now spreading alarmingly quickly. He called upon the territorial administration to ensure that adequate beds, vaccines and other facilities were available in the health facilities.  ‘Continue OPD services’ Mr. Narayanasamy took strong exception to JIPMER’s decision to shut down elective OPD visits temporarily. He pointed out that JIPMER catered to patients not only in Puducherry but also from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The decision to close the OPD during the current situation is unjustified. About 5,000 people turn up at the OPD in JIPMER every day and shutting the services would be a great injustice to the poor, Mr. Narayanasamy said. He said he had written a letter to the Union Health Minister, seeking his intervention for uninterrupted functioning of the OPD wing in JIPMER. Mr. Narayanasamy also criticised Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan for frequent modifications in implementation of the total lockdown which only confused the people, particularly the traders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/former-cm-blames-centres-inept-handling-for-covid-19-tragedy-in-states/article34405649.ece

Working professionals, who usually make grocery shopping on a weekly basis on Sundays, were forced to do it a day earlier due to the new restrictions. Many bought fish and chicken for the Sunday. At Kasivilangi Fish Market, customers made a beeline to buy fish, undeterred by high prices due to the 60-day fishing ban. “We find it difficult to source fish and are forced to increase the prices. However, our regular customers continue to patronise us,” R. Prabha, a vendor, said. Social distancing norms were ignored in the market, but vendors were content with the sales. “With the COVID-19 second wave and Sunday lockdown, we were worried about our business. Although we are incurring some losses, sales like these make us happy,” he said. Some of the customers said they had no choice but to buy meat and fish a day earlier. “We cook non-vegetarian food in our house only on Sundays. Due to the lockdown, we have to buy and store it for a day,” P. Bharathi, one of the customers, said.

Ramanan and his wife Vrinda Ramanan from the city have released a glossy coffee-table book on the sacred sanctum of Sri Venkateswara Temple commissioned by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) in Andhra Pradesh, with a view to archiving the hallowed Vaishnavite shrine’s rich heritage. Titled ‘Tirumala Kaliyuga Vaikuntam,’ the 248-page book includes a lavish spread of over 300 photographs (selected from at least 10,000 taken by Mr. Ramanan, who is also an avid lensman and professional architect), accompanied by illustrations and writings on various aspects related to the temple complex’s history, legends, art, architecture, flora and fauna, festivals, and so on. Did for TTD “We were approached by TTD officials three years ago, after they were gifted a copy of our book ‘Srirangam Bhooloka Vaikuntam’ where we chronicled the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in detail. The Tirumala temple complex is more than 1,300 years old, and the authorities felt the need for a similar volume as a document of social record,” Mr. Ramanan told The Hindu.  Both Mr. Ramanan and his wife Vrinda, who is a trained Bharatanatyam artiste, mountaineer and a columnist, made frequent visits to the sprawling temple complex for two years as part of their research for the book. TTD’s archivists also provided rare photographs and information to add depth to the tome. It has it all “We have covered the entire gamut of facts related to the temple - from the legend, history, art, architecture, the daily, weekly and monthly festivals, flora and fauna of the hill on which it is located, and the role of TTD. We also got to see the arrangements made here for water supply and waste management, and 12 places of worship related to the temple,” said Mr. Ramanan. The Ramanans have donated the first 1,000 copies of the book to the TTD as an act of ‘seva.’ There are photo spreads on some of the rites that have made the temple town of Tirupati famous – the delectable ‘Laddoo Prasadam,’ a sweet offering that has been made here since 1715 with its own Geographical Indication (GI) tag, and the tonsuring of hair for goddess Neela Devi, the consort of Lord Vishnu.

25 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Tomato price drops due to heavy arrivals||Heavy arrivals have led to a steep decrease in price of tomato in the city. A kg of tomato was sold between Rs. 7 and Rs. 8 in the retail market on Saturday. It was Rs. 5, the wholesale rate, at Gandhi Market on Saturday. A carton of tomato (25 kg) was sold for Rs. 150 in the wholesale market. The price of tomato, one of the essential cooking items in households, ranged between Rs. 30 and Rs. 35 a kg in January. The current drop was similar to the price trend in the third quarter of 2018. The price of tomato plummeted to Rs. 8 a kg in the retail market then. The downward trend began during the first week of February. It went down to Rs. 20 a kg during the first week of February. The price was Rs. 10 a kg on Wednesday and Thursday. It has gone down further now. Traders attribute the price drop to heavy arrivals outstripping the demand. They say that the Tiruchi market receives 25 lorries of supply from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh every day. There were supplies from Manapparai, Thuvarankurichi, Vaiyampatti, Oddanchathiram, Pollachi, Coimbatore, Theni, Dindigul and Kallupatti too. “We require 15 to 20 loads of tomato for the markets in Tiruchi and its surroundings. However, we receive 25 loads daily. Heavy arrival will automatically lead to price drop,” said M. K. Kamalakannan, a tomato trader at Gandhi Market. He said that the current trend might continue for a few more weeks. However, it was to be seen whether the lockdown restrictions might shoot up tomato price or not.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tomato-price-drops-due-to-heavy-arrivals/article34405011.ece

Nehru lodged a complaint with the Returning Officer (RO) of the constituency over movement of CCTV (closed circuit television) technicians carrying a laptop within the counting centre at Jamal Mohamed College campus on Saturday morning. Mr. Nehru, who submitted a representation to RO Viswanathan on Saturday in this regard, alleged that a few technicians, tasked with fitting CCTVs and permitted entry into the campus by the Returning Officer, were found working atop the building at around 3 a.m. on Saturday. When the police conducted a check, on being alerted, the technicians were found to be working with a laptop although they were not permitted to carry one. “How did the policemen guarding the centre allow the technicians to carry the laptop without specific permission from the Returning Officer? This has given rise to suspicions that they could have changed the votes polled in the EVMs,” Mr. Nehru alleged. The laptop used by the technicians be impounded immediately and kept in the strong room, he demanded and urged the RO to ensure that such incidents did not take place again. Mr. Nehru said already he had raised objections against security personnel on duty using smart phones and laptops on floors above the strong room and counting halls where they have been provided accommodation. “We had sought their shifting to another block, but no action has been taken,” he claimed. When contacted, the Returning Officer said that work on installing CCTVs, some electrical and civil works were under way at the counting hall and the counting centre. Only Public Works Department-approved workers were engaged in the work, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nehru-complains-about-suspicious-movement-in-counting-centre/article34404993.ece

Putting an end to rumours of that weekday curfew will be extended, Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar said, “The government does not have any plan to extend the curfew on weekdays. It has imposed restrictions for 14 days. We are hoping we do not go beyond this. We cannot stopall economic activity, like we did last year following the pandemic outbreak.” He urged citizens to cooperate with the government and follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Police barricaded major junctions and shut down flyovers to contain unnecessary vehicle movements. As many as 1,255 vehicles were seizedand 23 shops and commercial establishments were booked under the NDMA Act for violating the curfew. “Anticipating that people might venture out, heavy police security was deployed and patrolling was intensified. This will continue till the curfew ends on Monday,” a senior police officer said. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, accompanied by Police Commissioner Kamal Pant and Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Sandeep Patil inspected parts of the city on Saturday, especially crowded areas such as Basaveshwara Circle, K.R.

25 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cabinet to take call on free vaccination for all||The State government is considering various options, including free vaccination for all, in view of inoculation against COVID-19 being thrown open to the entire adult population from May 1. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who also holds the Finance portfolio, is learnt to have discussed with officials of the Finance and Health departments the amount required for providing vaccination for free. Speaking to presspersons on Saturday, Home and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Health and Family Welfare Minister K. Sudhakar said the Cabinet meeting on Monday would take a call on this. Already a few State governments have proposed to provide vaccination for free, including for those in the age group of 18-44 years, from May 1. At present, COVID-19 vaccination is provided free of cost at government primary health centres and government hospitals for citizens above the age of 45. Private hospitals charge a fee. Mr. Sudhakar said he would present a report at the Cabinet meeting on the arrangements made to administer vaccine from May 1. Other Ministers, too, are to present their views. The State government had, on Thursday, approved purchase of one crore doses of Covishield vaccine in the first phase at a cost of Rs. 400 crore. The Chief Minister urged all those aged above 18 to register themselves for the vaccine starting from April 28. The Opposition parties have been demanding administration of vaccine for free to all citizens of the State. Sources indicated that officials of the Health Department were working out a plan for the entire exercise and were expected to come up with data on the present situation, the number of people in the age group of 18 to 44 years, the future requirements of vaccine, logistical issues, and the expenses involved. “It was not just the quantity of vaccine needed for the people in the age group of 18 to 44 from May 1, but also the backlog of people who are 45 and above. A large number of people in the age group of 45 and above still have not received their first jab. Officials are also working out the data on how many people have received the first jab and are waiting for the second shot,” a source said. On the shortage of oxygen, Mr. Bommai said industries of steel, power and cement have been instructed to manufacture oxygen and divert it for medical purposes. The State-owned power plants are expected to supply oxygen shortly, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cabinet-to-take-call-on-free-vaccination-for-all/article34405099.ece
25 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rising demand for oxygen propels suppliers to the forefront||Subasish Guha Roy’s phone does not stop ringing these days. Every day he fields desperate calls from hospitals, government institutions, and family members of COVID-19 patients. As managing director of Universal Air Products, he has what everyone wants: oxygen. For the most part, Mr. Roy is unable to meet the demand of the people pleading with him for oxygen as it outstrips supply. But he attends every call and tries to direct families to other resources. “It’s an emergency and people are stressed,” says Mr. Roy, who as MD of one of the leading producers of medical oxygen in the State, is one of the more sought-after people. “The allotment of oxygen to the State has to be increased. That is the only way out of this crisis,” he said. The Union Government’s decision to increase daily oxygen allocation from the existing 300 to 800 tonnes is expected to provide some relief. This comes a day after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday to increase Karnataka’s oxygen quota to 1,471 tonnes per day (TPD) based on the projected daily cases by May 1.  Given the oxygen requirement across India, the Union government has centralised the oxygen supply grid. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade allots States a quota almost every day based on their oxygen need. Karnataka has an installed capacity of 812 TPD of medical oxygen, but until Saturday had been allotted a quota of 300 TPD by the Centre. Crisis in KK districts  The hope is that the increase in supply will ease the crisis faced in several districts in Kalyana Karnataka. Oxygen ran out at Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences on Thursday and after an SOS call an oxygen tanker was rushed from Kalaburagi, a district also reeling under severe shortage. “The price of oxygen cylinders has shot up several times, but even at these exorbitant costs we are scrambling for supply,” said a senior doctor running a hospital in Kalaburagi. Several private hospitals are shifting patients who need oxygen to government hospitals, a trend observed in many districts like Kalaburagi and Mandya, facing an oxygen crunch. “The district hospitals presently have better supply of oxygen, but the beds are running out and their oxygen supply is not unlimited either,” said Rajendra Prasad, an oxygen supplier in Mandya, who had been running from pillar to post in four districts for the last three days trying to get oxygen cylinders refilled. Mr. Roy advocated “reasoned use” of medical oxygen, as was also suggested by Mr. Modi at the conference of Chief Ministers on Friday. “Doctors need to desist from administering medical liquid oxygen for even borderline cases. We must start using oxygen concentrators that are available even on e-commerce platforms,” he said.

25 April 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Govt. urged to set up a co-op. online agri marketing platform||As the State has imposed restrictions following the second wave of COVID-19, there is a sense of anxiety in the farm sector though the government has made it clear there will be no curbs on movement of farm produce. Restrictions during the first wave had demonstrated the difficulties involved in getting a market for farm produce at the right time under similar circumstances. T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, agricultural economist and former chairman of Karnataka Agricultural Price Commission (KAPC), has suggested to the government to come out with a cooperative online agri marketing platform to help farmers sell their produce without hassle. “It is difficult for an individual farmer to sell his entire produce through online mode as logistics would be an issue. If the government steps in and helps in linking farmers’ groups such as farmers producers’ organisations with bulk buyers such as big apartments through a cooperative online marketing platform, it will be a win-win situation for both farmers and consumers,” he said. He has suggested that the government rope in residents’ welfare associations of apartments in big cities such as Bengaluru and convince them to provide space for selling farm produce. This will prevent apartment dwellers from scouting for fresh produce outside during the pandemic while farmers would get a direct market. “Health and food occupy the centre stage during COVID times. It is a criminal offence to allow food to go to waste. But our survey has shown that about 28% of the farmers who were surveyed could not sell their produce in the first phase of COVID-19 from May to September last year,” he said. Of this, about 17% of the farmers could not get market access, while 11% lost their produce as it was rotten. Only around 30% were able to sell their produce properly in main markets, while another 43% managed to sell in small markets. Mr. Kammaradi has also advocated for the revival of Minimum Support Price (MSP) as per the recommendation of the M.S. Swaminathan report to ensure that farmers get 50% of the margin over the comprehensive cost of cultivation. He argued that it should be made a punishable offence to buy produce below MSP by granting legal status to MSP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-urged-to-set-up-a-co-op-online-agri-marketing-platform/article34405092.ece
25 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Beds: Notices issued to private hospitals||Several private medical hospitals are still delaying handing over beds to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). On Saturday, Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta visited Vikram Hospital, Shifaa Hospital, and HBS Hospital and directed health officials to issue show-cause notices to the managements for failing to comply. This is the second time in a week the BBMP has served notice to Vikram Hospital. Mr. Gupta told reporters later that 11,000 beds would be available under the government quota over the next few days. In the backdrop of complaints from people who still have to wait for days to get their COVID-19 test results, he said action would be taken against labs that do not upload the results on the ICMR portal in time. Police do rounds Senior police officials also did the rounds of hospitals. P. Harishekaran, IGP (Training), who visited Fortis Hospital on Cunningham Road, said police officers were also coordinating with companies providing oxygen to ensure adequate supply. According to Mr. Gupta, there is no oxygen shortage. The State produces 800 tonnes of oxygen, of which around 200 tonnes was needed for medical purposes. With supply and distribution being an issue, an additional six tankers had been arranged. Meanwhile, Home Minister Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said, “Many police personnel who were on enforcement duty have contracted COVID-19 in the last few days. Three CCCs have been set up in the city to exclusively treat them and their families.” A committee of the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority appointed to monitor the situation in the State on Saturday found an acute shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir injections in Apollo, Sagar and Jayanagar public hospitals in Jayanagar area during an inspection. It has issued instructions to the BBMP and the State government to ensure supply of oxygen, medicine to the hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/beds-notices-issued-to-private-hospitals/article34405467.ece
25 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||29,438 new cases, 208 deaths in Karnataka||The frightening march of COVID-19 second wave continued in Karnataka as 29,438 new cases and 208 deaths were reported on Saturday. With this, the total number of cases in the State now stands at 13,04,397. Bengaluru Urban remained the most affected with as many as 17,342 new cases and 149 deaths, according to the media bulletin of the Department of Health and Family Welfare. The total number of active cases in the capital now stands at 1.62 lakh as against the State’s 2.34 lakh. As many as 1,280 patients are in the ICU. The positivity rate in the State stood at 15.52, and case fatality rate 0.7. The number of tests conducted was 1.89 lakh, which means this year, as many as 1.03 crore tests have been completed, and since 2020, 2.45 crore tests. With 9,058 new recoveries, the total number of discharged patients in Karnataka went up to 10.55 lakh. Overall, there have been 13.04 positive cases in the State. As many as 14,283 people have lost their lives so far. Earlier in the day, speaking to mediapersons, Health Minister K. Sudhakar referred to the severity of the second wave and said the new variants were posing a challenge to the medical fraternity too, and in this wave, propelled by what was being dubbed as the Indian variant, the demand for oxygen was far higher than in the first. On the weekend lockdown that kicked in the State, he said, “The Spanish flu lasted two years and was four to six times more deadly. In the COVID-19 second wave, the fatality rate is 0.4 to 0.5%. The new set of restrictions are aimed at breaking the chain,” he added. Referring to the sudden spike in the number of people developing breathing problems and requiring oxygen and hospitalisation this time, he said this was not the case during the first wave. “The virus will undergo continuous changes,” he said, urging the media to focus on the recoveries too. “Many have recovered without treatment. There is 86.43% recovery rate,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/29438-new-cases-208-deaths-in-karnataka/article34405086.ece

25 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Take action against illegal childcare centres: HC||The High Court of Karnataka has directed the State government to take immediate action against childcare centres operating in the city without registration following a disclosure that there were at least 56 such illegal centres, including one operated by an official of the Department of Public Instruction (DPI). The court also directed the government to take a decision on setting up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe instances of child trafficking disclosed in the report on a survey, carried out on the court’s direction, of minor children engaged in begging and hawking on city streets. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the directions acting on reports submitted by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA), which had identified 720 minors engaged in begging and hawking in several parts of the city. The KSLSA had also stated that 27 of these children were likely to be under the control of a mafia.The court had ordered the survey based on a PIL petition by the city-based Letzkit Foundation. To M.P. and not back When the KSLSA started mapping out street children, one Nagarathna, the then BEO of Vijayanagar, who was subsequently posted in the midday meal section of Zilla Panchayat, Bengaluru, brought to its notice that four children, staying at the childcare centre run by her in the name of Sarayu Charitable Trust, had gone to Madhya Pradesh along with their parents but did not come back. The KSLSA communicated the information to the Madhya Pradesh Legal Services Authority, which traced the children to a village and found that some of them were sexually abused by the caretakers at the centre run by Ms. Nagarathna. An FIR was registered in M.P. and it was later transferred to Bengaluru. This resulted in the KSLSA inspecting the Sarayu Charitable Trust, to find that it had been operating on the premises of the government school at Hosahalli, 9th Main Road, Vijayanagar, for the past eight years and 33 minor children (19 boys and 14 girls), engaged in begging and hawking in the Vijayanagar area, were housed in the childcare centre without any maintenance of register and without the centre being registered under Section 41 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015. The report also listed 56 other such unregistered childcare centres in the city. KSLSA member-secretary H. Shashidhara Shetty also informed the court in the report that initially, the jurisdictional police did not take proper steps and were about to give a clean chit to those involved in operating the childcare centre. The KSLSA report stated that a through probe was needed as many of these 33 children appeared to be part of human trafficking from M.P.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/take-action-against-illegal-childcare-centres-hc/article34405094.ece

Karnataka Sugarcane Growers’ Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar has urged the government to immediately convene a meeting of farmers’ representatives and other authorities to discuss the measures to be taken to protect farmers during COVID-19 times. “We are not against imposing tough measures to contain the spread of the infection. But our only request is that the government should initiate steps to protect farmers,” he said. According to him, already the demand for farm produce has started diminishing in the market. “Earlier, about 350 truckloads of vegetables used to be transported from Mysuru to Kerala on a daily basis. But now it has come down to 50 trucks,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-leaders-ask-govt-to-convene-meeting/article34405103.ece
25 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State to set up task force with CII||Karnataka is setting up a special task force in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to fight the COVID-19 second wave. The task force will explore ways to quickly augment medical and non-medical infrastructure, including a massive call centre and modular ICU units, to manage the virus attack and contain its spread more effectively. According to Minister for Health & Family Welfare and Medical Education K. Sudhakar, the State government is also planning to set up modular ICU units to address the rising demand for ICU beds. “About 3,000-5,000 modular ICU beds are being planned in the State. A few companies have come forward to set up this facility in 7 to 10 days,” he said while addressing CII representatives in a video meet on Saturday. The minister said the task force was expected to help the State with respect to technology, software applications, know-how, sourcing of medicines, medical equipment and oxygen supply. The modalities of the task force would be ready soon. The executives of the proposed call centre (likely to on the lines of Aptha Mitra helpline set up during the first wave of COVID-19) would be trained by medical professionals from Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences. This helpline would act as a master helpline for all aspects pertaining to COVID-19, he further said. The Minister urged the industry to channel their CSR funds for pandemic-related activities. “I urge the industry to explore possible areas for CSR investments. More than the funds, we are looking for technological know-how and contacts for sourcing medicines and medical equipment. Currently, 95% of the patients are in home isolation and technology will play a major role in monitoring them on a daily basis.” He also sought the help of CII to identify and procure Remdesivir and Tocilizomab injections from other countries. Vikram Kirloskar, former CII president and CMD of Kirloskar Systems, cardiologist Devi Shetty, CII Karnataka Chairman Ramesh Ramadurai and Kris Gopalakrishnan, former CII president and Co-founder of Infosys were part of the meeting. Stressing on the potential shortage of doctors, Dr. Shetty said, “Currently, all the headlines are on oxygen shortage. But, very soon, the headlines will focus on the shortage of doctors and nurses.” He asked the health minister to work with the Uniongovernment to augment medical staff by roping in 2.2 lakh nursing students in the country who are waiting for their final exams. Similarly, there are about 1.3 lakh MBBS students preparing for NEET exams, which may not happen. “The government should deploy them in COVID-19 management and incentivise them for this work through grace marks or quota or preference in government jobs,” Dr. Shetty added. Mr. Kirloskar urged the government to release official protocols for home-isolated patients and hospitalised patients as there was too much of misinformation on the internet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-to-set-up-task-force-with-cii/article34405080.ece

Some who ventured out on vehicles without a valid reason were penalised by the police. After 10 a.m., almost all the major roads in the cities and towns had little traffic as people chose to stay indoors in the wake of the curfew. It was only a few goods vehicle and those venturing out for emergency purposes who were seen on the roads apart from the police personnel stationed mostly at important junctions.

Across all the northern districts, several vehicles were seized by the police for violating the curfew. Meanwhile bus stations in these districts witnessed very less people. State transport officials had communicated that long-distance buses will be operated depending on the demand. And accordingly some buses were run.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/residents-of-bombay-karnataka-honour-weekend-curfew/article34405075.ece
25 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Union Minister to seek treatment cost reduction in private hospitals||Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi has said that discussions will be held with management boards of private hospitals in Dharwad district for reducing the cost of treatment for COVID-19 patients by 50%. Speaking to presspersons after launching a software-based ambulance service (with oxygen), developed by the Dharwad district administration, in Hubballi on Saturday, Mr. Joshi said that he would also speak to Dharmasthala Dharmadhikari Sri Veerendra Heggade for reducing the treatment cost at the SDM Hospital in Dharwad. Mr. Joshi said that former minister M.B. Patil has announced in Vijayapura that the treatment cost would be reduced in BLDE Society hospitals. “Accordingly, we will seek similar reduction in treatment cost in bigger private hospitals in the district,” he said. Mr. Joshi said that there was no need to panic as the requisite measures were being taken for ensuring treatment to the patients. “According to experts, the mutant strain of the pandemic which is being reported during the second wave can cause severe infection. Both the State and the Union governments are making efforts to check the spread of the disease and have held discussions with doctors across the country. Although Remdesivir is not the only medicine for COVID-19, unnecessary scare has been created among the public about its shortage,” he said. Mr. Joshi said that considering the shortage of oxygen in various cities in the country, special trains and flights were being sent with medical oxygen. This apart, oxygen allocation had been increased to various States and 80 lakh families will be supplied foodgrains by the Centre, he said. He said that the Mother and Child Hospital in Dharwad was almost completed and additional beds for COVID-19 patients were being arranged there in addition to other hospitals. Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar said that the district administration had launched the services of 10 ambulances for ferrying COVID-19 patients to hospitals. While seven will be available in Hubballi, three will cater to Dharwad. Nodal officers will monitor the services of the ambulances round-the-clock, he said. Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil said that while 40 ambulances were available in the district, 10 would be dedicated for COVID-19 patients. Steps had been taken to ensure that the patient would reach the hospital within an hour of the call.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/union-minister-to-seek-treatment-cost-reduction-in-private-hospitals/article34405070.ece

25 April 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Kalaburagi officials struggle to get cryogenic tankers for oxygen transport||In the face of medical facilities, especially those designated for COVID-19 patients, starving with shortfall of medical oxygen, the Kalaburagi district administration is struggling to get cryogenic tankers used for transporting oxygen from production plants to hospitals. In a virtual meeting with Deputy Chief Minister and Kalaburagi in-charge Govind Karjol on Saturday, Deputy Commissioner Vijaya Jyothsna pleaded helplessness by stating that her administration was unable to get the vehicles despite her best efforts. “Presently we are, somehow, managing to get the medical oxygen transported from the Jindal plant in Ballari district. The problem, however, is that we are not getting cryogenic tankers locally for the transportation of oxygen. Our efforts to get them from Hyderabad also went in vain,” Ms. Jyotshan told Mr. Karjol. In his response, Mr. Karjol asked the officer to give an advertisement in the media expressing interest in hiring the cryogenic tankers on rent. He also assured the administration that he too would talk to officers concerned in Bengaluru and try to arrange the vehicles. Taking note of the underutilisation of the ESIC Medical Complex in Kalaburagi, Mr. Karjol directed Mr. Jyothsna to make use of the huge structure for treating COVID-19 patients after putting necessary things in place. “You need to keep 60%-70% beds for COVID-19 patients. The beds in the other departments in various hospitals should be used for COVID-19 patients... ESIC Hospital in Kalaburagi is a government hospital and you should make complete use of it. There are other health facilities such as branches of Kidwai [Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology] and Jayadeva [Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research] that can also be used for treating COVID-19 patients,” he told Mr. Jyothsna. Stressing on the need of having more health workers in health emergencies, Mr. Karjol directed the Deputy Commissioner to recruit health staff, especially the staff nurses, as and when required showing flexibility in the legal procedures. The Minister also directed the administration to tighten security in areas sharing borders with Maharashtra and Telangana to ensure that only those with a COVID-19 negative report would enter the State. “People who had migrated to other places are returning to their native places in the district after restrictions were imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. You have to ensure that they would get enough work locally by expanding and the job scheme. There are reports that the pandemic could spread through the air. You have to take stringent action against those who spit in public places,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kalaburagi-officials-struggle-to-get-cryogenic-tankers-for-oxygen-transport/article34405068.ece
25 April 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Rural health workers deputed to VIMS without risk allowance||Rural health workers in Ballari district who were deputed to Vijayanagara Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) for treating COVID-19 patients have expressed discontentment by stating that they were deputed without any risk allowance. Ballari is one of the districts in the State that was hit hard by the pandemic. It has been reporting an increasing number of cases as well as deaths on a daily basis. Between April 4 and 23, over 5,000 new cases were reported and 20 people succumbed to the infection in the last four days. The increasing number of cases has mounted more burdens on VIMS, a State-run autonomous medical institution that was designated as COVID-19 hospital, as it is facing a severe resources crunch including health staff. In order to fill the gap between the existing staff and the requirement, the District Health and Family Welfare Officer deputed 60 of the 237 community health officers from its rural facilities in the first phase. “Injustice was meted out to us last year too when we were deputed for COVID-19 work without offering risk allowance. We performed many risk tasks during the COVID-19 peak last year, including screening at check-posts, contract tracing, and throat swab collection. Yet, we were not paid any risk allowance. Nor were we offered insurance cover. A community health officer died while discharging COVID-19 duties. No compensation was paid to his family members. The government is repeating the same injustice this time also by deputing us for COVID-19 without offering any risk allowances,” Shivashankar, a health worker from Hosapete, said. The deputed health staff also expressed their concerns on the adverse consequences in the rural areas after their deputation to district headquarters. “There is a lot of work at the rural health facilities. The health workers who are recruited on outsource basis are handling many health issues of the rural population including deliveries and childcare. Moreover, the COVID-19 has extended its tentacles deep in rural areas. If we are shifted to district headquarter, the rural patients would be deprived of healthcare. We request the District Health and Family Welfare Officer to withdraw his order and restore us back to our places,” Tukaram Naik from Sandur said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rural-health-workers-deputed-to-vims-without-risk-allowance/article34405077.ece
25 April 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Activities come to a standstill in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi||Activities in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts came to a standstill with the enforcement of weekend curfew on Saturday to prevent spread of COVID-19. The district administrations are likely to face challenges in enforcing the curfew on Sunday when a host of marriages are scheduled. With milk, vegetable vendors, and other essential products sellers downing their shutters by 9.30 a.m., it was a total lockdown in Mangaluru by 10 a.m. While private city buses were off the road, few skeletal services of KSRTC operated from State Bank Circle and KSRTC bus stand. “We are running only those buses in which around 20% of the seats are occupied,” said an official supervising operations of buses at the KSRTC bus stand. Students from Kerala and other parts of the country were seen coming in private cars, taxis and autorickshaws to Mangaluru Central and Mangaluru Junction to get trains. The railway authorities were seen entering the names of these passengers and allowing into the platform after checking their temperature and ensuring that they properly wear face masks. The Mangaluru city police set up checkposts at 54 places in the city, including at major junction like Clock Tower junction where about 12 personnel were posted to stop unnecessary movement of vehicles. Vehicle movement was barred on the road between Clock Tower and. A.B.Shetty Circle and diverted to the stretch between Clock Tower Junction- Rao and Rao Circle. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar said 35 mobile squads, with about three squads for each police station, have also been deployed. A total of 1,000 police personnel have been used for bandobast duties.

Rajendra, Mr. Sonawane, and other officials. Dr. Rajendra told reporters that apart from review of enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions and protocols, Mr. Nimbalkar reviewed the arrangements for treatment of 3,200 patients. “We do not have any problem for beds and medicines for the next 15 days,” he said and added that Mr. Nimbalkar was apprised of likely issues that the district would face in the coming days which will require intervention of the State government. Mr. Nimbalkar reviewed enforcement of COVID-19 protocols in the city and Dakshina Kannada and looked into progress in the vaccination of police personnel and their family members, post vaccination infection, and psychological issues, if any, faced by the police personnel. He also took information of crime scenario during the pandemic. The weekend curfew was total in Udupi district with police barricading some major points in Udupi town and other areas on Saturday.

25 April 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Fruit-bearing trees to be raised on 100 acres in Belthangady||Forest Minister Aravind Limbavali on Saturday said the department will launch a scheme to plant saplings of fruit-bearing trees on 100 acres in Belthangady taluk on June 5 as a pilot programme. The initiative will be replicated in all districts from next year, the Minister said. He was speaking to reporters after holding a meeting with department officials, people’s representatives and Dharmasthala Dharmadhikari D. Veerendra Heggade at Dharmasthala. Mr. Heggade will launch the programme, the Minister said. Directing Mangaluru Deputy Conservator of Forest V. Karikalan to be the nodal officer for the scheme, Mr. Limbavali asked him to procure the required number of saplings and seeds. The department should raise forests on the lines of Miyawaki urban forest with public participation, he said, adding that necessary training to personnel should be given by May 15 before its symbolical launch on June 5. In his introductory address, Mr. Heggade said it was everyone’s responsibility to leave the universe in a sustainable condition for the next generation. ]It becomes more significant at a time when the entire world was looking at India for guidance, he said. Mr. Heggade further said he wrote to the Forest Minister recently to encourage planting of saplings of fruit-bearing trees to discourage human conflicts with wild animals entering habitation due to scarcity of food in forests. Mr. Limbavali responded positively to the suggestion and held Saturday’s consultation meeting, he said. Mr. Heggade suggested saplings of trees namely mango, jackfruit, bamboo, amla, kokum, Indian blackberry etc. Belthangady MLA K. Harish Poonja, MLC K.

25 April 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Simplify conditions to allow marriages and shopping: DYFI||The Democratic Youth Federation of India on Saturday said though the government had permitted solemnisation of marriages during the fortnight curfew, people were finding it hard to follow the conditions imposed for the same. As such, there was a need to simplify the conditions and also allow shops selling marriage essentials, said DYFI State president Muneer Katipalla. While permissions were being given only for marriages, the Additional Superintendent of Police in Udupi district organised the mehandi programme of his daughter’s marriage on Friday, thus indicating that different yardsticks were being applied to the common man and the powerful, he said in a statement here. Mr. Katipalla said conditions, namely every guest at the marriage should get a pass producing his or her Aadhaar card and allowing only such persons to travel during curfew hours etc., were some of the conditions impossible to adhere to. As such, the government should allow holding of marriages by adhering to existing COVID-19 guidelines without troubling the common man. Added to these woes, the government has got closed commercial establishments which were essential to conduct a marriage. He urged the government to withdraw the pass system and allow at least 150 people to attend weddings adhering to COVID-19 guidelines besides allowing wedding shopping. Mr. Katipalla alleged the mehandi programme at the Udupi Additional SP’s residence was conducted violating COVID-19 guidelines wherein many dignitaries, including the Udupi Deputy Commissioner attended the programme. This was a shameful example indicating differential treatment to the powerful and the common man, he said urging the government to initiate stringent action against the Additional SP and others concerned. Meanwhile a photograph of Udupi DC G. Jagadeesha attending the ceremony at the Additional SP’s programme without wearing a mask went viral on social media. ‘Not a public place’ However, Mr. Jagadeesha clarified that the programme was conducted at the residence of the Additional SP, next to his residence and it was not a public place. About four to five close families attended the programme and he removed the mask for the sake of photograph, the DC added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/simplify-conditions-to-allow-marriages-and-shopping-dyfi/article34405596.ece

25 April 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Call for youth to donate blood before vaccination||With blood banks likely to face shortage of donors for about three months as those aged 18 and above will undergo vaccination for COVID-19 from May 1, there has been a call from the blood banks from Dakshina Kannada and Udupi to prospective donors to donate blood and then go for vaccination. In a release, Avinash Shetty, Medical Superintendent of Kasturba Hospital Manipal, said as per the guidelines there is restriction in donating blood for 28 days after vaccination. As most of the blood donors are in the age group between 18 and 40, they cannot donate blood for about three months from two doses of vaccination. This was likely to result in shortage of blood, which may lead to postponing of emergency surgeries. Dr. Shetty requested donors to donate blood to the Blood Bank of Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, two days before going for vaccination. ‘‘If there are more than 10 donors, we will arrange vehicle for pick-up and drop,’’ he said. As per the information about the blood availability posted on Jeeva Sanjeevini portal of the State Drug Control Department, Regional Blood Transfusion Centre of the Government Wenlock Hospital, Indian Red Cross Society at the Lady Goschen Hospital and eight other blood banks in Dakshina Kannada presently has sufficient stock of packed red blood cells (PRBC) in A+ve, AB+ve, B+ve and O+ve and very few stock of PRBC in A-ve, AB-ve, B-ve and O-ve blood groups. While all the 10 blood banks have enough stock of fresh frozen plasma, cryptoprecipitate was available at the blood banks in Wenlock, KMC Hospital, A.J. Hospital, and K.S. Hegde Hospital. “The stock is coming down. We need more donors to come forward,” said Sharath Kumar, Head of the Regional Blood Transfusion Centre at the Wenlock Hospital. Bhaskarchandra Shetty, the nominated member to the Mangaluru City Corporation Council and honorary president of Hindu Yuva Sene, which has been regularly blood donation camps across the city, said the district administration can encourage blood donation by giving priority for blood donors during vaccination. “This will encourage more youth to donate,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/call-for-youth-to-donate-blood-before-vaccination/article34405599.ece

25 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Total lockdown enforced in Mysuru||The first day of the weekend lockdown in Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar and Kodagu on Saturday was total with people complying with the restrictions imposed as a measure to fight the pandemic. Mysuru city as also other towns in the region wore a deserted look and all commercial establishments had downed shutters and were closed for business as stipulated by the government. In Mysuru K.R. Circle, D. Devaraj Urs Road, Sayyaji Rao Road, Dhanavantri Road, Ashoka Road, Santhepet and other major commercial hubs were completely shut. Only pharmaceutical shops were open and this was the scenario even in residential areas that witnessed a semblance of activity between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. after which the lockdown was complete. The streets were bereft of vehicles but for the movement of ambulances and people on an emergency errand. The KSRTC operated a few skeletal services during the first half of the day and they were latter withdrawn. Though a few autorickshaws were found stationed they saw very few takers. The police said some of the establishments under essential services like grocery stores, milk parlours, etc., functioned from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m and were subsequently shut. However, there was exemption for people who had their vaccination scheduled and for those who had medical emergencies. The bulk of the industries remained closed but for a few units classified as coming under either defence as in case of BEML or export-oriented unit as in case of J.K. Tyres. The Mysore Industries Association said almost 90% of the establishments in the industrial areas remained closed as they did not come under the category of units listed as ‘essential’ to merit an exemption from the lockdown. The situation was no different in the smaller towns as well and Nanjangud which otherwise bustles with activity presented a forlorn look. The streets were deserted and the shops were shut. Though a major pilgrimage centre, the town has stopped receiving the pilgrims since April 15 as Srikanteshwara temple has been closed for visitors till May 15 or until further orders by the Archaeological Survey of India. The weekend lockdown in other towns in Mysuru district including Hunsur, H.D. Kote, Periyapatana, T. Narsipura and K.R. Nagar, etc., too received a spontaneous response given the gravity of the situation. In the neighbouring district of Chamarajanagar which reported as many as 275 new cases on Friday, the weekend curfew was complete. A large number of daily wagers travel from Chamarajanagar and surrounding areas to Mysuru in search of their livelihood and work in the construction sector. But there was no such movement on Saturday. Other towns including Gundlupet and Kollegal too shut down. Similar scenes were witnessed in Mandya and Kodagu districts as well with the people remaining indoors given the severity of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/total-lockdown-enforced-in-mysuru/article34405198.ece
25 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Bengaluru tops COVID-19 deaths per million, followed by Mysuru and DK||Accounting for 5,382 of the total 13,759 COVID-19 deaths in Karnataka till April 21, Bengaluru Urban figures at the top of the mortality chart in the State with 506 deaths per million (DPM) population followed by Mysuru, Dakshina Kannada, and Dharwad at 341, 322 and 321 DPM, respectively. Bengaluru Urban has topped in mortality not only in absolute numbers, but also in DPM population based on Unique Identification Authority of India’s projected population figures as on December 31, 2020. An analysis of DPM population is considered to give a picture of the mortality in proportion to the population in a specific geographic region. Besides, Bengaluru Urban also accounts for 63% deaths in Karnataka during the four-week period between March 24 and April 21 of the second wave. Out of the 1,301 deaths occurring during the four-week period, a whopping 819, or almost two thirds, took place in Bengaluru against the 482 in the rest of the State. At the bottom of the DPM chart is Chitradurga with 38 DPM followed by Yadgir at 53, besides Belagavi and Bagalkot both of which have a DPM of 67. Despite its high numbers, the 28-day moving growth rate (MGR) of mortality in Bengaluru Urban at 18 was lesser than Bengaluru Rural’s 23, Bidar’s 22 and Kalaburagi’s 19. Sharing the data with The Hindu , Jeevan Raksha, a public private partnership initiative by Proxima, a management consulting firm, with technical support and guidance of Public Health Foundation of India, pointed out that for every square kilometre in Karnataka, there are six COVID-19 positive patients. “When we separate Bengaluru Urban and look at the rest of Karnataka, a cluster of districts, then the number of COVID-19 cases per kilometre drops to three. This is because in Bengaluru Urban, COVID-19 positive patient density is 300 per square kilometre. In a pandemic environment, positivity is bound to be high in a densely-populated city,” said Jeevan Raksha convenor Mysore Sanjeev. “Poor medical infrastructure and insufficient competent medical professionals to treat the critical patients could be one of the reasons for higher mortality,” said Mr. Sanjeev. Bengaluru added 1.62 lakh new COVID-19 cases during the study period, which took the positive cases per million in Bengaluru Urban from 39,590 to 51,300, while leading to a 10-fold increase in number of active cases from 11,520 to 1,13,374. Gadag and Davangere districts recorded no deaths during the four-week period, though the second wave is considered to be more virulent. Also, the number of deaths were in single digits in as many as 14 districts and zero in two others during the four-week study period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bengaluru-tops-covid-19-deaths-per-million-followed-by-mysuru-and-dk/article34405084.ece
25 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Concern over possible blood shortage ahead of mass vaccination from May 1||Foreseeing shortage of blood following guidelines for blood donation from a donor only after completing 28 days from vaccination, blood banks in Mysuru are making frantic efforts to stock blood units before the vaccination is rolled out for 18 years and above from May 1. Post-COVID-19, blood donation faced stiff challenges and blood banks were overcoming it gradually after the cases started to drop last year. The ongoing curbs over the alarming COVID-19 second wave have come in the way of organising blood donation camps, which has further hit ongoing efforts for stocking up blood. Also, the resurgent COVID-10 pandemic has been deterring donors from volunteering to donate blood visiting the blood banks which they used to do earlier. One-week window The blood banks have a one-week window to stock the units for emergencies and therefore, they have stepped up efforts to maximise donation from people aged between 18 and 45, before they get vaccinated next month on. Blood can also be donated by a person after he or she has recovered from COVID-19 infection, after fulfilling certain conditions. The National Blood Transfusion Council of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued guidelines on blood donation by a vaccinated person. “We are in constant touch with colleges, NGOs and volunteers with requests for urgent blood donation as we are not supposed to draw blood from a person unless he or she completed 28 days from the day of vaccination. There could be a shortage for a few days as 18 years and above will soon be covered under vaccination. We are trying our best to muster units anticipating shortfall,” said B.S. Manjunath, blood bank officer, K.R. Hospital (KRH), MMCRI, Mysuru. Donors age group Dr. Manjunath told The Hindu that the blood bank was distributing 45-60 units of blood daily and sometimes even more to KRH and other hospitals. The maximum number of blood donors were those aged between 18 and 45. “Notices have been put up across all hospitals, colleges and service organisations with a request for voluntary blood donation before vaccination, which is essential for protection from the virus. On social media platforms too we have made the requests. We are keeping our fingers crossed and hoping to mobilise a maximum number of units,” he said. The KRH blood bank managed to get 75 units of blood out of 100 identified for donation at Hunsur, which was organised recently by SVYM, an NGO, as the rest did not qualify for donation. “Any number of people aged above 18 can come to our blood bank and donate before the vaccination. All safety precautions are in place and there is no reason to fear,” he appealed. People interested in donating blood can do it even during COVID-19 weekend curfew with the blood banks ready to facilitate donation and donors can show certificates to authorities upon donation. From May 1, a few more questions will be added in the blood banks’ questionnaire before drawing blood on whether the donor was vaccinated or not, if yes when was the jab taken and whether he or she has completed 28 days after immunisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/concern-over-possible-blood-shortage-ahead-of-mass-vaccination-from-may-1/article34405079.ece
25 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Surge in COVID-19: Passenger occupancy down to double digits||The severity of the second wave of COVID-19 has drastically affected the transportation sector. Coupled with the weekend lockdown that began on Saturday, the number of passengers in buses, trains and flights reduced to two-digit figures. The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) operated only 50 services on Saturday mainly in rural and taluk areas as against about 600 trips that ply normally. This was owing to the lockdown. A similar number will be operated on Sunday, according to KSRTC Divisional Controller K.H. Srinivas. The Mysuru-Bengaluru route had only one bus or two per hour as against a service every 15 or 20 minutes pre-pandemic. The occupancy was not more than 20 to 25 passengers per bus. Though the Indian Railway has gradually reintroduced the trains to operate at least 60 to 70% of pre-pandemic level services, the number of passengers have dropped. On Saturday, there were 78 passengers on Chamundi Express departing from Mysuru against its full capacity of 1,200. Similarly, there were 40 passengers on the Tipu Express from Mysuru to Bengaluru. There were about another 30 in the unreserved category. On the return journey Tipu Express had 58 passengers while Chamundi Express ferried 70. There are 12 flight movements from Mysuru airport and though the occupancy rates after the first wave of the pandemic increased steadily, it is on a decline again. On Saturday the flight to Kochi carried 25 passengers against the full capacity of 72 passengers. The flight to Hyderabad had 14 passengers. The authorities said the flight to Mangaluru has been suspended till May 9th with people unwilling to travel under the present circumstances. The decline in the originating air passenger traffic coincides with the surge in cases. Mysuru Airport Director R. Manjunath said after the first wave the passenger load increased substantially encouraging them to contemplate additional flights to Goa and Chennai. But it has been put on hold given the situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/surge-in-covid-19-passenger-occupancy-down-to-double-digits/article34405199.ece
25 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 Care Centre to be set up at Beedi Workers Hospital||A COVID-19 Care Centre (CCC) will be set up at Beedi Workers Hospital in Kalyanagiri in Mysuru on Monday. Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Commissioner Shilpa Nag, who visited the hospital with former Minister Tanveer Sait on Friday, said the centre will be operationalised at the Beedi Workers’ Hospital in a phased manner from Monday. Once fully operational, It will have about 150 beds including 50 oxygenated beds, Ms. Nag said. “We have received more than 800 cases of COVID-19 in Mysuru in the last few days. The severity of the infection is more this time and the mortality rate is high,” she said emphasising the need for setting up more CCCs across the city in addition to the private and government hospitals. She said the MCC was committed to providing the physical infrastructure for the facility, but added there was a shortage of medical and paramedical staff for the purpose. “We need to recruit more people,” she said. Mr. Sait said centres were opened at Farooqia Institution in Udayagiri and Andalus School in Rajiv Nagar to treat COVID-19 patients last year. Though the CCCs were opened as a voluntary initiative last year, the government too extended support to the facilities by providing PPE kits and medicine worth Rs. 2 crore. “We will start with about 16 oxygenated beds at the new centre right away. We want to increase the number of oxygenated beds to 50, besides have 10 ICU beds and another 5 to 6 beds with ventilator,” he said. The MCC Commissioner’s announcement on setting up of a CCC at the hospital comes in the wake of a letter written by Mr. Sait to Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sidhuri in this regard. In the letter, Mr. Sait said the Department of Health and Family Welfare should take over the hospital and convert it into a CCC in the light of the rising cases in Mysuru. Pointing out that Narasimharaja Assembly constituency did not have any hospital facility in the government sector, Mr. Sait said the authorities should take necessary steps to convert the Beedi Workers’ Hospital into a CCC. Vaccination Mr. Sait also claimed that a lot of residents of Narasimharaja Assembly constituency had overcome vaccine hesitancy. In response to his appeal, the DC had extended the timing for vaccination till 8 p.m. from 6 p.m. to facilitate persons, who are fasting during Ramzan. Appealing to the public to come forward and get vaccinated, Mr. Sait said he had also taken the first dose like many other corporators of MCC. “Vaccination is for our safety,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-care-centre-to-be-set-up-at-beedi-workers-hospital/article34405200.ece
25 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Maneka Gandhi wants camp elephant released||Animal rights activist and MP Maneka Gandhi has called for humane treatment of a wild elephant captured by the Forest Department and retained at Dubare elephant camp. Ms. Gandhi said elephant Kusha has been kept in a kraal on the grounds that it had a wound and was being treated. But a team sent by the Chief Wildlife Warden to ascertain the nature of the injury discovered that it was not the case and ordered that the elephant be released. Though the elephant was released on Friday, his front legs were tethered with heavy chains that could injure it, said the MP. She called for removing the chains immediately and releasing it besides calling for training the officers in the sanctuaries of Karnataka. Elephant Kusha had escaped from Dubare almost an year ago and after a herculean search, was traced in the company of fellow wild elephants. He was separated from the company and forced back into the kraal sometime ago. Kusha was first captured from the wild in an operation in Virajpet taluk of Kodagu district almost four years ago and tamed in Dubare but he broke free to be amidst wild elephants. Another wildlife activist, on conditions of anonymity, said Kusha is a wild tusker who cannot be denied his true home which is the forest. To alienate him from the wilderness is an act of cruelty, said the activist, and argued that it had not killed any human being in the past. To capture him and put him in a kraal after he escaped from the camp almost a year ago defies logic, said the activist, who wanted it to be released and its movements monitored using a radio collar. “We have seven elephants radio-collared and being tracked in M.M. Hills-Chamarajanagar division and Kusha can be the eight elephant,” the activist added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/maneka-gandhi-wants-camp-elephant-released/article34405082.ece

The highest number of cases were reported in Virajpet where 227 tested positive, followed by Somawarapet where 194 cases were detected. Madikeri reported 127 cases. Kodagu DHO Mohan told The Hindu that this was the highest-ever single-day spike Kodagu had witnessed since the outbreak of the pandemic. “We had foreseen cases would cross 500 after May but the cases peaked now itself. People have to follow rules and go for vaccination otherwise it will be difficult to manage the situation,” he said. A total of 600 beds had been added to the treatment of patients by opening three COVID-19 care centres in the district. “The number of oxygenated beds will soon go up in Somawarapet and also Virajpet as the work is under way,” he said.

25 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||First time after spike, more discharges than new cases||For the first time since the spike, the number of discharges was more than the number of new cases reported on Saturday, bringing little respite to those treating patients housed in various hospitals across the district. As against 536 new cases, 637 patients were discharged or recovered on Saturday. Four succumbed to the infection on Saturday, taking the number of dead to 1,144. The number of active cases dropped from 5,027 to 4,922 for the first time after nearly a two-week gap when cases started to surge. The number of discharges is inching closer to 60,000 with 59,926 recoveries so far. As many as 74 persons died due to COVID-19 related complications in the past 16 days.  Meanwhile, sources here said there was no shortage of medical oxygen in Mysuru as of now with the hospitals managing the situation with the availability. Ravi P., Nodal Officer told The Hindu that Mysuru city required 13.5 kl (13,500 litres) of medical oxygen and the supplies were around 15.5 kl (15,500 litres) which is more than required. Around 10.3 kl (10,300 litres) of medical oxygen was currently being used by patients. “About five local companies were making oxygen supplies available to hospitals here with the bulk supplies coming from Bengaluru. However, hospitals equipped with large liquid oxygen tanks like at K.R. Hospital, and District Hospital, avail refills from bulk suppliers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/first-time-after-spike-more-discharges-than-new-cases/article34405193.ece

But the bridegroom-to-be came down with COVID-19 just before the wedding day and was admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Alappuzha. However, the couple will not let the virus come in the way of their plans. Sarath Mon, 28, of Kainakary in Alappuzha, will marry his fiancee Abhirami, 20, from the hospital bed between 12 p.m. and 12.20 p.m. on Sunday. She is from Thekkanaryad here. N. Sasidharan, Sarath’s father, said the couple’s wedding had been in the making for two years. “It dragged on as Sarath was employed in Qatar. He returned recently and both the families finalised April 25 as the wedding date. But Sarath and his mother contracted COVID-19 and have been admitted to the MCH since April 21. As there are no auspicious dates for the marriage any time soon, the families agreed to go ahead with the marriage. We contacted authorities and they have given permission to conduct the marriage in the hospital in accordance with COVID-19 protocol,” he said. The wedding would be held in a room in the hospital. Ms. Abhirami, accompanied by a relative, would reach the MCH just before the ‘muhurtham.’ The couple would tie the knot wearing PPE kits. Other than Sarath’s mother, the relative accompanying Abhirami, and a few hospital staff, no one would be allowed in the room. ‘Least possible time’ MCH superintendent R.V.

Of the total 90 shutters of the bund, 31 will be opened on April 27. “A decision on opening the rest of the shutters on the Alappuzha side will be taken after examining the water level at Kanakkassery bund in Kuttanad. Shutters on the Kottayam side will be opened after May 10,” said an official. Salinity threat The opening of the shutters will allow the entry of salt water into Kuttanad. If salinity poses a threat to agriculture in the region, the shutters will be regulated as per the directive of the District Collector, the official added. Earlier, the delay in the opening of the shutters caused by a late harvest of paddy had invited the wrath of fishermen and environmentalists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thanneermukkom-bund-shutters-to-be-opened/article34405167.ece
25 April 2021||Bengaluru,KERALA||Opposition to power project builds up||A power project in the neighbouring State of Goa has been ruffling feathers in Karnataka with environmentalists and conservationists raising alarm over its impact on the State’s ecology and wildlife. The Goa-Tamnar Transmission Line, which is aimed at bringing more power to Goa, seeks diversion of forest land in Dharwad, Belagavi, and Uttara Kannada in Karnataka as well, a major part of it in the Western Ghats, they have alleged. They have urged the authorities here to reject the proposal. “Out of the 177.091 hectares of forest land for which diversion is sought, a majority of the alignment (i.e. around 101 hectares) falls in Belagavi division. The removal of native vegetation for a transmission line would result in fragmentation of forests, loss of natural habitat of wildlife, create imbalance in the function of watershed, accelerate human-wildlife conflict, cause disturbance to wildlife corridors and avifauna habitat, and result in decline in non-wood forest produce production, which will threaten the rights and livelihood of local communities,” Giridhar Kulkarni, a conservationist, has written in his petition to the authorities in Karnataka. Seeking the rejection of forest and wildlife clearance for the project, he has pointed out that the proposed project area is already fragmented and disturbed by major linear projects such as the NH-4A widening project and the Hosapete-Londa-Vasco railway doubling project. He told The Hindu that the project had already received wildlife clearance in Goa, but both forest and wildlife clearance was pending from Karnataka. “The High Court of Karnataka had suo motu initiated a PIL with respect to unnatural deaths of elephants and had given directions to State government to review all clearances given to projects in the elephant habitat and corridor and to review non-forest activities.” Opposition has also come in from Jayanagar MLA Sowmya Reddy, of the Congress, who, in a letter to the Chief Minister and the Forest Minister, among others, has urged the government to reject the proposal. She has pointed out that the project is seeing objections from several sections in Goa as well, and threatens prime environmental hotspots in Belagavi and Uttara Kannada, such as Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary and Kali Tiger Reserve. “Goa has other alternatives for power. This project needs to be rejected at the proposal stage,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/opposition-to-goa-tamnar-power-project-grows-in-karnataka/article34405090.ece
25 April 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Healthy storage in hydel dams||The State has a healthy storage level in its hydel dams to meet the power demand in the current season ending in May. As on Saturday, the storage is at 40% in 16 major dams. The new water year will begin on June 1 with the new rule curve level coming into effect. In the Idukki reservoir the storage is at 38%. The water level on Saturday was 2,340.24 ft and generation at the Moolamattom power house was 8.782 million units (mu). A Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) official said the average power generation in Idukki was 9 mu and it had fallen after peaking over 13 mu. The power generation had to be scaled up to meet the demand in the State. Now, the Idukki reservoir had storage to generate 834.200 mu. The power consumption in the State on Saturday was 79.99 mu. The storage in the hydel dams was sufficient to generate 1,663.917 mu. The storage level in the main hydel dams on Saturday was Idukki (38%), Pampa (52%), Sholayar (42%), Idamalayar (36%), Kundala (74%), Mattupetty (37%), Kuttiyady (45%), Thariyode (16%), Anayirankal (25%), Ponmudi (57%), Neriamangalam (66%), Peringalkuthu (29%), and Lower Periyar (72%). The power consumption in the State reached an all-time high of 88.417 mu on March 19. The summer rain had also played a role in reducing power consumption. It resulted in a fall of eight to 10 mu in power consumption per day. The average power generation at Moolamattom had fallen from 13 to 15 mu to six to nine mu with the arrival of summer rain, said the official. In safe position KSEB Chief Engineer (Dam Safety) Supriya S. said 40% of water storage was a healthy level to meet the power demand till June. The India Meteorological Department had predicted normal monsoon this year, which would help in enhancing water storage in the coming water year, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/healthy-storage-in-hydel-dams/article34405173.ece
25 April 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||ASI sites in Wayanad remain neglected||The Janardhana and Vishnu temples at Punchavayal, near Panamaram, in Wayanad remain neglected despite the Union government declaring the heritage sites as national monuments six years ago. The restoration works of those dilapidated sites remain on paper, blamed on the alleged negligence of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The ASI declared the Janardhana and Vishnu temples (Janardhanagudi and Vishnugudi), temples at a distance of nearly 700 metres, national monuments in 2015 and erected bill boards to the same near them, A. Rajan, a farmer near the site said. A section of the ‘gopuram’ of the Janardhana temple collapsed in rain seven years ago, destroying sculptures on the stonewalls, he said. “As the dilapidated huge stone structure with intricate carvings in the middle of the temple complex may collapse any time, a quick intervention of ASI to conserve it is imperative,” he said. Nearly 300 carvings on the huge stone pillars have survived the passage of time. They include a sculpture of a man catching fish, a war scene featuring tuskers, other such war scenes, a few erotic sculptures, a stone edict in old Kannada script, Jain deities, and sculptures of the Dashavathara . The intricate and elaborate carvings on the pillars are in a dilapidated state due to long years of neglect. The style of the sculptures and a stone edict on a wall of the Janardhana temple in old Kannada script indicate these temples may have been built during the reign of the Hoysala or Vijayanagara dynasties in the Deccan plateau from the 12th to 14th centuries. When contacted, sources in the ASI, Thrissur circle, said documentation works of the structures had been completed and conservation works would be taken up soon. The delay was owing to the outbreak of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/asi-sites-in-wayanad-remain-neglected/article34405178.ece

25 April 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Mangrove deforestation continues unabated in Kannur||Deforestation of mangroves is continuing unabated in Kannur district. Kannur is blessed with large tracts of mangrove forests spread over government and private lands. However, large-scale felling of mangroves was recently noticed in private lands at Pattuvam, Ezhome, Cherukkunu, and Kandakali in Payyanur. The land is now being used for Kaipad and shrimp farming. All mangrove regions come under the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) and are legally protected by the CRZ Act, said N. Ramith, a Wildlife Trust of India member who is in charge of the Kannur Kandal project, which creates awareness about the need for protecting mangroves. However, there has been massive destruction of mangroves for Kaipad paddy cultivation and shrimp farming in the district, he said. Mr. Ramith observed that while violations were reported in CRZ zones, the almost continuous destruction of mangroves largely goes unreported to the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA). “The subsidised scheme implemented by the government for promoting shrimp farming and Kaipad paddy is a threat to mangroves,” he said. While shrimp farming is done in around 4 sq.km in Kannur, the subsidised scheme of the government is further encouraging people to destroy mangroves, Mr. Ramith said, adding that it would have serious ramifications for biodiversity and livelihood of people. V. Retheeshan, Forest Range Officer, Taliparamba, said the department had last year filed over 20 cases against those who allegedly axed grown mangroves. This year, three cases were filed under the Kerala Promotion of Tree Growth in Non-Forest Areas Act. District Environment Committee member Vinod Payyada alleged that clearing of mangroves was taking place with the knowledge of the authorities. However, the government is allowing destruction of mangroves under the Oru Nellum Oru Meenum project, which aims at rotation of fish culture and paddy culture. Though the scheme aims at ensuring additional income for Kaipad farmers, there are those with coveted interests, he alleged. Meanwhile, T. Vanaja, director, Kaipad Area Development Society, who is involved in promoting Kaipad paddy cultivation, argued that cultivation was stopped by farmers in private lands for various reasons, including high cost of production and shortage of labourers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mangrove-deforestation-continues-unabated-in-kannur/article34405121.ece
25 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||All beds occupied, say private hospitals||Several private hospitals in the district are reporting that the beds they have allocated for COVID-19 patients are all occupied, including beds with oxygen supply, ICUs and ventilators. While Aster Medcity would not specify the number of beds set aside for COVID-19 patients, a hospital spokesperson said that all beds allocated for COVID treatment were full, including ICU facilities. The hospital had set aside more than the required 20% of its total number of beds, added the spokesperson. A spokesperson for Lakeshore Hospital also confirmed that all beds for COVID patients were occupied. Around 23 COVID patients are admitted at the facility, with nine ICU beds that are all occupied. The number of ICU beds were ramped up from three to six over the past week since the number of critically ill patients arriving at the hospital was on the rise, the spokesperson said. Dr. T.V. Ravi, medical director at Ernakulam Medical Centre, president of the IMA Cochin chapter, said that private hospitals were running short of beds, particularly ICU beds and ventilators. “We are getting calls every other hour for ICU beds. Ventilators are all occupied. Even younger people are going into respiratory distress and they worsen quickly,” he said. Acute staff shortage, particularly of nurses, was another issue at private hospitals, he added. “Non-COVID patients are not too many now. At EMC, all 30 rooms set aside for COVID patients are full, besides five ICUs,” he said. Of the 39 beds and 10 ICU beds set aside for COVID patients at Rajagiri Hospital, all are occupied, it is learnt. A total of 160 ICU beds set aside at private hospitals for COVID patients in the district were all occupied, said Dr. Junaid Rahman, medical director at Sree Sudheendra Medical Mission and a member of the district programme management and supporting unit. Around 250 beds with oxygen supply were set aside for COVID patients at private hospitals, he added. One private hospital mentioned above said they were considering setting up a first-line treatment centre to handle the patient load. Patients turned away Two COVID patients who arrived at one private hospital in ambulances had to be turned away, and there were requests for ventilator support for patients, though all ventilators are full. Another private hospital also had to turn away some COVID patients who had sought care and had to divert them to other facilities, spokespersons at those facilities said. As many as 225 people out of the district’s active caseload are admitted in ICUs as per figures from the District Surveillance Unit. Government sector Going by a release from the district administration, a total of 1,146 out of 2,084 beds are available at government facilities. A majority of these vacant beds (851) are at domiciliary care centres. A total of 90 out of 417 beds at second-line treatment centres are occupied. SLTCs are equipped with oxygen beds. At COVID treatment centres at nine government hospitals, 205 beds are available. The District Information Office said the number of vacant ICU beds in the district was a statistic that was not available. District Medical Officer N.K. Kuttappan said that the number of vacant ICU beds in the district would be available only on Sunday evening after the day’s discharge was complete. He added that COVID patients were being offered care at private hospitals, and that they would comply with the directions issued to set aside 20% of their beds. A meeting with the managements of private hospitals will be held on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/all-beds-occupied-say-private-hospitals/article34405566.ece

That many personnel are off duty, having tested positive for COVID, made the task all the more difficult. A total of 54 personnel in Ernakulam Rural recently tested positive. Action was taken against those violating curbs announced by State government. Commuters who could provide proof that they were travelling due to unavoidable reasons were permitted to continue their journey. The Ernakulam Rural Police registered 110 cases and arrested 30 persons. Action was initiated against 3,200 persons for not wearing masks and against 3,350 for not maintaining physical distancing. Another 3,867 persons were issued notice to pay fine for violating pandemic restrictions. The Ernakulam Rural SP, K. Karthik, led the rule enforcement in Aluva town. High TPR Ernakulam is among the districts having a high test positivity rate. Organisers of functions where many people would gather should register them on the COVID Jagrtha portal, failing which strict action would be taken, he said. The Kochi City Police have, in the meantime, deployed 1,500 personnel to enforce the restrictions. A total of 50 two-wheelers and 49 jeeps have been placed at their disposal, while 81 pickets have been set up at different locations to intercept violators. Fine was imposed on 1,500 till 4 p.m. on Saturday for not maintaining social distancing failing to wear masks and for not ensuring COVID protocol at shops. A total of 122 cases were registered in connection with the violations. Surveillance has been stepped up in railway stations, bus stands, malls, hyper markets, and places of worship.

25 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Weekend restrictions affect businesses across sectors||The semi-lockdown to contain the second wave of the spread of COVID-19 has severely affected businesses across the spectrum. The business community has been reeling under a severe fall in sales, says Nazeer Babu of Aluva Merchants’ Association. He said on Saturday that vegetable, provision and other sales had been severely curbed over the past fortnight because of the spread of the pandemic. “People are afraid of coming out, and market places are consciously avoided by customers. This directly affects the volume of sales,” he said. Sales down Even ahead of the pandemic warning before the elections, the sales had been down because of fears expressed in different fora about the pandemic, he said. M. H. Majeed of Cochin Fisheries Harbour in Thoppumpady, said that the number of boats calling at the fish landing centre had been reduced by about 60%, largely because of the fear of the pandemic spread. The spread of COVID-19 in other States such as Tamil Nadu had also reduced the number of fishers arriving at the port for various works. N. H. Shameed, vegetable wholesaler, said that the Ernakulam main market had already been affected by the spread of the pandemic. The number of lorries arriving at the main market had dwindled also because of the pandemic situation in major supply centres in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. The Ernakulam main market is virtually deserted on Saturday, he pointed out, emphasising the loss of business because of the pandemic spread. ‘Curbs needed’ He said that with Saturdays and Sundays under virtual lockdown in other States, supplies would dwindle considerably and that fresh vegetables would be short because of the restrictions. But he said that there appeared no way to contain the pandemic and restrictions had to be imposed to restore normality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/weekend-restrictions-affect-businesses-across-sectors/article34405573.ece
25 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||In two weeks, district to have 2,000 beds with oxygen supply||The Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kalamassery, will turn entirely into a COVID-19 treatment centre in two days, while the district administration will also set up more beds with oxygen supply soon. The district currently has around 1,000 beds with oxygen supply, according to the District Information Office. The administration aims to have a total of 1,500 beds with oxygen supply ready in the district over the next one week. This number will be increased to 2,000 over the following week. OP consultations Beds with oxygen supply will be made available in every taluk, and cooperative hospitals will also be used for COVID treatment. If necessary, ESI hospitals will also be made available for COVID patients. Afternoon outpatient consultations at government hospitals will be suspended, and additional staff appointments, including that of nurses, will be made, according to a communication from the district administration. The decisions were taken at a meeting of the District Disaster Management Authority attended by Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar. Private hospitals are being directed to set aside 20% of their beds for COVID patients and officials of the district administration will hold a meeting with private hospital managements on Sunday. More tests Facilities will be ramped up on a war footing, anticipating that the number of cases is likely to go up over the next few days. The Health Department will collaborate with local bodies to increase swab collection for testing. The district administration’s decision to covert the MCH wholly into a COVID care centre comes in the wake of the increasing number of patients requiring intensive care and oxygen supply. At present, about 70 COVID patients are under treatment at the facility. The MCH was the single largest tertiary care centre exclusively for COVID patients for around a year, till recently when it was opened up to non-COVID patients to also facilitate medical training for house surgeons and students at the college. Patients who are under treatment for other ailments at the MCH will be shifted to the Ernakulam General Hospital and the government hospital at Aluva. The number of COVID patients in the district has been doubling in six days, according to the administration. Treatment facilities will be arranged for up to 40,000 patients at a time, the communication says. The active caseload in the district is currently at 32,167. Facilities While the MCH will have 300 beds for COVID patients, PVS Hospital has a capacity of 120 beds, the Aluva District Hospital has a capacity of 100, the Fort Kochi taluk hospital has 70, and the super-speciality block at the Ernakulam General Hospital will soon be a 100-bed facility. The CIAL COVID treatment facility has a maximum capacity of 150 beds, while the Thripunithura taluk hospital can admit 70 COVID patients, and the Muvattupuzha General Hospital can admit 40 patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/in-two-weeks-district-to-have-2000-beds-with-oxygen-supply/article34405564.ece
25 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Court to look into torture charge against Coast Guard||The Coast Guard has been asked to provide the details of its personnel who were on board the vessel that was involved in the arrest of six Sri Lankans in a recent drug haul off Vizhinjam. The Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram, issued the order on Friday to the Commandant of the Coast Guard to provide the list of the personnel on board the vessel after a Sri Lankan detenu complained that Coast Guard personnel forced him to lie on a hot iron plate. Drug haul case The alleged ill-treatment came to light when the accused in the drug haul case were produced before K. Biju Menon, Additional Sessions Judge 1, Thiruvananthapuram, on Friday. The judge, who noted the severe burns on the back of the detenu, had directed the Chief Judicial Magistrate to take cognizance of the incident. The judge had also ordered the injuries to be photographed and handed over to the magistrate. The Sri Lankan complained to the magistrate that a gas stove was lit and placed under the metal sheet which was used to cook chapatis in the vessel. After making him lie on the hot metal sheet, some personnel forced his body to the sheet with their shoe, he alleged. He also complained that the personnel beat him up with iron rods. The court recorded the statement of the detenu, who knew only Sinhalese, with the help of another Sri Lankan and a lawyer. His injuries too were recorded. The magistrate posted the matter for further enquiry under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to find out whether a case has to be registered against the alleged accused. The magistrate can also call for a police investigation. The inquiry will be held to find the veracity of the incident. The detenu, who has been provided legal aid by a lawyer of the District Legal Services Authority, can bring witnesses to the incident to the court to back up his case. After ordering the admission of the detenu in Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, the magistrate has also called for a medical report. The case has been posted for May 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/court-to-look-into-torture-charge-against-coast-guard/article34405182.ece

The closure report, which was filed by R. S. Dhankar, Deputy Superiendent of Police (CBI/SIC.II), New Delhi, on April 30, 1996, attains significance in the wake of the Supreme Court asking the CBI last week to look into the D.K. Jain committee report on the alleged framing of space scientists Nambi Narayanan and others by the former police officials in the espionage case. Besides debunking the espionage theory in its closure report filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, the CBI had also listed out the errors committed by three police officers, Siby Mathews, K. K. Joshua, and S. Vijayan, during the course of the investigation. The closure report attains significance in the wake of the Supreme Court asking the CBI last week to look into the D.K. Jain committee report on the alleged framing of space scientists Nambi Narayanan and others by the former police officers in the espionage case. The case The infamous ISRO espionage case has its genesis in a case registered at the Vanchiyoor police station in Thiruvananthapuram on November 13, 1994. Mr. Vijayan, who was the an inspector of the Special Branch, booked a case against Fauzia Hassan and Mariyam Rasheeda for violating the provisions of the Official Secrets Act.

25 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Metro records low footfall||The near-lockdown situation in Kerala had its reflection in the steep fall in passenger patronage in Kochi metro on Saturday. Frequency reduced The daily average patronage fell from approximately 30,000 till recently to 4,950 (the footfall till 7 p.m. on Saturday). Expecting a fall in patronage, KMRL reduced the frequency of trains, from one every seven minutes to one every 15 minutes. Similarly, the set temperature of the air conditioning system in trains was increased to 27 degree celsius, considering the prevailing pandemic situation. This was found sufficient since there were not many passengers on the day, official sources said. The KSRTC, and SWTD which operates ferries, too operated fewer services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/metro-records-low-footfall/article34405568.ece

25 April 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Kollam houses a steady supplier of medical oxygen||While other States are struggling to meet the unprecedented demand for medical oxygen, the Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited (KMML) has been consistently supplying the life-saving gas for the last six months. The public sector undertaking’s recently commissioned oxygen plant with a capacity of 70 tonnes per day produces six to seven tonnes of medical grade oxygen every day to be used in hospitals. Since its inauguration in October 2020, the KMML has supplied over 1,100 tonnes of liquid oxygen to various agencies at the instruction of Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO). “Since it is an essential healthcare commodity, we added a provision to produce 10% of medical oxygen when we designed the plant two years ago. But such demand was totally unanticipated,” says J. Chandrabose, managing director of the KMML. Why it was set up The Rs. 50-crore plant was commissioned to make the KMML self-reliant in production as it used to invest around Rs. 12 crore every year to buy oxygen from other manufacturers. While 90% of oxygen produced by the plant that purifies, liquefies and separates air into industrial gases, goes to its Titanium dioxide Pigment (TP) unit, the rest is used to produce medical oxygen. At present the KMML is supplying medical oxygen to three licensed agencies in Thiruvalla, Kochi, and Kozhikode through which it reaches various hospitals across the State. In view of the current crisis, the KMML has slashed the price of its medical oxygen from a government-approved Rs. 11,750 a tonne to Rs. 10,000. “Reportedly, private companies in Kerala charge more than Rs. 30,000 when they sell medical oxygen to other States,” Mr. Chandrabose said. From April 1 The KMML decided to cut the price from April 1 as the country is reeling under the deadlier second wave of COVID-19. “There has been a sustained demand for medical oxygen since we opened the plant. In April there was this intense wave and we reduced the rates to support the system and the public,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kollam-houses-a-steady-supplier-of-medical-oxygen/article34405156.ece

The test positivity rate (TPR) remained high at 23.96%. While Kottayam municipality continued to report the highest number of cases, the pandemic is on a rapid surge in the rural areas as well. According to officials, the TPR for at least four local bodies stood well over 40% while it stood above 30% in nine other panchayats. The TPR in 33 local bodies, meanwhile, stood above 20%. With 1,744 patients, Kottayam municipality has the highest number of persons undergoing treatment for the pandemic while 14 other local bodies have more than 200 patients each. With a steady rise in the number of medium and high-risk cases, the case load management system in the district is now beginning to feel the stress. As per estimates, the bed occupancy ratio of patients in COVID-19 hospitals and Second line treatment centres, which offer ventilation support, are 51.6% and 71.4% respectively till Friday.

In private hospitals, as many as 272 out of the total 300 beds earmarked for COVID-19 patients were occupied by Friday. Meanwhile, the district administration has decided to open domiciliary care canters (DCC) in all 77 local bodies in Kottayam to admit asymptomatic patients. As to how far this will go in managing the situation, however, is yet to be known as majority of the fresh cases belong to the medium and high-risk categories. Clusters Adding to the concerns, large and institutional COVID -19 clusters are being developed in different locations. On Saturday, the District Collector M.

25 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Despite curbs, no let-up in IMFL smuggling||Attempts to smuggle in Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) into Kozhikode district are on the rise, even as the State government has imposed more restrictions on the public to stop the spread of COVID-19. Many are reportedly on a buying spree and illegal procurement of stock. Though Excise squads have intensified surprise inspections and vehicle checking, there has been no let-up in cases where carriers use private vehicles to smuggle in illegally procured stock. Meanwhile, black market prevails in rural pockets, with the police imposing more regulations near Beverages Corporation and Consumerfed outlets to control rush. The situation was no different during the first wave of the pandemic when hooch dens too had turned active. For many it was an opportunity to make quick buck. The situation was brought under control with a strong deployment of striking forces and plainclothesmen by the Excise Department. The biggest seizure of IMFL in Kozhikode during the second wave of the pandemic was on Friday when an Excise squad impounded a car with 486 bottles of IMFL. A 40-year old Kuruvattur resident also was arrested. Officials said the man attempted to smuggle in illegally procured liquor using the boot space of the car. His plan was to sell it off to local buyers at a higher rate. The surprise inspections on Thursday and Friday to trace hooch dens also had earned results. The squads seized 545 litres of arrack and 250 litres of wash from a village near Maniyoor. Incidentally, the arrested were two youths below 30 years old who reportedly wanted to cash in on local sales. Noticing the spike in the number of cases, range-level squads have already been asked to intensify surprise checks and night patrol. Apart from highway squads, there will be a separate wing to keep an eye on rural and coastal roads. Bike patrol squads are also likely to be re-deployed soon after reviewing the situation at a district-level meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/despite-curbs-no-let-up-in-imfl-smuggling/article34405117.ece

The directive came in the wake of a complaint filed by Bineesh Athooni from Kottur. In his complaint, Mr. Athooni had said that five persons had been killed in accidents at the curve owing to lack of visibility. The PWD had suggested that the commission direct the local body to construct side walls on the dangerous stretch. It also said that the curve could be eliminated with the renovation of Ulliyeri-Kuttiadi road under a project aided by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The Kottur panchayat secretary had informed the SHRC of the need to acquire land on both sides of the road to raise the side wall. At the same time, Mr. Athooni told the commission that land acquisition was not necessary to eliminate the danger.

Based on a complaint filed by Bineesh Athooni from Kottur, the SHRC had sought an explanation from the Industries Department. The Principal Secretary of the Department informed the commission that the application for the quarry was under the consideration of the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority even though the permission had been granted by the Single Window Clearance Board four months ago. The people of Kottur panchayat had formed an action committee to fight against the quarry named ‘Delta Rock Products’ three years ago. Mr. Athooni said the quarry management had procured 4.8 hectares from local people saying they were to use it for farming. Delta Rock Products had first approached the District Single Window Board for clearance for the quarry, which was denied on the grounds that there were loopholes in the application. Later, the company approached the State board, which demanded a certificate from the owner of the quarry that there was no human habitation within 200 metres of the quarry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shrc-to-review-plaint-against-quarry-project/article34405640.ece

25 April 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||‘Chettur a textbook for modern day social workers’||Chettur Sankaran Nair, the only Malayali to become the president of the Indian National Congress, was commemorated on his 87th death anniversary at his native village at Mankara near here on Saturday. Inaugurating the commemoration, Congress district vice president Sumesh Achuthan described him as a shining star of not only the Indian National Congress but Indian history as well. Chettur had resigned from Viceroy’s Executive Council in protest against the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919, and fought the case in England against Lieutenant Governor of Punjab Michael O’Dwyer and his martial law. “The national spirit displayed by many today is no match for the patriotism of Chettur Sankaran Nair, who stood for his stand like a rock,” said Mr. Achuthan. “He is a textbook for present-day politicians and social workers who switch sides and opinions for personal gains,” he added. The Samskarika Sahiti district committee organised the commemoration. Sahiti district chairman Boban Mattumantha presided. Mankara panchayat president M.N. Gokuldas, municipal councillor K. Bhavadas, Gireesh Nochulli, Subhash Parali, A.C. Sidharthan, N. Achuthankutty, Aswajit Mannur, P.C. Ravikumar, K.L. Chandrika and P.C. Mohanan spoke.

It asked the government to provide free vaccination for all people. SJP general secretary Pradeep Gopalakrishnan said here on Friday that the government should re-examine its vaccine policy as it was anti-people. He criticised the government for giving six crore vaccine units to foreign countries even when India was tottering in vaccine shortage. He said the Central government had opened a huge market for multinational pharmaceutical companies in India by providing an opportunity for marketing vaccine vials. He said that according to the government’s vaccine policy, private hospitals would have to buy vaccine directly from manufacturers from May 1. “As a result, the rate of vaccination in private hospitals will rise steeply,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sjp-protests-against-vaccine-policy/article34405705.ece

25 April 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Reaching out to migrant labourers||In view of the rising COVID-19 situation in the district, the authorities have begun collecting details of the inter-State migrant workers camping in Pathanamthitta. Officials said the details being collected included the native place, date of arrival and the vaccination status, among others. To address concerns over the pandemic among these migrants, awareness programmes will be conducted, besides providing them with updates on the vaccination centres in the district. A control room jointly operated by the district administration and the Labour Department, which will function round the clock, too has been opened for the migrant workers. Disinfection drive Meanwhile, the Pathanamthitta municipality on Sunday will carry out a disinfection drive in public places including the bus stations and the General Hospital here. In the district, 933 persons tested positive on Saturday. Of the new cases, 883 persons contracted the virus through local transmission while the sources of 23 persons are yet to be traced. With 66 cases, Ranni-Pazhavangadi reported the highest number of cases while the Pathanamthitta municipality followed with 57 cases. The district also reported two COVID-19 related deaths. While the total test positivity rate for the district stands at 8.48%, the average test positivity for the past one week rose to 15.67%. Official sources said the rising number of medium and high-risk cases taking a steady rise has put the case load management in the district under severe stress. They attributed the sudden sky-rocketing of cases primarily to violation of room isolation norms. “It has been noticed that the number of cases due to local transmission stands very high in the district and the violation of room isolation protocols is one of the primary reasons for this. Patients undergoing home treatment should strictly follow the guidelines,” said A.L. Sheeja, District Medical Officer, Pathanamthitta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/reaching-out-to-migrant-labourers/article34405161.ece
25 April 2021||S.R. Praveen,KERALA||Kerala’s turnaround into oxygen-surplus State||Till two years ago, Kerala used to depend on its neighbouring States for its regular supply of liquid oxygen for medical purposes. Its transformation into an oxygen surplus State began with the setting up of oxygen plants in the public and private sectors over the past two years and the steps taken by the Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organisation (PESO) over the past year to augment capacity and plug leakage. Production capacity At present, Kerala has a production capacity of 204 tonnes per day of liquid oxygen. Inox Air products, a private sector company set up at Palakkad in 2019, produces 147 tonnes a day. The public sector Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited (KMML) set up a plant in September 2020, producing 7 tonnes per day. The Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited plant produces 0.322 tonnes a day, while the Cochin Shipyard produces 5.45 tonnes a day. The 11 Air Separation Units (ASU) across the State produces 44 tonnes a day. Supply "Now, Kerala is using 79 tonnes daily, and supplying 74 tonnes to Tamil Nadu and 30 tonnes to Karnataka. As per the current situation, we are doing well. There is demand for more oxygen from the other States too. We certainly have the option to increase capacity, as plants are not currently running at 100%. The total oxygen requirements are expected to soar in the coming weeks. The Centre has now given Pressure Swing Adsorption systems for three Government Medical Colleges at Kottayam, Thrissur and Ernakulam. The systems are already installed and once this too starts working, we will be in a better position,” says R.Venugopal, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, PESO, Nodal officer ( Medical Oxygen Monitoring) , Kerala & Lakshadweep The KMML till last year could produce only industrial grade oxygen, with 99.95% purity. But with the setting of a 70-tonne-a-day day oxygen plant in October last year, out of which 10% is liquid oxygen for medical purposes of 99.99% purity, it is also contributing to the State's surplus. Mr.Venugopal says hospitals across the State should use more cylinders, supplied from the ASUs, rather than depend on liquid oxygen. The PESO has also written to the Kerala State Electricity Board to provide uninterrupted round-the-clock supply to the ASU plants to ensure constant production.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/keralas-turnaround-into-oxygen-surplus-state/article34405192.ece
25 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||MCH directed to free up 1,400 beds by April 30||With the district reporting more than 2,000 COVID-19 cases daily, the district administration has directed the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thiruvananthapuram, to urgently free up beds for critically ill COVID-19 patients. In an April 23 order, District Collector Navjot Khosa directed the Superintendent, MCH, to immediately free up non-COVID beds occupied by patients who do not require emergency care so that 700 beds are available by Sunday and 1,400 beds by April 30. Scale down The MCH has been asked to scale down all non-emergency surgeries and procedures and postpone elective surgeries in non life-threatening cases. Underscoring the need for sufficient ICUs and ventilators, the district administration has asked the hospital to immediately ensure a minimum of 250 ICU beds and 100 ventilators for COVID-19 management. COVID-19 patients who are in a stable condition and not requiring critical care will be referred to COVID-19 first and second line treatment centres (FLTC/SLTCs) subject to the clinical decision of the doctor/institutional medical board. Non-COVID-19 patients who are stable will be referred to government hospitals and private hospitals empanelled under the Kerala Arogya Suraksha Padhati (KASP). The District Medical Officer has been directed to instruct peripheral institutions and nodal officers of FLTCs/SLTCs to refer only critical patients to MCH. In the order, the District Collector noted that the active cases can go up to 25,000-30,000 within a week as per the current projections. It now stands at 10,825. The test positivity rate had shot up from 5% to 15.4% in 14 days. ''When the above scenario takes place, we will have to admit approximately 4,000 patients in COVID hospitals. Approximately 1,500 will be Category C patients. More than 500 ICU beds and 150-200 ventilators will be required. As of now, only 442 beds including 110 ICU beds and 65 ventilators have been made available by MCH, Thiruvananthapuram,” the order noted. KGMCTA plea The Kerala Government Medical College Teachers' Association (KGMCTA), Thiruvananthapuram unit, has urged the government to ensure that only critically ill COVID-19 patients are admitted for treatment in the MCH. The KGMCTA in a set of recommendations submitted to the Chief Minister and the Health Minister has urged the government to equip the MCH with additional oxygen supplies and ventilators. Minor diseases should be treated online or through smaller hospitals. Medical college doctors who are needed for tertiary-level care should not be deployed in secondary and primary care centres, the KGMCTA said. The KGMCTA has also urged the government to open a COVID war room at the MCH.  Active cases can go up to 25,000 to 30,000 within a week as per the current projections||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mch-directed-to-free-up-1400-beds-by-april-30/article34405696.ece
25 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Caseload may choke system||The steady and steep rise of new COVID cases in the State is increasingly pointing to a situation wherein there is a high likelihood that the cases may exceed health system’s surge capacity in another two weeks. Authorities are well aware that even when the current surge capacity (public and private together) is quite high, a scramble for hospital beds and ICUs is a distinct possibility, given the pace of disease transmission. Even when the private sector has been asked to increase its capacity and set aside 25% of the beds exclusively for COVID-19 care, the current situation is such that hospital beds and ICU beds will have to be reserved for only those patients with serious disease. Preventing unnecessary hospital admissions is the first step in managing surge capacity, critical care experts say. They call for the government to ensure that the home-care manual for patients is improved, with better monitoring facilities in place, so that patients with mild/asymptomatic disease need not seek admission. Need for hospital care “Streamlining hospital admissions is important. There can be no on-request admissions. During the first wave, we allowed hospital admissions for people who did not have facilities at home or just because the patients felt more confident remaining in hospital care. We cannot afford to do that any more,” says A.V. Jayakrishnan, chairman of the IMA Hospital Board of India. Doctors point out that nearly 95% of the patients can be managed at home with oral medicines, fluids, rest and regular monitoring of oxygen saturation levels. Blame it on panic However, it is panic that drives many to seek admission in hospitals. COVID-19 patients with diabetes or those on cardiac medications are quite anxious about remaining home. “In a dire situation, we should be able to help patients remain calm at home. We can train volunteers on following up patients on home care. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) is in the process of drawing up a plan of action for home care of COVID patients,” P. Gopikumar, its State secretary, says. “Apart from checking oxygenation status, it is critical that the COVID-19 patient in home care knows exactly what to watch out for, what to do next, and most importantly, which hospital to go to. Ideally, he should be in constant touch with a doctor, at least online,” says Rajeev Jayadevan, a Kochi-based clinician The State will soon be taking a relook at its COVID discharge policy, wherein patients are discharged only after they test negative. The expert committee on COVID has been pointing out for a long time that this is unnecessary.  Doctors point out that nearly 95% of the patients can be managed at home with oral medicines, fluids, rest||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/caseload-may-choke-system/article34405578.ece

A majority of the public chose to stay indoors as the district administration had said that people should venture out only if absolutely necessary, in a bid to break the spread of the virus. Those who ventured out were required to provide convincing reasons or related documents at a couple of checkpoints set up in the city. KSRTC services Only 60% of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC)’s fleet of buses are being put into service for the weekend, while most of the private buses stayed off the roads. The occupancy levels in the buses were also low as most of the institutions remained closed. Long distance bus services, flights and trains are running as per schedule. Restaurants in the city did not have any occupancy as only takeaways are being allowed for the weekend. Tourist spots, parks, beaches and museums remained out of bounds for the public during the day. Most of the commercial establishments and shops, other than restaurants, remained closed through the day. Marriages and functions which were registered earlier on the COVID-19 jagratha portal were held as per schedule, but with strict restrictions on the number of participants. Despite the curbs, the higher secondary examinations and the training sessions for officials assigned for counting of votes on May 2 were held as scheduled. Movement of those heading to vaccination camps was also allowed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/roads-in-city-wear-deserted-look/article34405695.ece
25 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Good response to parenting clinics||The response to parenting clinics started by the Women and Child Development Department in 12 Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) blocks in the district has largely been good, with a range of issues coming to light. District Child Protection Officer S. Chithralekha said cases of behavioural and emotional problems, domestic violence, and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) were coming to the clinic for which counselling services and referral services were being provided. The clinics were launched in ICDS offices in all blocks and the city Corporation at the beginning of February to provide support to adults and adolescents living in unhappy family environments, besides helping with children’s personal and moral development and providing career guidance. A psychosocial counsellor helms the parenting clinics from 9.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. on all Saturdays, except second Saturday. Though the response in some blocks has been slow, overall it has been good, with school counsellors helping create awareness of parenting among the people through various programmes. Asha Raj, a counsellor in the Parassala ICDS, said while the services of school counsellors under the District Child Protection Unit were available in government schools, students in private schools that did not have a counsellor were also visiting the clinics. Kinds of cases Among the cases reaching the clinics were those pertaining to sexual abuse. In such cases, along with counselling referral services were provided to ensure their safety. In cases of parental discord that left children feeling isolated, both parents and children were provided support and counselling. Cases of screen addiction, learning disability, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also came to the clinics. More awareness of the parenting clinics had to be created among the public for enhanced reach, said Ms. Chithralekha. IEC (information, education, and communication) material on parenting such as brochures was being distributed from the clinics, she said. There were plans to get school counsellors to visit the community in case they got information through anganwadi teachers or workers about a number of issues in an area or if people in an area were unable to reach the clinic. The clinics, organised with UNICEF funds, are an extension of the webinars being organised by the department for encouraging responsible parenting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/good-response-to-parenting-clinics/article34405576.ece

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has become the latest to restrict travellers from India, after the U.S. advisory and U.K.’s 'red list'. Curbs by Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Canada and France have also come as a setback. Ramzan The decision of the UAE to suspend travel of passengers from India for a period of 10 days from April 24 has a debilitating effect on the State in view of the large population of NoRKs in Gulf countries. Hundreds have been waiting to join their families during the Ramzan and the summer months, which are vacation for educational institutions. Many families had shelved their plans to come home in view of the new quarantine norms and night curfew here. People have been barred from booking flights from the UAE to Indian destinations after April 24 on the Emirates, Etihad, flydubai and Air Arabia websites. Arrival of passengers from India through another country is also not allowed in the UAE unless travellers have stayed for 14 days in the transit country. Foreign airline sources said they would be operating inbound flight from the UAE to destinations in India as per the ‘Air Bubble’ pact, but outbound flights will not ferry passengers from the country. Cargo will be lifted in these departure flights Emirate’s flight on Saturday morning from Thiruvananthapuram international airport was the last outbound flight from here. U.K.'s 'red list' bans all travel from India and makes a 10-day hotel quarantine compulsory for U.K. residents returning home. The U.S. has advised its citizens to avoid travelling to India even if they are fully vaccinated. he Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has a four-level system for COVID-19, has placed India in "Level 4: very high level of COVID-19". Hundreds of NoRKs working in the U.S and U.K. and their families will also be hit by the restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/air-travel-ban-hits-non-resident-keralites-badly/article34405181.ece

Officials listed for counting duty testing positive for the virus or being identified as a primary contact have emerged a concern, as counting day is just a week away and the daily caseload persists above the 20,000 mark. In Thiruvananthapuram district, for instance, a Central government institution has approached the District Collector seeking the withdrawal of its staff who have tested positive or been prescribed quarantine from the poll-related assignment. Training on Election officials said adequate reserve staff, 10% or above wherever necessary, have been identified to deal with such an eventuality. The training sessions for the counting officials are in progress in the State. “We are keeping reserve counting staff so that even if somebody falls ill, we will have people on standby. The District Election Officers/District Collectors have been asked to identify reserve personnel in sufficient numbers,” a senior election official said. Fewer tables in a hall Given the COVID-19 scenario, the Election Commission of India had asked the States to reduce the number of tables in each counting hall from 14 to seven. Such an arrangement would require three to four halls for each Assembly segment, the official said. Kerala has witnessed a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases after the April 6 Assembly polls. From less than 3,000 cases in the beginning of April, the daily caseload in the State has jumped to over 20,000.

25 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Police scramble to enforce stay-at-home curbs||The State police scrambled on Saturday to enforce the State government's stay-at-home orders. The government had asked people to stay indoors on the weekend (April 24 and 25) and venture out only to buy emergency supplies from neighbourhood shops in view of the surging COVID-19 cases. Police officers said they found it challenging to staunch the flow of vehicles. Scores had turned outdoors armed with affidavits citing reasons for travel. Most said they required to stock up on provision and perishables. However, the police turned back many who had strayed kilometres away from their place of residence on the ‘pretext’ of shopping for essentials. An officer said the traffic had dwindled to a trickle by afternoon. Authorities cast a net of extra vigilance around epidemic hotspots. The police found it difficult to persuade people to follow the pandemic protocol in some localities. They stopped an equestrian race conducted at Thathamangalam, near Palakkad, on Saturday morning in blatant violation of the COVID-19 restrictions. Hundreds of people gathered to witness the biennial event, throwing caution to the winds. The police slapped cases on many people, including the organisers. The State wore an almost deserted look for the better part of the day. Hotels, bars, gymnasiums, State-run liquor outlets, shops, supermarkets, public parks, beaches, cinemas, malls and sports centres remained closed. A sprinkling of restaurants opened for home delivery and takeaways. The State was still reeling under the economic hardship wrought by the initial COVID-19 surge. Hence, many residents seemed to accept the 48-hour lockdown somewhat grudgingly. Mr. Vijayan would chair an all-party meeting via videoconference on April 26. The conference would deliberate on whether the State should press on with the weekend lockdown restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-scramble-to-enforce-stay-at-home-curbs/article34405187.ece

As many as 794 people have recovered from the illness. Three more deaths have been attributed to the disease, taking the district’s death toll to 947. The deceased included an 85-year-old woman and two men, aged 85 and 58. The district’s case fatality ratio currently stood at 0.74, the highest in the State by a distance. The total number of people being monitored in the district for COVID-19 related symptoms went up to 44,737 with 4,184 more being ordered to go into quarantine during the last 24 hours. A total of 1,261 people were permitted to conclude quarantine after completing the necessary period in self-isolation. New containment zones have been declared in Mannanthala, Kannammoola, Chempazhanthy and Fort in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation; Pallichaveedu in Andoorkkonam grama panchayat; and Plachivila and Chemmaram in Pallikkal grama panchayat. Moonamoodu area in Vazhottukonam ward, Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has been declared a micro-containment zone following a sharp surge in COVID-19 cases in the region.

He also said that the current price of Rs. 400 is also not a fair price. Addressing the media here on Saturday, he said that Kerala had reiterated its stand that Centre should supply vaccines free of cost to State governments, while fixing a fair price for the open market. He pointed out that Reuters had reported that the price of Rs. 600 (7.95 $) being charged by Serum Institute of India for open market, was quite a high rate at the international market and that nations like Bangladesh was directly purchasing the vaccine at 4 $ ( Rs. 300) and giving it free of cost to its citizens. He said that the vaccine supply position in the State continued to be grim and that even if registrations were being opened up for those above 18 years on May 1, the State will be able to vaccinate people only according to the availability of vaccines. The vaccination of senior citizens had not been completed and that has to be a priority, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccine-price-unfair-cm-writes-to-pm/article34405697.ece
25 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State seems discounting silent spread||People with no symptoms transmit more than half of all cases of the novel coronavirus (because they are mobile), according to a recent model developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The question of asymptomatic transmission post vaccination is now being explored by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). New trial Last month, Anthony Fauci, U.S. President’s chief medical adviser and director of the NIAID, announced a new trial, PreventCOVIDU, which will study if vaccines prevent disease transmission post vaccination. Dr. Fauci said the prevailing question is if individuals get infected and are asymptomatic, do they transmit it to their close contacts? Israeli findings The Nature Medicine reported in March that Israeli researchers had found that vaccinated people who contracted COVID had lower viral loads than people not vaccinated who got infected. However, while a lower viral load suggested less infectiousness, there is no current information on what constitutes an “infectious dose” of SARS-CoV-2 for people. Surprisingly, Kerala’s Health Department seems to totally discount the contribution of asymptomatic cases to disease transmission. The guidelines framed by the department for augmented testing on April 15 say that persons who recovered from COVID in the last three months and those who have received two doses of vaccine may be excluded from RT-PCR testing if they have no symptoms. “If we are totally excluding asymptomatic people from testing, how are we going to gather data on breakthrough infections? From a public health perspective, it is important to explore the impact of asymptomatic infections in fully vaccinated people on disease transmission. It might even give us more insights into the second wave,” a public health expert said. What is crucial now is how well the State is documenting and following up these cases of breakthrough infections and reinfections and if there has been any onward transmission from them amongst family or friends. Genome sequencing Most importantly, genome sequencing should be done in every one of these cases and any cases of onward transmission among family and friends to check if mutant variants are being disseminated. It is also essential that effective containment measures are initiated strictly right now to keep keep infection levels low so that there is less selection pressure on the virus to evolve into newer variants.  What is crucial now is how well the State follows up these cases of breakthrough infections and reinfections||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-seems-discounting-silent-spread/article34405190.ece
25 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Guidelines to panchayats to check COVID spread||The Director of Panchayats has issued guidelines to be followed by the panchayats in view of the spread of COVID-19 virus. The ward-level and panchayat-level committees formed after the outbreak of the pandemic have to be reconstituted. Action will be taken against panchayat secretaries who fail to do this. The ward-level committees should ensure that those who display COVID-19 symptoms and their family members are made to take the RT-PCR tests. Steps have to be taken to shift COVID-19 positive patients living in congested areas to the nearest COVID firstline treatment centre or COVID hospital. Awareness campaigns have to be organised using sectoral magistrates, police, health inspectors and ASHA workers. The committees should also ensure that proper testing is carried out among the migrant worker population. In case the virus spread is detected in labour camps, these have to be divided as clusters and strict monitoring carried out. The ward-level committees have to give priority in their awareness campaigns to elderly people, those undergoing palliative treatment, the differently abled, those living in coastal regions or slums, care home residents, employment guarantee scheme workers, Kudumbashree workers and migrant workers. The panchayats also have to take steps to strengthen their rapid response teams. In case there are large number of positives in a specific region, steps should be taken to declare containment and micro-containment zones with the cooperation of Police and Health Department officials. The COVID positivity rates from the primary health centres and community health centres have to be collected by the panchayat and uploaded in the COVID Jagratha portal. The panchayat secretaries have to ensure the accuracy of this data. Geo-mapping has to be conducted in areas of considerable virus spread with the help of health workers. Waste should be removed in a timely manner and following all protocols from quarantine centres and CFLTCs. The local bodies have to ensure that break the chain protocols are strictly followed in malls, cinema theatres, auditoriums and markets. The panchayats also have to ensure that only the allowed number of people are attending marriage and other functions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/guidelines-to-panchayats-to-check-covid-spread/article34405704.ece

25 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||VHSE students help in vaccine registration||Nearly 15,000 VHSE NSS Plus One volunteers across the State are helping their family, acquaintances, and neighbours register online for the COVID-19 vaccine. Snehasanjeevani, a programme launched a couple of days ago by the National Service Scheme (NSS) Vocational Higher Secondary Education (VHSE) wing under the General Education Department, is aimed at engaging students and empowering them by ensuring their social involvement. In the wake of online classes, most Plus One students have mobile phones and Net connections. So, helping people they know register online for COVID-19 vaccination helps orient them towards social commitment. Immediate circle “It is imperative that they do not remain aloof from what is happening around them. They should understand the importance of vaccination and communicate it first to people in their immediate circle such as relatives and neighbours and then later to other deserving groups. It will also help remove any vaccine hesitancy in society and help bring about change,” says Ranjith P., programme coordinator, VHSE NSS. A tele-help desk has been started as part of Snehasanjeevani on the lines of the helpdesks started for Plus One admission last year to facilitate vaccine registration without face-to-face interaction. Though there is no common helpdesk in view of the COVID-19 protocols, school-level helpdesks could be started soon. Schools in individual regions are also launching posters with hotline numbers too for registration. Snehasanjeevani has been launched so that each student can register a few people who despite having mobile phones are not familiar with how to use the Internet or how to register for the vaccination. Moreover, they can help reduce crowding in facilities that provide such public services, thereby controlling COVID-19 spread. Under Snehasanjeevani, each student has been given targets for the free online vaccine registration. Four relatives can be registered using a student’s mobile phone. In the case of friends or neighbours, their phone can be used by a student to register them for the vaccination. Social commitments The 12th campaign launched by the VHSE NSS in connection with COVID-19, Snehasanjeevani helps students understand and discharge their social commitments by helping people and keeping them safe, says Mr. Ranjith.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vhse-students-help-in-vaccine-registration/article34405689.ece
25 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Vaccine drive to be suspended today||The COVID-19 vaccination drive which has been under way in the capital district for around two months will be suspended for a day on Sunday. While several vaccine-seekers claimed difficulty in reaching their vaccination centres on Saturday with the KSRTC limiting services to a considerable extent, the situation was likely to persist on Sunday. Moreover, the need for a well-earned break for health workers was also factored in. Besides public health institutions, private hospitals were also unlikely to administer the vaccine as bookings were not opened for Sunday on the Co-WIN portal, official sources said. While bookings have opened up from Monday to Wednesday, the authorities have provided 2,000 slots in five sessions for the vaccination programme at the Jimmy George indoor stadium, where the distribution had been capped to 600 in the last two days. The district could near its optimum vaccine delivery level of 15,000 as 14,822 people were administered doses across 74 centres in the district on Saturday. These included 14,393 people who received Covishield and 429 others who were administered Covaxin. As many as 9,757 beneficiaries were provided the second doses of the vaccine. The district vaccine store currently had over 35,000 out of the 65,000 doses that were brought two days ago. Queue management remained a problem at many vaccination centres with several people failing to adhere to their time slots. Notwithstanding the travel restrictions on Saturday, a large queue formed outside the Jimmy George indoor stadium from as early as 7 a.m. as people jostled each other for tokens that were distributed at the venue. This left several senior citizens complaining against the lack of a proper arrangement in streamlining crowds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccine-drive-to-be-suspended-today/article34405692.ece

A press note issued by the association here recently said employees and pensioners were denied the revised salary and other benefits because of the delay in issuing the pay slip. The press note said no action had been taken on the association’s representation to resolve the issue at the earliest. Retirement benefits It added that the delay in issuing pay slips would cause retiring employees to wait indefinitely for their retirement benefits. “It is a matter of regret that though the State government had implemented the pay revision in time, officials at the AG’s office are delaying the benefits,” the association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plea-to-issue-pay-slip-for-revised-salary/article34405171.ece

The government has also asked private hospitals to set aside a minimum of 25% beds exclusively for COVID care. Giving the details of the discussions he had with representatives of the private health sector on Saturday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the private sector had assured the government of full cooperation in tackling the crisis. Private hospitals would give a report on the occupancy situation in hospital beds, ICUs, and ventilators on a daily basis to District Medical Officers (DMOs). The data would be put in the public domain and updated daily on the e-jagratha portal. The government has asked the private health sector to help out public sector hospitals with doctors, paramedical staff, and those with expertise in COVID critical care as and when a request is put up. Ambulance services Also, the ambulance services run by the Indian Medical Association, 108 ambulance network, and those of private hospitals would work in tandem. He asked the private hospitals to go by uniform treatment rates. However, they maintained that uniform rates across hospitals was not possible, as the facilities were different. Also, COVID care costed differed from patient to patient. The government’s attempt is to provide free COVID care to maximum people through public hospitals and at fixed rates at private hospitals empanelled under the Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padhathi (KASP). Hospitals would be reimbursed as per the KASP rates. At present, only 130 private hospitals were empanelled under the KASP and the government was asking more hospitals to participate. He assured the private sector that hospitals would be reimbursed COVID care charges within 15 days of patient’s discharge. He also asked private hospitals not to neglect non-COVID care patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/set-aside-25-beds-for-covid-care-cm-tells-private-sector/article34405189.ece

In the absence of festivities, the ceremony, which used to be conducted by noon, was held in the morning around 9 a.m. at a simple function. Fireworks cancelled The pooram city was literally numbed by the accident. Following the incident, both the Devaswoms cancelled the festivities of Pakal Pooram on Saturday. The colourful display of fireworks after the Upacharam Chollipiriyal ritual too was cancelled. Both the deities reached atop an elephant with limited percussion for the ritual. Thiruvambadi Chandrasekharan carried the idol of Thiruvambadi Bhagavathy while Ernakulam Sivakumar carried the idol of Paramekkavu Bhagavathy. In the wake of COVID-19, Thrissur Pooram was conducted with limited celebrations without people.

There was noticeable drop in the number of private vehicles on national and State highways. Only shops selling essential commodities remained open. Police squads had been deployed in advance at various spots to inspect vehicles. As instructed, a majority of drivers carried self-declaration forms and documents proving the purpose of journey. Only those who complied with rules were allowed to proceed. “Along with me, there were many students who turned up for the Occupational English Test for health care professionals at Devagiri College on Saturday. No one faced any difficulty in reaching the examination centre,” said a nurse from Kannur. “There were policemen to check vehicles at various points. They all behaved well and allowed us to proceed after verifying hall tickets,” she added. Though there were no restrictions on bus services, many private buses stayed off the road. There was a huge drop in the number of commuters too. According to taxi operators associations, only one-third of autorickshaws and taxi cabs operated in the district. “In general, there was hardly any opposition from drivers or commuters when they were stopped to check the purpose of their journey. We felt that only those making unavoidable trips were spotted on the road,” said a senior civil police officer. Shop owners also remained alert by regulating customers. Physical distancing was strictly implemented at shops. There were also police patrol squads to check compliance of local traders with norms. “The checking squads were mostly on awareness mode, insisting that people should follow rules. They will enforce rules strictly on Sunday,” said a Circle Inspector who is part of the city patrol squad. He warned that those who venture out without convincing reasons would be booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/people-fall-in-line-with-weekend-curbs-in-kozhikode/article34405125.ece

Hence, it is incumbent on citizens to stymie a sudden eruption of new cases, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Saturday. If coronavirus infections surged beyond the safety threshold, the outbreak would overrun the State’s health-care resources. Caution and not alarm was the need of the hour. “Wear masks, maintain physical distance, avoid closed spaces, do not congregate, and postpone non-essential events”, he said. The police would prosecute those who disseminate alarmist messages. Mr. Vijayan hinted that the State was in the long haul for an extended period of restrictions on civic life. He did not set any time frame. But, he urged the people to hold off unessential events “for at least a month”. Restrictions at weddings The Chief Minister said the government would further restrict the number of attendees at weddings. Currently, 75 persons could participate. The administration had also banned communal feasting. Mr. Vijayan said people arriving in the State should quarantine themselves mandatorily. A mutated version seemed responsible for the aggressive second wave of infections. Local bodies should step up the ‘Break the Chain’ campaign in rural localities. The weekend lockdown did not affect higher secondary examinations and training for election officials. The police on Friday booked 22,703 persons for violating the mask mandate. When pressed about Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala’s suggestion to airlift oxygen from Kerala to New Delhi, Mr. Vijayan said, “Kerala could not presume that it had the resources to solve the issues of other States. However, it is willing to spare other States essentials if the State registered a surplus”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-is-sitting-atop-a-volcano-chief-minister/article34405188.ece

The State government should convert a portion of the Kerala House precincts to an “open medical” facility, he added. The national capital reels under a critical shortage of life-saving supplemental oxygen. It is home to more than 10 lakh Keralites. Mr. Chennithala slammed the Centre for not stocking medical supplies and failing to build treatment infrastructure. The onus was on the Centre to supply vaccines free to States. The Centre had done the pandemic-ravaged country a disservice by allowing manufacturers to set the price of the vaccine. States now had to pay Rs. 400 for a dose and compete with private players for supply. Election result The government should limit election result day revelry to prevent more flare-ups. The United Democratic Front was against an extended and total lockdown. Instead, the government should allow regular activity in some measure in areas outside demarcated containment zones, he said. District authorities should create a shared pool of critical medical care equipment and apportion it as required. The government should redefine the hospital admission protocol. The administration should monitor the availability of supplemental oxygen, beds, ventilators, steroids and anti-viral medication daily.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/airlift-surplus-oxygen-to-delhi-chennithala/article34405185.ece

Having a B.Tech or M.Tech degree is not enough. Follow the mantra of imbibing independent thinking,” the Minister said while delivering the convocation address. He also recalled the ‘Big Day’ at the convocation when he received his degree from the same university in 2010. Uniform curriculum The government focussed on five aspects of education – Uniformity, Quality, Accountability, Affordability, and Accessibility. “As part of it, a uniform curriculum has been designed for all the courses. To ensure that no poor student is left out of higher education, the government has come up with Jagananna Vidya Deevena under which the entire fee is reimbursed,” Mr. Suresh said. “The enrolment in higher education is lower than the national average of 26.2%, and this needs to be improved,” he opined. For improving education quality, five universities had been identified to encourage research, and JUNTU-A was one among them, he said. University Vice-Chancellor G.

25 April 2021||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vaccination blues: wrong entries inconvenience people in Vizag||Observe COVID-19 protocols and avoid crowding around the registration desk and confusing the doctors and data entry operators, when going for the jab. Be patient and ensure that your personal details and the vaccine, to be administered, are filled in correctly. A good number of people are getting wrong messages giving them the shock of their lives. This is because the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been advising the people to ensure that the first and second doses of the vaccine should be of the same manufacturer. There are quite a few instances of people getting wrong messages on the brand of vaccine taken, name and gender. These could be due to negligence of the data entry operators, irresponsible persons, who divert the attention of the person, keying in the details, by picking up arguments with him/her and crowding around the desk. Whatever be the reason, the ultimate victim would be the person who took the jab. Sankar Rao, a senior citizen of Seethammadhara, and nine other members of his group, took the first dose at a private hospital near Hanumanthawaka about a month ago. They were given the Covishield vaccine but were worried when they later got a message on their mobiles that they had taken Covaxin. As the deadline approached for the second dose, they became jittery and rushed to the private hospital. Thankfully, the hospital staff acknowledged their mistake and issued a correction letter, after checking the register. What if those who took the vaccine, were not aware of what vaccine was given to them as the first dose and go by the message they receive? Some may take the second dose at a different centre and the message they get on the CoWin app is the only way to know what was given as the first dose. Battiprolu Baby (70), a woman from Marripalem area, was shocked when she got a message after the second dose that gave her name as Battiprolu Gopala Rao, female. Baby had lost her husband Gopala Rao sometime ago and she wanted to visit her children, who are living in the USA. “Vaccine certificate is mandatory to travel abroad and when there are discrepancies in the first and second dose, wrong name or gender, the Visa could be rejected,” Praja Arogya Vedika (PAV) general secretary T. Kameswara Rao told The Hindu on Saturday. Both District Medical and Health Officer P. Suryanarayana and District Immunisation Officer Jeevan Rani admitted that errors were occurring due to technical issues but said there was no cause for worry as hard copies were maintained and data would be cross-checked before giving the second dose to the patient.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vaccination-blues-wrong-entries-inconvenience-people-in-vizag/article34405666.ece

25 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Showing the way to execute a task that many dread||The outbreak of COVID-19 has thrown up many a challenge, one of which is giving a decent burial to the patients who succumb to the virus, a task that is usually unnoticed, unrecognised, and fraught with obstacles. But here is a gutsy public health officer, who not only overcame the initial fears associated with the task but also stirred the collective conscience of a few others in performing the last rites of 72 patients (and still counting) in the last one year. K. Chinnaiah, a sanitary inspector in the Chittoor Municipal Corporation, was nervous when he took up the first assignment of burying the unclaimed body of a COVID-19 patient during the first wave in 2020. Soon, the 36-year-old officer was successful in sloughing away the fear unleashed by the pandemic. After much brainwashing, counselling, and creating awareness on dealing with the bodies, Mr. Chinnaiah succeeded in forming a dedicated team of municipal workers to give the dead a decent burial. People were panic-struck during the first wave. Digging a grave in government lands used to attract the ire of the villagers residing nearby. They would often not relent until the intervention of the police and revenue officials, he said. With the number of deaths increasing at the district headquarters hospital here, Mr. Chinnaiah brought the complexity involved in arranging the burials to the notice of Municipal Commissioner P. Vishwanath. Soon, a one-acre forest land at the foot of a hill on the outskirts of Chittoor was earmarked for the purpose. “Our workers were anxious initially, but a sense of duty helped them overcome it. The workers do everything – from packing the bodies to transportation to digging the graves, and burying them. And they execute the task in strict adherence to the norms such as ensuring the correct depth of pits and sprinkling of disinfectants. They are also educating people to shun fears about COVID deaths,” Mr. Chinnaiah said. “Compared to the first wave, the casualties are more during the second wave,” he observed. Fear persists However, despite a year-long campaign, the response from the people has not been very encouraging. “Only a few could be convinced that the virus will not be active in a body after a certain time. Only a couple of families are coming forward to accept the bodies of their relatives,” he said. “In accordance with the Commissioner’s instructions, ‘one body one pit’ norm is being strictly ensured as a mark of honour to the departed souls,” Mr. Chinnaiah said. Awareness drive The sanitary inspector is also leading from the front in creating awareness among people on COVID-appropriate behaviour such as wearing face mask, maintaining physical distance, and using hand sanitiser. “Our mission is also to minimise deaths. Focus is also on home isolation cases and tracing their contacts. Most casualties occur due to neglect of co-morbid conditions during home isolation. We have formed a good number of paramedical teams to tackle such cases. It is alarming that many casualties are among people below the age of 40 wave,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/showing-the-way-to-execute-a-task-that-many-dread/article34405627.ece
25 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Overcrowded buses pose risk of virus spread||The rural services of the APSRTC with overcrowded buses has turned into a cause of concern at a time when the COVID-19 second wave is vigorous in Chittoor district. This is more felt on the routes under the Satyavedu depot in the eastern mandals. Post lockdown, APSRTC buses kept operating on the rural routes with limited services keeping in view the thin occupancy rate. But, since the second wave surge, the rural services are overcrowded. The passengers attribute this to low frequency of services. The pandemic has also forced people in the rural areas to reach home early, leading to overcrowding of some services and leaving the other services with less occupancy. Low frequency The low frequency of rural service between Satyavedu and Tirupati via Nagalapuram and Puttur has led to overcrowding in the morning and evening hours. “Though the passengers have the option to board another bus in a very short gap, they prefer to board the first bus they come across to reach their destinations early,” Depot Manager (Satyavedu) P. Gangadhar said. The official said conductors of the rural services had been strictly instructed to discourage standing passengers and footboard travel. “Whenever there is overcrowding, the conductors are asking the passengers to wait for the next bus,” he said. Except for a couple of services, several routes in the rural areas have been witnessing poor occupancy. This is attributed to holidays for students from Classes 1 to 9, and closure or partial functioning of some of the units in the industrial belt in the eastern mandals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/overcrowded-buses-pose-risk-of-virus-spread/article34404962.ece

25 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telangana to offer vaccine free to all||Karnataka was considering various options, including free vaccination for all, as inoculation against COVID-19 is being thrown open to all adults from May 1. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa discussed with Finance and Health officials the outlay required for free vaccination. Speaking to the media on Saturday, Home and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Health and Family Welfare Minister K. Sudhakar said the Cabinet would take a call on this on Monday. A few other State governments have proposed to provide free vaccination, including for those in the age group of 18-44 years, from May 1. At present, vaccination is free at government primary health centres and government hospitals for citizens above 45. Private hospitals charge a fee. Mr. Sudhakar said he would present a report at the Cabinet meeting on the arrangements made to administer vaccine from May 1. Other Ministers, too, are to present their views and the Chief Minister would take a final decision, he said. Mr. Bommai also expressed similar views The State, on Thursday, approved purchase of one crore doses of Covishield vaccine in the first phase at a cost of Rs. 400 crore. The Chief Minister urged all those aged above 18 to register for the vaccine from April 28. The Opposition has been demanding free vaccine for all. “It is not just the quantity needed for the 18 to 44 group from May 1, but also the backlog of people 45 and above. A large number have not received their first jab. Officials are also working out the data on how many people have received the first jab and are waiting for the second shot,” a source said. On the oxygen shortage, Mr. Bommai said steel, power and cement industries were asked to manufacture oxygen and divert it for medical purposes. State-owned power plants were expected to supply oxygen shortly. As Kerala prepared for a steep rise in cases and a scramble for hospital beds, health experts called for steps to prevent needless hospital admissions. Even when the private sector has been asked to increase their capacity and to set aside at least 25% of the beds exclusively for COVID-19 care, the current situation is such that hospital beds and ICU beds will have to be reserved for only those patients with serious disease. They asked the government to improve the home care manual for patients, with better monitoring facilities, for patients with mild/asymptomatic disease to avoid admission. “Streamlining hospital admissions is important as we may have a crisis on hand soon. There can be no on-request admissions. During the first wave, we allowed hospital admissions for people who did not have facilities at home or just because the patients felt more confident remaining under hospital care. We cannot afford to do that any more,” says A.V. Jayakrishnan, the chairman of IMA Hospital Board of India. Doctors said nearly 95% of patients could be managed at home with oral medicines, fluids, rest and regular monitoring of oxygen saturation levels.

25 April 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cybercrooks taking advantage of COVID crisis to cheat people||Taking advantage of the worsening COVID-19 situation, cybercrooks are defrauding people of their hard-earned money by promising them help with securing Remdesivir, hospital beds, oxygen and plasma. In a recent case, a person lost Rs. 40,000 to a cybercrook who asked for money to arrange an ICU bed at a private hospital and after taking the money in advance, switched off his phone. Many arrests have been made over black marketing of COVID-19 essentials, and yet no arrests have been made against cybercrooks in this regard as no complaints have been made so far. The Telangana police are asking citizens to come forward with their complaints so that arrests can be made and other unsuspecting victims can be spared from losing their money to the same crooks operating online. Police have urged people to lodge a complaint with them if anyone takes money, assuring to give a COVID resource like Remdesivir, but do not give it. In the past few days, several cyber tricksters floated numbers on the internet and various social media platforms assuring they will supply the antiviral in ‘black’ at a high price, took some money in advance and didn’t take calls or switch off their phones. “As of now, no such cases were brought to our notice,” Cyber Crime police of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda Commissionerates told The Hindu . In the last few weeks, Telangana police arrested over a dozen people in Hyderabad, Karimnagar and other districts, who were selling Remdesivir in the grey market. On Thursday, a man approached Jagadgirigutta police stating that he was duped of Rs. 40,000 by a cyber trickster who promised to provide a bed at a private hospital at Kukatpally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cybercrooks-cash-in-on-plight/article34405540.ece
25 April 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Two held for circulating fake news||Two persons, including an Intermediate student, were apprehended by the Hyderabad police on Saturday for allegedly circulating fake news about the health condition of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who recently tested positive, on social media. The accused were identified as Bhemanapalli Shekhar (36), a farmer from Munugodu mandal in Nalgonda, and a teenager (child in conflict with the law), the admin of Teenmaar Mallanna Yuvasena WhatsApp group. “By circulating the false news on social media, they created panic in the minds of the general public at this disastrous period,” police said. Two mobile phones, which were used for the commission of the offences, were seized by the police. The 16-year-old CCL is a native of Kottala village in Nalgonda. He was pursuing his Intermediate at Vanasthalipuram and staying at a BC hostel. The duo was apprehended by the Hyderabad Commissioner’s Task Force (north zone) team led by inspector K. Nageswar Rao. As per the police, the teenager created the ‘Teenmaar Mallanna Yuvasena’ WhatsApp group in March and started sharing different posts. On April 17, the juvenile received fake news on KCR’s health condition from Bhemanapalli Shekhar, and circulated the message in different groups, which went viral on social media. Soon after coming across the message, Hyderabad Cyber Crimes police registered a case and the Task Force sleuths apprehended the duo. They were handed over to Cyber Crimes police for further investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/two-held-for-circulating-fake-news/article34404933.ece

25 April 2021||Kochi,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jackfruit gets a brand name ‘Thalir’||The first ever jackfruit collection and processing centre, organised under the aegis of the Kerala government under the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK), has launched sale of jackfruit, ready to eat, under the brand name ‘Thalir.’ This is the first time that efforts are being made to sell the widely available fruit in a brand name, utilising its popularity as well as its great qualities as a food item. The branded jackfruit comes with traceability. Each of the farmers, who supply the fruit to the VFPCK centre near Thodupuzha, will provide details of the origin so that the buyers are able to get value for their money. The buyers will be able to give feedback on the quality of the fruit. The traceability aspect will add more attraction to the marketing of the fruit, which is now being procured at a price of Rs. 18 a kg. Earlier, the price was Rs. 20 a kg. But the fruit has become more widely available with the onset of the season. The jackfruit centre is based at Kalayanthani in Alakkode grama panchayat, near Thodupuzha, and the supply has been steady, said an official of the VFPCK on Saturday. The council had also been providing an extra Rs. 5 towards the labour involved in plucking and transporting the fruit to the common market, the official said. The emphasis is now on selling the most favoured variety ‘Varikka’ under the brand name as ripe fruit. Farmers have also been trained in processing the raw jack as value added food item. Each of the jackfruit being sold is now tagged so that the consumers can identify the origin of the fruit. The second wave of COVID-19 has been a big setback to the process of marketing jackfruit, which is now being sourced from Idukki district, where farmers have tied up with the VFPCK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jackfruit-gets-a-brand-name-thalir/article34404935.ece

25 April 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Gear up for challenging times, police personnel told||Prakasam Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal on Saturday called upon police personnel to gear up for the most challenging environment as the number of coronavirus cases went up exponentially across the district. With the second wave of COVID-19 wreaking havoc, Mr. Kaushal asked them to strictly follow ‘Dasa Sutralu’ (10 norms) while policing. It was the personnel at the grassroots level who bore the brunt of the viral disease earlier while enforcing the curbs to combat the disease. Hundreds of them had contracted the infection and some of them succumbed to it. At an awareness programme held here for police personnel and their family members in four batches, the SP said they, being frontline warriors, should in the first place fully follow the precautionary measures like wearing face masks, cleaning hands with sanitisers frequently and maintaining social distance. The SP asked the personnel to call the Police Covid Helpline number 9121104791 set up here for any coronavirus-related information. He said he was regularly monitoring the health conditions of the staff by looking into their test reports from the police officers concerned from time to time. The personnel who contract the infection should remain mentally strong and should not get carried away by rumours, he said and promised to arrange the best available treatment for them. GGH assistant professor Dr. L. John Richard took a volley of questions to remove misgivings among the personnel. Police clinic medical officer Dr. Bhanumathi explained to the personnel about the basic symptoms of the disease and the steps to be taken to keep the disease at bay. Ongole’s Om Shanthi group founder B.K. Madhavi said that there was no need to fear if one got infected. They should be spiritually-inclined and follow a healthy lifestyle. “Along with medicines, mental stamina is needed to win the battle against the viral disease,” she stressed. The SP handed over kits containing vitamin tablets, masks and sanitisers the police personnel, home guards and their family members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gear-up-for-challenging-times-police-personnel-told/article34405618.ece
25 April 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ongole GGH overflows with patients requiring oxygen therapy||Patients lying down on the verandah and their relatives restlessly running from pillar to post are the common sight at the Government General Hospital here, as COVID-19 cases increased exponentially this fortnight. The second wave of Coronvirus has pushed more and more COVID-19 patients, including children, gasping for breath following respiratory tract infection and lying on hospital pavements waiting for allotment of oxygen beds. Scores of them with low oxygen level had arranged their own oxygen cylinders and anxiously wait for allotment of beds at any given point of time at the hospital with a bed strength of 1,100 for COVID patients. Srinivasa Rao, a middle-aged patient from Martur, was in no mood to return home, and take treatment from there. “I fear that oxygen level may go down further if I go back home,” he said lying down on the verandah close to the help desk set up at the hospital.  Temporary supply Hundreds of patients wait for allotment of oxygen bed at the hospital at any given point of time with only 685 oxygen beds. All efforts by those manning the help desk asking the patients to go to private hospitals were in vain. The patients mostly from below poverty line hang around at the hospital reluctant to go to 10 notified private hospitals fearing that they might be overcharged. The GGH authorities have arranged oxygen cylinders on a temporary basis at the 300-plus general beds to meet the rush of patients, hospital sources said. Relatives of the patients who have been impatiently waiting at the reception centre urged the government to arrange piped oxygen supply at all the beds and creating oxygen bed facility on a temporary basis to treat at least 5,000 patients at the GGH as at least 500 patients contract the disease each day and they might require hospitalisation for at least a month or so. “During the first wave of Coronavirus, most of the patients were elderly and required treatment at the intensive care units. But now a majority of the patients suffer from shortness of breath and require oxygen support,” Prakasam District Medical and Health Officer P. Ratnavalli told The Hindu . Seven more private hospitals were renotified to enhance the available number of beds to 2,500 in the district on Saturday, she said. Ten COVID-19 Care Centres across the district were set up to treat 3,000 critical cases, she said, adding that there was no shortage in oxygen supply as such in the district. As many as 7,000 persons were vaccinated on Saturday in the district, including 4,000 who had already taken the first dose of vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ggh-overflows-with-patients-requiring-oxygen-therapy/article34404967.ece
25 April 2021||SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Second wave hits transport sector hard||The transport sector has been hit hard again with the second wave of COVID-19, which had already put the industry in deep crisis with the lockdown and drop in economic activity in 2020. The industry which was providing employment to thousands of people directly and indirectly had already been struggling in Andhra Pradesh with the steep hike in prices of diesel and toll fees. Transport charges reportedly remained at same level in spite of the additional burden of diesel and increased toll. For instance, a lorry owner charges nearly Rs. 18,000 to transport goods from Srikakulam to Vijayawada. The owner shardly makes a profit of Rs. 4,000 per trip after deduction of all the expenditure, including wages of driver and cleaner. But each owner hardly gets eight to 10 bookings per month and the amount generated would be spent again for payment of EMI, maintenance of vehicles and insurance and others. Andhra Pradesh Lorry Owners’ Association vice president M.Janakiram Reddy said many drivers and cleaners were scared to take up long trips owing to COVID fear, leading to loss of bookings. “Economic activity has come down significantly with the impact of second wave. Its cascading affecting is more on the transport sector,” he added. Srikakulam District Granite Lorry Owners’ Welfare Association president Venkata Satyanarayana and general secretary Allu Nagesh said that granite export to China and Europe was disrupted with the impact of the second wave. “Over six lakh tonnes of granite has been sent to Visakhapatnam and Kakinada ports. But its shipment to other countries has not been done. The granite exporters who could not get amount from importers are unable to clear transport bills. It has become a big shock for all granite lorry owners,” said Mr. Nagesh. “Diesel which was available at around Rs. 60 a litre five years ago is now priced at Rs. 90. It is a big jolt for the entire transport sector,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/second-wave-hits-transport-sector-hard/article34405662.ece

25 April 2021||Thrissur,ANDHRA PRADESH||2 killed as tree branch falls on people||An accident in the early hours of Saturday during Thrissur Pooram celebrations killed two persons and injured over 25 people, including police personnel and percussion artistes. A huge branch of a banyan tree near the Brahmaswom Madhom fell over people who had gathered for the night edition of the Madathil Varavu Panchavadyam of the Thiruvambadi Devaswom. The condition of two persons is said to be critical. The dead were identified as festival committee member of the Thiruvambadi Devaswom Rameshan Mannuthy, 56, and pooram exhibition committee member Paniyath Radhakrishnan, 65, of Punkunnam. They suffered head injuries. Among the injured were percussion artistes Kariyannur Narayanan Namboodiri, Kottakkal Ravi, and Varadarajan. The accident happened while the panchavadyam , led by Mela Pramani Kongad Madhu, was reaching its crescendo. Nobody heard the sound of the branch breaking. “It happened in a flash before we could think. Before people could escape, the branch fell over them,” said onlookers. Many, trapped under the tree, were not able to move. As the branch fell over a power line, supply was disrupted, delaying the rescue operations. The Fire and Rescue Services men were joined by locals in efforts to rescue those trapped under the branch. The injured were admitted to the General Hospital and the Government Medical College Hospital, Thrissur. Though the elephant that carried the idol of Thiruvambadi Bhagavathy ran amok in the melee, it was brought under control soon. Following the accident, the Paramekkavu and Thiruvambadi Devaswoms called off the pooram fireworks. But by that time, the fireworks had already been loaded and arranged at Thekkinkadu Maidan. As the removal of the loaded fireworks was risky, the explosives were destroyed by exploding them. The Collector ordered an inquiry into the circumstances that led to the accident. There was no wind or rain at the time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/2-killed-as-tree-branch-falls-over-people/article34404937.ece

25 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Public urged to strictly follow ‘night curfew’||Director-General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang has appealed to the public to follow ‘night curfew’ strictly from Saturday night, to prevent the spread the second wave of COVID-19. “During the first wave, about 14,391 policemen contracted the virus and 110 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in the police department. In the second wave, nine deaths and 1,396 positive cases have been reported among police personnel,” the DGP told The Hindu on Saturday. “I request the public not to come out until it is most urgent, as the second wave of the virus is fast spreading. Public should not gather at hotels, fast food centres, roadside eateries, bus terminals and other public places, and follow the instructions of the police,” Mr. Sawang said. COVID-19 has shattered many lives in the police department. Thousands of policemen, who were frontline workers, and their families suffered due to Coronavirus and many families lost their bread winners, he said. “So far, 15,787 police have been infected with the virus in the State. It is a challenge for the police, who will be on roads to implement the night curfew,” the DGP said. He asked the police to give priority to enlighten the public on the gravity of the situation, rather than enforcement. Police officers should create awareness on avoiding unnecessary movement, gathering at public places and on how to stay safe, he said. ‘Rotation system’ “All the police personnel in the State will be deployed for implementing night curfew. Duties will be given on rotation system. I appeal to all policemen to stay safe and take care of their families,” Mr. Sawang said. West Godavari district Superintendent of Police (SP) K. Narayan Naik said there would be no curbs on inter-State transportation during night curfew, and on-duty policemen at the border checkposts have been told not to interrupt the traffic on borders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/public-urged-to-strictly-follow-night-curfew/article34405724.ece
25 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Jagan trying to weaken the panchayat raj system in State’||APCC working president N. Thulasi Reddy on Saturday accused Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy of trying to debilitate the panchayat raj institutions. In a statement, he said after the Panchayat Raj Act (73rd Amendment) came into force on April 24 in 1993, the States were allowed to take steps to organise village panchayats and give them powers to function as units of self-government. “But G.O. 2 issued by the YSRCP government on March 25 this year violates the spirit of the Act and the 73rd Amendment,” Mr. Thulasi Reddy argued. ‘Grant powers to sarpanches’ He said, according to the G.O., the staff and volunteers of the village secretariats were not accountable to the sarpanches. He said the sarpanches had not been granted cheque power so far. Mr. Thulasi Reddy demanded withdrawal of the G.O. and grant powers to the sarpanches and the elected representatives at the village-level. He found fault with the Chief Minister “trying to create hype over the sunna vaddi (zero interest) loans to the women self-help groups.” Claiming that the Congress had introduced it during 2004 elections, he said the party had promised to implement ‘pavala vaddi’ scheme to empower women. It won the elections and the Congress governments headed by former Chief Ministers Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and K. Rosaiah had implemented the scheme from 2004-05 to 2010-11. To further improve the scheme, former Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy had changed it from ‘pavala vaddi’ to ‘sunna vaddi’ scheme, which was implemented as long as the party was in power. In 2016-17, he said, the TDP government, however, scrapped the programme, he alleged. “While the Congress government had granted Rs. 5 lakh to each self-help group, the YSRCP government reduced the amount to Rs. 3 lakh,” he said. The Congress leader said that spending huge money on publicity of such schemes was unwise, especially when the State was reeling under serious economic crisis, compounded by the pandemic impact. He said women should take note of the YSRCP government’s game plan.  It was the Congress government that first introduced the ‘pavala vaddi’ scheme, which was later changed into zero interest scheme N.

25 April 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TELANGANA||Mentally ill woman from UP reunited with family||A mentally ill woman from Uttar Pradesh was reunited with her family after several years in the temple town of Bhadrachalam on Friday. The elderly woman, who had gone missing from her home in UP’s Banda district around two decades ago due to suspected mental health disorder, was found wandering on the streets of Bhadrachalam by some local residents nearly one-and-a-half year ago. Alerted by them, the Khammam-based Annam Seva Foundation chairman and para-legal volunteer Annam Srinivasa Rao shifted her to the shelter home for destitute in Khammam in December 2019. The volunteers led by Mr. Rao with the help of local police traced the address of the woman and established contact with her son Dinesh, a labourer from Banda, after consistent efforts. Dinesh, who is now 30 years old, recognised his mother during their conversation over a video call arranged by the volunteers. He soon rushed to Khammam from UP and met his mother, who left their home when he was 10 years old. Dinesh broke down on seeing his mother and narrated the ordeal suffered by their family following the death of his father in 2013 and separation from his mother since childhood. The woman was reunited with her son in the presence of Bhadrachalam ASP Dr. G Vineeth in the temple town late on Friday afternoon. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Srinivas Rao said that he arranged the reunion of the elderly woman with her son in the temple town from where the woman was rescued in 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mentally-ill-woman-from-up-reunited-with-family/article34405685.ece
25 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Virus toll much higher than daily bulletins suggest||The number of daily COVID-19 deaths in the State are higher than the figures mentioned in the media bulletin issued by the Health department, according to an increasing number of doctors in government hospitals. The doctors, who have been making the claim for the past few weeks, opine that presenting the true picture of the pandemic’s extent will further alert people and prompt them to take precautions. Multiple sources said the number of daily deaths at Gandhi Hospital, which has been turned into an exclusive COVID care facility again this year, alone are higher than the total fatalities mentioned in the media bulletins. ‘Each death recorded’ “The deaths at Gandhi Hospital were 72 and 63 on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Details of every COVID patient’s death are meticulously recorded. Number of deaths during a particular duration of a day, photos of the bodies, a copy of their basic details issued by hospitals, the ward in which the patient died and other details are collected at all hospitals. Senior officials keep track of it,” sources in the hospital said. “If the deaths at other hospitals such as Government General Hospital in Nizamabad, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) and other hospitals are considered, the number will be many times more than what the media bulletins say. We all have real-time numbers. But we believe presenting the true picture will help people understand the gravity of the pandemic and push them to take precautions,” sources said. The doctors said there are some reasons for a high number of deaths at Gandhi Hospital. Some private hospitals have been sending COVID patients to the Gandhi when a patient’s chance of survival is bleak. “Despite our best efforts, the patients cannot be saved as they are sent to us in their end stage, and people blame us doctors for the deaths. That is unfair,” a doctor from the hospital said. Sources maintained that Gandhi Hospital and TIMS were overstretched with COVID patients and the toll was rising gradually because the highly critical cases were rushed to these two hospitals from private facilities. Death audit panel When concerns over the death toll were raised last year, senior officials in the State Health department said they have death audit committees which assess and conclude the reason of death of a COVID patient. Officials earlier said serious co-morbidities are the reason for a coronavirus patient’s death. In such cases, death is attributed to the co-morbidity or a reason other than COVID-19. Highly placed sources in the Health department also echoed similar concerns, but added that the death count in the bulletin was based on the audit committee’s report certifying it as a COVID fatality. “There are instances when the past medical history of a COVID deceased person is not available immediately. In such cases, the bodies are released to the family members but the death is added to the bulletin once the committee certifies the reason,” a key figure in the department maintained. The death rate in private hospitals, too, is alarming. Managements of several corporate hospitals admitted that their ICU beds were full and efforts to save the lives of several highly critical COVID patients with badly damaged lungs was becoming a Herculean task. On condition of anonymity, corporate hospitals put the daily coronavirus deaths at a minimum of 30. “We are reporting 10 deaths daily from our group of hospitals in the Twin Cities alone,” said a representative of a leading corporate hospital while another executive confirmed more deaths and pointed out that in the second wave of the pandemic, a majority of victims were young people. Last rites The scene at major crematoriums handling COVID last rites also makes one question the low number of deaths shown in media bulletins. Crematoriums witness the steady arrival of ambulances and other last journey vans throughout the day. On Saturday, a world-class crematorium in the western part of Hyderabad got busy quite early in the morning. By 11 a.m., eight ambulances had lined up with the mortal remains for last rites. Similarly, another crematorium in Amberpet, too, saw a series of funerals while the crematorium behind ESI Hospital continued to be the hub of last rites. Curiously, the media has been barred from entering any of these places. The managers of those crematoriums were tight-lipped about the number of funerals being held. On the other hand, the city police have stopped issuing no-objection certificates to the families of COVID-deceased persons maintaining that there was not much of a necessity for the certificate with rules relaxed. However, the government and private hospitals were diligently reporting each COVID death in their respective police station limits.  Deaths at Gandhi Hospital were 72 and 63 on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Details of every COVID patient’s death are meticulously recorded. A source at Gandhi Hospital   We are reporting 10 deaths daily from our group of hospitals in the Twin Cities alone. A majority of COVID victims are young people.

25 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Ventilator bed crisis deepens||Crisis situations in finding ventilator beds at government and private hospitals in Hyderabad are slowly deepening with each passing day. This is becoming more obvious as people are posting SOS calls on Twitter, calling friends and family members, and requesting information about hospitals where ventilator beds are available. 3 to 4 weeks’ time Heads of a few major corporate hospitals too, said that they were running out of this resource. Even if they can expand the ventilator bed facility, it would take at least three more weeks to get more ventilators. Ventilator beds in major government hospitals such as Gandhi and TIMS are full most of the time, and patients are always in the waiting list. In case of District Hospital, King Koti, the availability is changing regularly. Director of a pharma company Sai Charan Chikkulla is helping people find COVID beds. When he tried to find a ventilator bed for a family on Friday night, he had to call around 40 hospitals. “After finally finding a bed, it got occupied in no time. So, we tried at other hospitals,” Mr. Sai said. He said that even after being confirmed of a bed over phone from private hospitals, getting it is uncertain till the patient reaches the hospital. “In the 20-30 minutes or more it takes for a family to shift a patient to that hospital, another patient in need of ventilator bed might reach the hospital,” he said. When this reporter called on Friday night, some hospitals said that their ventilator beds were full. After verification, a few Good Samaritans started posting availability along with the time they verified it at. Professor and nodal officer at Government General and Chest Hospital Dr. M. Narender said that invasive ventilation is used as the last option of improving the oxygen saturation levels when lungs are severely damaged. Managing Director of KIMS Hospitals Dr. B. Bhaskar Rao said that they had 100 such beds but occupied. “We got 20 more ventilator beds, but those too, are full now. When patients approach us, we take down their details and call them when a bed becomes available,” he said. He too said that they evaluate a patient’s condition to decide whether a patient needs non-invasive ventilation. HCOO of Care Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Dr. Rahul Medakkar said that around 70 ventilators at their branch were put to use. “We are trying to procure more ventilators. The least time to receive good quality ventilators is not less than three to four weeks,” Dr. Rahul said. “We cannot move a ventilator just because it is not being used for sometime. A critical patient might need it any time. Besides, specialist doctors like anaesthetists, pulmonologists monitor the ventilators. If 1-2 machines are placed in other rooms,we cannot deploy the specialists for each room. It’s not practical,” a senior doctor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ventilator-bed-crisis-deepens/article34405538.ece

25 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Cyberabad police stop issuing NOCs to claim COVID bodies||Cyberabad police have stopped the practice of issuing no-objection certificate (NOC) for intercity or inter-State transport of bodies of COVID-deceased persons as it helps the bereaved family with less procedural formalities and prevents policemen from exposure to primary contacts. Earlier, a document of clearance was the norm but in view of rising COVID deaths, Cyberabad police feel no such NOC is required. “As family members are already going through a lot, we don’t want to harass them by asking them to get an NOC from the local police station to claim the body,” the officer said. “Moreover, people have also realised that the infection doesn’t spread through the infected body, but gatherings,” he said. However, Hyderabad police continued to issue the NOC at the police station level, while the top brass were unaware of the practice. “An undertaking is given by the family members that they would follow the COVID-19 protocols during the cremation or burial, only after which we issue the NOC. It is also to make sure that the body goes to the right family members,” an officer said on condition of anonymity. For instance, if a victim is from Adilabad or Karimnagar and died while undergoing treatment at any hospital in Hyderabad, the family members need to get the NOC from the police station, the officer said. “Each day, we are issuing more than 20 NOCs in the Commissionerate, despite the fact that there is no such order from the government. It is a very hectic and deadly practice,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-more-nocs-from-cyberabad-police-to-claim-covid-bodies/article34405535.ece
25 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Retired police officer pens memoir||Nenu Santa Kuda... Okka Jeevana Katha , the Telugu memoir of retired Superintendent of Police Chilukuri Rama Umamaheswara Sarma was launched here on Tuesday. In his book, Mr Sarma, who entered the force as SI in 1985, rose to the rank of Superintendent of Police and retired in May 2019, essayed his journey from a lower middle-class background to serving the State in various positions, including in naxal-affected North Telangana in the 1990s, when Maoist conflict was at its peak and in Anti-Corruption Bureau and at Tirumala. Mr. Sarma was widely seen in the news in September 2018 when as DCP Malkajgiri, he was seen on the same field as his daughter Sindhu Sarma, an IPS officer, both supervising the security arrangements for Pragathi Nivedana Sabha, a public meeting by Chief Minister K. Chandrasehkar Rao at Kongara Kalan. Speaking to The Hindu , he said the book charts the ‘undocumented’ ground reality of how police officers must endure exchange of fire in naxal-affected areas, and the tactical steps they must take to navigate the rural and forest lands in pursuit of Maoists. In his memoir, Mr. Sarma, an amateur farmer, wrote about role clarity of police officers in the changing scenarios, people-friendly policing, freedom of police officers, which is imaginative these days, and bringing up a successful family. The 362-page book was launched by Mr.Sarma's school headmaster Kuchibhotla Pardha Saradhi. Rachakonda Additional CP G. Sudheer Babu, Inspector M Sridhar Reddy, and several wirters and poets took part in the event. “It (the book) is a celebration of life and job, in which my wife, Santa, has been my major support all these years. To honour her place in my life, we launched the book on her birthday today,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/retired-police-officer-pens-memoir/article34405549.ece
25 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘24x7 production of oxygen, drugs and vaccines cleared’||Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy on Saturday said the Central and State governments are taking all necessary steps to provide sufficient oxygen supply to the hospitals, and vital drugs like Remdesivir with production cycles enhanced to ensure the plants work round the clock in three shifts. ‘Must fight together’ “This is not the time to point fingers at each other or resort to political partisanship. We have to fight together to control the pandemic and it is not true that the BJP-ruled States are getting more medical or oxygen supplies. A committee of officials here and in Delhi decide on the supplies quantity depending on the prevailing health situation. There is no discrimination,” he claimed He also informed that four oxygen plants for Telangana developed by DRDL will become operational from first week of May. “These include two units at Gandhi Hospital here and one each at Karimnagar and Warangal. Each unit will generate 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute, he said. The Minister was addressing the media after visiting the Gandhi Hospital and King Koti Hospital where he interacted with the patients and healthcare personnel. “The Indian Air Force services have been requisitioned for immediate airlift of the oxygen supply and drug enforcement authorities are cracking down on those hoarding drugs and other essential items across the country. I request the Telangana government to deal sternly with hoarders and conduct raids. The vaccine production is also being enhanced so that all the 136 crore people can be vaccinated quickly within the constraints,” he said. Mr. Kishan Reddy said multinational Pfizer has been allowed to import huge quantities to sell the vaccine in the country while the Russain Sputnik being brought out by Dr Reddy’s will be made available from May. Export of indigenously-made Covaxin and Covisheild have been stopped in view of the second wave. “Online registration process for those above 18 years of age will be opened soon and I urge every eligible person to register and await their chance for vaccination rather than crowd around the vaccination centres all at once,” he said. The Minister was candid in admitting that the country’s healthcare systems are totally “inadequate to handle the current COVID crisis due to the high population”. However, he has appealed to people to support the available government machinery and practise self-discipline to stay safe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/24x7-production-of-oxygen-drugs-and-vaccines-cleared/article34405534.ece
25 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Review fire safety steps at hospitals, says KCR||With a few instances of fire at hospitals in some States claiming lives of COVID-19 patients, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao issued directions to review status of fire safety measures at government and private hospitals. On Friday, 15 COVID-19 patients died in a fire in ICU of a hospital in Virar, near Mumbai, Maharashtra. Currently, most of the hospitals are filled with coronavirus patients. He instructed Health Minister Eatala Rajender to take measures to avoid fire. Fire engines should be placed at Gandhi Hospital and Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS). Gandhi Hospital, which is one of the major government hospitals where COVID patients are admitted, do not have required fire safety measures. The issue was highlighted from the past many years. It was latest published in January of this year when a minor fire occurred there. Hose reels and fire extinguishers are missing. In case of TIMS, officials said, there were sufficient measures. Fire safety personnel are posted near Liquid Oxygen Tank and manifold which are starting points for distribution of oxygen. Scores of private hospitals in Hyderabad still lack the measures. Mr Rao directed Health Minister to use xygen, procured from other States, at hospitals which need it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/review-fire-safety-steps-at-hospitals-says-kcr/article34405554.ece

The senior citizen has come up with an ingenious way of safeguarding himself. Heartwarming example  Irrespective of the information disseminated by the media, and the administration, officials and elected representatives doing their bit in spreading the message about the necessity of wearing face masks covering both nose and mouth, at least when one steps out of home, the instances of people moving on the streets without mask continues to remain high. However, in a heartwarming example, Mekala Kurmaiah, a resident of Chinna Munagalched village in Addakul mandal of Mahabubnagar district, has designed a unique mask — a bird’s nest vertically cut into half to hammer home the point that where there is a will, there is a way. Raised eyebrows He wore the mask to the mandal headquarters town of Addakul to draw his monthly social security pension amount, raising eyebrows. “It shows his awareness and resolve to protect himself from contracting the virus. It’s a general perception that people living in urban areas have higher awareness, but this gentleman in a rural area proved the notion wrong,” said an official engaged in making arrangements for the upcoming Jadcherla municipality elections in the district, adding that exhibition of such common sense is the need of the hour.

25 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Banning of sixteen organisations criticised||Several organisations have criticised the government for banning sixteen outfits on charges of links with the CPI (Maoist). The State council of the CPI condemned the step and said it is a violation of freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution. State secretary of the party Chada Venkat Reddy maintained that the ban was imposed at a time when the Maoist party had sent feelers about its preparedness to hold talks with the government in a bid to resolve the stand-off between them. ‘Immoral act’ The immoral act of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is reflected in the ban because he had offered to lead the civil rights movement when he led the separate Telangana agitation, Mr. Reddy said. The Human Rights Forum said it is a brazen attempt by the State to criminalise political belief and throttle dissent. The Telangana Public Security Act that was invoked to declare the organisations as unlawful associations and it’s nothing but a political instrument disguised as penal law. Statements recalled The Civil Liberties Committee which was also banned organised a media conference to recall the confidence created by Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao during the statehood movement that civil rights will flourish in separate Telangana. But, he did what the rulers in combined State did not attempt, they alleged. The Revolutionary Writers Association sought the intervention of the new Chief Justice of India Justice N.V. Ramana to take suo motu notice of the ban and take corrective measures to restore freedom of expression of the banned organisations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/banning-of-sixteen-organisations-criticised/article34405547.ece

Regional Fire Officer - Central Zone V.Papaiah said the prosecution proceedings were issued to 18 of them and five of them were found to be ‘repeat offenders’ as was noticed during surprise inspections in recent times. The information comes in the wake of the latest fire in COVID hospital at Virar in Maharastra where 15 persons were killed. The TS High Court also imposed penalty on four of these hospitals indicating the dangerous tinder box conditions prevailing in these healthcare centres which are seeing huge rush due to the second wave of the pandemic. The officer stated that 19 cases for violation of fire safety norms are under trail, a press release said. The Telangana Fire Service Act, 1999 clearly states that hospitals located in buildings of 15 metres and above in height have to obtain a ‘No Objection Certificate’ (NOC), by following heights and setbacks as per the local building by-laws and provision of fire prevention and safety measures as stipulated in National Building Code - 2016. The department had issued 112 NOCs to the hospitals and claims to have been conducting regular inspections of COVID hospitals and quarantine centres. “We are conducting awareness campaign and mock drill for every six months and also random surprise inspections verify the functionality of available fire fighting equipment,” he said. Few days ago, all the hospital managements and the security personnel have been sensitized on the fire safety measures through a workshop where posters, stickers and pamphlets were also distributed. Fire vehicles have been deployed at Gandhi Hospital and TIMS (Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences, Gachibowli) to attend any fire/emergency call. “While we are closely monitoring the fire safety measures of every COVID hospital and quarantine centre, we are requesting the hospital managements to ensure electrical safety and fire safety by keeping available fire equipment on working condition, training staff on emergency evacuation procedure and first aid,” said Mr. Papaiah. The department or the local fire officer is ready to provide any support or assistance. The RFO appealed to public to call ‘101’ or 9949991101 for immediate response in case of any fire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/prosecution-orders-to-23-hospitals/article34405555.ece

The website ‘health.telangana.gov.in’ displays availability of regular beds, oxygen beds, and ICU or ventilator beds in government and private hospitals. This data is updated regularly.

It felt sad to tell them that I don’t have the information about beds. We don’t know who uploaded the numbers,” a faculty member said.

25 April 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Only three villages remain to vacate||Almost all villages, except three, under Mallannasagar reservoir are getting vacated. The path is being cleared for the biggest reservoir with 50 tmcft under Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme (KLIS). There are eight villages — Erravalli and Singaram in Kondapaka mandal, Etigaddakishtapur, Vemulaghat, Pallepahad, Rampur and Lakshmapur in Toguta mandal — that will be submerged under Mallannasagar. All these villages, at the initial stage, passed unanimous resolutions not to vacate till all payments of compensation were cleared. Despite all these resolutions, one after another village was getting vacated. Even oustees of Pallepahad refused to vacate the village a few days ago. Some families, even after allotment of houses at Mutrajpally Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) colony, kept some belongings at new houses and came back stating that they would not leave the village till all pending payments were cleared. About 75 families remained in the village till Friday. They also vacated the village after officials arranged transport vehicles. "We are particular about vacating village only after receiving all payments. But officials stated that pending payments would be cleared only after shifting to R&R Colony. It was also stated that after Friday transport vehicles would not be provided by officials. Hence we shifted to the new colony though facilities are not there,” said an oustee from Pallepahad who arrived at the new colony. However, doubts are lingering in the minds of oustees on the promise made by officials on pending payments. “Some villagers shifted to the R&R Colony about 10 days ago and they were also given similar promise of clearing pending payments. But nothing transpired so far. We are not sure what will happen in our case,” the villager added. Referring to the quality of new houses, one resident showed a crack at basement of a house at R&R Colony. He said that several houses had developed similar cracks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/only-three-villages-remain-to-vacate/article34405558.ece

25 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||City hangs between hope and despair||“Until a week ago everything was fine and today, my younger brother is no more. We could not save him. He was only in his 40s. How could this happen to him? Everything is over now,” said Varun, a city resident, while breaking down outside the emergency wing of Max Hospital, Saket. Since the last four days, Mr. Varun, like many others had been hoping for a miracle, he said. “What do I tell my parents now? How do I break the news to them,” he asked. Frantic calls From frantic calls to visiting multiple hospitals in search of ICU beds to being inconsolable when informed of a death, the day was spent between hope and despair for those waiting outside the emergency wings of some of the city hospitals. At Moolchand Hospital, while some were seen desperately waiting for ICU beds even after being refused by the hospital administration, several others waited patiently outside amid reports of oxygen shortage even as their relatives fought for their lives inside. Waiting outside the hospital at 4 p.m., Mangolpuri resident Vinod Kumar said that he had lost count of the number of hospitals he had visited since morning. “We need an ICU bed for my aunt who is 54 years old. She has been admitted to ESI Hospital in Okhla but we were told in the morning to shift her out as the hospital did not have a vacant ICU bed. We literally begged them to not discharge her till we found an alternative,” said Mr. Kumar. No vacant beds Stating that he had visited hospitals in Paschim Vihar to Rohini, Mr. Kumar said, “We have been on the road since morning. At Rohini, Saroj Hospital is in a bad shape themselves so they could not help us. We have been waiting at Moolchand for half an hour even though they have told us that there is no vacancy. We were given a phone number but nobody is taking the call. We are at a loss.” With his 41-year-old wife in the ICU, Mohan Singh, a resident of a nearby colony, has spent days waiting outside the emergency wing of the hospital. “At the time of admission, her oxygen saturation had dropped to 50. She was kept in the emergency on the first day as there were no vacancies and later was shifted to the ICU. It is not possible for me to make multiple trips to the hospital. So I simply wait here the whole day and check up from time to time,” said Mr. Singh. ‘A feeling beyond words’ At a time when acute oxygen shortage was being reported across the national capital, Mr. Singh said that for relatives of the patients it was an emotion “beyond words”. “I cannot even begin to explain the level of tension that there is. It is painful. But thankfully, this hospital has been managing somehow and so far my wife did not have face any issues with regard to oxygen supply. We can only hope that they have enough supply for their existing patients,” said Mr. Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/city-hangs-between-hope-and-despair/article34405215.ece
25 April 2021||New Delhi,||Hospitals continue to gasp for oxygen, many reduce beds||City hospitals on Saturday continued to raise alarms about low levels of oxygen and some even stopped admissions of new patients. Hospitals have been facing an oxygen shortage for at least the past seven days. Many hospitals also complained that contact numbers of nodal officers given by the Delhi government for oxygen supply was not responding to their calls. Sir Ganga Ram Hospital raised an alarm at 11 p.m. on Saturday that the hospital had oxygen for only 45 minutes and sought help from the government. It said that they were in touch with nodal officers but no help has come yet. Finally, an oxygen tanker reached the hospital around 12.20 a.m. There were 130 people in ICU of the hospital and a total of over 500 COVID-19 patients. Earlier in the day, Batra Hospital, a private hospital, said their oxygen stock was almost zero around 8.30 a.m., the hospital said. “The oxygen was almost zero and we diverted oxygen from everywhere else to the ICU. We have 265 COVID patients,” said Sudhanshu Bankata, executive director of the hospital. At 9.30 a.m., the hospital received oxygen through the Delhi government. Around 12.30 p.m., Fortis Healthcare also raised an alarm. “Fortis Shalimar Bagh is running out of oxygen. Patients’ lives are at risk. We are running on backup, waiting for supplies since morning. We are currently suspending admissions,” the hospital said. “No oxygen! No help! Govt helpline numbers r of no use. Senior admin not responding to calls. In case of any untoward incident, this admin will make us scapegoat?” Dharamveer Solanki Hospital, which has around 15 COVID-19 patients, said in a tweet at 1 p.m. Several other hospitals sought urgent help from the government. Many hospitals have stopped taking new patients due to the shortage and some bigger hospitals have reduced the number of beds. GTB Hospital has reduced its number of beds for COVID-19 patients to 700 on Saturday from 1,500.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hospitals-continue-to-gasp-for-oxygen-many-reduce-beds/article34405209.ece
25 April 2021||New Delhi,||Kejriwal writes to other State CMs requesting oxygen supply||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday wrote to his counterparts in all other States requesting supplies of oxygen if they had any to spare. The Chief Minister asked that this request be treated as an SOS and stated that many Delhi hospitals had run out of oxygen due to the severe rise in COVID cases in the last few days. While the Central government was helping Delhi in this regard, he wrote, the intensity of the spread was so severe that the quantity was proving inadequate. “Delhi does not produce any oxygen. Due to the severe rise in corona cases in the last few days, many Delhi hospitals have run out of oxygen,” he wrote. “I would be grateful if you could provide us with any oxygen from your State. Kindly treat this as an SOS. I would be personally grateful for your support,” he also wrote. BJP slams govt. Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri accused the Delhi government of “misleading” residents on the issue of oxygen to hide its failure to set up the PSA oxygen plants across the city sanctioned by the Centre months ago. “Instead of putting in place infrastructure for PSA plants, the Kejriwal government sat on the paperwork and clearances required for installation of these plants. The funds sanctioned under PM CARES have been lying idle with the Delhi government which is sheer negligence and a criminal act,” Mr. Bidhuri alleged. The Delhi government responded: “These are being made from PM CARES Fund. A total eight were to be made. The Delhi government was to provide land, such we did. It was supposed to be constructed by Centre. However, Centre’s contractor made only one and ran away. We have written several letters in last few months to expedite this. This status was informed to HC also today,” a Delhi government source said.  Kindly treat this as an SOS. I would be personally grateful for your support Arvind Kejriwal Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/kejriwal-writes-to-other-state-cms-requesting-oxygen-supply/article34405212.ece

For heart treatment It was revealed that he had come to Delhi for his cardiovascular treatment from AIIMS Hospital and his wife was here too but she left a few days ago to vote for Bengal elections.

Stating that there was a spike in cases over the last two weeks, the JNUTA said, “The rigid and the almost negligent attitude of the university administration, we fear could end up having grave consequences for JNU as a whole. To avoid this, the JNUTA would once again like to plead with the university authorities to not stand on rigidities and be flexible to demands that are being made by residents.” “It would indeed be criminal to keep physical facilities locked up and not made available for use by residents in need,” the letter said. Later in the day, the JNU administration issued a statement saying that a COVID response team had been set up recently to assist those requiring tests and vaccines. The administration added that each hostel had a separate response team of its own to handle cases. ‘Malicious remarks’ Terming the teachers’ statements as “malicious and irresponsible”, the varsity said, “JNU administration appreciates the concerns of each member of the community and would welcome constructive suggestions to fight COVID-19...the administration strongly deplores the unwarranted comments.” The teachers also said that it was imperative to create facilities for oxygen concentrators on campus to aid any person in a state of acute distress till a hospital bed can be made available. “It is well-known now that such is the nature of COVID-19, that deterioration in health can happen very fast and hospitals are facing acute overcrowding. This is leading to JNU community members being denied admission to hospitals even listed under the cashless scheme,” the letter said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/teachers-union-condemns-jnu-over-care-centres/article34405211.ece

25 April 2021||Noid,||Burning pyres refuse to die at Noida ground||Every ambulance siren fell silent as it entered the vicinity of ‘Antim Niwas’, the sole facility in the district set aside for the cremation of COVID patients, as a hearse here on Saturday. Family members prohibited from touching COVID-infected bodies wailed inconsolably when allowed a final view of the mortal remains of their loved ones tucked away behind locked vehicular doors and tightly shut windows. One member allowed Only one PPE kit-clad member from such groups would be allowed to observe the CNG cremation of a relative when their turn came, by which time, more ambulances would line up. Across from the CNG crematorium and funeral pyres created on the ground since the adjacent elevated platforms were occupied in between, kin of the non-COVID dead desperately sought help from strangers to get bodies down onto biers assuring bystanders that they were safe to touch. “She had got a bed in a government hospital just last evening and was okay at night before suddenly passing away this morning. We allowed the women from our family a last look, no matter how painful it was for them, before the CNG cremation for the sake of closure,” said Vinod Kumar from Hisar whose 45-year-old COVID-positive cousin’s body underwent CNG cremation. “A last look was both the least and most that we as family members could have done since such a body cannot be touched,” Mr. Kumar added.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, who chaired a high-level meeting to review the illegal mining situation in the State, asked the Mining Department to strictly ensure that no mining is undertaken by any authorised contractor in river beds or other areas after 7.30 p.m. and before 5 a.m. The Chief Minister said anyone, including officers and police personnel, found conniving in illegal sand mining operations should also be dealt with strictly. While directing State’s Director General of Police and the newly constituted Enforcement Directorate (Mining) to crack down strictly on any night mining activity, the Chief Minister, however, ordered that there should be no hindrance to the smooth movement of sand and gravel during the night in view of the high level of construction activity going on in the State. Availability of material at affordable price should also be ensured, he told the department, directing Principal Secretary, Mining, to coordinate with authorised contractors to bring down the prices of sand and gravel. During the meeting, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Minister, Water Resources, apprised the Chief Minister that the creation of Enforcement Directorate (Mining) had made a positive impact on the ground in curbing illegal sand mining activities. DGP Dinkar Gupta said directions have been issued to take action against the unscrupulous elements involved in illegal sand mining. He said that additional manpower will now be deployed to check any sand mining operations at night, in line with the Chief Minister’s directives. R.N.

25 April 2021||LUCKNOW,||Seize property of those spreading rumours: U.P. CM||Amid reports of patients and hospitals struggling to find and maintain oxygen supply, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked officials to take action under the National Security Act and seize the property of individuals who spread “rumours” and propaganda on social media and try to “spoil the atmosphere”. Mr. Adityanath asserted that there was no shortage of oxygen supply in any COVID-19 hospital – private or government-run – but that the actual problem was blackmarketing and hoarding. He made the statement in a video conferencing with select journalists on Saturday evening, as per a government spokesperson. Earlier, Mr. Adityanath, in a high-level meeting with officials, directed them to take action under the NSA and the Gangsters Act against “anti-social elements” involved in “blackmarketing” of medicine, spreading rumours and trying to spoil the atmosphere.  In his interaction with the journalists, Mr. Adityanath referred to a private hospital which had reported a shortage of oxygen two days ago. Upon checking, it was found that the hospital had sufficient oxygen, he claimed. “Due to such people, fear is increasing among the public. Even those who don’t need it, are worried about oxygen cylinders,” Mr. Adityanath said. The State police have taken cue from the government and launched a campaign against people accused of hoarding and blackmarketing medicine and oxygen cylinders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/seize-property-of-those-spreading-rumours-up-cm/article34405515.ece

25 April 2021||BANYUWANGI,||Missing submarine sank, killing 53 aboard: Indonesia||Indonesia’s Navy on Saturday declared its missing submarine had sunk and cracked open, killing 53 crew members aboard, after finding items from the vessel over the past two days. Military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said the presence of an oil slick as well as debris near the site where the submarine’s last dive on Wednesday off the island of Bali were clear proof the KRI Nanggala 402 sank. Indonesia earlier considered the vessel to be only missing. Navy Chief Yudo Margono told a press conference in Bali, “If it’s an explosion, it will be in pieces. The cracks happened gradually in some parts when it went down from 300 m to 400 m to 500 m... If there was an explosion, it would be heard by the sonar.” The Navy previously said it believes the submarine sank to a depth of 600-700 m, much deeper than its collapse depth of 200 m, at which point water pressure would be greater than the hull could withstand. The cause of the disappearance was still uncertain. Findings to be evaluated Adm. Margono said searchers found parts of a torpedo straightener, a grease bottle believed to be used to oil the periscope, debris from prayer rugs and a broken piece from a coolant pipe that was refitted on the submarine in 2012. “With the authentic evidence we found believed to be from the submarine, we have now moved from the ‘sub miss’ phase to ‘sub sunk,’” Adm. Margono said. He said rescue teams from Indonesia and other countries will evaluate the findings. He said no bodies have been found so far. Officials previously said the submarine’s oxygen supply would have run out early on Saturday. An American reconnaissance plane, a P-8 Poseidon, landed on Saturday and had been set to join the search, along with 20 Indonesian ships, a sonar-equipped Australian warship and four Indonesian aircraft. Singaporean rescue ships were also expected on Saturday, while Malaysian rescue vessels were due to arrive on Sunday, bolstering the underwater hunt, officials said earlier Saturday. The German-built KRI Nanggala 402 has been in service in Indonesia since 1981 and was carrying 49 crew members, three gunners and its commander, the Defence Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/missing-submarine-sank-killing-53-aboard-indonesia/article34404874.ece
25 April 2021||COLOMBO,||MP held over Sri Lanka Easter attacks||Sri Lanka police on Saturday arrested All Ceylon Makkal Congress leader and opposition parliamentarian Rishad Bathiudeen in connection with the April 2019 Easter Sunday attacks. In a pre-dawn raid, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) took Mr. Bathiudeen into custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) that rights groups term “draconian” and want repealed. His brother Riyaaj Bathiudeen — who was arrested in April 2020 and released months later due to “lack of evidence” — was arrested again. “They were arrested under the PTA based on circumstantial and scientific evidence that they had connections with the suicide bombers who carried out the attacks,” police spokesman Ajith Rohana said in a statement. On April 21, Sri Lanka marked the second anniversary of the ghastly Easter Sunday terror bombings, carried out by a network of suicide bombers from an IS-inspired local radical Islamist group. A total of 279 people died, and several hundreds were seriously injured in the serial blasts carried out at luxury hotels and churches in Colombo, and in the eastern city of Batticaloa. The arrest of the Bathiudeen brothers comes amid growing calls, from the Catholic church and political opposition, for the government to expedite and complete the probe into the incident, a poll pledge of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. ‘Politically motivated’ In a Facebook video just ahead of his arrest, Mr. Bathiudeen said he was innocent, and his arrest was ‘politically motivated”. “It is part of the repression of the Muslim community of this country, this arrest is a big conspiracy to silence our community…they did not even inform the Speaker about the arrest of a parliamentarian, of the leader of a democratic political party,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/mp-held-over-sri-lanka-easter-attacks/article34404877.ece
25 April 2021||Yerevan,||Defying Turkey, Joe Biden recognises Armenian genocide||U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday recognised the 1915 killings of Armenians by Ottoman forces as genocide, a watershed moment for descendants of the hundreds of thousands of dead as he defied decades of pressure by Turkey. Mr. Biden became the first U.S. President to use the word genocide in a customary statement on the anniversary, a day after informing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that he would go ahead with this step. “We remember the lives of all those who died in the Ottoman-era Armenian genocide and recommit ourselves to preventing such an atrocity from ever again occurring,” Mr. Biden said. “And we remember so that we remain ever-vigilant against the corrosive influence of hate in all its forms,” he said. The statement is a massive victory for Armenia and its extensive diaspora. Starting with Uruguay in 1965, nations including France, Germany, Canada and Russia have recognised the genocide but a U.S. statement has been a paramount goal that proved elusive under other presidents until Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden said his statement was “not to cast blame but to ensure that what happened is never repeated.” As many as 1.5 million Armenians are estimated to have been killed from 1915 to 1917 during the waning days of the Ottoman Empire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/defying-turkey-joe-biden-recognises-armenian-genocide/article34404870.ece
25 April 2021||Washington,||Donald Lu picked for top South, Central Asia job||U.S. President Joe Biden has nominated Donald Lu, a career foreign service officer as the next Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia — a remit that includes the India portfolio. The position was earlier held (in an acting capacity) by Alice Wells who retired last year. Mr. Lu has been the U.S. Ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic since 2018 and was, at one point, the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. He has also held positions in Georgia and Pakistan, according to a bio released by the White House.

25 April 2021||Jerusalem,||Gaza rockets follow Jerusalem clashes||Israeli warplanes struck the Gaza Strip early on Saturday after repeated salvos of rocket fire into Israel followed a second night of clashes between Palestinians and police in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. Thirty-six rockets were launched, the Israeli Army said, the most in a single night this year, after Gaza’s Islamist rulers Hamas voiced support for the east Jerusalem protests, which were fuelled by a Thursday march by far-right Jews. Washington said it was “deeply concerned” by the escalating violence, while the European Union appealed for restraint. The U.S., which has taken a more even-handed approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since President Joe Biden took office in January urged “calm and unity”. “The rhetoric of extremist protesters chanting hateful and violent slogans must be firmly rejected,” State Department spokesman Ned Price tweeted. Tensions have been running high in east Jerusalem over a ban on gatherings, and a series of videos posted online showing young Arabs attacking ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Jewish extremists taking to the streets to bully Arabs. On Thursday, at least 125 people were injured when Palestinian protesters, angered by chants of “death to Arabs” from far-right Jewish demonstrators, clashed repeatedly with police. Skirmishes broke out again on Friday when tens of thousands of Muslim worshippers left the city’s revered Al-Aqsa mosque compound after night prayers and found themselves confronted by dozens of armed police, some on horseback. Hundreds of Palestinians also gathered at the Qalandiya checkpoint between Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/gaza-rockets-follow-jerusalem-clashes/article34404875.ece
25 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||India recalls second rescue vessel, first one still enroute||India has recalled the second Deep Submergence Rescue Vessel (DSRV) that was airlifted on Saturday morning to Indonesia after the Indonesian Navy declared that it had located debris of the missing submarine, KRI Nanggala, suggesting that it had sunk. The Indian Air Force (IAF) C-17 plane with the DSRV intervention system has returned, a Navy official said. The aim of the intervention system was to locate the submarine and enable timely rescue. With debris now being sighted and the Indonesian Navy saying that the submarine had likely sunk, the intervention system was not required as the nature of search had changed, the official stated.  However, the first DSRV which was dispatched on Thursday by sea along with its mother ship is still enroute and a call would be taken in the next few days as clarity emerges on the missing submarine, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-recalls-second-rescue-vessel-first-one-still-enroute/article34404878.ece
25 April 2021||MUMBAI,||ICICI Q4 net rises threefold to Rs. 4,403 cr.||ICICI Bank on Saturday reported fourth-quarter standalone net profit surged more than threefold to Rs. 4,403 crore, from Rs. 1,221 crore a year earlier, helped by an almost 20% jump in retail loans and robust growth in CASA deposits. For the full year, standalone profit more than doubled to Rs. 16,193 crore. In the three months ended March 31, provisions (excluding provision for tax) stood at Rs. 2,883 crore, compared with Rs. 5,967 crore in the year-earlier quarter. The bank said it had utilised contingency provision amounting to Rs. 3,509 crore towards proforma NPAs as of December 31, 2020, in the fourth quarter since these loans had now been classified as per the RBI guidelines. Further, it made additional COVID-19 related provisions of Rs. 1,000 crore during the fourth quarter. As of March 31, the bank held COVID-19 related provision of Rs. 7,475 crore which it said could be used to mitigate risk during the current fiscal. The lender said average savings account deposits increased by 21.2% in the fourth quarter, while current account deposits climbed 33.9% from a year earlier. For the full year, total deposits grew by 21% to Rs. 9,32,522 crore. In Q4, retail loans expanded 19.9%, while domestic loans grew by 17.7%. During the quarter, the gross NPA additions, excluding borrowers in the proforma NPAs as of December 31, 2020, were Rs. 5,523 crore . Recoveries and upgrades, excluding recoveries from proforma NPAs, write-offs and sale, from non-performing loans were Rs. 2,560 crore. NPA ratio falls The net NPA ratio declined to 1.14%, from 1.41% as at March 31, 2020. Excluding NPAs, the total fund based outstanding to all borrowers under resolution as per the various extant regulations/ guidelines was Rs. 3,927 crore, or about 0.5% of the total loan portfolio on March 31. The fund-based and non-fund based outstanding to borrowers rated BB and below (excluding fund and non-fund based outstanding to NPAs) was Rs. 13,098 crore at March 31, 2021, compared with Rs. 13,654 crore as on December 31, 2020, it said. The board has recommended a dividend of Rs. 2 per share. It also authorised the bank to raise up to Rs. 20,000 crore during the current financial year. “We see more opportunities to grow,” Executive Director Sandeep Batra said on a post earnings conference call. “These are uncertain times. We have strengthened our balance sheet and our portfolio is best in class. We are calibrating our risk standards,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/icici-q4-net-rises-threefold-to-rs-4403-cr/article34404849.ece
25 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||RBI to issue cybersecurity norms for payment services||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will soon issue cybersecurity norms for payment service providers (PSPs), following a series of data breaches faced by operators including Mobikwik and payment aggregator JusPay, a top RBI official said. While the standards for fintech-driven payment services providers will be similar to cyber hygiene norms issued recently for banks and non-banking finance companies, the RBI is quite clear that firms will have to do more than observe the minimum standards to ensure safety as digital transactions gain further traction. “On cyber frauds, Reserve Bank of India has issued very recently basic guidelines on cyber hygiene and cybersecurity for banks and certain NBFCs,” said RBI executive director T. Rabi Sankar. “We would follow that up with respect to other entities such as payments systems operators in the payments space. Those are getting finalised and will be issued soon,” he added. “Having said that, the minimum standards set by the regulator for the regulated entities are needed, but they would never be enough. As digitisation increases in any sphere, payments or otherwise, as people do more and more digital transactions, institutions themselves will have to do more than the minimum standards that regulators set, to deal with any cybersecurity threats,” he said, adding that individual users would also need to be alert as there is no alternative to being aware of the risks in undertaking digital transactions. Mr, Sankar, who was speaking at a webinar on ‘Banks, Finance and the changing form of technology’ hosted by RIS, India International Centre and the University of Essex, also raised concerns about the domination of two or three players in the fintech-backed retail payments space. “Look at the popularity of UPI because of the client base of a couple of Big Tech companies. But this process has to be managed…. the concentration of two or three third-party providers in this retail payments space could give rise to competitive weaknesses. That is a challenge that we need to look at and solve going forward,” he said. Over the next decade, the critical challenge for regulators would be to speed up the absorption of fintech without undermining the financial system’s integrity or stability, he asserted. Stressing that there are not too many payment systems in India and the number of players is limited, Mr. Sankar observed that two apps provide about 70% of third-party services in the UPI system. “Strictly speaking, they are not providers as such, as they are just the front-end and just onboard customers. They have no control on the entire UPI itself. In that sense, there is not so much a concern on antitrust or monopolistic tendencies because there is hardly any pricing that happens there,” the central bank official said. ‘No antitrust norms’ The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) had laid down a framework for a more even distribution of share of third-party app providers in the UPI system, the senior RBI official noted, adding that the regulator was, however, not looking at any antitrust provisions against dominant players at this juncture. “If UPI is gaining popularity, you will have to think twice about stepping in and controlling the market share of two or three popular apps because that could actually hurt absorption of this tech in the population,” he said.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Morris’ spell and Samson’s knock help Royals sink Knight Riders||Rajasthan Royals’ clever bowling, aided by tight fielding, fashioned a six-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Saturday. Electing to bowl, Royals restricted Knight Riders to 133/9. Despite losing wickets at regular intervals, Royals chased down the target comfortably, courtesy Yashasvi Jaiswal (22), Sanju Samson (42 n.o., 41b, 2x4, 1x6), Shivam Dube (22) and David Miller (24 n.o., 23b, 3x4). Jos Buttler (5) lost his way after a Pat Cummins bullet struck his helmet. Dazed and confused, the Englishman was trapped in front by Varun Chakravarthy. After five fours, Jaiswal’s adrenaline got the better of him as he attempted to drive a Shivam Mavi delivery and found substitute fielder Kamlesh Nagarkoti at deep-cover. But skipper Samson dug his heels in, rotating the strike and hitting the odd boundary. He added 34 for the fifth wicket with David Miller, and also hit the winning runs. Earlier, Knight Riders adopted a conservative approach on a decent batting track. Openers Nitish Rana (22) and Shubman Gill (11) struggled to negate the slower ones and cutters from left-arm seamers Jaydev Unadkat, Chetan Sakariya and Mustafizur Rahman. They hit only two boundaries in the PowerPlay (25/1). Soon after being dropped by Jaiswal on six, Gill threw his wicket away while going for a cheeky single. Buttler’s under-arm throw hit the stumps before the young opener could make his ground. Even before Rana could explode, Sakariya forced him to edge a short ball outside off to wicket-keeper Samson. Things worsened when Rahul Tripathi (36 off 26) and skipper Eoin Morgan had a communication gap, the confusion leading to the skipper getting run out without facing a ball. Tripathi and Dinesh Karthik’s 33-run stand looked promising before the former fell to a Mustafizur off-cutter. Chris Morris won the match-up with Andre Russell (9), dismissing him for the fourth time in T20s. Two balls later, he sent back Karthik, with Sakariya taking a blinder at extra-cover. The South African finished with four for 23, matching his best figures in the IPL, also against KKR in 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/morris-spell-samsons-knock-help-royals-tame-knight-riders/article34404837.ece
25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||On-a-roll DC will look to halt SRH’s rise||After suffering three losses, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) finally found success with a nine-wicket win over Punjab Kings (PBKS) on Wednesday. It took an unbeaten 63 from Jonny Bairstow and a three-wicket haul from Khaleel Ahmed to turn the match in SRH’s favour. SRH will look to carry that momentum against Delhi Capitals (DC) at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Sunday. DC, however, is a tough nut to crack. The side, led by the young Rishabh Pant, is on a roll with three wins in four outings. Experienced opener Shikhar Dhawan is in great touch, with scores of 92 (vs PBKS) and 85 (vs CSK) to his name. DC leg-spinner Amit Mishra, the second highest wicket-taker in the IPL with 164, scalped four wickets to star in DC’s six-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians on Tuesday. Fellow spinner R. Ashwin has been unusually subdued, having picked up just one wicket in the campaign so far. Batsmen Prithvi Shaw and Pant have recorded a fifty each, but have yet to hit top gear. Tricky pitches SRH depends heavily on its powerful opening combination of David Warner and Bairstow to get the big totals. While Warner has been consistent, his subdued tournament strike-rate of 116 reflects the slow, tricky nature of the pitches at Chennai. New Zealand mainstay Kane Williamson made his first appearance of the season against PBKS, and is set to play the role of sheet-anchor. The SRH bowling attack is depleted by the absence of left-arm seamer T. Natarajan, who will undergo a knee surgery. The side has been served well by Rashid Khan, Abhishek Sharma and Khaleel, all of whom boast of an economy rate of less than six.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/on-a-roll-dc-will-look-to-halt-srhs-rise/article34404833.ece

Gavaskar’s view was seconded by the Indian team’s bowling coach Bharath Arun. “Just 10-15 minutes with Ravi Shastri after a practice session. You know Ravi has got the ability to give so much confidence to youngsters, it’s unbelievable,” Gavaskar said during a webinar to mark the book launch of 1971: The Beginning of India’s Cricketing Greatness (published by Harper Collins). “If he (Shastri) believes in their ability and talent, there is no better man than to give encouragement to that youngster. He will scold you, but at the same time, he will tell you what you can do to get better, he will actually demonstrate to you,” said Gavaskar. He was also all praise for Arun, who has groomed a world-class crop of fast bowlers playing in the same era, a rarity in Indian cricket.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gavaskar-showers-praise-on-shastri/article34404855.ece
25 April 2021||KOCHI,||KFA’s new Super League plans could run into time trouble||The Kerala Football Association can breathe a big sigh of relief after it completed the seventh Ramco Kerala Premier League this week but its plans for a new super league next season is likely to run into time trouble. The KFA has received two bids for its commercial rights — which also requires the bid winner to start a new Super League — for the next 12 years but it is not likely to complete the formalities to get the new league up and running next season, which starts on June 1 this year. “Only two companies have submitted their bids and they have been opened by the expert committee headed by our (KFA) president. It has made some arrangements to make a report by next week and then the executive committee has to meet and decide about it. But at this moment, I think it may get delayed...because of COVID, no official meeting is possible,” P. Anilkumar, the KFA general secretary, told The Hindu on Saturday. “Since this matter is of a serious nature, they need to discuss it in person. So, it may get delayed by one or two months.” Ideally, agreements between the KFA and the bid-winner will have to be completed before the beginning of the new season (the KFA season is from June 1 to May 31) so that the teams concerned could plan their moves well. “If things had been completed before May, then we can start registering players by June. And accordingly, we can restructure our competition calendar but unfortunately, because of this coronavirus position, we are not in a position to redesign it,” said Anilkumar. “So, we may lose one season from our side because we have to make the deal prior to the season. If the agreement is not in place before the start of the season, it will be difficult for them to implement everything as per expectations.” One understands that the bids for KFA’s commercial rights have come from within Kerala from some prominent business groups. Three parties had picked the bid document and two had put in their bids.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kfas-new-super-league-plans-could-run-into-time-trouble/article34405149.ece

Chennai Super Kings will have to find a way past the three musketeers — Virat Kohli, A.B. de Villiers and Glenn Maxwell — in its quest to breach Royal Challengers Bangalore’s fortress. RCB is on a dream run. It has four wins in four games. And the second-placed CSK has been victorious in three out of four. Sparks are bound to fly in the day game. The surface at the Wankhede has some pace and the ball does come on to the bat. Padikkal impresses RCB is not about the Big Three alone.

The 38-year-old, who scored an unbeaten 114 against Ireland on her international debut in 1999, said not winning the World Cup has been her biggest regret. “Yes, I am desperate to be part of a World Cup-winning team. Otherwise, it has been an immensely satisfying career for me, and I take pride in my consistency and longevity at the highest level,” Mithali told The Hindu on Saturday. Mithali insisted that it doesn’t mean she will stop playing ODIs after next year’s World Cup in March. Final decision “Hopefully, I will be playing in my sixth World Cup if the situation improves by then after the second wave of the coronavirus. But, I will be looking to take a final decision on continuing at the international level after a home series next year,” said Mithali, who trains with her mentor-cum-coach R.S.R. Murthy at the St. John’s Sports Foundation here. Mithali said the pandemic has hit women’s cricket hard. “We were supposed to have some camps around this time, but the second wave has undone all the planning. Understandably, everyone is scared now. There’s uncertainty all over,” she said. “We will be going to England to play a Test there, the second one for India in England after the 2014 match,” she said. “Ideally, we should start planning for the next World Cup with Plan A and B. We have to have more options in bowling and not just spin bowling. We need to work on our fast bowlers and there are quite a few talented who need to be groomed in a camp,” Mithali said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/2022-edition-will-be-my-last-world-cup-mithali/article34404842.ece

Nadal defeated Tsitsipas in the 2018 Barcelona final losing just three games. Djokovic loses World No. 1 Novak Djokovic lost to Aslan Karatsev 5-7, 6-4, 4-6 in the semifinals of the Serbia Open. The Russian had a dream run at the Australian Open before losing to Djokovic in the semifinals. Karatsev later went on to win the Dubai ATP 500 title.  The results: Semifinals: Rafael Nadal bt Pablo Carreno Busta 6-3, 6-2; Stefanos Tsitsipas bt Jannik Sinner 6-3, 6-3.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||My brother across the border||Salai Uk Thang, 31, a policeman from Myanmar’s Sagaing Division, knew his arrest was imminent. Last month, Thang had joined the civil disobedience movement, a rapidly expanding resistance movement that has attracted tens of thousands of Myanmarese in the wake of the coup that toppled Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government in February. He, like many police personnel, fled Myanmar. Thang’s instinctive choice was to head to Mizoram, divided from Myanmar by a porous international border, part of which is formed by the 159-km long Tiau river. Thang simply walked across the shallow waters. “I crossed the border and was given a warm welcome by the people of the nearest village,” he says. He has distant relatives in Mizoram’s capital Aizawl, and they welcomed him with open arms even though he was meeting them for the first time. Thousands of Myanmarese like Thang, mostly from Myanmar’s Chin State, the Sagaing Region, and other neighbouring provinces, have trooped into Mizoram since February, an influx that once again raises questions about identity and borders, refugees and relatives, friends and foes. The India-Myanmar border stretches over 1,600 km, of which roughly 400 km runs along Mizoram, and then it snakes north along Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. The sudden and large influx of Myanmarese people sent alarm bells ringing in New Delhi, and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) sent a note on March 10 to the four States asking their governments to stop people crossing the border and to deport anyone who had found their way in. Surprisingly, what Raisina Hill had overlooked was the rich fabric of religious, linguistic and ethnic ties that binds people in these border regions. This is especially true of Mizoram, which has seen the greatest number of Myanmarese refugees. The MHA’s stance drew flak from the Mizo government and people, and K. Vanlalvena, the lone Rajya Sabha member from the State, reacted sharply, saying the Mizo people could not act against their own brothers and sisters. Not just rhetoric The use of the phrase ‘brothers and sisters’ was not mere rhetoric. The Chins of Myanmar and the Mizos come from the same ethnic roots and fall within the broad ethnic grouping, Zo. They speak the same Tibeto-Burman languages and are bonded by the same customs, cultures and traditions. As Vanlalvena explained, these ties are manifest in all the Chin-Kuki-Mizo tribes living in Myanmar, India and Bangladesh. The Mizos have long believed that the people of Bangladesh’s Chittagong Hill Tracts, Myanmar’s Chin Hills, and India’s Mizoram and Assam States are one ethnic group, divided into three nations by the British. In an unusual move, Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga, who heads the State’s ruling Mizo National Front, sent a strong missive to Prime Minister Modi, saying the MHA’s instructions were not acceptable. “Mizoram cannot remain indifferent today,” he said. “India cannot turn a blind eye to this humanitarian crisis unfolding right in front of us in our own backyard.” While the Centre has yet to respond officially, the Mizo government and people have continued to welcome refugees from Myanmar. “The Chin communities are ethnically our brethren with whom we have had close contact down the years, even before India became independent,” Zoramthanga said in the message to Modi last month. Citizens for democracy The present situation is unique in Myanmar. Unlike the military takeover by General Ne Win in 1962 or the military coup d’etat in 1988, a large majority of the refugees today are police, fire service personnel, and government employees, seeking refuge in India and Thailand. They have joined the civil disobedience movement in large numbers, as have doctors, nurses, lawyers, teachers, bankers and engineers. They have boycotted work, and are demanding a reversal of the coup. And what began as an online campaign has morphed into a popular pro-democracy movement. Linda Cin Par, 28, who works in a government bank in Chin State, is one such person. She joined the movement last month and refused to cooperate with the military junta. Par says she had to leave because the army would have arrested her any minute. She fled, leaving family behind, to join her uncle, a trader in a tiny Mizoram hamlet near the Myanmar border. Based in Aizawl, V.L. Tana Bawitlung is the president of MZP, the Mizo Zirlai Pawl or Mizo Students’ Federation. He says India cannot call itself the world’s largest democracy if it doesn’t extend help to the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar and to those who have taken shelter in Mizoram fearing persecution. MZP has been at the forefront of providing assistance to the refugees, working closely with a non-profit called United for Democratic Myanmar, which consists of Myanmarese nationals as well as those who moved to Mizoram decades ago. Bawitlung says, “The people of Mizoram will continue to give shelter and food on humanitarian grounds because these are Chin-Kuki-Mizo people even if the Indian government objects.” Marches, rallies, concerts and fundraising drives are on in full swing. MZP collaborates not only with non-profits, but also with cultural organisations such as the Mizo Zaimi Inzawmkhawm Pawl (Mizo Singers United), Music Domain of Mizoram, People United for Music with a Purpose; religious organisations such as Chin Baptist Churches USA; and local television channels such as ZONET and LPS that broadcast fundraising concerts. Money is collected on the streets as well as through donations in cash and kind, and eventually distributed to the refugees. Spread across villages, smaller towns and Aizawl city, at least 6,500 refugees are estimated to be in Mizoram, including 18 members of the Myanmar Parliament and State legislatures. They have been accommodated in camps like the one established in RAY Building at Falkland in Aizawl; many are with relatives; and others are in community halls and schools. In the UN, the Indian Ambassador T.S. Tirumurti, in a closed-door Security Council meeting, expressed India’s commitment to democratic transition. This gave fresh hope to the refugees in Mizoram. On the ground, however, the Centre-State mismatch continues. The Assam Rifles personnel guarding the Myanmar border have continued to stop cross-border movement, despite the fact that the Free Movement Regime is still in force here. This means that people from both sides of the border can enter the other side up to 16 km (as the crow flies) without any travel documents. Traditionally, people visit relatives across the border to attend weddings, funerals and other ceremonies. Cross-border romance and marriages are common. Long history Now, Assam Rifles personnel are again reportedly demanding ID cards and travel documents from people moving in the area, reminding locals of the days when the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) was in force here for two decades from 1967 to 1986. In 1966, a movement to unite the ethnic Mizos or Zo people of India, Myanmar and Bangladesh under a single sovereign ‘Zo Nation’ had been launched by the Mizo National Front, which had led to armed insurgency and the AFSPA. The history of the region is a layered one. Legend has it that the Mizos and Chins emerged from the same cave called Chhinlung. According to history, they were possibly part of a wave of migration from China and Tibet dating back to the 7th century. Mizo oral history talks of their place of origin being Chhinlung, and historians speculate that this might be Chhinlungsan on the banks of the Yalong River in China. As they travelled south, they passed through the Shan and Kachin States of Burma before reaching Lushai country, now known as Mizoram. Many of these ethnic Mizos, mainly Pawi or Lai clans and the Paites (now officially recognised by the Myanmar government as Chins) remained in the Chin Hills, while a large number of them, led mainly by Sailo chiefs, settled in the present Mizoram. Later, when Burma got independence from British India, a number of Mizos, especially from the eastern parts of the State, left to settle in Burma’s Sagaing Division, mainly in the Kalaymyo township. Neihkima, who lives in Tahan in Kalaymyo, says that he enlisted in the Burmese Army during the late 1940s and settled in Myanmar with his family. “All of us who migrated from Mizoram to Myanmar and settled there, we are all identified as Chins,” says Neihkima, adding that a large number of people living in Tahan speak Lushai, the Mizo language, flawlessly. No differences This history has meant that although the people of Chin State and Sagaing region of Myanmar and the people of Mizoram might have been administered by different governments down the years, there was no other real difference between them. In appearance, language or custom, it is almost impossible for outsiders to differentiate between a Mizo from Mizoram and a Chin from Myanmar. This is one big reason why refugees can remain undetected in Mizoram. Another strong bond is that of religion — they are all Christian. The Presbyterian Church of India’s Mizoram Synod has a close relationship with the Presbyterian Church of Myanmar, and the latter still uses the Mizoram Synod’s church literature printed at the Synod Press in Aizawl. Bollywood bonds Cinema is another unifying factor. Both Hollywood and Bollywood movies, subtitled or translated into Lushai, are extremely popular in the Chin-Kuki-Mizo inhabited areas of Myanmar. In fact, these films have helped disseminate Lushai widely among the various ethnic groups in Chin State. Though they have their own dialects such as Falam, Hakha or Tiddim, they are now fluent in Lushai as well, making communication seamless when they come into Mizoram. Cultural exchanges, such as the Zofest organised by the MZP have been another connection. The Zofest has been hosted in turn by Mizoram, Bangladesh, Tripura, Assam (hills region), Manipur and Myanmar, where several tribal groups showcase their distinct traditional music, dance and costume. The cultural unification of the people of the border areas has been a major preoccupation in recent years, with organisations such as MZP, the Mizo Students Union, the Zo Reunification Organisation, and Zofa Global Network working to bring Chin-Kuki-Mizo peoples from Mizoram, other Indian States, Myanmar, and Bangladesh together in festivals and collaborations. These cultural bonds continue to colour the political dreams of an ultimate ‘Zo Nation’, a dream encouraged by local political parties. In 2017, former Mizoram Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla spoke of Zo people reuniting “under a single administrative unit” one day and of how cultural and emotional integration of Zo ethnic groups would help in the “reunification process”. On April 20, the Manipur High Court restrained the government from taking action against seven Myanmarese taking refuge in Moreh, and ordered their safe transit to Imphal. “The protection afforded by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution is not limited to citizens and can be availed by non-citizens also,” the bench said. The fact remains that the highly emotional support extended to Myanmar’s refugees in Mizoram has its roots in some strong historic and cultural ties that the Centre will have to understand and acknowledge sooner or later.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Godse by any other name||There is something deeply troubling about Chennai-based playwright Prasanna Ramaswamy’s new play This is my name . Long after it is over, it leaves you with a sense of disquiet and lingering insecurity. The 90-minute theatre performance featuring a large ensemble cast was recently staged in Chennai to somewhat muted response, thanks to COVID-19. The play is ostensibly an exploration of the past — Nathuram Godse’s defence of his assassination of Gandhi. Yet, in doing so, the play essentially raises uncomfortable, deeply unsettling questions about the future. “While the central figure, Godse, claims that he only performed his duty as a patriot in the act of killing Mahatma Gandhi, the notion of the nation state as against the philosophy of a nation, a land of people, through the several interpolations of fundamentalist acts through history, the discourse moves to reveal the cruel and abysmal ignorance behind the act,” says Prasanna, who has adapted and directed the play, supported by Chennai Art Theatre. “Gandhi is the embodiment of secularism and Godse as a representation of an ideology that is out to destroy secularism and to engage with the perpetrator brings us close to present reality.” An adaptation of writer Paul Zacharia’s Malayalam novella, Ithanente Peru , the play takes the audiences through a “series of soliloquies of Godse ranging from memory, defence, reasoning, fear and so on,” says Prasanna. Real turmoil Delivering a stunning performance as Godse, actor Sarvesh Sridhar brings to the stage a myriad of eloquent emotions, ranging from ecstasy to confusion, from a false sense of peace to a very real turmoil. Through the play, Godse bases his reasoning on the ideology he grew up with, the principles against secularism. In the course of self-enquiry, he revisits what he imagines to be his previous births. The play ends with his refusal to sign his name, claiming that his name will now be Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. In the end, all the actors shed their images of Godse and come together to deliver the powerful words of Kerala’s philosopher-social reformer Narayana Guru on religion and caste, delivered in 1916. “I have no connection whatsoever with any one of the existing religions. All religions are acceptable to me. Everyone needs to observe the religion they like. It is according to the wishes of certain of the Hindus that I have consecrated some temples. Likewise, if followers of other religions like Christians, Muhammedans wish, I am only too happy to do the necessary for them as well. When I say that I have left behind the differences of caste or creed, it only means that I have no special attachment to any of the existing castes or religions.” In his novella, Zacharia “expands the discourse on Godse’s faith in the singular further by arranging episodes from history — those which happened with few other religions, including Christianity, as parallels,” says Prasanna. In the play, Prasanna deftly places some contemporary elements as intertexts in an attempt to ‘raise a question on the cultural output hydrated by the religious faith and another looking at how texts are turned into political equipment.’ So, if we have Nikhila Kesavan as a ‘commentator’ confronting the dancer in Anita Ratnam about her choice of mythological characters to expound contemporary feminism (even calling them as ‘suspended in movement’), we also have Dharma Raman and Sharanya using a discourse in Bhagavad Gita as a tool for polarisation. Dramatic engagement In the course of these intertexts, Anita presents her dance repertoire as a dramatic engagement with the question of art and faith. “These two additional intertexts — one voicing a crucial question on cultural manifestations of a faith, any faith, and the other holding a mirror to the act of art and tradition turned into a weapon by the perpetrator — complete the discourse,” says Prasanna. That a novella written in 2003 holds more relevance today than when it was first written, and that it could be successfully adapted as an intense theatre performance is perhaps a reflection of what the country has gone through in these years. “The immediate reason to write the play was a re-reading of Godse’s defence in court. It was a powerful document, and he was so deep-rooted in his belief. That is what fundamentalism and terrorism are all about, whatever the religion,” recalls Zacharia. “In 2003, I do think I started writing on what could happen. I had this eerie feeling that things are changing and not for good. Different forces were coming into play.” Zacharia thinks the novella is more relevant today because the “character of Godse has come into greater prominence today; people are building temples for him. In that context, it is worth taking a look at [the subject].” For Prasanna, it is all about interrogating the grimness of reality with the craft of theatre. “We live in times which call for celebration of secular values, especially in a country like India which has been home to people with very different faiths for centuries. This central idea of secularism has been challenged by those who uphold a singular faith ideology and use power to destroy the multicoloured fabric. I think it helps to cut to a close-up to see clear the right-wing ideology that leverages action.” The play also features Nikhil Kedia and Dharshan Ramkumar doing extended Godses and other multiple roles. The original score for the play has been composed by Anandhkumar; the artwork is a triptych created by artist Gurunathan Govindan; and light design is by Charles. The play features vocals by Sharanya Krishnan and nattuvangam by Subhasri Vidya. According to Prasanna, the play breaks, fuses and leaps across genres working through the principles of contact and isolation towards a surreal that can be more real. “The play brings the rants of Godse, fluctuating between arrogance, fear, and misled ideas, which takes form through stylisation of not just movement but by multiplication of his character.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Hanging by a noodle||As I effortlessly unmoulded the steaming hot rice cones on to the shavige press without having to run a knife along the sides of the tumbler, my husband quipped, “So, you are quite a pro now.” I was thrilled at the rare compliment from him, for ottu shavige is a speciality in his hometown Parampalli in Udupi district and occupied a place of pride in my mother-in-law’s vast cooking repertoire. In fact, there was always a certain sense of anticipation and hype whenever she made it. This was not entirely unwarranted, as the preparation was laborious and had to be done a day or two in advance, and the quantities prepared were quite large. But it was an occasion much looked forward to and the dish was immensely enjoyed by all in the family. Given that it was my childhood favourite too, I decided to learn how to make it over a decade ago. Also known as ‘akki shavige’ and ‘idiyappam’, ottu shavige, which roughly translates to hand-pressed rice noodles, is a speciality in different parts of South India. My mother would always wax eloquent on its preparation, which was akin to a minor celebration in her childhood home, with a household of over 40 people. A lady help would be called in for the occasion and a pressing machine brought in on hire. Kilograms of rice flour would be cooked and steamed into balls, and the pressing would go on for hours. Satiating the entire household was a mammoth task. Onerous process As a child, I often fantasised about this delicacy, but we would never make it at home. Growing up in a nuclear family in 80s’ Hyderabad, where the dish was hardly known, getting hold of a shavige press was an onerous task, if not impossible. So, my shavige dreams were only rarely indulged, mostly when we happened to visit a friend of my mother who used to make it. Otherwise, it was always good ol’ Bambino vermicelli that was our source for shavige bath. But, as my mother always said, this could never compare to the taste of freshly pressed rice noodles.  When we eventually moved to Bengaluru in the late 90s, we tried making it at home. The onerous process involves cooking rice flour in boiling water until it becomes soft yet firm enough to be rolled into balls and steamed for about 15 minutes, after which the balls are sent into the press to emerge as string hoppers. Right formula The quantity of rice flour and water is of utmost importance — too much water and the ball gets too sticky and cannot be pressed. Too little water and the flour stays uncooked and brittle. Often, during our trials, we ended up with a sticky mass of rice flour that had to be repurposed into akki rotis or dosas. The right formula continued to evade me, until I got married. On a visit to my husband’s hometown for the festival of Gowri Habba, my joy knew no bounds when I saw my mother-in-law deftly pressing out beautiful mounds of shavige. I quickly began taking notes. I was surprised to learn that the batter was made from soaked raw rice as opposed to rice flour. My enthusiasm to make the complex shavige was met with scepticism since I wasn’t really known for my culinary prowess. Nevertheless, I made my notes with steely resolve. Back home, I splurged on a small shavige press, known locally as a shavige mane . I followed my notes to the tee and the result was not bad at all. I made it many times thereafter, and each time it turned out better than before. One self-taught trick was to grind the batter thick while adding small quantities of water at regular intervals. It has been over a decade of shavige-making and now I have a much larger brass press. I always make it a point to use red parboiled rice, which is not only healthier but tastier too. The dish is a regular feature at home and one that not only makes holidays and festivals more special but also conjures up fond memories of a simpler past.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Man and the first big boom||Reality is magic and magic is real in this collection of stories about Nagaland, its people, lores and folk beliefs. Some of the stories represent oral narratives, meant to be shared around a glowing hearth, to keep the darkness away. Some are based on folktales, like the one presented here. All of them are strikingly simple and all the more memorable for that. Coupled with stunning illustrations by graphic artist Sunandini Banerjee, the tales make Nagaland with its deep forests and sparkling skies come alive. The following story, based on a Konyak folktale, is titled ‘One Day’.  One day, when the time was right, God came down to earth. The quietness of that day was unlike any quiet that would ever be again. It was different from loneliness because you can’t be lonely if you’ve never known the presence of a human being, a shadow of yourself, a mirror of all the feelings that, some time or another, you have known. Like a great, deep aloneness was the voiceless vastness of the land that spread out in ranges of primeval mountains or the seas of water gravitating toward the smaller ball of light in the skies, its waters ebbing and flowing ceaselessly. ‘It needs to be dominionated,’ God declared, and His mind flung together strong sinews and flame-thrower eyes into that brave terrible, the tiger. Great feet pounded the earth and ivory-white tusks thrust at the air as the elephant burst into existence; and all around them the flap-flap of a thousand and more creatures of the air; and on the seas, water animals pirouetted the lengths of the waves. The other animals were already making their homes in the greenness and beginning to procreate. In the midst of all this, God took a small clod of clay in His big hands and breathed His breath into it and called it Man. Smaller than many of the animals, inept at swinging from trees, unskilled at flapping his arms and uninitiated in the world of waterways, this new creature called Man was mortally afraid of both the animals of land and the animals of water. ‘Oh creator God, please give me more strength than them,’ he begged every day. Walking alongside his latest creation, sometimes lifting him to his feet if he stumbled and fell in the undergrowth, God said, ‘I can’t give you more strength, because I made you last but I will give you something before I go back to heaven.’ Every day Man begged God to protect him, until, one day, he took out a long stick, that was pointed at one end, and gave it to the man. ‘This is is a firestick. It has great power, such great power that it will destroy all those you fire at, so, use it only in times of great danger.’ Then, as God got ready to go back, he told Man, ‘Mind, you don’t fire that stick until I have entered heaven.’ Once God was gone, the man forgot everything that God had told him. He was so happy with his firestick that he forgot all the warnings about its use. Impatient, he fired it. God was in the upper reaches of heaven when He heard the loud retort. He ran down to earth again. He found the firestick in the man’s hands, with smoke curling up from its pointed end. ‘Why did you fire?’ God asked. ‘I’m just trying it out,’ Man replied. But God did not like it at all. ‘The way you did it — mmhü , I don’t like it, no I don’t.’ And God took it away from Man. ‘I’m sorry, I won’t do it again,’ said Man, ‘please don’t take it away.’ ‘I’ll send you another one,’ said God, and turned away from Man, climbed the last tall mountain, heaved Himself up onto the clouds and went back to heaven. Every day, the animals walked past Man. They had their young with them, and female animals heavy with child fed on the fruits fallen on the forest floor. Man worried as they watched him languidly with mildly curious eyes. ‘Oh creator God, one of these days they shall surely be my death. Please keep your promise to me.’ Finally, God felt sorry for him: ‘My son, kill a chicken, remove the flesh and carefully examine the joints of its leg. You may fashion a firestick after it.’ So Man did as God told him, and fashioned a firestick like the leg joint of the chicken. Then Man went out with the firestick, and Man knew no fear because he knew the power possessed by the stick. He walked up to the elephant. ‘Coming after me with a stick, are you?’ snorted the elephant, and tried to wrap his trunk around it. Man was ready — and he fired. And the sound was heard in heaven too. Fell to earth, the elephant did, in a flurry of dust and dead leaves — and there was such amazement in his eyes before they closed in death. The she-bear saw it all. She ran back to the other animals, and said: ‘Don’t have anything to do with that creature — the one who calls himself Man. I was there when he raised this little stick and waved it at Elephant. And when Elephant was almost upon him, and I was thinking surely he would be killed, and God would have to make another thing called Man, he fired the stick at Elephant! And poor Elephant, he fell — fell to the dust and died there, you can still see his mouth hanging open from the shock of it all!’ Extracted fromThe Rain-Maiden and the Bear-Man and Other Storiespublished by Seagull Books.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Not a ‘demographic’ battle||An impartial analysis of Islamophobia in India would reveal that what generated it was not Islam but a sense of political insecurity born out of exaggerated fears of Muslim numbers. These anxieties came to the fore in the early 1900s after the partition of Bengal, the passage of the Punjab Land Acquisition Act of 1900, and when the Indian Councils Act of 1909 introduced separate electorates for Muslims. More recently, in September 2004, the VHP working president of north Gujarat region Chinubhai Patel expressed alarm at the 36% rise in the decadal growth rate of Muslims recorded in the 2001 Census and said that the community was “conspiring to convert ‘Hindu rajya’ into a Muslim country.” And in October 2019, BJP leader Surendra Singh warned that Hindutva will become endangered in the next 50 years unless population control laws are enacted in the country. Wealth of material S.Y. Quraishi’s The Population Myth seeks to counter this disinformation campaign with hard data. The book brings together a wealth of information from unimpeachable sources to show that Muslims can never outnumber the Hindus given the trend in the last 70 years, and that by 2101 the Indian population will stabilise around 1.7 billion, with 1.27 billion Hindus and 320 million Muslims. However, the stabilisation of the Muslim population will be slower by 40 years due to the lag in demographic transition. These findings were more or less confirmed by a study published in The Lancet last year which suggested that by 2048 India’s population will peak at about 1.61 billion and decline to 1.093 billion by 2100. And if India is able to meet UN Sustainable Development Goals targets for education and contraceptives, the population would peak earlier and decline to 929 million by 2100. Statistics provided by Quraishi also show that from a religious point of view Muslims have not just been open to the idea of family planning but far ahead in the acceptance of birth spacing methods than their Hindu counterparts. Quraishi states that more than religion it is factors such as literacy, age of marriage, exposure to mass media, and economic conditions that determine the fertility levels of Indian Muslims. Yet he quite unnecessarily devotes three chapters spanning 105 pages to discuss the tenets of Islam on family planning, and population policies in Islamic nations. Economic backwardness These chapters offer nothing more than a collection of some Quranic verses, few hadiths, and a number of fatwas. And the author fears fatwas enough to confess that when in 1994 he was accumulating data on family planning he sounded many ulema and imams “to make sure I don’t end up getting fatwas against myself.” It is this submissive attitude that has kept Muslims under the thumb of religious leaders, letting them micromanage their lives for centuries. Indeed, the socio-economic backwardness of Muslims is mostly a result of letting clerics have their way on issues they know little about. For instance, a dispassionate study of verses 6:151 and 17:31 would have yielded enough material for Quraishi to rethink his elitist neo-Malthusian argumentation that links scarcity of resources to overpopulation. Both verses warn Muslims against ‘killing’ their children fearing impoverishment or ruination ( imlaaq ) because the planet has been provided with enough resources ( rizq ) to sustain humanity. But Quraishi glosses over this Quranic statement instead of investigating it further. Food wastage A 2012 article in the Journal of Sustainable Agriculture by a group of researchers led by agroecologist Eric Holt Giménez argued citing Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN that the world produces more than 1.5 times enough food to feed 10 billion people, the world’s 2050 projected population peak. But the bulk of industrially produced grain crops goes to biofuels and confined animal feedlots rather than food for the hungry. Then there is the issue of food wastage. The United Nations Development Programme estimates that up to 40% of the food produced in India is wasted even before it reaches the consumer. In other words, hunger or lack of access to education, healthcare and other basic necessities do not appear to be due to overpopulation. In July 2020, policy analyst Chelsea Follett of the Cato Institute in a forcefully argued paper titled Neo-Malthusianism and Coercive Population Control in China and India states that population growth can coincide with increasing abundance of natural resources and does not necessarily lead to scarcity. Her concern is that despite birth rates declining dramatically across the world without coercion neo-Malthusian ideas are seeing resurgence in India and elsewhere. The political import of these scientific opinions is momentous. It means any legislative attempt to regulate India’s population based on unfounded fears would be as counter-productive as China’s failed population policy which not just affected the sex-ratio, but reduced the productive workforce and resulted in an ageing society. The Communist state is now considering “more inclusive population policies” to boost birthrate. Although Quraishi mentions China’s failed population policy and the significance of demographic dividend, his book does not contain any discussion on the pros and cons of the neo-Malthusianism it rehashes. It presents the one-sided view that family planning is the be-all and end-all of population stabilisation. Nevertheless, the book succeeds in exploding the myth that Indian Muslims are plotting a “demographic jihad” to capture power.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The caste-free collective||On a sultry April day, Thakurnagar, the holy site of Matuas in the Bongaon sub-division of West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district bordering Bangladesh, sizzles with banners of rival political parties asking for votes. As if indifferent to the ongoing political tension and the pandemic threat, a boisterous religious rally makes its way through the town, with men jumping as high as they can and women rolling on the roads. The sound of drums gets deafening. Every participant seems to be in ecstasy. The procession is part of the Baruni fair or Thakurnagar Matua mela, the week-long annual festival observing the birth anniversary of Harichand Thakur (1812-1878), the founder of the Matua sect. Religious ecstasy is essential to the Matuas. The word Matua probably comes from the term, matta (drunken) — to be Matua is to be drunk on faith, absolute faith, uninhibited by caste considerations. Freedom from hierarchy While the fair takes place in different parts of Bengal on a smaller scale, its centre is Thakurnagar, where lakhs of Matuas come over to pay their respects to their leader at Thakurbari (House of the Thakurs). There they recite and listen to words from Hari Lilamrita, a collection of Harichand’s sayings. In the stalls stalls selling sweets and samosas, images of Harichand and his son Guruchand are sold alongside those of Hindu deities. Some Matuas consider Harichand to be an incarnation of Vishnu. The Matua sect is the result of a reformist, anti-caste movement started by Harichand in Bangladesh in the late 19th century. “The core ideology of this movement was freedom from the hierarchy of Brahminical caste practices,” says Rajat Roy, assistant professor of political science at Presidency University, Kolkata. Roy adds that while social reform movements, headed by the likes of Vidyasagar, Ramakrishna or Swami Vivekananda, were widespread in Bengal at the time, they rarely breached caste boundaries. This is where the appeal of Harichand’s teachings, with their anti-discriminatory message, lay. Equality for all Born into a family of peasants in Orakandi village, in present-day Bangladesh, Harichand founded the Matua sect to bring emancipation to the Namasudras, who were pejoratively called Chandals and considered untouchable. After Harichand’s death in 1878, his son Guruchand Thakur (1846-1937) expanded the scope of the movement to include people from other downtrodden communities and religions. The book, The Politics of Caste in West Bengal (edited By Uday Chandra, Geir Heierstad and Kenneth Bo Nielsen), quotes Dalit author Manoranjan Byapari as saying that the Matua movement “needs to be recognised as the first organised Dalit movement in Bengal.” Guruchand campaigned successfully to have the Chandal people recategorised as Namasudra in the 1891 census. He also managed to ensure reservation for the community in 1907. Emancipation through education was the cornerstone of the movement as shaped by Guruchand, who established a number of schools in undivided Bengal for the Dalit community. Even today, Thakurnagar, created post-Partition in the image of Orakandi, is remarkable for the number of schools it has — there are at least 16 in this small town. Women’s education also came early. Binapani Devi Thakur (1920-2019), wife of Pramatha Ranjan Thakur (Guruchand’s grandson), worked alongside her husband to establish Thakurnagar. Still revered as the matriarch, Binapani Devi spread the teachings of Harichand across the country and campaigned for the Matuas’ right to permanent citizenship. “Equality for all — whether in terms of gender, caste or religion — is one of our primary tenets,” says Soma Thakur, leader of Matri Sena, the women’s wing of the Matua Mahasangha, the central Matua organisation. Articulate community The zeal for education has differentiated the Namasudras from other lower castes of Bengal. As Roy says, “While the Namasudras are aware of reservations and are ambitious about their career, many other Scheduled Caste (SC) communities like the Rajbongshis are more intent on political representation, specifically territorial autonomy.” However, as the Matuas became economically successful, they sometimes ended up replicating the very caste practices they had rebelled against. The view that Harichand is a Vishnu incarnation can be cited as an instance of this tendency. Matua activists have countered this trend through literature connecting Matua tenets to the teachings of Ambedkar and secular organisations meant to create caste consciousness. But even now, Ambedkar is not a big presence in their daily lives. Namasudra author Manindranath Biswas’s book, Harichand Tattwamrita , seeks to reinterpret Harichand’s teachings by separating it from Hindu beliefs. The Matuas, who began migrating from Bangladesh in 1947 and continued to arrive until the 1970s, are now settled as far as Uttarakhand, the Dandakaranya area, and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. In West Bengal, they have a considerable presence in border districts such as the 24 Parganas, Nadia, Howrah, Cooch Behar and Malda, and are the State’s second largest SC community. While always an articulate community with a sizeable body of literary works to its credit, the Matuas became a significant political entity after the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, and the introduction of the term “illegal migrant,” which cast their credentials into doubt. In 2019, the NRC furthered this anxiety, which the CAA 2019 sought to assuage.  Dilution of tradition Thakurnagar resident Kamalkanti Biswas, 73, the present in-charge of the Matua Mahasangha of North Bengal, traces his origins to Orakandi. He came to India in 1975. “I quit my job in the agriculture department of Bangladesh to come here. For years, I worked in other people’s homes and farms. I sat for the Madhyamik (West Bengal Board) exams, and eventually got a job in the State education department. I retired as a lower-division clerk this year,” he says. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Orakandi on March 27 and its significance have been enthusiastically discussed in the media, but Biswas downplays it. He would rather emphasise the importance of his faith, divorced from electoral politics: “It is our road to liberation. It allowed us to pray, to live with dignity and to educate ourselves. I have worked all my life to spread the ideals of Harichand and Guruchand Thakur. My grandchildren are also working with the Matua Mahasangha,” he says. These sentiments are echoed by a local shopkeeper, who refuses to be named. He looks up to the Thakurbari for instructions on life and living, but doesn’t like the way family members have politicised themselves. But the Matuas have a long tradition of political involvement. Pramatha Ranjan was a member of the Congress party. Another Namasudra leader, Jogendranath Mandal (1904-1968), established the Bengal branch of the Scheduled Castes Federation with Ambedkar in the 1940s to fight for Dalit rights. The dilution of the rationalistic, reformist traditions of the Matua movement is one of the reasons why some Namasudras of Bengal are unwilling to see themselves as Matua today. Byapari, who wrote Matua Ek Mukti Senar Naam (‘Matua, the Name of a Liberation Army’), and is Trinamool Congress’s candidate from Balagarh in Hooghly district this year, says that he sees no hope in the movement any more. “What is the science behind rolling on the ground? Why should a leader from a community in which people don’t get two square meals be bathed in milk? The movement has fallen into the trap of faith, moving away from science and rational questioning. Every time that happens, people will exploit you, whether they represent political powers or the caste powers that you freed yourself from,” he says.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Beating the virus||The second wave has taken even our wise rulers by surprise. Most people I know are either confused, terrified, or both. They have many questions on how to defeat the coronavirus. But there’s no one place with all the answers. So, in the larger public interest, I’m sharing below the top five most effective strategies to beat the virus. If you follow them diligently, I can guarantee 110% that you won’t die of COVID-19 — at least not officially. So, here goes:  1. Don’t catch COVID-19:This may seem obvious but it’s the most powerful strategy to avoid dying of COVID-19. I know people keep saying, ‘Don’t attend mass gatherings’. My advice: Ignore these fear-mongers. I know someone who attended a series of mass gatherings, including a family wedding on his way to an election rally on his way to his funeral. He is in complete isolation now — can’t reach him either on phone or Ouija Board — and more important, he’s fully asymptomatic.  2. Boost your Immunity:Surviving COVID-19 requires an invincible immune system. There are many Ayurveda and Maserati remedies that can boost your immunity from zero to 100 in less than four seconds. The basic idea is simple: if you move faster than a coronavirus, it can never catch you. The best immunity booster combines the immunity elements of Ayurveda with the booster elements of a Maserati Biturbo V8. Follow the following regimen daily for a turbo-charged immunity:  a. Take a pot of warm water and add to it 10 mg Chyawanprash, 5 mg haldi (turmeric), 7 mg jeera (cumin), 8 mg dhaniya (coriander), 4.5 mg garlic, 8 mg tulsi (basil), 3 mg dalchini (cinnamon), 6.3 mg kalimirch (black pepper), 8 mg dry ginger, 11 mg raisin, and 12.74 mg jaggery. Then transfer the contents into a mug and pound them into a paste. While pounding, don’t break the mug.  b. Once the paste is ready, add 15 ml of double toned cow’s milk or single-toned tiger’s milk, depending on whichever is your favourite animal. Then pour the entire mixture into a beaker and heat it on a Bunsen burner. Wait till boiling point, then plunge into ice — the beaker, not you. Then take the beaker out of the ice and pour the mixture into a tall (but not too tall) glass coated with sambar powder.  c. Drink seven-eighths of the mixture in six gulps of equal volume. To the remaining one-eighth of the mixture, add one table (I prefer the study table but dining table or bar table also okay) spoon of sesame oil, one soup (tomato soup or lentil soup are recommended but avoid lizard leg soup) spoon of ghee, three pudina (mint) leaves, and 13 ajwain (caraway seeds). Do not drink this mixture but swish in the mouth (12 times clockwise and 24 times anti-clockwise) for three minutes and spit it off followed by a warm water rinse.  d. Rest for two minutes after above-mentioned rinse, then take 15 mg of lavang (clove) powder and mix it with 45 mg of freshly generated cow dung. Apply this mixture in both the nostrils and breathe normally 45 times. After this, get into any Maserati with a Biturbo V8 engine and drive fast with the windows open. If you don’t have a Maserati physically available, use an imaginary one.  3. Breathe less oxygen:Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we end up COVID-positive. So it’s best to be prepared for the worst. In India, your chances of survival are inversely proportional to your need for oxygen. So, my advice: train your body to get by on less and less oxygen until you wake up one morning transformed into a giant anaerobic organism. But how does one train to become anaerobic? You know the answer: Pranayama. Doing Namoshah-Shahnamo pranayama (similar to Anulom-Vilom pranayama but performed facing the direction of 7, Lok Kalyan Marg) every morning will eliminate oxygen dependency and make your lungs 110% atma nirbhar.  4. Don’t vote for the virus:By all accounts, the second wave of 2021 is much bigger than the waves of 2014 and 2019. Sources tell me the coronavirus may capitalise on its unprecedented popularity in India by standing for elections. I know you might vote for it out of sheer habit of voting for a virus. My advice: don’t. I agree it’s not the virus’s fault that India doesn’t have enough oxygen or hospital beds or vaccines or common sense. And it’s true the virus has so far spared you. But I wouldn’t recommend needlessly stress-testing your immunity.  5. Think of nation’s image:If, despite everything, COVID-19 routs your immune system in straight sets, be gracious about it. Don’t be selfish and make your death all about yourself. Think of how bad it will look if India’s COVID mortality rises some more because of you. So, my last and final advice: make sure your death certificate says nothing about COVID-19. Instead, it can say something neutral, like, ‘Cardiac arrested under provisions of UAPA’.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The first big byte||The year 2021 marks the 50th anniversary of the manufacture of the first digital computer in India. After being indigenously developed at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in 1969, the computer, TDC-12, was made by Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. (ECIL) in Hyderabad in 1971. The efforts put in by ECIL in hardware and software development while bringing out a series of digital computers subsequently were phenomenal and laid the foundations for India’s computer industry. Today, if the world sees India as a great source of expertise in information technology, it is undoubtedly because of the country’s champion technocrats who proved their worth. Generally one tends to look at, and admire, only the superstructures of the now-available wealth of IT skills, but fails often to recognise and respect the foundations laid by the visionaries in the early periods. The evolution can be categorised in three phases. During Phase 1, the first set of digital computers was designed, and development models were made operational in R&D institutes such as the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). The development model TIFRAC was formally commissioned in 1960. Computer-educated manpower was limited in India till the mid-1980s. Probably this could be one of the reasons such endeavours did not trigger the computer industry in India. During Phase 2, the industry took roots and gave confidence to the country about the competence and potential of its people. During those days, when even a radio was manufactured under foreign collaboration, it was unthinkable to manufacture digital computers based on local designs. The efforts required to convert the development know-how of an R&D model into manufacture-worthy know-how were huge. The credit of initiating manufacture based on indigenous development goes to stalwarts like A.S. Rao and S. Srikantan. Dr. Srikantan proposed to develop a 12-bit digital computer at BARC during 1964. The Trombay Digital Computer, or TDC-12, was inaugurated by Vikram Sarabhai on January 21, 1969.  During the late 1970s, when private industry started manufacturing digital computers in India, the ECIL developed a variety of application-specific hardware and software. The ECIL has been the first in many such application areas. It introduced computers in the LIC in 1981.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||All in a rat’s life||There they go again: blaming us rats for everything. The other day, I heard the old man living in my flat read out to a visiting friend from his computer: “U.P. cops blame rats for missing cartons of seized liquor from police station, case filed.” Both the man and his friend guffawed. And the friend said, “Yes, it is always rats and mice at the root of everything, or at least so we think. At any rate they are always at the receiving end! Remember the Panchatantra fable where rats are said to have eaten up a trader’s iron weights and balances in safe storage?” I bristled in my dark corner. Every rat child knows the Panchatantra story, which it has heard from its mother. That is how the child learns about human duplicity. I remember hearing it from my mother: A merchant goes bankrupt. He decides to embark on a long journey. Before leaving, he gives his stock of iron scales and weights to a merchant friend for safe keeping. Years later the man is back and asks his friend for the return of his scales and weights. “Sorry, I don’t have them any more,” says the friend. “They were eaten by rats.” The man, to borrow a rather derogatory phrase from the human language, smells a rat. “I understand,” he tells his friend. “By the way,” he continues, “can you lend me the services of your boy for the day?” The friend agrees. The man takes the boy and hides him in a cave. In the evening he goes to his friend and tells him the boy had been picked up by an eagle and carried off to god knows where. The friend goes to the king and complains. The king summons the man and questions him. “Your majesty, such things can happen in a country where rats eat iron scales and weights,” he says. But that is not the rat child’s favourite bedtime story. That honour goes to The Pied Piper of Hamelin . True, the Piper lures all the rats in town to the Weser river nearby and drowns them. Sad indeed! But again human duplicity asserts itself and the civic authorities do not pay the piper the promised sum. I don’t know where the country U.P. is or who is its king. I hope he will punish the real “rats” and save our name. I hope the man in my flat will somehow get to know of it and regale my children with another good bedtime story.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||We are the hashtag gen||Somewhere in No One Is Talking About This, Patricia Lockwood says, “...when a dog runs to you and nudges against your hand for love and you say automatically, I know, I know, what else are you talking about except the world?” We are all dogs reaching out to the outstretched hand that is this incredible book. The first novel by the American poet and essayist is a whirlwind tour of her pain, madness, and insight gained. Reading it, one can only marvel, nod along, and say, “I know, I know.” Rabbit hole The novel’s nameless protagonist is a writer feted for her viral tweets who now travels the world delivering talks. The first part reads like an extended Twitterfeed composed of jokes, musings, stories, notes, reflections, punctuated with commentary. It’s a stumble into the rabbit hole of a whole gamut of concerns — relationships, clothes, history, mothers using eggplant emojis wrong, and more. The prose is fragmented, outrageous, polarising, incisive, and designed to go viral.  Pondering and mimicking the never-ending barrage of social media feeds, Lockwood’s protagonist asks, “Why were we all writing like this now? Because a new kind of connection had to be made, and blink, synapse, little space-between was the only way to make it. Or because, and this was more frightening, it was the way the portal wrote.” The “portal” is the protagonist’s name for the Internet, a melting pot where, once upon a time, you went to be yourself, and which is now turning each of us into a homogenised version of one another. Lockwood divides the collective online mind into two hemispheres — one which has never been to college and the other a product of privileged institutions, which can only be described as a “bubble”. Each faction remains convinced that they alone know the truth. Disarmingly honest The second part is decidedly offline, as the writer is jolted back to reality when her pregnant sister’s unborn child is diagnosed in utero with Proteus Syndrome, a rare one-in-a-billion disorder that causes an overgrowth of skin and bone. Lockwood chronicles in moving detail the struggle of raising a child who, in all probability, will die soon. Following that is a disarmingly honest, unabashed series of musings on family, love, relationships, and being a modern woman. While discussing the last topic, she traces how women have progressed from foot binding, teeth polishing to rubbing snail mucus on their face — all for the sake of beauty, acceptability. Women today freely chose their fetters — “paints, polishes, and waist trainers” — while pitying women of the past. Lockwood flits effortlessly between the hilarious, sleazy, graceful, and radiant. There is such a strong clarity in her prose that her words cut deep. While the first half seems cynical and distant, the second is pure, tender emotion. It is as if the Coen brothers decided to make a rom-com. The title of the book is a revelation and once it explodes, one realises that the book could be called nothing else. In a single novel, Lockwood goes from observing our world as a pale blue dot from the moon to zooming in into the workings of a particular family. Like a magician, she ties up contraries — the macro and the micro, cynicism and hope, the tragic and the ludicrous — making the novel a beautiful, brilliant read. The reviewer is a freelance writer and illustrator.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Reimagining the horse and its unique place in Indian history||Yashaswini Chandra’s The Tale of the Horse: A History of India on Horseback is a charming book, both in its broad strokes as well as details. From the start Chandra’s passion for the horse as a “sentient being” is clear, but it is not a romanticised affair. And though it is perhaps difficult to separate horses from tales of kings and aristocrats — not least because much visual material featuring them is courtly in origin — there is a conscious effort to move beyond elite quarters and recognise the role of the horse in making communities, economies, identities, sport, and in challenging gender stereotypes. This last extends even to the treatment of male and female mounts: while one might presume that warriors’ standard preference was for stallions, communities such as the Rajputs, we learn, “did not share in the prejudice against mares”. On the contrary, their folklore reveals a fond attachment for mares, who in some stories join their affectionate human masters in the afterlife.    Large canvas   Chandra begins the book by delving into mythology to locate the horse in Sanskrit lore, moving thereafter into the historical space, down to the Raj. In the process she also progressively narrows a large canvas into a geographically and culturally compact one centred on Rajasthan. The mythological section features interesting details — we read, for instance, that the horse is mentioned a great deal more than the cow in the Rig Veda — while the historical section highlights the travails of the animal itself as a transactional commodity. As many as 11,000 Persian horses could be imported into India in a single batch, but not all made it. On arduous maritime routes, horses regularly died, and their bodies were thrown overboard. Meanwhile, to prove to buyers in India that the merchants had indeed set out with the originally agreed number, the dead horses’ tails were preserved, allowing the seller to claim full fees. Chandra deploys dynamics of the horse trade to demonstrate how politics could be shaped by merchants in this period, not to speak of cultural attitudes. On the one hand it became general wisdom that good horses did not thrive in India’s climate — a convenient excuse, she argues, given that it passed off enervation born of the animals’ painful journeys to the subcontinent, to the recipient’s environment instead. Similarly, while local breeds were smart (with Marathas achieving a great deal on “desi” mounts), it soon became a given that prestigious horses were foreign. This led not only to a caste system of sorts (the Arab was ranked higher than the Turki, with one kind of horse even named “Tattu”, now a favourite slur among schoolboys), it also gave merchants immense power — think of Mahmud Gawan or Ali Asker. Another compelling element in the book is its emphasis on the horse’s role in social formations. Social being Chandra notes that the identification of the horse with specific communities has its own history. Horses are integral today to the Rajput self image, for example, but this evolved relatively late, around the 15th century. The elite preoccupation with horses also trickled down to non-elite groups: leatherworking castes, thus, developed sub-groups that were experts at saddle-making. Chandra’s notes on women and the horse are also interesting. While art shows courtly women riding in leisurely settings, she notes their role in battle, travel, and even survival. The thought of Akbar’s heavily pregnant mother on horseback, at one point having to survive on horse meat cooked in a helmet, is telling. Overall, by lucidly combining her deep interest with academic themes, Chandra leaves us having learned several new things through the book. My only grievance is that with its emphasis on Rajasthan, the Deccan and the south are somewhat neglected — and not because the horse was less significant in these parts — though perhaps that would have required a longer book.

He based it on the projection by Ptolemy and the discoveries of Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci and others. Waldseemüller was one of the first to depict thea water body that which would later on be recogniszed as the Pacific Ocean, but he was the first to use the name of a particular continent. Which continent is referred to by name for the first time in the Waldseemüller map? 2 Born on April 25, 1599, Oliver Cromwell was a political and military leader who as a subordinate commander and later commander-in-chief led successful efforts to remove the monarchy in his country. He oversaw two wars in which more than 1,80,000 people lost their lives — the bloodiest war in that country’s history . He later ruled for five years as Lord Protector. A Parliament met on April 25 25, 1660, two years after Cromwell’s death, and on May 8 voted to restore the monarchy. By what name are these two wars known? 3 On April 25 1719, Daniel, an English trader and journalist, published his novel, which is widely regarded as the very first English novel and one of the most translated titles. He went on to write more than 300 works, but none matched this book in popularity. The book, though fictional, is based on the true story of a Scottish castaway called Alexander Selkirk who lived on an island on the Pacific for four years. What book is this and what is Daniel’s full name? 4 On April 25, 1886, this gentleman opened his practice at Rathausstrasse 7, Vienna.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Notes from Sydkyst||For months I remained holed inside, fearful of COVID-19. Clipped were my wings, as I couldn’t travel to any exotic destination during the Christmas break. However, my feet remained itchy and I started exploring — at first studying my neighbourhood with depth and respect I hadn’t shown before. Gradually, however, I started pushing my boundaries. I live in the southern part of Sweden, in the city of Malmö that neighbours Denmark. As I ran out of options to explore in my immediate vicinity, I spoke to my Danish friends to understand what else Denmark has to offer besides its beautiful capital city, Copenhagen, which I had visited several times. The southern coast of Denmark — or Sydkyst, as it’s more commonly called — popped up as a strong recommendation. I hadn’t been to this part of Denmark before, and soon enough I hopped into my car to take a road trip to Sydkyst. It’s strange that travellers go around the world chasing adventures and experiences, while at times the most amazing discoveries lie next door. While I had heard this maxim many times, I had thought myself immune to it. Till only this far though. Sydkyst is home to Stevns Klint, which bears testimony to the impact of the Chicxulub meteorite. This meteorite impacted earth approximately 67 million years ago, and ended roughly 70% of life on the planet . It is believed to be the primary cause of the extinction of dinosaurs. Though the actual impact site is off the coast of Mexico, Stevns Klint harbours exceptional evidence of the impact within a thin visible reddish layer of iridium captured between the limestone rocks. Such a large quantity of iridium is usually not found on earth, and it is postulated to have come from outer space via the meteorite. Stevns Klint was accorded UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 2014. A 20-minute drive from Stevns Klint took me to the Faxe limestone quarry. 65 million years ago, this quarry was the bottom of an ocean where sharks, squid and crocodiles swam around. Back then, this part of Denmark was a deep-sea bottom, where corals slowly built up a reef. Now the exposed parts of the reef make for a treasure box of fossils. The limestone quarry therefore contains remains of all these creatures — for instance, shark teeth, crab shields and mussel shells from 65 million years ago — caught in the coral. Fossil hunt The quarry is open for anyone who wants to try their luck to scout these fossils. I took a walk there and stumbled across a fossil with rounding corals branching into one another. In between its tentacles was caught a fossilised snail from millions of years ago. Later, I asked the museum next door what happens when visitors stumble across these fossils while walking around the quarry. “Well, if you wish, you can keep them,” the lady told me with a smile, “We even lend out chisels and hammers to children who wish to go fossil hunting. We have so many of them here and doesn’t this make a great learning opportunity!” It does, I exclaimed, excited that I could take home the prized fossil that I had found myself. That fossilised coral sits on my working desk as I write this story. It also serves as reminder that while travelling is about exploring, it doesn’t necessarily demand that we must go on a quest far off. Many a treasure lies around us, and at times, we need only dig where we stand.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Surviving war||The picture of a woman with cropped hair, attired in camouflage shirt and trousers, and wielding a gun, can symbolise the ultimate dream of empowerment. More so if the woman is part of an armed liberation struggle. Often invoked in the depiction of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka, the image of a Tamil militant woman challenged some prevalent social norms, but could it overturn the entrenched biases in society? Meena Kandasamy’s The Orders Were to Rape You: Tigresses in the Tamil Eelam Struggle , is in part an essay, with narratives of three Tamil women — the wife of an LTTE fighter, a female combatant from the LTTE, and the author herself. Its second part is a collection of resistance poems by female guerrillas and militants. Drawing upon interviews for a documentary project that did not materialise, Kandasamy records the gruesome experiences recounted by the two survivors of war in chilling first-person accounts. She meets them in Malaysia and Indonesia in 2013, just four years after the war ended. Struggle to survive They are not grateful to be alive, after facing recurring torture and sexual violence at camps and “rehabilitation” centres, and unceasing judgement by their own people following their release. The woman married to the LTTE member had no direct connection with the movement, but had to cope with regular questioning, harassment, and torture by military personnel. She speaks of having contemplated death by suicide but decided against it for the sake of her child. The account of the Tamil Tigress, of being repeatedly raped by soldiers and treated like a trophy of war, is gut-wrenching. The southern Sinhala psyche cannot accept that their “war hero” engaged in a “humanitarian operation” could unleash sexual violence. That rape was used as a weapon of war, as a stamp of domination is rejected in disbelief by the people, and categorically denied by the state. The women’s accounts point readers to the very male, violent core of the military, which asserted its “heroism” by targeting Tamil women with abject brutality and perversion. Equally distressing, as the former combatant recounts, is Tamil society’s cruel gaze on women like her, who are part of the very movement it venerates. If the Sinhalese army sought to crush their resolve and resilience, the Tamils whose liberation they fought for virtually banished them. Unquestioning embrace Early in the book, Kandasamy declares her political affinity to and emotional investment in the Tamil self-determination struggle. Her crisp and vivid prose, though highly readable, centres too much on herself, at times overshadowing the women’s stories. She admits that meeting a female Tiger in flesh broke her own “naïve carnivalization of war”, and “shattered” her image of female militancy, as liberated, gun-wielding women embodying empowerment. But curiously, the women’s testimonies notwithstanding, Kandasamy does not question her own embrace of Tamil nationalism. On the other hand, in her autobiographical Oru Koorvaalin Nizhalil , Thamilini, who led the women’s political wing of the LTTE, offers an insider’s account of how the movement that she once saw as the agent of women’s liberation, in fact regulated women’s desires, sexuality, and bodies. Much like Kandasamy’s interviewees, she holds a mirror to Tamil society, which so readily rejected and stigmatised women like herself who fought for the cause, while extolling the LTTE. The accounts of the ex-combatant and the wife of a militant in Kandasamy’s essay lay bare the enduring patriarchal character, sexism, and moral policing in Tamil society. But Kandasamy’s stubbornly romantic rather than critical view of Tamil nationalism falls short in its reckoning of women’s emancipation in the Tamil struggle.

In their spry morning greeting, I spy a hint of superiority. Yesterday, I dreamt that my dead grandmother was laughing at me from above saying “Even I’m vaccinated, you poor sod, why weren’t you born a few years earlier?” To compensate, I recently went to a nearby parlour and got a COVID-19 virus tattoo (spikes and all) on my left bicep, hoping for the jab to be piercingly symbolic when my turn comes. But now I’ve started binge-eating due to pandemic panic, and my distended tattoo resembles not the virus but the buttocks of a fat politician who has fallen on a thorny bush. I am depressed. How can I alleviate my envy and anxiety? — Possessed of Keen Envy   Dear POKE,  Patience, dear heart, patience. See, already since you have sent me mail, government has announced vaccines for everybody above 18. Just you have to shell out Rs. 400 and get the coveted jab at nearest clinic. Of course, vaccine might not be available. Just like oxygen and Ramdevsviral and other pandemic fighting agents are not available. But not to worry. If you wait two-three years, government is saying vaccine will be available even in all the potti kadais because by then population would have halved and there will be plentiful supply for one and all. You can take it at that time. They might even hold another utsav.  But if you are impatient and filled with competition spirit against aged parents, then my dear boy, you must Use Influence and Pull Strings. That is what I did. I am, of course, a bit young for vaccine but I used my Sway in Powerful Places to get an out-of-turn shot. Of course, Visvesvaran from 13B got jealous and he is going about telling everyone that the only string I pulled was the one holding my birth certificate together, but what does he think? We don’t know about the relationship between his moustache and one product that comes in tubes? Anyway, even if you can manage one ex-Minister or MLA type, it will do. See how nicely 22-year-old former chief minister’s nephew in Maharashtra has already finished getting two doses? If you can’t display that kind of chutzpah, then your full life you will only be getting bad tattoos and nothing else. But waiting for May 1 is not such a bad idea — I hear that you have a good chance of meeting many young stars like Rayka and Hayma in the queue on that day. One more thing, even if you forget your water-bottle or Aadhaar card, never forget your phone on D-Day. Because after the shot, the most important antidote is to take one selfie immediately. Other people pose with full family, but your parents won’t be there with you, so you can pose next to flowerpot or lamppost. For best results, wear mask and expose bicep. The effect of the vaccine will last longer with selfie than without. I can see that you are a creative person like me. Once you become less fat, probably your tattoo will look good again. Only one addition I am going to suggest. Why not add one line below the spikes that says ‘Jabless in India’. There is a double advantage in this. Until you get vaccine, it can remain like this. Then, after vaccine, you can change ‘Jabless’ to ‘Jobless’ — minor and easy correction only. This new line promises to be a good signature tune for long time to come. — AA  agony.akka@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/get-jab-satisfaction/article34405438.ece

South considered ducking but, on a bad day, East would shift to a club and give West a club ruff for down one and he would have some ‘splainin’ to do. South won with his ace and was happy to see West follow suit. What about the clubs? All the warning signs were there about a possible 4-0 split.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||‘India may have 8–10 lakh cases a day in mid-May’||With the daily infections accelerating at a blazing speed to reach 3,45,103 on April 23, and the daily deaths stubbornly remaining above 2,000 and rising since April 20, the second wave is growing at an alarming rate resulting in health-care facilities bursting at the seams. The second wave is expected to peak in May.Bhramar Mukherjee,Professor of Epidemiology at University of Michigan in an email says there will be 8–10 lakhs cases a day in mid-May when it peaks, and 4,500 deaths around May 23. Edited excerpts:  Since April 1, the number of daily cases has been accelerating at a rapid speed. Can it be due to any reason other than more infectious variants? We have to be cautious here. Causality can sometimes be established by elimination of alternative explanations. Let us try that argument here: We all agree that it is not a single factor but a confluence of different factors all coinciding to create the perfect transmission inferno in India. There was lack of COVID-appropriate behaviour at a time when the country was fully reopening. We were complacent with a false sense of security, thinking we have conquered COVID-19. Instead of anticipating the silent footsteps of this insidious virus, we let it run wild without any surveillance. Even when we saw the uptick in mid-February, we were dismissive and continued with data denial. The nonchalance, negligence, complacency and hubris cannot be ignored. Colossal mistakes were made by not accelerating vaccination when the virus curve was at its nadir. Even with all of those features factored in, and allowing for a certain rate of re-infection consistent with existing literature (84% protection from past infections at seven months), the growth rate that we are seeing with cases growing by 8-fold, deaths increasing by 9-fold, and eight States having a reproduction number (R0) around 2 cannot be adequately explained without entertaining the possibility of an intrinsically more transmissible variant. We have data now from different Indian States showing that the double mutant or the U.K. variant have quickly become dominant strains in Maharashtra or Punjab for example. The increasing number of reports of cluster/family level infections also point to this hypothesis. However, without proper sequencing data over geography and time, and proper epidemiological investigations, this evidence is still circumstantial. Even if the rise is due to new highly transmissive variants, why are we seeing a sudden acceleration since April 1? This is the nature of exponential growth, the virus creeps in silently and explodes astronomically. The rate parameter of the growth is startling, but the pattern is explainable. This is a feature of the last surges for example in the U.S. and U.K. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, India saw a similar pattern. We started imposing lockdowns only recently to slow down transmission. Before then we were having not one or two isolated superspreader events but a continuous flow of numerous superspreader events. The reproduction number is over 2.5 in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and above 2 in Delhi, Rajasthan and West Bengal for a few days now. At this high reproduction number, are these States reporting the expected daily cases? Our papers have consistently estimated underreporting factors for reporting cases nationally around 10–20. The IHME [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation] model is projecting 45 lakhs daily new infections today in India, pointing to a daily underreporting factor of about 15. This factor widely varies across States. Even with inaccurate numbers the relative trends are clear. From all I know, the reality on the ground is much starker than what the numbers show. I would like to reiterate that suppressing the truth or having artificially deflated numbers does not help anyone. It hinders prudent policymaking, prevents estimating true healthcare needs or need for oxygen supply/ICU beds accurately. This pandemic has turned into this confusing policy pandemonium partially because the data and science have not been presented transparently to the public. Based on the high reproduction number in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat for days, are we seeing the expected number of deaths now? We have estimated death underreporting by a factor of 2–5 in the first wave. Now with the surge, the reporting infrastructure has probably eclipsed dramatically. So I expect the underreporting of deaths to be massive right now. All reports from burial grounds and crematoriums strongly suggest this possibility. The fact is, we have a relative idea of the growth but we have no idea about the absolute numbers. I tell my students that this India modelling exercise is to teach them to adopt best statistical practices with the worst possible data. Finally, even if we believe the reported death numbers, the IHME is projecting 6,64,000 reported deaths by August 1 for India. Misclassification of COVID-19 deaths and attributing the cause of death to other comorbidities has happened to some extent in every country. But in India, medical reporting of deaths and cause of deaths is already a very porous system. So it is challenging to do such calculation reliably to quantify COVID-related fatalities in an indirect way. The data deficient infrastructure in India is really hurting us right now. The seven-day average test positivity rate (TPR) nationally on April 23 was 18.5%. Delhi (30.5%), Chhattisgarh (30.1%), Maharashtra (24.6%), Madhya Pradesh (23.8%), Andhra Pradesh (22%) and West Bengal (20.4%) are reporting higher TPR than the national average. Are the daily fresh cases reported from these States in concordance with the test positivity rate? These high levels of TPR can capture both increasing prevalence or limited testing. I think in this case it is a combination of both and impossible to unconfound one from the other. Again, I think all arrows point that cases are severely underreported. Why are we seeing low TPR in Uttar Pradesh (12.5%), despite the number of tests done being less than in Maharashtra? What are the reasons for this? You are asking me about a ratio where I neither believe the reported numerator nor the denominator. It could be that patients with obvious COVID-19 symptoms are not even being tested. Selection bias in testing can distort the numbers you get. We have worked on this issue of selective testing. I would like to add that some RT-PCR tests have a high false negative and they may not have the same accuracy to detect new variants if they are optimised for the original strain. You had tweeted saying “Uttar Pradesh’s growth in spread is alarming. Our models are failing at this high rate of growth to come up with sensible predictions”. Is the growth in spread alarming only in Uttar Pradesh? No, not just Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Delhi are on top of my “high alert” list. Then comes Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat, and Karnataka. Kerala is again starting to look worrisome. I feel West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Kerala will need lockdown at some point. Odisha and Assam also have a high R0 [reproduction number] value but the projected number of total cases is lower. When do you think the second wave in India will peak and what will be the daily fresh cases reported at the time it peaks nationally? All models are projecting a peak for infections in May right now. Deaths will be a lagged indicator by 7–10 days. The IHME is projecting early-May and we are projecting mid-May for infections to peak. We are projecting reported cases at 8–10 lakhs a day with 4,500 deaths around May 23 when deaths peak. IHME predicts about 50 lakh infections (reported plus unreported) and 5,500 deaths at the peak of the two curves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/india-may-have-810-lakh-cases-a-day-in-mid-may/article34404931.ece
25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||IISc teams develop oxygen concentrators, ventilators||With the setting in of the second wave of covid-19, there is round the corner, a growth in the need for ventilators and related interventions. While hospital ICU beds do come with ventilators, makeshift ones will not be so, hence the need. Indian Institute of Science researchers have come up with several non-pharmaceutical interventions such as ICU ventilators, oxygen supply manifolds and oxygen concentrators which will each satisfy different sets of needs.  Low-cost solutions In 2020, when the pandemic set in within India, Sushobhan Avasthi, Associate Professor with Centre for Nanoscience and Engineering and his team wanted to build low-cost ventilators. But as the project evolved, they realised that what was needed was a more sophisticated device that could sense when the patients were able to breathe on their own, and then wean them off gently so that they could become independent again. “In September we were ready with the D3 edition of smart ventilators that were good enough to be used in the ICU,” says Dr Avasthi. They teamed up with the company Vasmed with an aim to produce these ventilators for the market. “These would have cost about 1.5 lakh rupees,” says Anoop Varghese, COO of Vasmed, pegging the cost at approximately a third of the price of commercially available ones. The group worked with Dr Justin Aryabhata Gopaldas, of the Manipal Hospital, Bangalore, to get inputs and feedback as they developed the devices. “There were many doctors involved initially, perhaps it was my familiarity with physics that helped. We discussed many things, for example, when a breath was taken what kinds of waves were formed,” says Dr Gopaldas. However, the effort did not see fruition during the first wave. Vasmed needed the pull of the market to be able to finance a complete testing and certification of the module. No prior experience The group then also started looking out for other interventions that would be useful in this juncture. They came up with the idea of the oxygen supply manifold, which is a system using which oxygen may be supplied to several patients from a central source and the amount of oxygen supplied may be adjusted. “We started this project with zero experience in medical devices, let alone a critical one like a ventilator… Prof. Prosenjit Sen developed the touchscreen user interface. Prof. Saurabh Chandorkar designed the embedded system – the brain of the ventilator. Prof. Srinivasan Raghavan oversaw the development of the pneumatics. Most crucial of all was the enthusiasm of our students, specifically Harshvardhan Gupta and Ankit Rao,” says Dr Avasthi in recollection.  Sturdy concentrator Meanwhile, in the Materials Engineering lab, efforts were on to produce an oxygen concentrator. Ambient air contains about 70% nitrogen and about 28% oxygen and other gases; the work of a concentrator is to separate the oxygen and collect air enriched with oxygen to the patient. “By August 2020 we had the third generation of the concentrator ready. It worked to concentrate more than 90% in five litres and 80% in ten litres. Not just this, it could run non-stop for months together without getting heated up,” says Praveen Ramamurthy, who led the effort. By September they had the system ready, but interest had died down. “In the last couple of weeks, again I have been getting many mails and calls enquiring about this,” says Dr Ramamurthy. Certification for safety The device has the advantage that it can pump the data into the cloud, which can be shared with a doctor for monitoring use. The group is going to apply for a certification which will test for electrical and pressure safety and also biocompatibility. They expect it will take about two weeks to obtain. Both the oxygen supply manifold and the oxygen concentrator are very much the need of the hour, the group feels, and can be manufactured easily.   By August 2020 we had the third generation of the concentrator ready. It worked to concentrate more than 90% in five litres and 80% in ten litres.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Groundwater depletion may reduce winter cropping intensity by 20% in India||India is the second-largest producer of wheat in the world, with over 30 million hectares in the country dedicated to producing this crop. But with severe groundwater depletion, the cropping intensity or the amount of land planted in the winter season may decrease by up to 20% by 2025, notes a new paper. Some of the important winter crops are wheat, barley, mustard and peas. The international team studied India’s three main irrigation types on winter cropped areas: dug wells, tube wells, canals, and also analysed the groundwater data from the Central Ground Water Board. They found that 13% of the villages in which farmers plant a winter crop are located in critically water-depleted regions. The team writes that these villages may lose 68% of their cropped area in future if access to all groundwater irrigation is lost. The results suggest that these losses will largely occur in northwest and central India. Alternative sources The team then looked at canals to understand if they can be promoted as an alternative irrigation source and as an adaptation strategy to falling groundwater tables. But the results showed that “switching to canal irrigation has limited adaptation potential at the national scale. We find that even if all regions that are currently using depleted groundwater for irrigation will switch to using canal irrigation, cropping intensity may decline by 7% nationally,” notes the paper published in Science Advances.  When asked what new or additional adaptation strategies can be implemented, corresponding author Meha Jain explains: “We can conjecture based on other literature and say that adoption of water-saving technologies like a sprinkler, drip irrigation and maybe switching to less water-intensive crops may help use the limited groundwater resources more effectively,” She is from the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan. Her team is now trying to understand how groundwater depletion has already reduced yields and cropped areas in India over the last 20 years, and also how climate change may affect the future availability of groundwater resources.  Unsuited soils Balwinder Singh from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, New Delhi, explains more about the problems wheat farmers face in our country. “There are several first-generation (productivity) and second-generation (sustainability) problems. In the green revolution era, policy-supported environment led to a large increase in rice cultivation in northwestern India mainly in Punjab and Haryana which are ecologically less suitable for rice cultivation due to predominantly light soils.” He explains that this policy-supported intensive agriculture led to unsustainable groundwater use for irrigation and in turn groundwater scarcity. There was also post-harvest residue burning to make way for the timely sowing of wheat. He is one of the authors of the paper. Poor infrastructure He adds that there are enough groundwater resources supported with higher monsoon rainfall in eastern Indian states like Bihar. But due to lack of enough irrigation infrastructure, farmers are not able to make use of natural resources there. “So we need better policies in eastern India to expand the irrigation and thus increase agriculture productivity. This will also release some pressure from northwestern Indian states,” he concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/groundwater-depletion-may-reduce-winter-cropping-intensity-by-20-in-india/article34404925.ece

The Dragon capsule docked autonomously with the orbiting outpost 420 kilometres above the Indian Ocean, a day after launching from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. The new arrivals – representing the U.S., France and Japan – will spend six months at the space station. They’ll replace four astronauts who will return to Earth in their own Dragon capsule Wednesday. It was the first time two SpaceX crew Dragons were parked there at the same time – practically side by side. Third crew flight Although this was SpaceX’s third crew flight for NASA, it was the first to use a vehicle that’s flown before. The Dragon capsule was used for Space’'s first crew launch last May, while the Falcon rocket soaring Friday hoisted crew two in November. Fully automated NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur – the commander and pilot of the arriving Dragon – monitored their capsule’s flat screen computers as the space station loomed ever larger. They could have taken control if necessary, but the autonomous system did its job, much like a self-driving car. Also checking into the space station: France’s Thomas Pesquet and Japan's Akihiko Hoshide. Both have lived there before, as has Kimbrough. It was the first station visit for Megan McArthur. For the next four days, the space station will be home to 11 astronauts, just shy of the record of 13 set during NASA's space shuttle era.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/old-spacex-capsule-delivers-new-crew-to-space-station/article34404929.ece

Every year a stunning and colourful image of India does the rounds on Diwali, with claims that it was taken from space. In reality, the image is a composite of several satellite photos, created in 2003 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to highlight population growth in the country. So how do we know if a satellite image is fake or even if it has been used for misinformation? A new study says that there is a lot of this ‘deepfake geography’ happening in recent times and with new and more sophisticated artificial intelligence technologies available today, the problem could grow. To the untrained eye it may be difficult to detect the differences between real and fake images, the researchers point out. To try to identify a “fake,” researchers employed many technical aspects of image processing, such as colour histograms and spatial domains. Bo Zhao, assistant professor of geography at the University of Washington and lead author of the study said in a release that the study’s goal was not to show that geospatial data can be falsified, rather it was to learn how to detect fake images so that geographers can begin to develop the data literacy tools, similar to today’s fact-checking services, for public benefit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/fake-images/article34404926.ece
25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I know I am not boring’||In the two years that she has been in our public consciousness, after the investigative six-part documentary Wild, Wild Country , Sheela Birnstiel has seen polarised opinions of condemnation and sycophancy. “I am a mirror for them. I reflect the other, so what they want to see, they will find in me,” she says, of people’s opinions and questions. “I accept both without judgement. People have a habit of dissecting, so they should have their pleasure, and I know I am not boring.” You see both sides — the demonising and glorification — in the way journalists, social influencers, and celebrities react to the 71-year-old, in a new documentary, Searching for Sheela . Shot by Dharmatic Productions across 22 days, during her visit to India in 2019, the film runs for 58 minutes. It begins and ends with her home in Switzerland, far from the life we saw her live in the previous documentary. In between are scenes from interviews and visits to her old family home in Gujarat — her first trip to India after almost 35 years.  Camera friendly  “My team found it [the movie] lovely,” says Sheela, who watched this movie, unlike the previous one. Shot in an observational style, by a team put together by executive producer Shakun Batra, it documents her navigation through people and places in India. When Batra looked at the rushes, he saw an “audience in need of this idea of redemption from her”. So the film became about examining how “someone like her who is carrying this weight” responds to people’s questions on her past with Osho: of assault, poisoning, wire tapping of which she was convicted in 1984, though now denies. “Some people wear their baggage on their face; I wear the baggage on my shoulders,” she says, in the documentary. In the film she seems, at times, to be laughing at those around her: “I feel like a dulha ,” she says, of the Raw Mango outfit before her interview with Karan Johar. At the event she tells the producer-director-host, “You know, I have bigger scandals than show business.” On a drive in a car she speaks to the camera matter-of-factly: “I didn’t want to become spiritual…enlightened, or learn about meditation. I have no interest in them.” At another time, pragmatic, when they’re in the hills: “Just don’t look down, there’s garbage; look up.” And reflective: “Life is multi-dimensional. There’s no black and white. They have shades of colours, shades of information.” At socialite-entrepreneur Bina Ramani’s residence, she manages to put a slightly overbearing Raghu Rai in his place. And at an event at Gurugram’s The Quorum, she does not react to a bizarre introduction: “Today we have the pleasure of asking her about her crimes, her past, and Osho,” checking, instead, with the team if they’d got some rest. The film doesn’t give answers, but Batra says that wasn’t his job. “My effort is to not try and oversimplify things and to not arrive at answers, because I don’t think I know the answers.” Sheela says she simply accepts how people react to her, even though they are “stagnant”, if all they want to ask her is whether she really did attempt murder. Instead, she wants people to ask about “the love that I feel, I felt, the work I have done”.  Life and love  Love is a constant through all her interviews, but it’s love for Rajneesh, the people she currently lives with, and her parents; she doesn’t speak of her three husbands and her daughter though. “After Rajneesh, I focussed my love on my parents. They suffered my dark days in imprisonment. I wanted to take their pain away, and in love you can take pain away from people,” she says. She also talks about the people with disabilities and those with complex mental illnesses she currently takes care of in her two homes called Matrusaden and Bapusaden. “I live with them, just the way I used to live with Bhagwan’s people in Rajneeshpuram.” Batra, whose forte has been films like Kapoor and Sons and Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu , says this experience has been different because in non-fiction “you arrive at the meaning after you’ve shot it”. In terms of the content, he says it’s difficult to flesh out any person in such a short time, least of all Sheela with her range of experiences. “I can make another six-part series and there will still be questions, because that’s just who she is. She is a person who leaves you with more questions than answers,” says Batra, whose parents were followers of Osho, and who “were not very fond of Sheela…” Even before Wild, Wild Country , Batra had gone to meet Sheela, with questions. Some days before the release of the movie she asked him if he’d found his answer: had he found Sheela? He still finds her an “enigma”. Perhaps the answer lies in Sheela’s own words in an old interview when she was at the height of her fame as Rajneesh’s secretary. In response to a reporter who asks what role she plays, that of Snow White or the wicked witch, she says, “Both.” Searching for Sheelaisnow streaming on Netflix.

25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The ‘replay’ test||Over the years, some 91 films have won the best picture Oscar, and come April 25/26 — depending on which part of the world you’re in — a new winner will be crowned. This isn’t going to be a discussion conjecturing who will lift the statuette this year. Instead, let’s consider which ones we remember. Debates over whether the winners were worthy or not will continue raging as long as there is a medium called cinema and there are Oscars. The winner is decided after members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, more than 10,000 of them this year, vote. Every person’s reaction to a work of art, be it painting, sculpture, music or literature is deeply personal. One woman’s Tom Jones (best picture 1963) may be another man’s My Fair Lady (best picture 1964), as it were. Applying the remembrance test, My Fair Lady is more likely to have instant recall value than Tom Jones . Some best picture winners have stood the recall test of time, like say, Gandhi (1982), or The Silence of the Lambs (1991), but some have not, unfairly. Take Kevin Costner’s epic Dances w ith Wolves, which, deservedly, in my opinion, swept the board at the 1990 Oscars, winning seven statuettes. I watched the film at Singapore’s magnificent Capitol Theatre (now sadly redeveloped) and drank in the vistas. The next day, I went back and watched it again. Today, the film hardly ever gets mentioned and there are some revisionist reviews doing the rounds that are a far cry from the near universal acclaim from when it was released. I pay no heed to the carping and, instead, settle down with my four-hour extended version Blu-ray of the film secure in the knowledge that I am having the last laugh. More recently, there are some best picture winners that have been deservedly forgotten, and not a moment too soon. Take 2017 winner The Shape of Water , for example. What? I hear you say. Exactly. Let us forgive it as an aberration in Guillermo del Toro’s otherwise terrific career. How about 2011 winner The Artist or 2012 champion Argo ? What about them indeed? Do aficionados go back and re-watch them obsessively like they would The Godfather films (1972 and 1974) or Lawrence of Arabia (1962)? Or are they likely to go the way of Gentleman’s Agreement (1947) or Patton (1970) — undeniably impressive films, but just not part of the zeitgeist. How many of you have revisited Driving Miss Daisy (1989) or Ordinary People (1980), hand on heart? It’s anyone’s game this year, despite the impressive number of wins at other awards; especially the BAFTAs Nomadland carries into the ceremony. Whoever wins, is the victor memorable enough? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, if you have access, try the 1944 winner Going My Way . Skip Frank Capra’s 1934 winner It Happened One Night for the 100th time and embrace his 1938 winner You Can’t Take It With You instead. The rewards will be immense — so what if you haven’t heard of it or have forgotten about it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-replay-test/article34405130.ece

This year,Jallikattudid the same, but couldn’t make the final cut. What are we getting wrong? Vetri Maaran weighs in.       Whydo producers spend a lot of money sending a film to the Oscars if it does not have a fighting chance of winning?   Thereputation the Acadamy Awards has garnered over the course of these eight decades is so imposing that every film enthusiast wants the film he likes to win an Oscar. A few days ago, I got a message from an acquaintance saying ifAsuranhad gone to the Oscars it would have won! They feel they know it. In this context of having a brand value, most of our producers want to be part of the race, even if they don’t have a chance. And some of the producers are misinformed. In this day of getting your information online, some fans of certain films that are part of the screening think it’s in the competition and put it out on social media. This year there were more such incidents.   How can a regular film enthusiast spot the difference?  The only official category our films can get in is the Best International Film, erstwhile called the Best Foreign Language Film. That is selected every year by a committee consisting of members of the selecting body — an autonomous body, not functioning under the government. Sometimes if these international films are very impressive to the voting members, they are nominated in other ‘main’ categories as well, like Best Film, which are meant only for films produced or co-produced by American companies. We had the best actor award given to an international film forLife Is Beautifuland theParasitephenomenon happened last year.   For such screenings, do filmmakers have to spend money on promotions as they would if selected as an official entry?  It is unbelievably expensive. The Acadamy will give you one free screening for which very few voting members turn up. You can have around four paid screenings. I’ve forgotten the exact numbers. Most of these happen at boutique screens set up in star hotels. The most-liked are the Soho House screenings, for which you pull a lot of strings. If I remember it right, we paid $17,500 for that screening alone.

Contracting COVID-19 after vaccination is known as breakthrough infection. It has occurred in “a very small number” of people and does not undermine the effectiveness of vaccination, said Dr. Balram Bhargava, Director-General of the ICMR. What is a breakthrough infection? These are infections that occur in people who have been vaccinated. Such cases are not out of the ordinary as the vaccines that have been approved so far the world over are made to protect against disease and not the transmission of the virus. Phase 3 clinical trials conducted before vaccines were approved showed a fairly constant proportion of infections among those vaccinated. In the AstraZeneca trial, for instance, 30 out of 5,807 vaccinated — about 0.5% — were symptomatic and tested positive 14 days after the second shot. Results from the Pfizer phase 3 trial showed that of the 21,720 who got the second dose of the vaccine, eight tested positive for COVID-19, or about 0.03%. Figures as of April 20, from the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), show that there have been 7,157 breakthrough infections reported to the agency so far. Compared to the 87 million Americans who were fully inoculated, this works out to an infection rate of 0.008%, or 8 in 100,000. Further, in those reported infections, there were 88 deaths and 498 hospitalisations. How does India compare with others? According to data presented by Dr. Bhargava, of the 1.7 million people who got a second dose of Covaxin (and thus fully inoculated), 695 tested positive — a rate of 0.04%. Of the 15.7 million who got a second dose of Covishield, 5,014 tested positive, a rate of 0.03%. Covishield has not been tested in an India-specific efficacy trial, and Bharat Biotech, the maker of Covaxin, has not yet published results from its ongoing efficacy trial. So, we do not know — unlike in the case of Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s international trials — how many vaccinated trial participants went on to get COVID-19 after their second dose. That 5,709 people who got a second dose of either vaccine tested positive of the 17 million inoculated persons suggests that 3 people per 10,000 tested positive, which is higher than the rate the CDC is reporting, of 8 in 100,000. Is it rare to get infected even after vaccination? The CDC guidelines on breakthrough infections state that all such reported rates are an undercount. “It is important to note that reported vaccine breakthrough cases will represent an undercount. This surveillance system is passive and relies on voluntary reporting from state health departments which may not be complete. Also, not all real-world breakthrough cases will be identified because of lack of testing. This is particularly true in instances of asymptomatic or mild illness. These surveillance data are a snapshot and help identify patterns and look for signals among vaccine breakthrough cases,” the advisory notes.  For nearly three months after vaccination began in India, the government’s COVID-19 test form, used by state and private laboratories, did not check if those who tested positive had been vaccinated. Dr. Samiran Panda, who heads the Epidemiology Division at the ICMR, toldThe Hinduthat reports on breakthrough infections were collated from the Co-WIN database and were based on self-reporting. “There will no doubt be many more who may have got infected after the second dose but that is expected. It is also likely that only those with significant symptoms might report and those with mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic will not follow up. The message of vaccination is that it protects against disease,” he said. What are the reasons for such infections? Dr. Bhargava said healthcare and frontline workers were getting infected because of their constant high exposure to COVID-19 patients. The other reason he said was due to “highly transmissible new variants”. According to the latest data, over 12.1 million healthcare and frontline workers have got a second dose, as opposed to over 9 million of those above 45 years of age. Laboratory studies for Covaxin on the ‘U.K. variant’ and the Indian variant (B.1.617) suggest that it “effectively neutralises” the virus. However, studies on the AstraZeneca vaccine show that its efficacy is reduced when faced with the U.K. and the South African variant. The CDC data show that there were 88 deaths for 87 million people who were fully inoculated with the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines — this means that one in a million will die from COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated. If those figures are applied to India, it would mean around 800 deaths given our adult population of 800-900 million. Thus, while vaccines indubitably protect against death and disease, they may not be 100% protective.  Healthcare and frontline workers are getting infected even after vaccination, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research, because of their constant high exposure to COVID-19 patients. Also, there are several “highly transmissible new variants”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/chances-of-infection-after-covid-19-vaccination/article34404867.ece
25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Jabs for all adults amid the second wave||The story so far: Since April 1, the number of COVID-19 cases reported daily has been accelerating rapidly in India. On April 21, the country, for the first time, crossed the 3-lakh mark in infections reported in a day, when it saw 3,15,735 cases. On April 20, as many as 2,021 deaths were reported, which further rose to 2,620 on April 23. While Maharashtra is still reporting the most number of cases daily, there has been a slight dip in the last few days. It is early to say if the second wave has peaked in the State. But Mumbai and Pune, the two cities that reported the most cases in the second wave, have been consistently reporting fewer numbers for the last few days. On the other hand, States such as Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, which did not experience high daily cases last year, are now witnessing a surge. Are there any signs of daily cases slowing down nationally? As of April 23, there is no indication that the cases will start dropping in the next few days. Despite the number of cases reported on April 23 reaching an all-time peak of 3,45,283, the national seven-day average test positivity rate on that day was 18.5%. This indicates that there are more cases that remain undetected. Though the daily number of tests across the country increased from over 11 lakh on April 1 to 17.53 lakhs on April 23, the high test positivity rate indicates that the number of tests being carried out in States witnessing a sharp surge should increase manifold. Testing has to be increased, particularly in a few States whose seven-day average test positivity rate as of April 23 was way above the national average of 18.5%. These States are Delhi (30.1%), Chhattisgarh (30.1%), Maharashtra (24.6%), Madhya Pradesh (23.8%), Andhra Pradesh (22.2%), and West Bengal (20.5%). How will higher vaccination coverage help? It is possible to slow down the spread of the virus by vaccinating all above the age of 18 years, say doctors. However, with several States facing vaccine shortages, the number of daily vaccinations in the last week dipped. The Serum Institute of India (SII) currently has the capacity to produce 2.4 million doses of Covishield a day. The company has been manufacturing 60-65 million doses a month, and it says production will be ramped up only around June-July, when about 100 million doses can be produced in a month. Bharat Biotech, the maker of Covaxin, is also increasing capacity at its facilities in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. According to a governmentrelease, Covaxin production will be increased from the current 10 million doses a month to 100 million doses by September. A six- to seven-fold increase is expected around July-August. According to Bharat Biotech, the technology to manufacture the vaccine has been transferred to Indian Immunologicals Ltd., which will also produce the vaccine. With restricted-use approval granted for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, about 100 million doses are expected to be imported soon by Dr. Reddy’s Lab. Fast-track approvals for Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots are likely to be given when companies apply to the drug regulator. Will vaccines be free for the 18-44 age group? According to the recent policy of the Centre, which allows vaccination of those above 18 years from May 1, States are required to procure vaccines directly from the two vaccine manufacturers. The SII has priced the vaccine at Rs. 400 per dose for State governments and Rs. 600 per dose for private hospitals. Those above 45 years of age can still avail of the shots for free at government vaccination sites, and for Rs. 250 per dose at private health facilities. A few States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Goa have announced free vaccination for all aged 18-44 years at government health facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/jabs-for-all-adults-amid-the-second-wave/article34404869.ece
25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Reforms in the National Pension System||The story so far: Started as the New Pension Scheme for government employees in 2004 under a new regulator called the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), the National Pension System (NPS) has been open for individuals from all walks of life to participate and build a retirement nest-egg. Given the dominance of informal employment in India, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation, which is contingent on a formal employer-employee relationship, only covers a fraction of the workforce. The NPS has been gradually growing in size and now manages Rs. 5.78 lakh crore of savings and 4.24 crore accounts in multiple savings schemes. Of these, over 3.02 crore accounts are part of the Atal Pension Yojana (APY), a government-backed scheme for workers in the unorganised sector that assures a fixed pension payout after retirement. The rest constitute voluntary savings from private sector employees and self-employed individuals, for whom some significant changes are on the anvil. What overhaul is the PFRDA planning? The law regulating the NPS allows members to withdraw just 60% of their accumulated savings at the time of retirement. With the remaining 40%, it is mandatory to buy an annuity product that provides a fixed monthly income to retirees till their demise. Members who accumulate up to Rs. 2 lakh in their NPS account at the time of retirement are exempted from the mandatory annuitisation, and can withdraw the full amount. Last week, PFRDA chairman Supratim Bandyopadhyay said this limit will soon be revised to Rs. 5 lakh. Separately, the regulator has decided that the annuity purchase stipulation for 40% of members’ retirement corpus should be dropped altogether. Legislative amendments to this effect are being worked out for Parliament’s approval. What prompted this rethink? Falling interest rates and poor returns offered by annuity products had triggered complaints from some members and experts about the compulsory annuitisation clause. “If someone opts for a lifetime annuity at retirement with a return of purchase price to the nominee once the person dies, the rates are varying between 5% and 5.5%. Since annuities are taxable, deducting the tax and factoring in the inflation means annuities are yielding negative returns,” Mr. Bandyopadhyay pointed out. With retail inflation running at about 5%-6% over the past year, the returns on annuities are, in fact, negative, even if one does not factor in the tax. To avoid forcing people into such an unattractive investment, the regulator has now proposed to give members a choice to retain 40% of their corpus with the NPS fund managers even after retirement. This, the PFRDA chief believes, will allow them to get better returns, and these savings can be paid out to members over 15 years through something like the systematic withdrawal plan offered by mutual funds. While this change shall need Parliament’s nod, the expansion of the annuity-free withdrawal limit from Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh is being done immediately. “Suppose somebody reached Rs. 2.1 lakh at retirement, he will get an annuity component of Rs. 84,000, which, today, will give an income of Rs. 400 or Rs. 450 a month — a pittance. So, now, we will allow those with savings up to Rs. 5 lakh to take the entire corpus out if they choose,” the PFRDA chief said. Are there any other tweaks in the works? While different schemes under the NPS have given reasonable returns at a low fund-management cost so far, there has been a clamour for a guaranteed return product for large sections of potential investors with a high aversion to risk. An actuary is being appointed to suggest the design for such a product and the PFRDA hopes to launch its first guaranteed product soon. At least three more fund managers are expected to be appointed soon, which will take the total managers to ten. Age restrictions to join the NPS are also being eased to allow people to join the scheme up to the age of 70 years, from 65 years earlier. The reason is that over 15,000 recent NPS members joined after the age of 60 since the age limit was raised to 65 years from 60 years in 2017. So, as Indians’ overall longevity improves, the population of “retired, but not so tired” will also have access to the NPS.  The regulator said the limit on funds at the time of retirement will be revised to Rs. 5 lakh. It is also dropping the annuity purchase stipulation for 40% of members’ retirement corpus||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/reforms-in-the-national-pension-system/article34404865.ece
25 April 2021||April 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Crash and burn||The story so far: Last Sunday, 12 of Europe’s biggest clubs resolved to form The Super League, a multi-billion-dollar tournament to be largely played among a closed group of 20 teams. The move was championed by Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur from England, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético Madrid from Spain, and Juventus, Internazionale and AC Milan from Italy. But in under 48 hours, the project, which would have severely disrupted the Champions League, the crown jewel among all competitions run by European football’s governing body UEFA, became unviable after all six English teams backed out, followed by Internazionale and Atlético Madrid. Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez, the chairman of the Super League, is still holding out hope and believes the initiative is just “on standby”. But UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin told the Associated Press on Friday that the Spanish and Italian teams still clinging on to the Super League risk being banned from the Champions League.  What was the idea behind the Super League? According to its founding members, there was a persistent desire to “improve the quality and intensity of existing European competitions throughout each season, and of creating a format for top clubs and players to compete on a regular basis”. The Super League would ensure more matches between high-quality teams, which would generate more revenue and “put the game on a sustainable footing”. The clubs believed that there was “instability” in the existing football economic model, which was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Pérez declared that the Super League would take football to its “rightful place in the world”.  Why did it crumble? Even as football authorities and national governments threatened penalties of varying degrees, and murmurs were heard from players and coaches, the project became untenable largely because of vociferous protests by fans, both on the ground and on social media. With football increasingly becoming commercial and corporate ownership being widely prevalent, some supporters felt that this was yet another attempt by owners to use clubs for private profit. The closed nature of the competition, but for five places offered on a rotational basis, did not please the likes of Pep Guardiola, the celebrated Manchester City coach. That the 12 founding clubs and three future permanent members would be under no risk of missing out meant there was no meritocracy. In contrast, qualification for the Champions League depends on where a club finishes in its domestic league. “It is not sports if the relationship between effort and reward doesn’t exist … if success is guaranteed and it doesn’t matter if you lose,” said Guardiola. England’s Premier League, Spain’s La Liga and Italy’s Serie A moved to expel the teams, sensing that their championships would become largely uncompetitive. UEFA, eager to protect the Champions League, said it would ban Super League players from playing for their respective nations in flagship events like the Euros. FIFA president Gianni Infantino bluntly stated that the 12 clubs will have to “live with the consequences”. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson went to the extent of terming the Super League a “cartel” and warned that he would drop a “legislative bomb” to scupper the project.  What lies ahead for European club football? The Super League announcement came a day before UEFA was to announce the ratification of a revamped Champions League, starting from 2024. With the Super League all but shelved, the reformatted Champions League will take centre stage. The competition will be expanded to 36 teams from its current 32, and will dispense with the group-stage format of eight groups with four teams each in favour of one consolidated 36-team table, from where 16 teams will qualify for the knock-outs. Each team will play a minimum of 10 matches, up from six in the current format. One objective is to generate more revenue from ticket sales, broadcast rights and sponsorships. The second is to give more teams a chance to make the knock-outs and ensure that the competition is alive till the very end. But there are fears that the increase in revenue will just make the already rich clubs richer and further skew the respective domestic leagues in their favour. Juventus, for example, has won the Serie A nine times in a row, while Bayern Munich in Germany and Paris Saint-Germain in France have been equally dominant. Liverpool coach Jürgen Klopp recently frowned at the increase in matches, fearing player burnout, while Manchester City midfielder İlkay Gündoğan called the new format “the lesser of two evils” in comparison to the Super League.  All eyes are now on the reformatted Champions League, which is being expanded to 36 teams from the current 32. It will have one consolidated 36-team table, from where 16 teams will qualify for the knock-outs||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/crash-and-burn/article34404863.ece
