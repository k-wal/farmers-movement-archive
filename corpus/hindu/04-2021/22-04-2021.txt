Attributing the leak to a valve malfunction, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said a high-level inquiry had been ordered to ascertain if negligence had caused the tragedy. Sources said the events unfolded around 10 a.m. when the tank was being refilled after the oxygen level went down. The massive leak caused disruption in the vital oxygen supply for at least half-an-hour. A fire brigade team had to be rushed to the spot to contain the leak. 157 patients Mr. Tope said 157 patients were undergoing treatment at the hospital, of whom 61 were in a critical condition and required oxygen. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, expressing grief over the incident, announced a thorough inquiry. “The kin of every patient who died will receive compensation of Rs. 5 lakh. I appeal to the people not to indulge in any kind of politics,” he said in a statement. Mr. Thackeray said the tragedy showed the need to be careful in the struggle against the pandemic. “We have been facing the pandemic for more than a year now and the available doctors and medical staff are working day and night to save lives of patients… Such incidents should not happen in the future. The administration will have to work very carefully to prevent any such occurrences that could erode the morale of the health personnel,” Mr. Thackeray said. Nashik Collector Suraj Mandhare said the tank belonged to a private vendor. “Apparently, technicians tried to fix the valve when low pressure caused the leakage,” he said. “Currently, the other patients are being supplied oxygen from the repaired tank. They are in a stable condition, as per medical authorities,” Mr. Mandhare said. Chaotic scenes erupted on the hospital premises as fraught relatives of patients converged on the scene of the tragedy. They accused the Nashik Municipal Corporation authorities of not giving them proper information on the mishap. PM ‘anguished’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed anguish over the incident. “The tragedy at a hospital in Nashik because of oxygen tank leakage is heart-wrenching. Anguished by the loss of lives due to it. Condolences to the bereaved families in this sad hour,” he tweeted. Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also condoled the deaths of the patients. Mr. Gandhi urged the Maharashtra government to provide all assistance to the affected. The tragedy comes at a time when Maharashtra, the worst-hit State in India in terms of COVID-19 cases and fatalities, is reeling under an acute shortage of oxygen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/24-covid-19-patients-in-nashik-die-without-oxygen-as-gas-leaks/article34380866.ece
22 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||CM rules out State-wide lockdown||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday ruled out a State-wide lockdown. However, the government would curb civic life to a considerable measure on the weekend to slow down the transmission of a resurgent and more virulent COVID-19 virus. Only essential services would operate on April 24 and 25. The 9 p.m. to 5 a.m curfew would continue till May 3. There was no change in the higher secondary examination schedule, he said. Saturday holiday The government has declared Saturday a holiday. It had not insisted on a lockdown. It was incumbent upon citizens to save the State a shutdown. Hence, residents should sequester themselves indoors as far as possible on Saturday and Sunday. The government had introduced the restrictions to reduce public interaction to stop the virus spread, he said. Conduct of functions Nevertheless, citizens could conduct marriages and house-warming ceremonies already registered on the COVID-19 Jagratha portal. However, hosts should ensure not more than 75 guests. Shops should down shutters at 7.30 p.m. District magistrates could relax hotel timings to deliver food to citizens observing Ramzan fast. The government has exempted neighbourhood shops selling food, groceries, fruits, vegetables, milk, dairy products and meat and fish stalls from the weekend restrictions. Departments Government departments would function with 50% staff. Employees should work from home and make their service available if requested by the District Magistrate. They could attend office on a rotational basis. Private institutions could allow only minimal number of staff to attend office and emphasise work from home. Mr. Vijayan said closed spaces drastically increased the viral load and posed a higher transmission risk.  The weekend curbs would not apply to citizens requiring medical attention or those going for vaccinations. The government has also exempted employees of cable television networks, Internet service providers from the restrictions. The Health Department has scrapped the system of spot registration for vaccination, following the chaos, over crowding and scuffles at many vaccination centres across the State. From April 22, both first and second doses would be available only for people who have secured online registrations ahead. To avoid queues, only those with prior registrations would be distributed tokens at vaccination centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-rules-out-state-wide-lockdown/article34381036.ece
22 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Strike by RTC staff called off on day 15||On Wednesday, after remaining off the road since April 7, buses started pulling into major bus stands across the city in large numbers after employees of the road transport corporations (RTCs) called off their indefinite strike. As the Statewide strike, one of the longest in recent history, entered the 15th day, honorary president of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Employees League Kodihalli Chandrashekar announced that they were postponing the stir in the wake of the High Court of Karnataka’s observations. HC observations On Tuesday, the High Court said that strike by employees of the four public transport corporations amid the COVID-19 pandemic violated the fundamental rights of other citizens. While expressing disappointment with the government’s response to the strike, Mr. Chandrashekar said, “The 15-day-long indefinite strike was one of longest observed in transport corporations. Unexpectedly, the Karnataka High Court intervened noting that in the interests of the general public employees should immediately report back to duty. We respect what the court has said. The strike has been postponed temporarily.” On Wednesday, even before the strike was formally called off, all the four RTCs were able to run more than 12,500 buses across Karnataka, indicating that employees were not waiting for a formal announcement.  Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi thanked employees who reported back to duty on Wednesday. “From Thursday, the RTCs will be able to ply buses as per the schedule,” he said in a press release. Buses will be operated as per the new COVID-19 guidelines issued by the State government. During night and weekend curfew, buses will be operated as per demand.   Validity of monthly pass extended  Special Correspondent Bengaluru In the interest of over 3 lakh monthly bus pass holders, the Bangalore Metropolitain Transport Corporation has decided to extend the validity of the passes. Passengers who had purchased the passes for April will be able to use them till May 16, 2021. The BMTC stated that the extension of the validity would come into force immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/strike-by-rtc-employees-called-off-on-day-15/article34381001.ece
22 April 2021||NEW DELHI/GURUGRAM,||Centre steps in to restore oxygen supplies to Delhi||Oxygen stocks at several hospitals in the national capital dipped to alarming lows following disruption of supplies from Haryana on Wednesday. Supplies were restored by late evening after intervention by the Centre. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, “The problem regarding Haryana and Delhi has been resolved.” Hospitals in Haryana too might be staring at oxygen shortages soon, Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan said. “There is a 24/7 control team by the Centre that will mediate in disputes between the States on supply of oxygen…. We are in a pandemic and there will be differences that crop up between the States on oxygen supply,” Mr. Bhushan said, adding that there was a committee for every hospital, and guidelines on appropriate management of oxygen. “Green corridors have been set up to ensure smooth passage of oxygen trucks.” Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “Central govt has increased Delhi’s quota of oxygen. We are very grateful to centre for this.” The disruption in supplies from Haryana was preceded by a tweet by Health Minister Anil Vij, who said a tanker carrying oxygen for a hospital in Faridabad in the State had been “looted” by the Delhi government on Tuesday. “Also, pressure is being mounted on us to supply oxygen to Delhi, but we will supply only if we have spare oxygen. Our first priority is Haryana,” said the Minister. Hours later, the Delhi-based Holy Family Hospital authorities said they had been informed by the “supplier of liquid oxygen in Faridabad that the Haryana government was not allowing to supply oxygen outside the State”. Sumit Ray, the hospital’s head of the Department of Critical Care, said the hospital had stock that would last only until 11 a.m. on Thursday. Two hospitals in Gurugram too had tense moments with just a few hours of oxygen left on Wednesday. At 4 p.m., the St. Stephen’s Hospital had oxygen stock for two hours, which was replenished just in time. An executive at the Apollo Hospital said its oxygen would last till late night on Wednesday but that supplies were expected in time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-steps-in-to-restore-oxygen-supplies-to-delhi/article34380856.ece
22 April 2021||New Delhi,||Very few post-vaccine infections: ICMR||The Indian Council of Medical Research on Wednesday said only a “small” fraction of people who had been vaccinated had tested positive for COVID-19. However, these instances of “breakthrough” infections did not undermine the efficacy of the vaccines. “These vaccines definitelyprotect against disease. However, the immune response begins to develop usually two weeks after every dose and there are variations within individuals, too. Even after the first dose, if exposure to the virus happens, one can test positive,” Balram Bhargava, Director-General, ICMR, said. Of the 9.3 million who received the first dose of Covaxin, 4,208 tested positive; and of the 1.7 million who received the second dose, 695 tested positive. For Covishield, of the 100.3 million who received the first dose, 17,145 tested positive; of the 15 million who got the second dose, 5,014 tested positive. Two key reasons for this, Dr. Bhargava said, were that healthcare and frontline workerswere as a population far more exposed to the virus and therefore, more susceptible. Second, the emergence of “the highly transmissible second wave (newer variants)” may have contributed to infection among those vaccinated. Several variants, which have mutations that have been shown to avoid detection by the immune system and in some cases, reduce the efficacy of vaccines, have been reported globally, including in India. “This is roughly around two in 10,000 and is a very small fraction. We have seen similar rates of reinfection internationally, too, from the use of other vaccines,” said V.K. Paul, Chairman, National Expert Group on Vaccination that oversees the COVID-19 management strategy. When comparing patterns of infection and mortality in the first and second waves , a slight percentage increase in cases among those in the age group of 10-20 is seen in the current wave — 8.5% compared with 8.07% earlier. There is an increase in cases among those in the 40-70 age group from the previous wave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/very-few-post-vaccine-infections-icmr/article34381633.ece

22 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Covaxin phase 3 trial shows vaccine has 78% efficacy||The efficacy of Covaxin has dropped a tad lower to 78% from the 81% reported in March. On Wednesday, Bharat Biotech, in a press release, announced results from an interim analysis of its phase 3 trial. The efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease was 100%, the company said, but that against protecting from asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 70%. The analysis was on a data set of 127 COVID-19 positive volunteers. Efficacy, a measure of risk reduction from a vaccine, varies among vaccines commercially available. Ranking by reported efficacy gives relative risk reductions of 95% for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 94% for the Moderna shot, 90% for Sputnik V, and 67% each for the J&J and AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines, according to a review article in the Lancet Microbe.  The safety and efficacy results from the final analysis will be available in June, and the final report will be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication. “Based on the achievement of the success criteria, placebo recipients have now become eligible to receive two doses of Covaxin,” Bharat Biotech  said in a statement. In a press briefing on Wednesday, Balram Bhargava, Director-General, ICMR, furnished data to show that four in 10,000 of those who had been inoculated with Covaxin went on to test positive. “Even if it had been five or 10 per 10,000, it wouldn’t be a cause for worry because the objective of the vaccine is to protect against severe disease, and we have demonstrated that in protecting against severe disease it is 100%,” a senior scientist from Bharat Biotech, who declined to be identified, told The Hindu . The vaccine had been tested against emergent international variants of concern, such as the U.K. strain and the Indian B.1.617 strain, the scientist said. “Because the vaccine produces a very broad range of antibodies, unlike many other vaccines that are solely directed at the spike protein, it does a great job at neutralising the various.” The company has reported efficacy against the U.K. variant in a peer reviewed journal ( Journal of Travel Medicine ) but is yet to publicise results on the vaccine’s efficacy against the Brazilian strain. “Covaxin has been found to effectively neutralise the double mutant variant as well,” the ICMR tweeted on Wednesday. Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech, said, “Efficacy against SARS-Cov-2 has been established. Covaxin is now a global innovator vaccine derived from Research and Development from India. The phase 3 study enrolled 25,800 participants in the age group of 18-98, including 2,433 above 60 and 4,500 with comorbidities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covaxin-phase-3-trial-shows-vaccine-has-78-efficacy/article34380862.ece

The court made the remark during an urgent hearing on a petition by Max Hospital (Patparganj) claiming shortage of medical oxygen for treatment of critical COVID-19 patients. During the initial part of the hearing, the court ordered the Centre to take over the supply of oxygen at steel and petroleum industries. It later withheld the order till 3 p.m. on Thursday after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, assured the court that allocated oxygen, which was increased from 350 to 480 metric tonnes, would be facilitated to Delhi. The court was later informed that Max Hospital and its associate facilities have received oxygen needed for the day.

A patient died of the infection in Dakshina Kannada. Of the new cases, 471 cases were reported in Udupi and there were 401 cases in Dakshina Kannada. With this, the number of active cases in the two districts touched 3,556 — 2,472 cases in Dakshina Kannada and 1,084 cases in Udupi. Of the 471 positive cases reported in Udupi, 317 are asymptomatic and 154 symptomatic. Of those who tested positive, 43 have been admitted to designated hospitals and the remaining 428 were advised to be in home isolation, a media bulletin said. Meanwhile, Udupi district in-charge Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who spoke to officials in Udupi through video conference from Bengaluru, asked the administration to increase sample tests from 3,000 to 4,000 daily. He said that robust testing should be conducted and results should be obtained fast. The Minister asked the district administration to make sure that sufficient number of beds is available to accommodate COVID-19 patients. Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha told the Minister that he has asked all private hospitals to reserve sufficient number of beds to treat symptomatic patients. Mr. Jagadeesha also clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code in the district till May 4. As per the order, gathering of more people in any parts of the district is prohibited. Anybody found violating the order will be punished as per section 188 of IPC, he said. As new cases are increasing, seer of Udupi Pejawar Mutt Vishwaprasanna Thirthai said that any major religious programmes that require attendance of many number of people should be put on hold as the health of the people is important. If religious programmes are held in a very simple manner where adherence to social distancing norms is possible, such events can be allowed, he said. ‘‘Nationwide lockdown last year yielded good results in containing the spread of infection. But later we all neglected the norms. So there is a spike now. There is more pain and death around. Careless attitude is not acceptable. Social distancing should be strictly followed and wearing a mask is a must,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/patient-dies-872-new-cases-in-twin-districts/article34381518.ece

The Centre has presently allocated 300 tonnes a day of oxygen to Karnataka. According to the State’s projection, the requirement is likely to touch 500-600 tonnes a day by this month-end and further go up next month. The demand for oxygen has come to such a point in the city that several hospitals are now asking patient families to give an undertaking that they will arrange for an ICU and critical care if the patient’s condition deteriorates. “We have been getting calls from many desperate families who have been asked to give an undertaking that they will arrange for an ICU if the condition worsens,” said Ameen-e-Mudassar, member of the Emergency Response Team, a volunteer group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/oxygen-demand-in-state-may-touch-1500-tonnes/article34380998.ece

22 April 2021||New Delhi,||SII fixes price for Covishield||From May 1, Serum Institute of India will sell its COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, to the States at Rs. 400 a dose and to private hospitals at Rs. 600 a dose, its chief executive officer, Adar Poonawala, said in a statement on Wednesday. The vaccines, however, would not be sold in retail for four or five months, and corporates and private individuals could in the meantime only get these vaccines from “state-facilitated machinery”, the statement added. Covishield constitutes over 90% of India’s vaccine supply and is learnt to be sold to the Centre at Rs. 150-Rs. 200 a dose. On Monday, when announcing vaccination for all above 18, the Centre said vaccine companies could sell half their approved lot of vaccines in the open market, opening up avenues for States to directly procure them without intervention from the Centre. States have, however, expressed reservation. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that such a policy would place additional burden on States’ finances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sii-fixes-price-for-covishield/article34380863.ece

22 April 2021||New Delhi,||Cannot club remaining poll phases: ECI||The Election Commission (EC) on Wednesday told the Trinamool Congress that its suggestion of clubbing the last three phases of polling in West Bengal due to the COVID-19 surge was “not feasible”. The EC’s response to a letter sent by Trinamool MP Derek O’ Brien came on the eve of the sixth phase of polling in the eight-phase West Bengal election on Thursday. The seventh and eighth phases are scheduled for April 26 and 29. “You are aware that scheduling for an election is an activity planned much in advance taking complex interplay of variety of factors ranging from optimal utilisation of resources, and training thereof, logistics involved in the mammoth exercise, voters’ convenience, festivals, etc. and assessment of prevailing law and order situations,” the EC reply stated. It said the Representation of the People Act, 1951 also placed a statutory requirement for at least 14 days for the schedule of each phase of poll. It said each phase of poll was notified separately. “Your submission that 52 days of campaign period has already been availed is misleading and not in accordance with law,” the EC said, adding that the total duration of elections had been reduced to 66 days, which was 11 days less than the 2016 election. The EC added that the number of polling booths had been increased, the campaign period had been limited to 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and the silence period extended to 72 hours before polls rather than 48 hours as a result of the pandemic. Meanwhile, some former Chief Election Commissioners also raised concerns over the suggestion made by the Trinamool. Former CEC O.P. Rawat, who held the post in 2018, said while the remaining poll dates could have been clubbed with the last one, it would have only “added to the evil” by extending the campaign period. He said the Home Ministry could have addressed the deployment concerns, but only if it had been planned earlier. “The Election Commission has done what was the best option. They have increased the silence period from 48 hours to 72 hours,” he said. Former CEC N. Gopalaswami, who had the role from June 2006 to April 2009, said the clubbing of phases could not be done due to the requirement of security forces to be deployed. He added that political parties would need to be more “responsible” by not having large rallies during the pandemic. However, S.Y. Quraishi, who was the CEC between July 2010 and June 2012, said the proposal of clubbing the last three phases (April 22, April 26 and April 29) was a sensible one.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cannot-club-remaining-poll-phases-ec/article34380797.ece
22 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Variant in Bengal can evade immune system||With the election on in West Bengal, scientists report the emergence of a new lineage of the novel coronavirus that may comprise as much as 15% of the genomes in the State from January to March. The new variant, B.1.618, has a major mutation called E484K — found in several of the internationally identified variants of concern — that helps it evade the immune system and possibly compromise vaccine efficacy. On April 8, INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics), a group of 10 Indian labs working across the country on sequencing genomes from coronavirus patients, named a “double mutant variant” as B.1.617 that contains two mutations, E484Q and another L245R. Though more studies are under way, there is suspicion that this variant, whose mutations have also been found in variants in other countries, may be playing a significant role in the nearly month-long exponential rise in cases that is now seeing over 2,70,000 new infections a day, the most in the world, and straining India’s health infrastructure to its seams. Characteristic mutations The B.1.618 was first isolated on October 25, 2020 and most recently on March 17. The variants that carry some of the mutations associated with B.1.618 have also been found in the U.S., Switzerland, Singapore and Finland. While mutations occur in all parts of the coronavirus genome, key changes to the spike protein — that help the virus bind better to the body’s cells — are most closely tracked. In the case of B.1.618, there are four characteristic mutations to the spike protein associated with increased infectivity and immune escape. “The proportion of B.1.618 has been growing significantly in recent months in West Bengal,” Vinod Scaria, who researches genome mutations at the CSIR-Insititute of Genomics and Integrative Biology said on Twitter. “Along with B.1.617, it forms a major lineage in West Bengal.” The IGIB is part of the INSACOG. The samples detailing the genetic structure of the virus was collected by the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBG), Kalyani, West Bengal — also an INSACOG lab. Though its goal is to sample 5% of coronavirus samples, the consortium has sampled around 1%. He said at the moment there was no “conclusive” evidence that the lineage was driving the epidemic in West Bengal, other than the fact that the numbers and proportions were rising. Like other States, West Bengal too has seen a sharp spike in cases. On April 1 it was reporting 829 cases a day and that has since spiked to 7,000 cases everyday with 53,000 active cases reported as of Tuesday. This has prompted some Opposition parties to announce withdrawing from campaigns and calls to club the remaining phases of the polling. Partha Majumdar, geneticist and a former director of the NIBG, said though the variant was spreading rapidly it alone can’t be linked with the acceleration of cases in West Bengal. “Mutations play a role but as only 15% of those infected carry the B.1.618, it cannot alone explain the surge,” he said. The 15% only represents the number of samples whose data has been shared by Indian scientists on the global repository GISAID, a forum for researchers everywhere to collate data and track emerging variants and strains. In spite of its huge number of cases, there are relatively fewer samples and details of their genetic information regularly uploaded out of India. Lab tests Some laboratories have started tests on the virus containing these mutations. Rakesh Mishra of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, said the institute was testing plasma from those inoculated with Covishield and Covaxin against virus variants to check if it escaped antibodies. Studies so far have shown that the Novavax, Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer vaccines were less effective against the South African variant, that contains the E484K mutation. Some vaccine makers are already developing vaccines that reportedly account for the mutation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-coronavirus-lineage-found-in-west-bengal/article34380807.ece
22 April 2021||New Delhi,||Congress flays pricing of vaccine||The Congress on Wednesday criticised the Centre over differential pricing of the Covishield vaccine, with former Union minister Jairam Ramesh calling it “atrocious” that the Centre could procure it for Rs. 150 per dose but States would have to pay Rs. 400 per dose. While former finance minister P. Chidambaram posed a series of questions on Twitter, party general secretary Ajay Maken, at an online press conference, charged the Narendra Modi government of reducing India from being “a vaccine leader to a vaccine beggar”. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in an interview to news agency ANI, said, “This government can speak to ISI. They are speaking to ISI in Dubai. Can’t they talk to Opposition leaders? I don’t think there is any Opposition leader who is not giving them constructive and positive suggestions...The government needs to be sensitive at this time. The Prime Minister needs to show up, he needs to get off the stage of the rally where he is laughing and cracking jokes. He needs to come here, sit in front of people, talk to them and tell them how is he going to save lives.” “Manmohan Singh- ji was Prime Minister for 10 years. Everyone knows how dignified a person he is. If he is giving suggestions when the nation is facing a pandemic, then suggestions should be taken up with the same dignity with which they were offered,” she added. Ms. Vadra flagged the issue of shortage of vaccines because of “the Modi government’s PR exercise”, lack of planning to ensure smooth supply of oxygen despite India being its largest producer, and allowing export of critical drugs. The party also sharply reacted to the announcement by the Serum Institute of India (SII) on vaccine pricing. Mr. Ramesh tweeted, “The Central government will continue to pay Rs. 150 per dose for Covishield. State governments will now be charged Rs. 400 a dose. This is not cooperative federalism. This will bleed dry the already reeling State finances. Atrocious. We demand One Nation, One Price for Centre and State governments.” “Who will pay the Rs. 400 for one dose in government hospitals? The State government or the beneficiary? How many persons between 18 and 44 years can afford to pay Rs. 400 per dose? Will the beneficiary be burdened with the cost ? How many States would be willing to pay the price of the vaccine and subsidise the people?” asked Mr. Chidambaram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-flays-pricing-of-vaccine/article34380809.ece
22 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indian ads further gender stereotypes, shows study||An analysis of Indian advertisements on television and YouTube has shown that while they are superior to global benchmarks insofar as girls and women have parity of representation in terms of screen and speaking time, their portrayal is problematic as they further gender stereotypes — they are more likely than male characters to be shown as married, less likely to be shown in paid occupation, and more likely to be depicted as caretakers and parents. These are some of the findings of a study released on Monday by UNICEF and the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media (GDI) titled “Gender bias and inclusion in advertising in India”. The research measures over 1,000 television and YouTube advertisements aired across India in 2019. The ads analysed were those that received the most reach. The study finds that women characters dominate screen time (59.7%) and speaking time (56.3%), but one of the drivers of this is their depiction for selling cleaning supplies and food and beauty products to women consumers. For example, almost all the detergent and food commercials depicted a woman caretaking for her family who speaks directly to women viewers about caring for their families. In comparison, in a separate study by the GDI for setting global benchmarks, it was found that ads in the U.S. show women with half the screen time (30.6%) and nearly half the speaking time (33.5%). A greater percentage of female characters is depicted as married than male characters (11.0% compared with 8.8%). Female characters are three times more likely to be depicted as parents than male characters (18.7% compared with 5.9%). While male characters are more likely to be shown making decisions about their future than female characters (7.3% compared with 4.8%), the latter are twice as likely to be shown making household decisions than male characters (4.9% compared with 2.0%). Female characters are more likely to be shown doing the following activities than male characters — shopping (4.1% compared with 2.3%); cleaning (4.8% as against 2.2%); and being involved in the purchase or preparation of meals (5.4% against 3.9%). For characters where intelligence is part of their character in the ad, male characters are more likely to be shown as smart than female characters (32.2% compared to 26.2%). Male characters are almost twice as likely to be shown as funny than female characters (19.1% compared to 11.9%). Two-thirds of female characters (66.9%) in Indian ads have light or medium-light skin tones — a higher percentage than male characters (52.1%). Female characters are nine times more likely to be shown as “stunning/very attractive” than male characters (5.9% compared with 0.6%). Female characters are also invariably thin, but male characters appear with a variety of body sizes in Indian advertising “Misrepresentation and harmful stereotypes of women in advertising have a significant impact on women — and young girls — and how they view themselves and their value to society. While we do see female representation dominate in Indian ads, they are still marginalised by colorism, hypersexualisation, and without careers or aspirations outside of the home,” said Geena Davis, Academy Award Winning Actor, Founder and Chair of the GDI adding that the stark inequality must be addressed to ensure an equitable society.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indian-ads-further-gender-stereotypes-shows-study/article34380795.ece

A statement signed by ‘Vikalp’, spokesperson of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee of the Maoists, said on April 19, the drone dropped “12 bombs” between Bottalanka and Palagudem villages in Pamed area of Bijapur in which some plants and trees were destroyed and a few animals were injured. The Maoists also shared a photograph of the affected area and the “bombs”. The statement said they were able to change their location minutes before the attack took place. They claimed that this was the first time that a drone had been used to aerially bomb areas, adding the attack was a retaliation of the April 3 encounter at Tarrem on the Sukma-Bijapur border where 22 security personnel were killed by the banned group. Chhattisgarh IGP P. Sundarraj said, “The security forces in Bastar operate within the legal framework with a single objective of protecting life and property of the native population. It is the Maoist cadres who have taken away the lives of thousands of innocent civilians by using IEDs and explosive materials. They haven’t even spared children, women and animals during their desperate attempts to harm the security forces by using IEDs. The Maoists do not have any moral authority to level such baseless allegation against the security forces. It is high time that they stop unleashing cruelty against innocent tribals of Bastar.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maoists-allege-drone-attack-in-bijapur-by-security-forces/article34380790.ece
22 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||States promised seamless oxygen supply||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday assured the States of a seamless supply of medical oxygen, even as pharmaceutical manufacturers told the government that they will ramp up production of Remdesivir injections from 36 lakh vials a month to 1 crore. “Measures that the government is taking include importing medical oxygen, round-the-clock working of the oxygen filling stations and allowing containers used for nitrogen and argon to be used for oxygen,” Ms. Sitharaman said. “On meeting the phenomenal increase in demand for medical oxygen, a critical treatment tool for COVID-19, the Finance Minister assured seamless supply to States,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement after she met 150 industry leaders virtually, in an interaction hosted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). In a separate meeting with FICCI, she said oxygen supply has been “very neatly mapped and new permissions have been given, particularly for the hard stressed 12 States”. She also laid out measures taken to ramp up production capacity of Remdesivir from 36 lakh vials to 78 lakh vials per month, such as rapid clearances for new capacities, stopping exports of the injection and APIs and formulations used in its manufacture, and allowing export-oriented units and manufacturers in Special Economic Zones to sell in the domestic market. CII members that produce Remdesivir told the Minister “that they were in fact working towards exceeding the committed target of 78 lakh vials per month and aiming to reach a production of 1 crore vials per month,” the statement added. “The government has cleared an advance payment of Rs. 4,600 crore to Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech,” Ms. Sitharaman said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-promised-seamless-oxygen-supply/article34380801.ece
22 April 2021||Srinagar,||Special Task Force to monitor J&K government employees||The J&K government on Wednesday constituted a Special Task Force (STF) for identifying and scrutinising the government employees who are involved in any cases related to posing threat to the security or anti-national activities. “The STF will have the ADGP, (CID), J&K, as its chairman and the IGP, representatives of the Home Department; Department of Law, Justice Member and Parliamentary Affairs and the concerned department as its members,” reads a notification issued by Commissioner-Secretary Manoj Kumar Dwivedi. It said the STF will scrutinise cases of employees suspected of activities requiring action under Article 311(2)(C) of the Constitution. The STF has been tasked to compile records of such employees and engage with other members of the Terror Monitoring Group (TMG) for identifying such other employees. The government spokesman said the STF shall speedily scrutinise such cases in a time-bound manner. The move comes as a number of government employees in the past were found expressing their political opinion in public space on the Kashmir conflict. According to an official data, scores of employees were found involved in stone-pelting, participating in anti-India demonstrations and expressing anti-national sentiments on the social media during the five-month long agitation in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/special-task-force-to-monitor-jk-government-employees/article34380789.ece
22 April 2021||Mumbai,||Door-to-door vaccination not possible: Centre to Bombay HC||The Central government told the Bombay High Court on Wednesday that door-to-door vaccination against the COVID-19 virus is not possible as it was expected to lead to contamination and wastage. Satyendra Singh, Under Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, filed an ffidavit and listed reasons for not being able to go door-to-door. The affidavit read, “In case of any Adverse Event Following Immunisation, case management may not be proper and there will be delay in reaching the health facility and challenges in maintaining protocol of observation of the patient for 30 minutes after vaccination. There were chances of contamination as during door-to-door inoculation, the vaccine container will be taken out at each house, which could affect its efficacy.” The affidavit mentioned, “There was also the possibility of high wastage as inoculation drive will take longer. At the request of State governments, more vaccination centres have been approved with special consideration for senior citizens.” As to the registration for vaccination, it said that people could register in advance or on site. The reply was submitted in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by two city-based lawyers who sought those above 75 years, bed-ridden or wheelchair-bound may be vaccinated at home. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni is expected to hear the PIL on April 22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/door-to-door-vaccination-not-possible-centre-to-bombay-hc/article34380812.ece
22 April 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC verdict likely today in WhatsApp privacy policy case||The Delhi High Court is likely to pronounce its verdict on Thursday on a petition filed by WhatsApp challenging a decision of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) calling for an investigation into its controversial new privacy policy. Justice Navin Chawla had reserved verdict on April 13 after hearing the arguments by both the sides. WhatsApp has contended that the CCI need not have ordered the probe since the issue of its privacy policy was before the Supreme Court. Social media giant Facebook, which owns the instant messaging app, also filed a similar petition challenging the competition watchdog’s March 24 decision. WhatsApp said the CCI jumped the gun and started the probe when this was not in fact a competition issue. The issue with respect to personal data of the users, and sharing of personalised data, was already before the Supreme Court. CCI, on the other hand, said the probe order was made to gauge whether access to data would lead to abuse by WhatsApp of its dominant position. The commission said it was dealing with the app’s new privacy policy that could lead to excessive collection of consumers’ data and the use and sharing of the data in anti-competitive context. The commission said it was not concerned with the privacy aspect of the issue, as the Supreme Court was already seized of it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-hc-verdict-likely-today-in-whatsapp-privacy-policy-case/article34380777.ece
22 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Three ONGC staff abducted in Assam||Suspected members of the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) have abducted three employees of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Ltd. from an oil rig in eastern Assam. The police said the three men were taken away at gunpoint from a workover rig within the Lakwa Tea Estate around 3 a.m. on Wednesday. The estate is in Charaideo district but the area is under the jurisdiction of the police in the adjoining Sivasagar district. The abducted employees have been identified as Mohini Mohan Gogoi and Ritul Saikia, junior technicians (production), and Alakesh Saikia, junior engineering assistant (production). A statement issued by the ONGC said the abductors took the three away in one of its operational vehicles, which was later found abandoned near the Nimonagarh jungles close to the Assam-Nagaland border. “A complaint has been lodged with the local police,” the statement said. “Any group could have abducted the trio but the modus operandi points to the involvement of the ULFA-I. We have launched a search operation and intensified security at the exit points,” Sivasagar district’s Superintendent of Police Amitava Saikia told The Hindu . “We have taken up the matter with our counterparts in Nagaland since the place of abduction is not far from the border with that State,” he said. Extremist groups in Assam have had a history of executing hit-and-run operations from Nagaland besides taking hostages to the adjoining State and Myanmar beyond.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/three-ongc-staff-abducted-in-assam/article34380788.ece

Mr. Bajwa, in a statement, said, “It is necessary for us to be judicious about extravagant expenditure when the State has a fully functioning Advocate General’s office to defend its interests. There is no justifiable reason as to why the State must continue paying extravagant fees to lawyers from Delhi, especially in the midst of a global pandemic. It is necessary for the Government to act immediately, lest the faith of the public in the State be irrevocably damaged.” Mr. Bajwa issued statement in against the backdrop of Punjab and Haryana High Court quashing the probe by the State in the Kotkapura police firing incident of 2015. He said the sacrilege cases are extremely sensitive to the Sikh community and Punjab as a whole.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bajwa-demands-white-paper-on-hiring-of-lawyers-in-punjab/article34380802.ece
22 April 2021||LUCKNOW,||Citing oxygen shortage, hospital asks kin to shift critical patients||Relatives of COVID-19 patients admitted in a private hospital in Lucknow got a scare on Wednesday after the authorities, citing acute shortage of oxygen, allegedly asked them to shift the patients on oxygen support to other centres. The administration of the Mayo Medical Centre put up a notice to draw the attention of the attendants. “After repeated requests to the UP CM/ Central government we are not able to get enough oxygen supply. Hence we are requesting family members of those patients who are on oxygen support, please take their patients to higher centre for further management,” read the notice. The notice was widely shared on social media and also by the attendants. Madhulika Singh, director of Mayo Hospital, confirmed that the hospital had put up the notice. After raising an alarm, the hospital got 80 cylinders through the State government and at present did not have a shortage, she said. The hospital has 117 COVID-19 patients and barring 27 all are on oxygen support.As a desperate measure, as the hospital was running out of oxygen, Ms. Singh said, she got 20 cylinders transported to Mayo from her medical college in Barabanki district. Given the high demand, she said the slow process of refilling cylinders was causing a shortage in the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/citing-oxygen-shortage-hospital-asks-kin-to-shift-critical-patients/article34380816.ece

22 April 2021||Lucknow,||U.P. police get ‘clean chit’ in Vikas Dubey case||A three-member inquiry commission probing the encounter killings of gangster Vikas Dubey and five of his alleged associates has given a clean chit to Uttar Pradesh Police because of lack of evidence, sources said on Wednesday. The commission is headed by former Supreme Court judge B.S. Chauhan. The other two members are former Allahabad High Court judge Sashi Kant Agrawal and former U.P. Director General of Police K.L. Gupta. The panel submitted its report to the State government on Monday, eight months after it was set up. “Yes, the commission has submitted its report to the State government on Monday. A copy of the report will be submitted in the Supreme Court also,” Mr. Gupta said. He, however, did not elaborate on the contents of the report. Asked about it, Additional Chief Secretary, Home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said, “I would not like to comment on it.” According to the sources, the inquiry commission has found no evidence of wrongdoing by the State police. Speaking to PTI, a senior police official said, “No witnesses came forward to challenge the police claims even after placing advertisements in newspapers and media. Also, no one from the media came forward to get their versions recorded.” There were, however, witnesses supporting the police version, he added. On July 3 last year, eight policemen were killed in an ambush in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur when they were going to arrest Vikas Dubey. The police later killed Prem Prakash Pandey, 55 and Atul Dubey, 35 in an encounter in Kanpur on July 3. On July 8, Amar Dubey, 30, who carried a reward of Rs. 50,000 on him, was killed in an encounter at Maudaha village in Hamirpur district. On July 9, Praveen Dubey, alias Bauwa, 48, and Prabhat, alias Kartikeya, 28, were killed in separate encounters in Etawah and Kanpur districts. Six PIL petitions were filed in the Supreme Court to seek a court-monitored probe into the encounter killings. The Supreme Court had on July 22, 2020, approved the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to institute the inquiry commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-police-get-clean-chit-in-vikas-dubey-encounter-case/article34380784.ece

22 April 2021||New Delhi,||India at 142nd rank on press freedom index||The World Press Freedom Index, 2021, produced by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a French non-governmental organisation, has again ranked India at 142nd out of 180 countries. This is despite the fact that for a year, on directions from Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, an index monitoring cell worked to improve the rankings, even holding a meeting between the Indian Ambassador to France and the RSF officials to lobby for a change in the ranking. In 2016, India’s rank was 133, which has steadily climbed down to 142 in 2020. The RSF report says India is one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists trying to do their job properly. They are exposed to every kind of attack, even police violence against reporters, ambushes by political activists, and reprisals instigated by criminal groups or corrupt local officials. In February last year, fearing such an adverse assessment, the cell was set up in 18 Ministries to find ways to improve the position on 32 international indices. The Information and Broadcasting Ministry was delegated to look at the freedom of press index. According to the report of this cell, accessed by The Hindu , on April 26 last year, the Additional Director-General, Public Information Bureau, first wrote to RSF chairman Pierre Haski asking for the criteria on the basis of which it compiles the index, for a better understanding of the ranking. This was followed by a meeting between Indian Ambassador Javed Ashraf with the RSF’s secretary-general Christophe Deloire and the head of its Asia Pacific desk, Daniel Bastard. The minutes of this September meeting are part of the report of the cell. Mr. Ashraf said the openness of the government to be criticised and questioned with respect to subjects such as economy, international affairs and defence deals such as Rafale were indicators of press freedom. Internet ban in J&K The RSF representatives, however, questioned the Internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir from August 5, 2019, which went on for nearly a year. The Ambassador said the shutdown was for the security of the region. “Members of the press could access the Internet through the Internet kiosks set up by the government and there was active reporting in Indian and international media on the situation in Kashmir, which could only have been possible with unhindered access to the Internet and freedom of the press,” the minutes say. The minutes also note that on the issue of violence raised by the RSF, Mr. Ashraf said, “many incidents reported as attacks on journalists are often a consequence of the law and order situation in some areas of India. This is often misrepresented as targeted attacks on journalists by the State in western media.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-at-142nd-rank-on-press-freedom-index/article34380780.ece

The vaccine had been tested against emergent international variants of concern, such as the U.K. strain and the Indian B.1.617 strain, the scientist said. “Because the vaccine produces a very broad range of antibodies, unlike many other vaccines that are solely directed at the spike protein, it does a great job at neutralising the various.” The company has reported efficacy against the U.K. variant in a peer reviewed journal ( Journal of Travel Medicine ) but is yet to publicise results on the vaccine’s efficacy against the Brazilian strain. “Covaxin has been found to effectively neutralise the double mutant variant as well,” the ICMR tweeted on Wednesday. Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech, said, “Efficacy against SARS-Cov-2 has been established. Covaxin has demonstrated an excellent safety record in human clinical trials and in usage under emergency use. Covaxin is now a global innovator vaccine derived from Research and Development from India. “The efficacy data against severe COVID-19 and asymptomatic infections is highly significant, as this helps reduce hospitalisations and disease transmission, respectively.” The phase 3 study enrolled 25,800 participants in the age group of 18-98, including 2,433 above 60 and 4,500 with comorbidities. The primary endpoint of phase 3 clinical trial is based on the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second study vaccination in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants at baseline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covaxin-phase-3-trial-shows-78-efficacy/article34380791.ece

On Monday, when announcing vaccination for all above 18, the Centre said companies could sell half their approved lot of vaccines in the open market, opening up avenues for the States to directly procure them without intervention from the Centre. States have, however, expressed reservation. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said such a policy would only place additional burden on States’ finances. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the policy amounted to States abdicating their responsibility. In an interview to CNBC TV 18, Mr. Poonawala said his company had sold 100 million doses at Rs. 150 a dose, and was fulfilling a fresh order from the Centre of 110 million doses at Rs. 2,000 crore (about Rs. 180 a dose), but in future, it would also charge the Centre Rs. 400 a dose. “I’ve always maintained that Rs. 1,000 a dose would be a reasonable price.

Our first priority is Haryana,” said the Minister. The Delhi-based Holy Family Hospital authorities said they had been informed by the “supplier of liquid oxygen in Faridabad that the Haryana government was not allowing to supply oxygen outside the State”. Sumit Ray, the hospital’s head of the Department of Critical Care, said the hospital had stock that would last only until 11 a.m. on Thursday.  Haryana has a cumulative capacity of 270 MT liquid oxygen per day with a plant each in Faridabad and Panipat. The Centre on Tuesday reduced the State’s share to 80 MT from the earlier 118 MT, and fixed a quota of 140 MT for Delhi, Mr. Vardhan said. The State was also directed to supply around 20 MT of liquid oxygen to neigbouring Punjab. “When Haryana is producing 270 MT and giving 200 MT to others, there is sometimes popular and public resentment here as well as to why we are not safeguarding our interests,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-steps-in-to-restore-oxygen-supplies-to-delhi/article34380778.ece

There were 22% deaths among those in the 70-80 years in the second wave compared to 19% in the first wave, and 9.8% deaths in those above 80 compared to 7.8% previously. There is no evidence of any change in patterns of death in the younger age groups of 30-70 years, with about 70% deaths during both waves falling in this age bracket. However, for the mortality comparison, a far smaller sample — 24,814 — was used in the second wave compared with the 83,189 in the first wave. Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, Health Ministry, said the severity of the second wave meant that efforts were on to mitigate it and save lives, and only in the days ahead, with the benefit of hindsight, would it be possible to discern how India was attacked by a severe second wave. There are 146 districts reporting a test positivity of over 15%, and these are the places where the hospital facilities are most taxed. There are 274 districts where case positivity is between 5% and 15%, and 308 districts where it is less than 5%. India’s case fatality rate, Mr. Bhushan said, is at 1.17% and on decreasing trend from March 22, when it was 1.37%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccines-offering-protection-says-icmr/article34380779.ece

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||24 COVID-19 patients die after oxygen leak||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Pravin Darekar said that the Nashik civic body authorities were to blame for negligence and demanded a case of culpable homicide be lodged against the NMC Commissioner. “One cannot pin the blame for this tragedy just on mere technicians. The NMC authorities and the State government are equally to blame for this,” Mr. Darekar said. The BJP is in power in the NMC. The fact that no BJP representative reached the accident spot soon drew accusations of callous politicking on part of the saffron party from several quarters. “There is no question of playing politics here. Devendra Fadnavis (Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly) and myself are available for people 24 hours a day. In this case, it is clearly NMC authorities who are to be blamed for negligence,” Mr. Darekar said. BJP State president Chandrakant Patil said that this was not the first time that such incidents had been reported in Nashik and across the State. He urged Mr. Thackeray and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government to “get its act together” and make sure such incidents did not occur again. The tragedy comes at a time when Maharashtra, the worst-hit State in India in terms of COVID-19 cases and fatalities, is reeling under an acute shortage of oxygen. Along with Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur, Nashik has witnessed massive case spikes and COVID-19-related deaths in both waves of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/24-covid-19-patients-die-after-oxygen-leak/article34380794.ece
22 April 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Provide uninterrupted oxygen supply: Punjab||Punjab has requested the Central government to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply for the State. Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday wrote to Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Harsh Vardhan seeking at least 120 MT daily allocation of oxygen for Punjab. He also reiterated urgent steps to set up two pending Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants approved by the Centre two months ago. In his letter, the Chief Minister sought immediate consideration to his request for uninterrupted oxygen supplies from the Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) suppliers as per commitment on daily basis. While the capacity for storage of oxygen for all healthcare facilities in the State is around 300 MT, daily requirement as per the present case load is 105-110 MT, the Chief Minister pointed out, adding that this figure was expected to rise to around 150-170 MT in the next two weeks as per the projections of increase in hospital admissions due to the rising case load. Captain Singh noted that since the main requirement of the State is fulfilled from outside, adherence of supply as per the allocation made by the Centre for all States, including Punjab, is critical to be able to meet the daily requirements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/provide-uninterrupted-oxygen-supply-punjab/article34380813.ece

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Greatness of Hastigiri||In his Varadaraja stavam, Kooratazhvan says the Vedas longed to be like Hastigiri, the hill on which Lord Varadaraja of Kanchipuram stands. The Vedas tell us about Brahman — the Supreme One. Hastigiri also shows us the same Brahman, albeit in archa form. Why then should the Vedas want to be like Hastigiri? The desire of the Vedas implies the superiority of Hastigiri to the Vedas, in showing us Brahman, said Valayapet Ramachariar in a discourse. So, what is this superiority? In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, there is a section known as Moorthaamoortha Brahmanam. It talks about Brahman being antaryami, indwelling, in all. The Lord wears a yellow garment, and He is white in colour like pure white wool. He is like a lotus. He sparkles like thousands of fireflies (Indragopa) gathered together in one place. It seems as if He is surrounded by lightning on all sides. After describing the Supreme One, the Upanishad says “neti,” meaning “not so”. Neti (na iti) does not mean that He is without any qualities. If that interpretation were to be taken, then why did the Upanishad go to the trouble of listing His qualities? It means that these are not the only qualities He has. He has many more, too many, in fact to be laid out fully. In other words, His qualities are infinite. So, clearly, the Vedas admit that He is beyond description. They express their inability to describe His infinite qualities. He is beyond comprehension by our indriyas. But Hastigiri, the hill abode of Lord Varadaraja, puts before our eyes (aparoksham) such a Supreme Brahman. No wonder the Vedas consider this hill to be their superior, for it achieves what the Vedas are unable to. Vedanta Desika says that the 24 tattvas reside in Lord Varadaraja, showing the greatness of Hastigiri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/greatness-of-hastigiri/article34380805.ece
22 April 2021||New Delhi,||SC paves way for ad-hoc judges in HCs||Terming pendency of around 57 lakh cases in High Courts as “docket explosion”, the Supreme Court activated a “dormant” constitutional provision to pave way for appointment of retired HC judges as ad-hoc ones for a period of two to three years to clear backlog and came out with guidelines to regulate appointments. Article 224A, used rarely, of the Constitution deals with appointment of ad-hoc judges in HCs and says “the Chief Justice of a HC for any State may at any time, with the previous consent of the President, request any person who has held the office of a Judge of that Court or of any other HC to sit and act as a Judge of the High Court for that State”. A bench of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Justices S.K. Kaul and Surya Kant issued a slew of guidelines pertaining to issues such as the trigger point when the appointment process can be set in motion, tenure, procedure for appointment, salary, perks, etc, maximum number of such judges and their role in adjudicating cases. The CJI wrote the 37-page judgement on a PIL of NGO 'Lok Prahari' seeking appointment of ad-hoc judges in HCs under Article 224A in order to reduce pendency of cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-paves-way-for-ad-hoc-judges-in-hcs/article34380785.ece

22 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Erratic water supply irks residents||Residents of a few pockets of the city and added areas are complaining of erratic water supply, particularly since the start of summer. Residents of TVS Colony and Officers Colony in Anna Nagar West Extension said water was supplied on alternate days as it was an added area. But this too had become erratic. People who are largely dependent on piped water supply find it difficult to manage even if water is not supplied one day. Disruption means residents are left without water for two days due to the alternate day supply system, said V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase II Residents Welfare Association. People living in Anna Nagar West End Colony said they hardly got sufficient water for almost a year now. “There is enough water source for the city this year. But we are still waiting to receive adequate water through pipelines. A majority of about 350 families that live in the colony do not get piped water supply. We hardly get three or four pots of water and manage the gap with groundwater,” said S. Jegajothipandian, secretary, West End Colony Residents’ Welfare Association. Similarly, residents of a few streets in Purasawalkam have been facing water shortage since March. Piped water supply has been erratic in places like Sundaram Lane, Sundaram Street and Subramaniam Street. H.P. Anand, a resident of Subramaniam Street, said, “In a week, we get adequate amount of water only for two or three days. On other days, water supply lasts only two hours. We depend on piped water supply as the water table has declined in our area.” At present, the city is supplied with 830 million litres of water daily (mld). Sources in the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board said improvement work was being taken up to provide better supply through pipelines in affected localities in core parts and merged areas. Work in progress Funds were yet to be sanctioned for a proposal to change the old pipeline in Anna Nagar West End Colony. Work was in progress to link transmission lines carrying water from overhead tanks in Mogappair to improve supply. Once it is completed in two or three days, areas such as Golden Colony and West End Colony would receive more water. “In Zone 7 alone, we have improved water supply from 20 mld to 30-35 mld recently,” an official said.

22 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||College students, NGO launch campaign for children||With many children getting infected with COVID-19, a group of college students, along with an NGO, have started creating awareness of the basic standard operating procedures (SOPs) among adolescents and children below the age of 12 at the Semmenchery resettlement colony. The nine students, drawn from Stella Maris College and Patrician College, are pursuing their master’s programmes in social work and have been interning with Thozhamai, an NGO at Semmenchery. They have been creating awareness of the basic steps to be followed to keep the novel coronavirus at bay. “There have been reports that many children are getting infected. But there are no proper awareness programmes on wearing masks, hand washing and personal distancing targeting children. So, we thought it was pertinent to educate children till the age of 17 at Semmenchery,” said A. Devaneyan, director, Thozhamai. Prathipa K., a first-year student from Stella Maris College, said they were surprised to know that many teenagers did not know the importance of washing hands. “They were using just water. We told them that it was not enough and taught them the proper way of doing it. We taught them how to wear their masks properly and wash them regularly, told them about drinking hot water and maintaining personal distancing. Many of their parents do not have time to teach them all these norms,” she said. S. Chandralekha, a Class 10 student who attended the programme, said she greatly benefited from it. “As schools and colleges are closed, many children are out on the roads with their friends. After this, they directly go home. This programme was an eye-opener,” she said. K. Kanchana, project coordinator, Thozhamai, said that even children below the age of 12 were taught at the micro-education centres in the locality. “This will be an ongoing process. We have to keep reminding the children to wear masks and keep washing their hands,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/college-students-ngo-launch-campaign-for-children/article34381402.ece

22 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State’s explanation of vaccine wastage unacceptable: Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin has said the explanation given by the Tamil Nadu government for wastage of COVID-19 vaccines is not acceptable. At a time when the State is facing a vaccine shortage, the news of Tamil Nadu topping the list in wastage comes as a shock, he said in a statement on Wednesday. He alleged that the AIADMK government was handling the second wave of COVID-19 carelessly as it did the first wave. He also voiced concern over the report that the Union government had diverted oxygen from Tamil Nadu to other States without consulting either the Chief Secretary or the “caretaker government”. Mr. Stalin wondered whether the oxygen shortage was due to the careless attitude of the BJP government at the Centre or its administrative failure. The current situation also raised a question whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi was only bothered about the Tamil Nadu and West Bengal elections and not the pandemic, he said. It was said Mr. Modi was an efficient administrator; if so, why did he fail to handle the pandemic properly, Mr. Stalin asked. The DMK president urged the State government to take urgent measures to stop vaccine wastage and ensure an adequate supply of oxygen. He also urged the Centre and the State to hold meetings and handle the situation effectively. Shock over pricing Mr. Stalin expressed shock over Serum Institute of India’s announcement that it would offer its Covishield vaccine at Rs. 400 a dose to the State governments, compared with Rs. 150 to the Centre. (Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla has clarified that the price will be Rs. 400 a dose for the Centre as well as the States). Mr. Stalin said the pricing would affect all the States. He said the finances of the States, including those of Tamil Nadu, had already been stressed, and they could not incur a higher vaccine cost. He urged the Centre to ensure that the vaccine-makers supplied at the same rate to both the Centre and the States. He demanded that the Centre allocate funds to the States to buy the vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/states-explanation-of-vaccine-wastage-unacceptable-stalin/article34380960.ece

22 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||All eligible transport employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19||The Transport Department has decided to speed up vaccination of its employees, comprising drivers and conductors, in the wake of a sharp spike in the cases of COVID-19. The department has identified 70,657 employees aged above 45 for receiving the vaccine. The eight State Transport Corporations (STCs), including the Metropolitan Transport Corporation, Chennai (MTC), have about 1.2 lakh employees. A senior official said more than 36% of the drivers and conductors had been vaccinated since March first week when the vaccination programme was rolled out. The department was taking steps to speed up the vaccination but because of shift timings and other work-related issues, employees above the age of 45 are expected to be vaccinated only by the end of May. Once all employees aged above 45 get vaccinated, the remaining workforce would be covered in the second phase, he added. Transport Secretary C. Samayamoorthy on Wednesday inspected the vaccination camp being conducted for drivers and conductors at the MTC headquarters in the city. Mr. Samayamoorthy said since the announcement of restrictions by the State government to disallow travel by standing on buses to avoid overcrowding and to maintain social distancing, the STCs have been suffering financial losses in the range of Rs. 12 crore to Rs. 15 crore daily. Despite the fall in fare collection, the Transport Department has advised all senior officials of all the corporations to operate more number of buses so that commuters did not face any inconvenience. The MTC, which operates 2,790 buses, has started operating an additional 350 buses daily. The MTC has a fleet of 3,300 buses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-eligible-transport-staff-to-be-vaccinated/article34381407.ece

The CII also urged these States to allow organisations exporting 100% of their production to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and classify them as essential services. All employees working in night shifts in the essential services sector should be allowed to travel without restrictions during lockdowns and night curfews, it said. “While Indian industry is well prepared and equipped for implementation of stricter health and safety protocols, the stringent implementation of safety norms are a better option than partial lockdowns,” said C.K.

22 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Oxygen diversion not at our cost: Minister||The Union government’s direction to divert 45 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Telangana from Tamil Nadu will not affect the requirement of hospitals since the State is producing it in surplus, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said on Wednesday. The State’s manufacturing capacity is 400 metric tonnes as against the current consumption of 240 metric tonnes. The storage capacity was increased to 1,200 metric tonnes at all major hospitals across the State during the first wave of COVID-19, he told The Hindu . Dr. Vijayabaskar said sufficient oxygenation pipeline infrastructure was also developed with the help of the Public Works Department last year to meet future demands. “We are very much willing to help the neighbouring States. But what worries us is the mandatory diversion clause... We have made it clear to the Union government that there would be no compromise on our demand-supply ratio. Helping others will certainly not be at the cost of our needs.” The Minister said Tamil Nadu’s future requirements of liquid oxygen would be closely monitored. “There will be no question of diversion of liquid oxygen by denying it to hospitals or patients here,” he said, adding that a couple of oxygenation plants were expected to come up in the State soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/oxygen-diversion-not-at-our-cost-minister/article34380956.ece
22 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Report on Special DGP submitted, says govt.||An Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), which inquired into a recent sexual harassment complaint lodged by a woman Superintendent of Police against a Special Director General of Police (now under suspension), has completed its proceedings after hearing all parties concerned and submitted its preliminary report, the State government informed the Madras High Court on Wednesday. Appearing before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, special senior counsel for the government A.L. Somayaji said the ICC’s preliminary report had been submitted to the government and that further course of action would follow in due course. The submissions were made during the hearing of a case filed by a retired police officer insisting upon a CBI probe into the issue. However, Mr. Somayaji brought to the notice of the court that Justice N. Anand Venkatesh of the High Court had already taken suo motu cognisance of the issue and was monitoring the probe conducted by the CB-CID. Stating that there could not be a better mechanism than a court-monitored probe, the senior counsel opposed the plea for a CBI probe. Advocate Abdul Saleem, representing the suspended Special DGP, also opposed the case on the ground that his client had already appeared in person before the ICC as well as the investigating officer of the CB-CID and answered all queries raised in connection with the complaint. After recording their submissions, the first Division Bench disposed of the case seeking a CBI probe as the CB-CID probe was being monitored by the High Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/report-on-special-dgp-submitted-says-govt/article34380957.ece

22 April 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Omni buses see poor patronage following night curfew||With the State government imposing night curfew to curb the spread of COVID-19, private omni buses that usually operate in the night have been seeing poor patronage during the day. At the Omni Bus Terminus in Gandhipuram within Coimbatore Corporation limits, scores of omni buses remained parked and only a few were operated on Wednesday. “We had only one service to Tiruchendur on Tuesday before the night curfew came to force,” R. Baskaran, president of Tamil Nadu Omni Bus Owners Association (Coimbatore) and an omni bus operator with 35 buses, said on Wednesday. Many of the omni buses were cancelled at the last minute on Monday owing to poor occupancy, he added. While the services are available to locations such as Chennai, Puducherry, Nagercoil, Madurai and Bengaluru, most of the passengers do not prefer travelling in the day in omni buses, according to Mr. Baskaran. Even in the omni buses that were operated, only about 10 to 15 seats were getting filled leading to financial loss to the bus operators. “Booking of at least 25 seats in a bus would help [the operators] to break even without facing any losses,” he said. A Regional Transport Officer from the city said that only about a dozen omni buses were operated on Tuesday from the Gandhipuram Omni Bus Terminus, while around 100 omni buses are usually operated by various operators. Regarding the COVID-19 safety protocol, the Transport Department has been inspecting all the omni buses whether they disinfect the vehicles after every trip, ensure wearing of masks and provide hand sanitisers to all the passengers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/omni-buses-see-poor-patronage-following-night-curfew/article34381428.ece

22 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corporation strengthens contact tracing exercise||In an effort aimed at breaking the COVID-19 chain, the Coimbatore Corporation has strengthened the exercise to trace the contacts of persons who had tested positive. Sources said, following instructions from Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian, the Corporation had deployed two employees in junior assistant rank to each of the 32 urban primary health centres for the exercise. Their job would be reach out to the positive persons, know about their workplace, other places they frequented and their travel history to identify primary and secondary contacts. After doing so, the junior assistants would pass on the information to the urban primary health centre concerned, from where people would get in touch with contacts to check if they had influenza-like infection. Though the Corporation had conducted a similar exercise – tracing primary and secondary contacts – last year during the lockdown, this time it was a more challenging exercise, at least as far as tracing secondary contacts. The sources explained that to trace the primary contacts, the junior assistants would visit the workplace or the neighbourhood of positive persons and identifying such persons was easy. But to find out, for example, who had shared a table at a restaurant with the positive person or who had commuted with him in a bus was not easy. The sources said the Corporation had also redeployed domestic breeding checkers to conduct door-to-door survey in the neighbourhood of positive persons. Once the checkers traced such persons, they would report to the primary health centre concerned from where a lab technician and nurse would go to the house of the person(s) with the influenza-like infection to collect samples. Sources said that the objective behind the exercises was early identification of positive persons and effective steps to break the chain of infections. On Wednesday, the Corporation collected 3,760 samples, conducted 55 fever camps and collected Rs. 61,800 as fine. The day also saw the civic body record 383 COVID-19 positive cases. Norm modified Hereafter, if a particular house had positive cases, the Corporation would stick a notice on it, stating that the house has been quarantined. There would be no barricades. Till now, the civic body had quarantined a part of the street or the entire stretch even if one house had such cases. However, the earlier practice of barricading a part of or the entire street would be resorted to if the number of cases was spread across houses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-strengthens-contact-tracing-exercise/article34381423.ece

Launching the programme at Raj Nivas, Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan singled out the wearing of masks as the most crucial component of COVID-19 prevention. “While we can scale up stocks of medicines and tests or ramp up bed capacity, the simplest way to contain the pandemic remains compliance with masking norms. This is why a supply chain for delivering masks and sanitisers at prices that are much lower than the market rates is being rolled out,” the Lt. Governor said. “At this stage of the pandemic and given the steps being taken to provide cheap protective wear, not wearing a mask is tantamount to an anti-social act,” she said. “Just like locking the house to prevent theft, you should wear a mask to prevent coronavirus,” she added. She also urged the public, especially the youth, to become ambassadors to raise awareness about vaccines and masks. These affordable masks and sanitiser bottles are available for immediate sale through the 70 Ponlait outlets in Puducherry. About four lakh masks would be bought and sold by the Health Department at subsidised rates, said T. Sudhakar, Managing Director, Ponlait. Earlier, inaugurating a vaccination campaign at the Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), the Lt. Governor emphasised that even a day’s delay in getting the vaccine would mean delaying antibody formation in the body. She urged the beneficiaries not to hesitate in getting vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-get-masks-for-rs-1-at-ponlait-milk-outlets/article34381573.ece

22 April 2021||Rajapalayam,TAMIL NADU||No vaccine for the fourth day in Rajapalayam, says CPI(M)||Communist Party of India (Marxist) members staged a protest seeking adequate supply of COVID-19 vaccines and life-saving drug Remdesivir in Government hospitals here on Wednesday. The protest was led by the party’s town secretary B. Mariappan. Mr. Mariappan charged that Rajapalayam Government hospital has run out of vaccine for the last four days. “Even today, people had to return home with disappointment as the hospital authorities said that they did not have stocks of vaccine,” he said. Besides, the party was opposed to Centre’s move of allowing State Governments to procure vaccine. The Centre should ensure that all people got vaccines free of cost. Stating that the acknowledgement of having taken the vaccine in the form of SMS was not being delivered on time on the mobile phones, Mr. Mariappan said that he received the message only eight days after he had taken the first dose. Besides, the SMS did not have any details on the next dose. “The SMS is the only acknowledgement for the people of having got vaccinated. If something untoward happens, the vaccinated person would not have any record of proof for vaccination,” he said. Mr. Mariappan alleged that Remdesivir was also not available in adequate quantity in Government hospitals. The administration should also take steps to increase the number of swab tests, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-vaccine-for-the-fourth-day-in-rajapalayam-cpim/article34380968.ece

22 April 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Adopt biological method to control black bug menace’||Farmers have been advised to adopt biological or mechanical methods or spray chemicals to control the black bug menace on paddy crop noticed in certain parts of the delta. In a press release, V.Ambethgar, director, Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute, Aduthurai, said that the institute received information that the presence of Scotinophara lurida (Burmeister), known as rice black bug (RBB) or psunami vandu in local parlance, was noticed on the paddy crop particularly in the coastal areas and it was multiplying rapidly. The pest attacks the rice plant at almost all the stages of growth and results in severe to complete crop loss during heavy infestation.If a rice plant was infested with about 10 to 15 RBB per hill, then it could cause a yield loss of around 25 per cent. Pointing out that the study of RBB carried out for about a decade has revealed that these insects were noticed in the fields during or after a full moon period, he said that it was ascertained that the full moon cycle affects the RBB’s flight activity. Farmers were advised to adopt light trapping technology since the RBBs are highly attracted to the high intensity of light. In case if humid weather condition prevails in the late season of the crop, insecticides can be used, he said. If further details required, the farmers could contact the Institutes’s Assistant Professor (Agriculture Entomology), P.Anandhi (0435 – 2472108).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/adopt-biological-method-to-control-black-bug-menace/article34380930.ece

With the rise in cases, the Kerala authorities said that as a precautionary measure, they would permit only those people, who had a certificate stating that they had tested negative to the virus. Also, the e-pass was made mandatory. However, workers from Theni district said that they had obtained the e-pass as instructed by the Kerala authorities for a period of six months. But, the ‘sudden’ announcement to have COVID-19 negative certificates took them by shock. As the police personnel at the check post were clear on seeing the certificate, the workers returned. As they came near Cumbum by pass, they resorted to a road blockade. Cumbum North Police officials came to the spot and held talks. As the workers insisted that they would give up the stir only if they were allowed to go for work, the TN police held talks with their counterparts to permit the workers to go for work today with the e-pass.

22 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Omni buses ply with full capacity||Omni buses operate with full capacity during the day as night buses stood cancelled due to the night curfew in the state. Bus operators, however, say that their business was taking a hit and demanded compensation from the government. At least five buses operated by different travel agencies ran at full capacity to both Chennai and Bengaluru on Wednesday morning, hours after the night curfew was lifted. ‘The crowd is temporary. They are travelling to Chennai for work. After the first few days, we will run empty buses,’ a bus operator said. Some passengers were rushing to various places along the Chennai route such as Villupuram, as many had been given work-from-home options and were returning home. ‘We were ready to travel last night but due to the night curfew, we had to wait for a bus in the morning,’ said M. Sivaprakash, a techie in the city. The bus services at the Omni bus stand stop by afternoon, as the buses must reach their destination before 10 pm. ‘Our last bus to Chennai is at 2 p.m. while buses to Bengaluru stop by noon,’ a bus operator said. The passengers and bus operators agreed that travelling during the day was inconvenient. ‘We are forced to travel through the day wasting an entire day on a bus. When travelling during night, one reaches the destination in the morning and is ready for the work the next day,’ he said. The summer heat making several stops for food and lunch and having to halt at the destination for nearly 12 hours inconveniences the bus operators, they said.  R. Balakrishnan, president, Tiruchi Omni Bus Operators Association, said that their business has taken a severe beating over the last year. ‘Only around December till February did we have some travellers. Since March, it has come down once again,’ he said. Representatives of various omni bus operators associations across the state had met the Transport Commissioner on Tuesday seeking their intervention. The representatives sought waivers in road tax, loans taken against the buses. ‘We have told them that by May 1 if the night curfew persists, we will stop our services entirely,’ he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/omni-buses-ply-with-full-capacity/article34380934.ece
22 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Archaeology Dept. makes encouraging finds near Gangaikondacholapuram||The State Department of Archaeology has made some encouraging finds during the excavation at Maligaimedu, near Gangaikondacholapuram, the capital of King Rajendra Chola I. “Thirteen coarse brick walls have been exposed so far at the site. A copper coin, some potsherds and iron pieces have been collected. Besides, a piece of Chinese celadon ware, belonging to the 10th-11th century, has been found,” R. Sivanandam, Deputy Director of Archaeology, told The Hindu . “We have to send the coin for chemical cleaning, but going by its circular shape, we can assume it belongs the Chola period. The presence of celadon ware is indicative of the trade ties that existed [between the two countries] then,” Mr. Sivanandam said. “We have to dig further to assess the brick structures fully,” he added. Gangaikondacholapuram was established by King Rajendra Chola I (1012-1044 CE) after his victorious expedition up to the Gangetic plains. Excavations conducted earlier at Maligaimedu had revealed the remains of a royal palace. The previous excavations were carried out at the site on a smaller scale on six occasions when portions of Rajendra Chola’s palace were unearthed. Antiques and other items found in the excavations are on display at a museum in Gangaikondacholapuram. The present excavation at the site began towards the end of February after conducting surveys using drone, thermal cameras and ground penetrating radars with the help of various agencies. Excavation is now underway at five trenches at the site. The department is looking to take up exploration on a larger scale now to find out more about the palace, the city and its streets. The site is one of the seven identified for excavation in the State by the department. In January, T. Udayachandran, Principal Secretary and Commissioner of the Department, had announced plans to launch excavations at the seven sites after the Central Advisory Board for Archaeology granted permission for the projects. The excavation is being conducted under the supervision of S. Nandakumar, director of site; K. Bagyalakshmi, co-director; Umayal and Subhalakshmi, archaeological officers, besides three research assistants. About 30-40 workers are engaged in the excavation, which will go on till the beginning of the monsoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/archaeology-dept-makes-encouraging-finds-near-gangaikondacholapuram/article34380949.ece

However, officials are of the view that there will be literally no space if all 77 candidates in Karur constituency and 44 candidates in Aravakurichi constituency depute each one to 14 tables. “We have requested the Independent candidates of Karur and Aravakurichi candidates to limit their agents in view of the prevailing COVID-19 situation. Some of them have agreed not to appoint agents except for their presence. We hope that better sense will prevail,” said a senior officer in Karur. In Tiruchi, Collector cum District Election Officer S. Divyadharshini held an all-party meeting here on Tuesday to solicit the views of political parties on enforcing COVID-19 norms. “If we need to enforce safety norms, it is inevitable to reduce the number of tables to restrict the number of officials and agents. It will lead to an increase in the number of rounds,” an official, who took part in the meeting said. He said that an idea had been mooted to make compulsory for the officials and the agents to get themselves tested for COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-few-changes-likely-at-counting-centres/article34380946.ece

22 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Sweet stalls and bakeries in a fix||Hoteliers are in a fix over the lack of clarity on the opening of sweet stalls and bakeries on Sundays. As per a recent Government Order, restaurants are not permitted to offer dining services on Sundays. However, they can offer take-away service. Owners of restaurants say that the G.O. is silent on opening sweet stalls and bakeries, which have been categorised under the list of restaurants. In the first phase of nationwide lockdown in 2020, they say that they were allowed to run as usual to offer parcel service. According to a rough estimate, around 150 to 200 bakeries and sweet stalls function in Tiruchi. A section of them had kept open during the first phase of the lockdown with the skeletal strength of workers. They are not sure whether to offer parcel service this time. There is no clarity from the Government on opening sweet stalls on Sundays, says a proprietor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sweet-stalls-and-bakeries-in-a-fix/article34380945.ece

Of it, 10,410 doses have been released for use across the district for the next three days while the remaining 13,890 has been reserved until further instructions are provided by the Directorate of Public Health.

Notwithstanding the reserved 13,980 doses, the vaccine stock would last until the end of this week, he added. On Wednesday, only 1786 people received vaccine shots, of which 1103 were people taking their second dose. ‘This is because we had reserved most of the doses for people coming to get their second dose. But with the new delivery, we will be able to vaccinate everyone till the end of this week,’ a senior health official said.

22 April 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Allow us to perform or give us relief: folk artistes||Seeking permission for performing folk arts during temple festivals up to midnight, the folk artistes submitted a petition at the Collectorate on Wednesday. Led by their president Pon Pandi and secretary T. A. Sudalai Kani, members of Confederation of Folk Artistes Welfare Association of Tirunelveli District, submitted the petition even as good number of ‘karagam’ exponents performed in the traditional attire. The petitioners said that the lives of over 4,000 folk artistes of the district that had got affected due to the pandemic in last March was yet to improve as the restrictions on performance during temple festival was continuing. Even as the artistes were eagerly waiting for the new season that would usually start in Chiththirai, the first month of Tamil calendar, the latest round of restrictions had wiped-out their hopes. “We used to get offers during temple festivals organised between ‘Panguni’ and ‘Vaikaasi’ wherein we used to perform between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. Since the Tamil Nadu Government has imposed restrictions in the wake of pandemic, no one has received offers so far, thus leaving our families in the lurch. Considering our pathetic condition, the State Government should allow us to perform during the temple festivals at least up to midnight. Or, the government should give us Rs. 10,000 per artiste for the loss we’re facing now even though they have not registered their names with the welfare board,” Mr. Pon Pandi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allow-us-to-perform-or-give-us-relief-folk-artistes/article34381620.ece
22 April 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||‘Increase fuel quota for sending samples to testing centres’||Former Radhapuram MLA M. Apapvu has appealed to the State Government to increase the quantum of diesel and allowance being given to Government hospitals and primary health centres for sending the COVID-19 test samples to the testing centres so as to get the results at the earliest and ensure proper treatment to the people on time. In a memorandum submitted to Chief Secretary Rajiv Ranjan on Wednesday, Mr. Appavu said Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, 10 Ggovernment hospitals and 44 primary health centres across the district were catering to the needs of the people during this pandemic. When the samples are collected in the PHCs, it should be taken to the testing centre within the stipulated time for which the government has allowed Rs. 5,000 and 55 litres of diesel per month, which is insufficient. Consequently, results of the tests and the treatment of the positive patients are getting delayed and they are forced to be in home quarantine as medical facility in their area is limited. Moreover, proper steps should be taken immediately to screen a few thousand contract labourers working with Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project, Indian Space Research Organisation’s Propulsion Research Complex at Mahendragiri in the district. The quantum of diesel being given for the Medical Officers for sending the samples to the testing facility should be increased. Sufficient number of personnel should be appointed in the PHCs to take care of the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in home quarantine, Mr. Appavu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/increase-fuel-quota-for-sending-samples-to-testing-centres/article34381618.ece
22 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Two timber importers picked up in cocaine case||Officials of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) have picked up two timber importers of Shencottai in Tenkasi district for interrogation in connection with the seizure of 303 kg of cocaine. The drug was found in a ship that ferried timber from Panama to the VOC Port at Thoothukudi. When the ship berthed at the port on Tuesday, having passed through the Antwerp and Colombo ports, DRI officials checked eight containers based on a tip-off. Since nine bags containing cocaine had been found amid logs in one of the containers, the officials seized the drug, worth Rs. 1,500 crore in the international market, and picked up the two importers who had ordered the logs. The officials are not buying their claim that they had nothing to do with the drug, suspecting that the drug mafia operating from the South American nations could be part of this cartel. The DRI and the Narcotics Control Bureau suspect that the drug mafia is making repeated attempts to strengthen its base in Thoothukudi. The DRI said the nature of the confiscated substance would be known only after analysis, but it was believed to be cocaine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-timber-importers-picked-up-in-cocaine-case/article34380952.ece

22 April 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Two arrested for poisoning carcass that led to death of tigress||After an investigation spanning over five months, the Forest department arrested two men who allegedly poisoned a carcass that killed an adult tigress in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR). The death of the tigress resulted in two cubs being orphaned. The cubs were taken to the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai to be raised in captivity. The forest department identified the accused as Ahmed Kabeer, from Achakarai and B. Kariyan, from Kurumbarpadi, both villages located near Masinagudi in the MTR buffer zone. Two others, identified as S. Saddam, and Shaukat Ali, are absconding. Speaking to The Hindu , L.C.S.Srikanth, Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone), said that all four accused were cattle owners whose livestock were occasionally being lifted by wildlife. “Though they had not targeted any one animal in particular, they wanted to poison the carnivore that was attacking their livestock,” said Mr. Srikanth. Mr. Srikanth said that the investigation took a very long time to complete as they had to wait for test results of the stomach contents of the tiger, and collecting evidence. “Mr. Kariyan had been absconding since the incident happened. He returned a few days back to attend a function, when we detained him for questioning. We managed to piece together more evidence based on his testimony and have arrested one of the men who was also responsible,” said Mr. Srikanth. With the latest arrests, the Forest department has cracked three major cases relating to wildlife crimes in the tiger reserve that have occurred in the last 12 months, including a poisoning that led to the death of five Asiatic wild dogs and the elephant burning case, where the owners of a private resort threw a burning projectile on the animal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-arrested-for-poisoning-carcass-that-led-to-death-of-tigress/article34380982.ece
22 April 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||HMs of tribal schools suspended for misappropriation of funds||Two headmasters of Government Tribal Schools (GTR) in Gudalur were suspended after allegations of misappropriation of funds meant for Adivasi students surfaced. According to sources in the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department, two headmasters of the Devala and Ponnani GTR schools were accused of misappropriating funds meant for around 45 students at the schools. “Each student was to receive Rs. 7,300, which would have been spent by the department on food and lodging. The headmasters were asked to deposit the money in the accounts of the students’ parents,” said an official requesting anonymity. The money was for students who usually stay at the residential schools but were unable to do so due to the pandemic. The two headmasters – Bakkiyasenan and Sekar, were alleged to have misappropriated the funds by depositing the money into accounts of non-beneficiaries. Complaints were raised by the parents with the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department and an inquiry was conducted. Officials said investigations revealed the money was not debited into the accounts of the beneficiaries. “As the students are from Adivasi communities, many parents do not have bank accounts. The two headmasters’ defence is that the money was deposited into the accounts of the students’ relatives who did have bank accounts,” said the source. When contacted, Suganthi Parimalam, District Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Officer, confirmed that the two headmasters had been suspended. “We are continuing our investigations into the allegations made by the parents. We are now taking efforts to make sure that the money reaches the proper beneficiaries,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hms-of-tribal-schools-suspended-for-misappropriation-of-funds/article34381434.ece

22 April 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Virudhunagar receives 10,500 doses of Covishield||Six days after several vaccination centres in Virudhunagar district ran out of stocks, the district on Wednesday received 10,500 doses, a meagre quantity of Covishield vaccine, which can last only for two days. With the district having 95 vaccination centres, including private hospitals, the present stock will not be sufficient to continue with vaccination beyond two days. While the district had been administering vaccines to around 4,000 persons every day, the administration had planned to increase the daily vaccination to 7,500 doses, as per the district Monitoring Officer S. Madhumathi. “Already, all vaccination centres have a backlog for thousands of people who were scheduled to get their second dose, but could not get them in many centres for the last six days. The present stock cannot even fulfill the backlog requirements,” an official said. Every day people have been visiting the centres and returning home disappointed. The official said that private hospitals were facing more pressure as they had either collected the money for second dosage in advance or had issued tokens with details of schedule for second dose. People who had been administered Covaxin injection have been given the second dosage too. The district had received very limited quantity of Covaxin. A senior doctor expressed apprehension about sudden surge in demand for the vaccine after the Centre opened up vaccination for all persons above 18 years from May 1. A senior official at a Government hospital in the district said that all those who returned home due to lack of vaccine had registered their names along with phone numbers in the last six days. “We will send reminder through SMS to those people in the order of their visit and they would be given preference during the vaccination. In all probability, the meagre doses will be exhausted on Thursday,” he added. However, a senior medical officer exuded hope that more doses will arrive soon. The spurt in number of COVID-19 positive persons has driven people, who were hesitant to take the jab, to get vaccinated.  New cases The district on Wednesday recorded 101 new positive cases and 27 discharges. The district, which has so far reported 237 deaths, has got seven containment zones – Veeracholan, Manoor, Narikudi, Thammanayakkanpatti, Moolipatti, Periyavallikulam and Soolakkaraimedu.

22 April 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||ECI allows 14 tables for each round of counting in Virudhunagar||The Election Commission has decided to allow 14 tables in each counting hall for the seven Assembly constituencies in the district while taking up counting of votes on May 2. The decision was conveyed by Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo during a video conference with District Election Officers held on Wednesday. Earlier, there was mixed reaction among political parties on taking up simultaneous counting in two halls for each round of counting during a consultative meeting held here on Tuesday. This proposal was made by Virudhunagar District Election Officer R. Kannan, after the ECI came up with a restriction that 250 sq ft of space should be allocated for each table. The space constraint considering the new ECI norm as COVID-19 precautionary measure forced the officials to go for two counting centres as only eight tables were allowed in each round. This would have led to more number of rounds in each constituency and would have taken more than 24 hours to complete the counting process. “Now the ECI has decided that each person inside the counting hall should be provided 4 sq. feet of space. Considering this rule, we have got 6 sq ft to 9 sq ft of space given the number of counting staff and agents in each hall,” said Mr. Kannan. The seven counting halls have a minimum of 1,970 sq. ft. space, which is more than the maximum requirement of space, he said. As a result, the counting could be completed between 23 rounds (for Aruppukottai and Tiruchuli Assembly) and 27 rounds (for Sivakasi AC). Counting of votes EVM-based votes and postal ballots will be taken up at 8.30 a.m. on May 2. The results are likely to be declared by evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eci-allows-14-tables-for-each-round-of-counting/article34380974.ece

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Talavadi farmers want value addition for tomatoes||Procurement of tomatoes at Rs. 1 a kg is a perennial problem faced by farmers in Talavadi hills who want value addition for their produce, to fetch better income. Tomato, onion, chilly, potato, turnip, cauliflower, cabbage, ginger, beans, brinjal, beetroot, carrot, garlic, radish are the crops cultivated in over 35 villages in Talavadi that is located 120 km from Erode and borders Karnataka. In the absence of adequate transport facility and marketing opportunities, vegetables are taken to the 11 mandis and auctioned from where traders transport to wholesale markets in Erode, Coimbatore and Kerala. Hence, farmers are not getting the right price for their produce and were long demanding for effective steps to improve their livelihood. Tomato is a major crop cultivated in the hilltop during November-December and harvesting is done in March-April. But tomatoes are currently procured at Rs. 1 to Rs. 2 a kg from them whereas the cost of cultivation is Rs. 5 kg. “Many farmers failed to pluck tomatoes as they are not getting the price even to cover the labour cost,” said S. Manickam, a farmer of Talavadi, who had sold tomatoes for Rs. 2 a kg recently. In the absence of a cold storage facility, farmers were forced to sell their produce at the price fixed by the traders, he added. Since tomatoes are available in large quantities, it can be processed into pulp, puree or paste so that it is purchased by tomato product manufacturing companies. “If processing units cannot be started for lack of investments, mobile processing units can be deployed in the hill areas and the product can be marketed,” said Duraisamy of Gettavadi. Farmers said that processing and value addition to their produce would fetch better and stable income and improve their livelihood. “It is a perennial problem that remains unattended for many decades,” he added and wanted the new State government to fulfil their long demand. Farmers said that when the production drops after May, the price of tomatoes would go up significantly. “But even then, we will not get a good price as traders fix the price,” he said and added that tomatoes also come from Chamrajanagar to the mandis. Farmers also suggest that a regulated market could be established at Talavadi where they can sell their produce at a reasonable price. “Or the government should fix procurement rates for the vegetables grown here so that we could get at least a minimum profit”, said another farmer Velusamy of Panakahalli in the hilltop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/talavadi-farmers-want-value-addition-for-tomatoes/article34380977.ece

The demand for oxygen is high right now, and we are definitely anticipating oxygen scarcity if the situation continues for the next few weeks. In fact, scarcity has already happened at a few centres. So we think twice before taking in such patients,” he said.  No breathing space Anticipating a shortage, they were hesitant to take in already intubated patients. “Though we have beds, doctors and nurses, it will be of no use if we take in patients without adequate oxygen. Unlike last year, when the State was under lockdown, there is no breathing space now. Hospitals are flooded with patients, and we are in a dire need of a breather,” he said. “Right now, oxygen supply is not a major issue. We are in a quite comfortable position as far as liquid oxygen is concerned. But we can anticipate issues if it is not augmented in two to three days. Oxygen is directly transported through the companies. The problem is that the demand is so high that delivery may take longer. So the issue is not short supply of oxygen but probably transportation due to the vast supplies,” T.N. Ravishankar, senior practitioner and director of Sudar Hospitals, which has 35 beds each at three different places near Tambaram. Oxygen suppliers, Dr. Ravishankar said, could provide for major hospitals that required large volumes every month. Some corporate hospitals in Chennai are in a better position. One hospital official said, “We have close to a month of supply as of today. But the Central and State governments’ prospective regulations may create a crunch.” A rational use of available oxygen was important, said K.R. Vijay Chakkaravarthy, a critical care specialist. “Sick patients can be maintained at an oxygen saturation of 92 to 94. We will need three to four litres of oxygen to maintain this level. Patients on ventilator or high-flow nasal cannula need plenty of oxygen, at least 50 to 60 litres per minute. These patients with severe pneumonia can be maintained at an oxygen saturation of 88 to 92, which is universally recommended. If we target a higher saturation, it may lead to a higher, unnecessary oxygen consumption. We are focusing on oxygen targets, depending on patients, for which we are training our nurses and doctors,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/smaller-hospitals-in-chennai-feel-the-pinch/article34380958.ece
22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||‘Velammal hospital performed 113 transplants’||The Velammal Medical College Hospital and Research Institute in Madurai has successfully performed 113 transplants, including kidney and liver, over the last three years, according to its chairman M.V. Muthuramalingam. Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, he said recognition from the State government in the form of ‘best transplant centre' award consecutively for three years came as a motivation to the team of surgeons, physicians and medicos at the hospital. Stressing the need for organ donation, he said during the COVID-19 pandemic, the hospital performed liver transplants on two critically ill patients — a 13-month-old boy from a village near Rameswaram and a 46-year-old man suffering from jaundice. Transplant surgeon Senthil said the diagnosis for the baby boy, weighing just 10 kg, indicated that he had jaundice when he was six months old. He was the recipient of a liver from a four-year-old brain dead patient from JIPMER, Puducherry. After the successsful transplant, the child was recovering. Similarly, in the case of the 46-year-old man, live liver transplant became possible after a family member came forward to be a donor. The patient showed signs of recovery at the hospital. Besides the coordination of doctors and surgeons from multi-departments, the infrastructural facilities at the hospital also played a key role in executing such complex transplants. Earlier, patients would be referred to Chennai or other cities for transplants. Now, it was no longer required for patients to travel long distances, Dr. Senthil added. Alwar Ramanujam, Head, Department of Solid Organ Transplant, said liver disease was seeing a rise. Though there were many causal factors, alcohol consumption and obesity were key areas to be looked into. The State government’s Chief Minister Medical Health Insurance Scheme, which was available at Velammal hospital, had come as a boon to economically weaker sections, especially, in transplant surgeries. Suggesting a few tips, he said physical exercise for about 30 minutes daily and intake of vegetables and fruits would keep people, especially those above 45 years, in good shape. With four lakh patients dying every year due to non-availability of organs at the right time, it would be ideal to be fit and healthy. He appealed to the media to campaign for more organ donations as it was rebirth to needy patients.

The former Minister and society chairman M.B. Patil has in a release said that the hospitals would collect only 25% of the fees prescribed by the State government for various categories of patients. The government has fixed Rs. 10,000 as fee for non-oxygen beds in general wards. This has been reduced to Rs. 3,000. Similarly, a general ward bed with oxygen will be charged Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 8,000 will be collected instead of the government fixed price of Rs. 25,000, Mr. Patil said. Reduced prices were introduced two months ago. This will be continued for all, he said. The hospital will have 500 beds for COVID-19 patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/blde-hospitals-reduce-fee/article34381003.ece

22 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Patients in a dilemma as hospital beds become scarce||When a 35-year-old software professional tested positive for COVID-19, a telemedicine specialist that he consulted advised home isolation as he had no symptoms initially. However, when he developed some mild symptoms after two days, the doctor advised him to get a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) done and the scan showed significant changes in his lung. From then on the infection progressed rapidly and oxygen saturation levels too dropped. He required hospitalisation at the earliest, but by the time he got a bed his condition had further worsened and he required ICU admission. Doctors said early intervention would have helped in easily managing the case with oxygen in a high dependency unit. It is not just beds that patients are finding hard to find, but also oxygen and other essential COVID-19 drugs. In fact, several patients have lost lives waiting for a bed and oxygen in the last few days as most smaller hospitals have run out of oxygen. After testing positive for the disease, most patients are in a dilemma over whether to look for a bed immediately or not. “If I wait till my symptoms worsen and then start looking for a bed, I am worried my condition would deteriorate by the time I get a bed given the scarcity. So, I have been continuously calling the government helplines 1912 and 108 requesting a bed allotment,” said a 27-year-old Zoya Fathima, who has only mild symptoms. Monitoring weak V. Ravi, member, State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), who is also the nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said the patients’ dilemma can be addressed if there is proper monitoring of those in home isolation. “In the second wave because of the huge number of cases being reported daily, monitoring of those in home isolation has become a huge challenge. This is our weakest point during the second wave and people are developing complications,” he said. Haleema Yezdani, a general physician who has been regularly tele-triaging and tele-treating COVID-19 patients through the Emergency Response Team and Project StepOne groups that offer free service to people in getting beds and treatment, said people should not ignore any symptoms such as fever, body ache, headache, cold, cough among others. “It is better to seek medical advice at the earliest. Depending on the symptoms and investigations, the doctor will decide if a patient requires admission or not,” she said. Stating that the patients’ dilemma is natural, Dr. Yezdani said the need of the hour is to start more COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs). “Malls, idgah maidans and even big complexes can be converted into CCCs and patients can be monitored there,” she added. Six-minute walk test Mr. Ravi said it is important that people have a pulse oximeter handy and monitor their oxygen saturation regularly. Advising a six-minute walk test, he said, “The individual will have to walk for six straight minutes, without a pause, on an even surface with the oximeter on the finger. After six minutes, if the oxygen level does not go down, the individual is considered healthy. Saturation should not go below 94. This test will help in early identification.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/patients-in-a-dilemma-as-hospital-beds-become-scarce/article34381015.ece
22 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||RTC workers’ strike ends without settlement||One of the longest strikes by the road transport corporations ended on Wednesday without a settlement. Even after observing the strike for 15 days, employees were unable to get the cash-strapped State government to revise their salaries as per the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. The State government categorically refused to entertain any talks with the KSRTC Employees League, the union that had called for the strike. However, the government had yielded to eight of the nine demands even before employees went on strike. On the contentious issue of salary revision, the government had promised interim relief of 8% hike to be paid to them after elections. The government maintained that it had paid over Rs. 2,000 crore towards the salary of the staff during the lockdown despite facing severe financial constraints. Nevertheless, the league decided to go ahead with the strike, a decision that did not garner it much sympathy especially as Karnataka was fighting a fierce second wave of COVID-19. Many feel that the outcome of the strike undermined RTC employees, causing them more troubles. H.V. Ananthasubba Rao, president of KSRTC Staff and Workers Federation, said until now all their strikes had ended in settlements and there was no victimisation of employees. For the first time, bus stands of KSRTC, BMTC and others opened for private operators. “This will open the floodgate for privatisation. The timing was bad, as people are dying because of the pandemic and hospitals are full. The strike has projected KSRTC employees in poor light,” Mr. Rao added.  Due to the pandemic, RTCs incurred revenue loss of over Rs. 4,000 crore. They also started raising loans from banks to pay pending bills related to pension and provident fund. The RTCs used every trick in the playbook to foil the strike from issuing notices to over 7,600 employees, suspending more than 2,900 and even dismissing 1,970 people who were on their rolls. The labour union declared the strike illegal. Employees who took part in the strike were not paid salaries for March. When asked about how they were going to protect the interest of employees who were dismissed or suspended from service, president of KSRTC Employees League R. Chandrashekar said: “Managements have taken illegal action against the employees. We will approach the High Court seeking justice.” However, managing director of BMTC C. Shikha said there was no question of reinstating dismissed trainee employees as they had violated rules by taking part in the strike. “Employees who have been suspended from service will face disciplinary action as per the set rules. Further action will be taken based on their response.” Mr. Rao claimed that Kodihalli Chandrashekar, honorary president of the league, was not aware of the issues. “In December, they started a strike with a demand to consider RTC workers as government employees. They later gave that up and started asking for pay revision as per Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. Two days ago, Mr. Kodihalli said some employees had gone to the court earlier and that the court had ordered a salary hike of 20% from 2004 with 6% interest. He claimed that if implemented. it would be more than the Pay Commission recommendations,” said Mr. Rao. “It was our union that had raised the demand, which was referred to the Industrial Tribunal in Bengaluru not the High Court. After a 12-year struggle, in August 2017, the tribunal gave order on eight or nine points, including revision salary by 20% from January 1, 2004. Later, the management approached the court and brought a stay. He is referring to this case and saying some staff approached the court. If he wants revisions as per the tribunal, why was the strike needed?” asked Mr. Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rtc-workers-strike-ends-without-settlement/article34381032.ece
22 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Hotels, theatres, gyms seek relief from govt.||Many parts of Bengaluru, which would have otherwise been packed, were noticeably empty on Wednesday, a day after the government introduced restrictions and shut down theatres, hotels, malls, and gyms for two weeks. People whose livelihoods are dependent on these sectors fear that the “semi-lockdown” will be extended beyond the two weeks. Any such extension will “ruin our business irrevocably”, said proprietors who are still to recover from last year’s lockdown. Chandrashekhar Hebbar, president, Karnataka Regional Hotels’ and Restaurants’ Association, argued that opening only for takeaways was not viable. Most hotels will shut shop, he predicted. “Already hit from the restrictions last year, nearly 3,000 hotels wound up business. This year too, we may see a repeat of the situation,” he said. The association demanded that the government provide relief packages such as exemption from taxes, rebates in utility bills and monetary support for hotel employees. “If the restrictions are extended, which we fear will be the case, there will be large-scale job losses in the sector,” he said. He also argued that hotels must be allowed to function at 50% occupancy. “If a person can travel in a bus across the State for several hours with others, why can’t he have some food or drink coffee at our hotels?” Proprietors of film theatres and gyms owners held a similar view. K.V. Chandrashekhar, president, Karnataka Film Exhibitors Association, said many theatres may be forced to permanently close. “The impact of the lockdown last year was so severe that at least a hundred theatres never reopened. The government is closing down theatres, and film teams are going to OTT platforms. While the government is ready to impose restrictions, is it unwilling to give us exemptions even in property tax? It lacks empathy,” he said.  Meanwhile, Uday Garudachar, BJP MLA from Chickpet and owner of a chain of malls in the city and Mysuru, said malls remained closed for nearly seven months last year. “None of the businesses are in a position to pay salaries to their employees. Meanwhile, they are also unlikely to pay rent to mall owners,” he said, hoping the restrictions won’t be extended beyond two weeks, for which they are imposed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hotels-theatres-gyms-seek-relief-from-govt/article34381386.ece

22 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Oxygen crisis a consequence of storage and refilling issues: Sudhakar||There are seven liquid oxygen plants in Karnataka which together manufacture 812 metric tonnes of oxygen per day. The State is facing a crisis currently despite this owing largely to problems in storage and refilling. “We have adequate oxygen in our plants but smaller hospitals do not have storage facilities as they have been managing by refilling small cylinders so far. Now with increased consumption, the refilling has to be done at least three times a day and this is where the problem lies,” said Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar Pointing out that JSW has agreed to give 40 metric tonnes to Bengaluru, he said 5,000 additional cylinders are also being procured. Another company has agreed to give 500 more cylinders under CSR funds. With complaints pouring in regarding shortage and blackmarketing of oxygen and Remdesivir, the State government has set up a 24/7 call centre that can handle ten calls at a time. Passing an order to this effect, the State Drugs Controller appointed 26 officers to work in three shifts and facilitate and coordinate oxygen and Remdisivir supply. Artificial scarcity The Health Department on Wednesday initiated action against Assistant Drugs Controller B.R. Venkatesh and placed him under suspension for creating artificial scarcity of the vital drug. Calling the current surge in COVID-19 cases an ‘unprecedented situation’, Mr. Sudhakar called upon people to not rush to hospitals just as they test positive. “Over 95% of cases - all asymptomatic and mild - can be managed at home under the supervision of our telemedicine specialists. If those with mild symptoms go and get admitted, a critical patient who needs hospitalisation will be deprived of medical care, which can be fatal,” he said.  Remdesivir not for all Consultant Pulmonologist at Apollo Hospitals Ravindra Mehta, who is part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said the panic over non-availability of Remdesivir is unnecessary as not all require this injection. “Only those with moderate and severe infection wherein the oxygen saturation drops below 93 within the first nine days of illness are eligible for Remdesivir. It is only an add-on therapy and can help in improving the patient’s condition. While the WHO says it does not impact on mortality, previous literature has shown that it can hasten recovery and reduce hospital stay,” he said. He added that the demand can be reduced if it is given to only those who require it. Non-COVID-19 patients All small hospitals with less than 30 beds will now have to treat only non-COVID-19 patients. An order to this effect will be issued. This is to prevent loss of lives due to logistical issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/oxygen-crisis-a-consequence-of-storage-and-refilling-issues-sudhakar/article34381018.ece

Ashoka has announced that more places will be allotted for the last rites. Speaking at a press conference with Health Minister K. Sudhakar and Tejasvi Surya, MP, on Wednesday, Mr. Ashoka said bodies from surrounding villages are being brought to the city to be burnt, which is adding another 40 to 50 bodies to the city’s already overburdened infrastructure. “Four acres have been identified in Tavarekere for open burning and it will be arranged for immediately. Five to six places in Bengaluru have been identified. All DCs have also been told to identify government lands and gomalas one kilometre away from villages to be utilised for the purpose. We will arrange for whatever infrastructure is necessary for the last rites in two to three days,” he said. Dr. Sudhakar said the government has already allotted 49 hire vans and there may not be need for more. “If somebody is exploiting the situation, we will take action,” said Mr. Ashoka and Dr. Sudhakar, responding to allegations of such ambulances charging exorbitant amounts to transport COVID 19 fatalities. The Minister acknowledged the need to augment ICU beds and said the government is considering adding another 2,000. Speaking at the press conference, Mr. Surya said to enforce the 50% beds that private hospitals are required to give for COVID-19 patients, he and other officials and Ministers will start inspecting every hospital with over 30 beds. To prevent the long queues outside crematoria, the BBMP has decided to open all 12 crematoria for victims of COVID-19 as well as other reasons. Earlier, only seven of the 12 were designated to handle COVID-19 deaths. The government also said that people will now be allowed to cremate or bury on their lands following the COVID-19 protocols.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/more-places-to-be-identified-for-last-rites/article34381383.ece

Shivakumar termed ‘discriminatory’ the differential pricing of the COVID-19 vaccine by States and private hospitals and said it would adversely affect vaccination coverage. “Differential pricing to States and private hospitals for procurement of vaccine is discriminatory and will affect vaccination coverage. In a National Health Emergency, profiteering must not be allowed. The Centre and State government must make vaccination free for 18+ years as a welfare measure,” the Karnataka Congress chief tweeted. The Serum Institute of India on Wednesday announced that its Covishield vaccine will be made available to State governments at a price of Rs. 400 per dose and to private hospitals at Rs. 600 per dose. Earlier, speaking to mediapersons, the Congress leader alleged that the BJP governments in the State and in the Centre had failed to contain the spread of the virus owing to lack of strategy and experience. None of the Ministers had gone to the districts. Instead of holding meetings, the authorities should have deployed all IAS, KAS officers and engineers in PWD, Irrigation and Energy Departments to handle the crisis, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/differential-pricing-discriminatory-dks/article34381012.ece
22 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Urdu translator Syed Ahmed Esar dead||Noted Urdu writer and translator Syed Ahmed Esar, 98, known for his translations of classical Persian poetry of Allama Iqbal and Rumi into Urdu, passed away in Bengaluru on Wednesday. His son Syed Sultan said that he was suffering from age-related ailments and was hospitalised on Tuesday night. Born in the garrison of Mysore Lancers in Munireddy Palya to a World War I veteran in 1922, Syed Ahmed Esar lived in the narrow Sher Khan Galli off Avenue Road almost all his life. A former Indian Forest Service officer, he worked as the Chief Conservator of Forests, Karnataka, and retired from service in 1980. Though his interest in classical Persian poetry began at a very young age and he began trying his hand at poetry adopting a pen name “Esar”, which he later added to his name, his first collection of translation was published only in 1997, 17 years after his retirement. Persian poetry was his constant companion on lonely postings in the forests during his service, Syed Ahmed Esar said to Frontline in April 2020.  His work He translated the entire seven volume corpus of Allama Iqbal’s Persian poetry into Urdu. He next took up the challenge of translating Rumi’s 13th century magnum opus Masnavi of over 27,000 verses into Urdu. The work took up almost two decades of his life and the six-volume poem was published by the National Council for the Promotion of Urdu Language in 2019. He has also published a collection of his own poems and an autobiography. He was given the Rajyotsava Award in 2017 and was the recipient of several literary awards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/urdu-translator-syed-ahmed-esar-dead/article34381025.ece
22 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP issues notices to 66 private hospitals||The civic body has issued notices to 66 private hospitals in the city asking them to reserve half of their beds for COVID-19 patients under the government quota. These hospitals include reputed chains like Apollo Hospitals, Fortis Hospitals, M.S. Ramaiah, Narayana Health, among others. Gaurav Gupta, Chief Commissioner, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), told presspersons that with every passing day more beds in the city were being brought under the central bed allocation system of the government, claiming the 50% quota in private hospitals. “We started with 4,300 beds a few days ago and have now gone up to 7,000 beds. We are working towards augmenting this to over 11,000 beds in the next few days,” he said.

22 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No exodus of migrant labourers from city||Unlike in Delhi and Mumbai, migrant labourers in the city seem to be adopting a wait-and-watch approach and desisting from a panic-stricken exodus despite severe restrictions and the weekend lockdown imposed in the State. However, having learned from past experience, the government has ensured that this time around the construction sector, markets and industry remain largely unaffected. “We have been working on confidence-building measures with labourers and have informed them that we will take care, even in the event of a lockdown. This has stood us in good stead this time,” said Suresh Hari, chairman, CREDAI-Bengaluru. However, given that hotels, another sector that employs a large migrant labour population, has been allowed to work on only takeaways, Chandrashekhar Hebbar, president, Karnataka Regional Hotels and Restaurants’ Association, said if the restrictions were extended beyond two weeks, it would become difficult to retain staff and predicted that there would be a clamour to return home. Even before the new restrictions were imposed a section had begun going back home. “What we have been seeing in the city is not an exodus like last year, but definitely a trickle of migrants returning home,” said Gayathri Vasudevan, Co-founder and CEO, LabourNet. Ashok Kumar Verma, Divisional Railway Manager, Bengaluru, said there was some rush observed on trains bound for West Bengal, Assam, and Bihar, compared to other destinations. “We have decided to run four additional special trains to these three destinations this week. But we do not see an exodus of migrant labourers like in other cities,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-exodus-of-migrant-labourers-from-city/article34381387.ece

22 April 2021||Ganguru (Hassan district),KARNATAKA||No land 27 years after being freed as bonded labourers||“Now, we are left with no option but to go back to work as bonded labourers,” rued Lakshmamma of Ganguru in Arkalgud taluk on Friday. She is among the 91 people released as bonded labourers by the State government in 1994. Even after waiting for 27 years, their wish to own land has remained a distant dream. “The government released us from bondage then. But, now with no land to cultivate, we are forced to return to the same landlords, requesting them to take us back as labourers,” said Lakshmamma. Annual pay of Rs. 5 Members of 110 families of the Scheduled Caste (SC) community in the Dalit colony of Ganguru village worked as bonded labourers for decades. The issue caught the attention of the State government after Dalit Sangharsha Samiti leader Chandraprasad Tyagi and others raised their voice seeking justice for them. Then Deputy Commissioner of Hassan Mahendra Jain, after visiting the village, passed an order on September 26, 1994, releasing 91 people from bondage. It was found that as low as Rs. 25 was adjusted towards the loan borrowed after the worker completed a year. “Initially, for a few years, I worked only for the food offered by the landlord. Later, my annual pay was fixed at Rs. 5, which was increased gradually,” recalled Govindaiah Javaraiah, 65. He worked for nearly 20 years. Madamma, who lost her husband within a few years after marriage, continued to work as a bonded labourer in place of her husband to earn Rs. 10 a year.  Ravi Ramaiah recalled that the government assisted the families with financial aid as they had no source of income. The government allowed them to cultivate a part of Gobbali Reserve Forest area near the village until an alternative land was identified and allotted to them. ‘Stopped from entering’ All these years, they grew ragi, cereals, and tobacco in the land. The Forest Department took back the land on April 1 this year amid protests by the families. “We struggled hard to protect our land, but could not succeed as Forest Department officers had come to the spot with 22 earthmovers. An army of police personnel stopped us from entering the field,” said Sannamma. Following this incident, they staged protests in Hassan and Arkalgud, seeking grant of land. Deputy Commissioner R. Girish, Arkalgud tahsildar Renu Kumar have assured them that an alternative land would be identified soon. “The government should grant the land that we cultivate all these years. If it is forest land, let the government hand over equal extent of land in some other place to the Forest Department,” demanded Mr. Javaraiah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-land-27-years-after-being-freed-as-bonded-labourers/article34381023.ece

22 April 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Ruckus over penalty on vegetable seller||The Hassan City Municipal Council has attracted the wrath of vegetable sellers by imposing a penalty of Rs. 500 on a seller in Kattinakere Market in the city. A health inspector of Hassan CMC, on Tuesday, slapped the fine for not keeping a sanitiser bottle. During the rounds in Kattankere Market, a team of officers noticed a vegetable seller not keeping the sanitiser. The seller said he would keep do so if the administration had given him one. This led to a heated argument between the sellers and the staff members in the market. At one point, a health inspector tried to snatch the seller’s balance scale. The officer demanded a penalty of Rs. 500. The vegetable seller maintained that he had hardly made business since the morning and he could not afford to pay the fine. The officer threatened that if he did not pay the fine on the spot, his shop would be lifted from the market. The vegetable seller paid the fine, probably with the help of his friends in the market. A video clip of the incident has gone viral in the city. Many people have expressed their anger over the officer’s conduct.  When this issue was brought to the notice of Deputy Commissioner R. Girish, he said keeping a sanitiser bottle was compulsory for establishments, not the vegetable sellers in the market. “I will talk to the officer who slapped fine on the vegetable seller”, he said. Further, he added that the public had to cooperate with the administration in its efforts to avoid the spread of the infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ruckus-over-penalty-on-vegetable-seller/article34381151.ece

Speaking to presspersons in Dharwad on Wednesday, Mr. Patil said that the decision on night curfew and weekend lockdown became inevitable as the people developed a casual approach towards standard operating procedure despite the risk to their lives. The Deputy Commissioner said that if people failed to mend their ways and ignored the protocol again, the situation could turn from bad to worse forcing the administration to take further stringent steps. Briefing presspersons about the regulations that would come into force on Wednesday night, he said that tough measures were being taken and restrictions imposed to break the infection chain. Closure Mr. Patil said that as per the Government Order, all shops and business establishments, excluding pharmacies, should be closed by 9 p.m. for the day. The order will be in force till May 4 in the twin cities and all taluks of the district. During the weekend lockdown, no shops would be allowed to open barring those connected to essential services and people should refrain from venturing out as prohibitory orders will be in force, he said. As per the order all educational institutions, coaching centres, cinemas, gymnasiums, swimming pools, cultural and religious auditoriums, clubs will remain closed till May 4. Apart from banning all kinds of social and political gatherings, closure of places of worship has been ordered, he said. Already hotels, bar and restaurants have stopped serving food on their premises. They have been allowed to hand out parcels, instead. However, hotels with lodging facility have been allowed to serve food only for room occupants. Those violating the protocol will be dealt with strictly which might lead to sealing premises, he said and added that at roadside inns and dabhas on highways only parcel services are allowed. Mr. Patil clarified that essential businesses such as provision shops, pharmacies, meat and fish shops along with construction material shops will be allowed to operate and there will be no hindrance to construction activities and industries. With the government allowing only 50 persons for marriage ceremonies, a special team has been formed to keep an eye on marriage halls and cases will be registered against organisers if the number exceeded the limit. Special bands with names on them will be issued to only 50 persons each attending marriages, he said. To a query, Mr. Patil said that they have already begun taking action against violators. “We have booked cases against three bar and restaurants and a jewellery shop for violating the guidelines and hefty fine has been imposed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/peoples-cooperation-crucial-in-effectively-handling-pandemic/article34381009.ece

As per information provided by sources in the steel plant, four oxygen producing companies, including Linde Gas India (earlier called Praxair), BOC India Limited and Industrial Gases Private Limited that supply gases, including oxygen, required for making steel to JSW, have already increased production of liquid medical oxygen to meet the growing demand. “Normally, these four companies together produce between 120 tonnes and 150 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen a day and supply it to various hospitals. Last July [when COVID-19 was widespread], the production of liquid medical oxygen in the JSW plant rose to 200 tonnes a day and reached 430 tonnes a day by September. Now, we are back to the same sort of situation. In the first week of April this year, production was around 130 tonnes and now, it has increased to 350 tonnes a day,” a JSW official told The Hindu . He added that production was expected to be further increased to over 400 tonnes a day in the days to come.  Meanwhile, officials involved in medical oxygen production say that the problem cannot be solved by increasing production of medical oxygen alone. “Transportation and storage infrastructure for oxygen after it is produced is also equally crucial. It requires tankers, cylinders and storage infrastructure also,” they said. “State-level meetings are regularly being held on the issue and JSW authorities are also participating in them,” Ballari Deputy Commissioner Pavan Kumar Malapati has said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gas-plants-on-jsw-premises-scale-up-oxygen-production/article34381005.ece

Serious COVID-19 cases are admitted to BRIMS and others are sent to other hospitals where beds are available,” he said.

22 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||ZP sets up task forces in GPs to ensure cleanliness, hygiene||The Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat has formed cleanliness and hygiene task forces in every gram panchayat to ensure solid waste segregation and management and also for villages to remain open defecation-free and other related cleanliness issues. Announcing this here on Monday, ZP CEO Kumara said that the panchayats were entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the overall hygiene and cleanliness in their limits. It was their responsibility to ensure that residents segregate domestic waste into wet and dry and convert wet waste on their premises into manure, prevent throwing of trash in public places apart from many other tasks under the Swatch Bharath Mission. The task forces, Mr. Kumara said, have to ensure scientific disposal of wet and dry wastes, get closed circuit television cameras installed at black spots to prevent littering, undertake patrolling near black spots round the clock in shifts, register FIR with the police against those throwing litter, facilitate the gram panchayat to impose fines on such people and also facilitate communication to the Transport Department to cancel registration of vehicles throwing trash in public places. They would have to arrange for cleaning of black spots and beautify them to discourage further littering, Mr. Kumara said. Task forces should also ensure that those generating bulk waste (more than 50 kg), enterprises and meat sellers handle waste on their own. The task force should hold meetings every fortnight to take follow-up action. Mr. Kumara said that the panchayats have the authority to impose penalty and take legal action against those littering in public places and failing to scientifically handle solid waste under the Karnataka Panchayat Raj (Solid Waste Management) Model Rules 2020. Up to Rs. 1,000 penalty could be levied against individuals spitting, littering, burning waste or dumping waste in public places. If these were done by generators of bulk waste, a fine of Rs. 5,000 could be imposed on them, the CEO said. Similarly, complaints against vehicles dumping waste in public places could be made to the Transport Department under the Motor Vehicles Act, to the Assistant Commissioner under the Code of Criminal Procedure and to the jurisdictional police under the Karnataka Police Act for imposing penalty and other actions. Task forces could facilitate action to cancel trade licence of commercial establishments that do not handle waste scientifically. Mr. Kumara urged panchayats to effectively implement the rules thus ensuring sustainable development of villages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/zp-sets-up-task-forces-in-gps-to-ensure-cleanliness-hygiene/article34381525.ece
22 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Aniruddha Saralatthaya chosen to succeed Lakshmivara Tirtha||Udupi Sode Vadiraj Mutt on Wednesday announced 16-year-old Aniruddha Saralatthaya as successor to Sri Lakshmivara Tirtha Swamiji of Udupi Shirur Mutt, who passed away on July 19, 2018. Saralatthaya will ascend the seat as the 31st seer at Sode Mutt in Sirsi, Uttara Kannada, on May 14. Sode Mutt, the dwandva mutt of Shirur Mutt, was entrusted with the responsibility of selecting the seer for the latter as Late Lakshmivara Tirtha had not appointed any successor. Sode Mutt seer Sri Vishwavallabha Tirtha told reporters at Shirur Mula Mutt near Udupi that appointing a teenager as heir to Ashta Mutts in Udupi was a tradition followed as per the recommendations of the Shastras. Saralatthaya, son of Uday Kumar Saralatthaya and Srividya from Nidle village near Dharmasthala in Dakshina Kannada, has studied the Vedas, Tatparya Nirnaya and Yuktamallika, a magnum opus by Sode Mutt founder Sri Vadiraja Tirtha Swamiji. He would ably take up the new responsibility and undertake further studies in Vedanta and may continue his formal education through informal mode of education, Sri Vishwavallabha Tirtha said. Having undergone formal education till Class 10, Saralatthaya will be ordained into Sanyasa between 7.35 a.m. and 8 a.m. on May 13, followed by his anointment as the seer of Shirur Mutt the next day between 12.35 p.m. and 12.50 p.m., Sri Vishwavallabha Tirtha said. Saralatthaya, who was present, said that he chose to walk the path of renunciation as he felt worshipping Lord Krishna was a task that gives him ultimate content. His ancestors served as priests of Sri Durga Parameshwari Temple, Kadya, near Kukke Subrahmanya. His father came to Udupi in 1988 for higher studies. He later pursued B.Ed, and Ph.D, at the National Sanskrit University, Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. Regarding objections to the anointment by some followers of Late Sri Lakshmivara Tirtha, Sri Vishwavallabha Tirtha said that those objecting were not related to the affairs of the dwandva mutts, Sode and Shirur, and hence, he would not make any comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/aniruddha-saralatthaya-chosen-to-succeed-lakshmivara-tirtha/article34381528.ece

22 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Lakshmivara Tirtha’s brothers oppose choice||Latavya Acharya and Vadiraja Acharya, brothers of Late Sri Lakshmivara Tirtha of Udupi Shirur Mutt, on Tuesday objected to the announcement of the new seer to the mutt. They told reporters in Udupi that a case was pending before the High Court of Karnataka regarding handling of mutt affairs and the new appointment should not have been made during the pendency of the case. Moreover, the candidate should have studied the Vedas for at least 10 years and anointing a teenager was against this tradition. Mr. Vadiraja Acharya said that they were opposing the new appointment as it might not ensure good administration in Shirur Mutt and not because the family would lose hold over the mutt. In fact, the new seer should have been appointed within four months after the demise of Sri Lakshmivara Tirtha. However, Sode Mutt and the other Ashta Mutts kept quite all these days, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lakshmivara-tirthas-brothers-oppose-choice/article34381526.ece

22 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MCC to get tough with those defying norms||With the State government bringing in stricter rules for controlling the resurgent COVID-19, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) on Wednesday said it will get tough with those flouting the norms and warned of booking criminal cases against repeat offenders. “We are going to be strict against those not wearing masks, not maintaining social distance and violating other safety precautions. They will be penalised and booked if they continue to disobey the rules,” warned MCC Commissioner Shilpa Nag. After going around the market and commercial areas here along with Deputy Commissioner of Police Geetha Prasanna for spreading awareness on the need for wearing face masks and following the rules, Ms. Nag said the Health Department had alerted that the cases would continue to spike for the next 20 days and therefore the public have to cooperate in tackling the crisis by complying with the rules. Testing and vaccination had been stepped up to fight the pandemic, she said and added that the MCC would lay emphasis on enforcing COVID-19 rules for the next one week, putting off all other works and meetings.  Ms. Nag said the COVID-19 Enforcement Teams had been re-activated in nine MCC zones and nine testing teams had been formed in the zones which will be overseen by the zonal commissioners. As many as 150 booth-level officers (BLOs) had been appointed for enforcing quarantine and home isolation rules. Each ward will have two such officers who will be verifying the status of the patients and ensure they do not step out of their homes.  Micro-containment zones  Ms. Nag said 26 micro-containment zones had been created in the city based on the positive cases. This is unlike the containment zones and barricading of the areas done last year since only the home where the positive cases are detected would be contained for controlling the spread.  The MCC has constituted three COVID-19 War Rooms in Narasimharaja, Krishnaraja and Chamaraja constituencies and they are in addition to the District COVID-19 War Room run by the district administration. Ten BLOs will manage each war room. Replying to questions, Ms. Nag said the importance of wearing masks was yet to sink in among many in the city. “We have started the raid and will enforce the mask rule strictly. The public have to cooperate; otherwise we shall be slapping fines every time they violate the rule,” she warned. Police help  Teams comprising officers from the MCC and the city police have been constituted to enforce the rules, including the number of people allowed to participate in a wedding event. “The Commissioner of Police has provided us 15 officers to assist us in enforcing the rules strictly,” she replied. The MCC has collected a fine of Rs. 94,000 from those not wearing face masks. MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj and other officers from the corporation were present when the MCC conducted the mask awareness drive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-to-get-tough-with-those-defying-norms/article34381158.ece
22 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Minister inspects checkpost at border||Amidst the alarming rise in COVID-19 cases in Mysuru, Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar on Wednesday visited the checkpost at Bavali on the Karnataka-Kerala border and reviewed the steps taken by the district administration and the police for controlling the spread of the contagion. Anybody from the neighbouring State wishing to travel to the State through Bavali has to produce a RT-PCR negative report which has been made mandatory by the State government. At Bavali, a COVID-19 Inspection Centre and Border Facilitation Centre has come up. Mr. Somashekar, after the inspection, said the travellers not possessing the RT-PCR negative report are being sent back. The Minister, however, admitted that the number of vehicles from Kerala entering the State through Bavali has dropped over the COVID-19 scare and the restrictions. As many as 120-130 vehicles are passing through the border daily fulfilling the norms. Mr. Somashekar said the Kerala government has set up a swab collection centre at the border to facilitate the travellers of its State for getting the tests done. This centre has started to function from Tuesday. “Steps will be taken on our side too.” Claiming that steps had been taken for the smooth movement of goods from Mysuru to Kerala, especially farm produce, through Bavali, he said the administration had responded to emergency situations and facilitated the movement without any difficulties. He told reporters that the tough rules for bringing the resurgent pandemic under control have come into effect in addition to the night curfew and the weekend curfew across the State. These rules have to be complied with strictly and the Mysuru district administration will be enforcing these rules firmly. “I am confident that the people of Mysuru will follow the COVID-19 Appropriate Behaviour as the city has less number of violations of COVID-19 norms,” he said. In reply to a question, Mr. Somashekar said there was no shortage of Remdesivir injection for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in government hospitals but the private hospitals were facing scarcity of the drug. In this connection, the Minister for Health is visiting Mysuru on Thursday and look into the matter, he said, adding that 5.70 lakh vaccine doses had been administered in Mysuru district out of the targeted 8.75 lakh doses. He reiterated that Mysuru is also not facing any shortfall of medical oxygen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/minister-inspects-checkpost-at-border/article34381163.ece
22 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Library to be funded by three agencies||The library to be built in Rajiv Nagar in Mysuru will be jointly funded by Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) and Department of Libraries. A joint statement released by MCC Commissioner Shilpa Nag, MUDA Commissioner D.B. Natesh and Deputy Director of Department of Libraries Manjunath B. said the construction will be carried out by Nirmithi Kendra. The officials said they had not sought donations from the public for constructing the library, but decided to open an exclusive bank account and keep the donations which were being raised from the public for the sake of transparency and accountability. The three departments were individually as well as jointly financially stable enough to take up the work. The bank account had so far collected Rs. 9,124 as at 12.30 p.m. on April 20 and a decision on how the amount is to be utilised will be taken at a meeting of the City Central Library Authority’s Sub-Committee constituted for the construction of the library. Donors wishing to contribute to the library have been asked to preferably donate books, furniture, computers and other essential items instead of money. The joint statement by the officials also clarified that there is no compulsion on the amount collected through online crowdfunding to be deposited into the bank account opened by the authorities. The amount raised through crowdfunding can also be used for buying any items for the library or be deposited in any Central government scheme or bank deposit scheme for payment of monthly honorarium to Syed Ishaq, whose original library was burnt down. Meanwhile, the official statement said April 23 had been fixed as the date for laying the foundation stone for the library. But, in view of the restrictions imposed by the government on organising functions, a clarification had been sought from the Deputy Commissioner.

22 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Activists raise ‘inconvenient’ question||“How did officials allow encroachment of public land for a library?”. This was an ‘inconvenient’ question raised by a group of citizen activists in Mysuru more than 10 days after a library set up by 62-year-old Syed Ishaq in Rajiv Nagar was destroyed in a fire. The activists including Bhamy V. Shenoy and six others have written a letter to Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Commissioner and marked a copy to Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) Commissioner regretting the failure of the officials to take action when Mr. Ishaq started a library on a Civic Amenities (CA) site belonging to the MUDA. Though the group of citizens described Mr Ishaq’s “noble goal of giving easy access to books and newspapers to readers in Rajiv Nagar” as “most admirable”, they said it was “most unfortunate” that nobody has raised the ‘inconvenient’ question so far. “When we first read his story in the media, our initial reaction was how did the officials allow an encroachment on public land. However, as we learnt more – like an illiterate starting a library, tiny shed having 11,000 books, spending Rs. 8,000 per month to support the library despite his limited wage earnings, support for promoting Kannada books, having hundreds of books like Bhagavad Gita, Bible and Quran etc, our emotions took over. Some of us even wrote a letter suggesting that we need to raise funds (we were not aware of the crowd funding then) to help him”, the letter said. However, the episode took a different turn with politicians, Ministers, officials coming forward to compete with one another to get involved. “Even at the risk of being misunderstood, some of us, who have taken a principled stand against encroachments in the past, want to raise a fundamental question”. “During the long years since 2011 when Mr. Ishaq started the library in a CA site belonging to MUDA, why did the officials fail to take action? Even now when we all know that Mr. Ishaq has violated the rule of law, what is the right thing to do? Just ignore the illegality as we seem to be doing”, the letter asked. “…Should we just forget the encroachment even when done with the noble motive?”, the letter said while referring to the rampant violation of law that also includes “misallocation and misuse of CA sites….”. Apart from Mr. Shenoy, the letter had also been signed by C.R. Aswathanarayan, Shoba Sambasivan, Venkatesh Kharidi, Roy Joseph, Nanjapur Yaduraju and Usha Yaduraju. However, speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Shenoy clarified that they were not opposed to the construction of a permanent library building in the spot in Rajiv Nagar by the government agencies after due allocation of land for the purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/activists-raise-inconvenient-question/article34381161.ece
22 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Daily count inches closer to 1,000 in Mysuru||Mysuru recorded close to 1,000 cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday as 975 more people tested positive for the infection.

The police have also booked cases under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and also under the IPC sections for defying the rules. Meanwhile, the Mysuru Urban Development Authority, worried over the COVID-19 peak, has urged the public to avoid visiting the office needlessly. The interest-free remittance of tax can be made till March 31, 2022 and the public therefore need not have to rush to the office and stand in long queues to pay the tax. Shortly, online tax payment will also be launched and the public can make use to it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/daily-count-inches-closer-to-1000-in-mysuru/article34381155.ece
22 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Heli-tourism: public hearing on tree-felling postponed||The public hearing to elicit objections to felling of trees in front of Lalitha Mahal Palace, and slated to be held on April 23, has been postponed in view of the COVID-19 situation. The public hearing scheduled to be held at the Aranya Bhavan from 11 a.m. now stands postponed indefinitely in view of the restrictions imposed on public gathering owing to the surge in COVID-19 cases, according to the Deputy Conservator of Forest (Territorial), Prashanth Kumar. Nearly 150 trees were marked for felling on a four-acre land to pave way for a helipad as part of the heli-tourism project against which there was public opposition. An online campaign launched to save the trees elicited nearly 70,000 signatures and even politicians belonging to the ruling BJP voiced their resentment over tree-felling and the heli-tourism project. The issue snowballed into further controversy as the erstwhile royal Pramoda Devi Wadiyar staked claim over the land proposed for the helipad and cited a court ruling in her favour. This put a question mark on the legal tenability of the project pushed hard by the Minister for Tourism C.P. Yogeshwar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/heli-tourism-public-hearing-on-tree-felling-postponed/article34381159.ece
22 April 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||BJP member is chief of Chennithala panchayat||Bindu Pradeep of the BJP was elected president of the Chennithala Thripperunthura grama panchayat in Alappuzha on Tuesday. Six Congress members abstained from voting. Ms. Pradeep polled seven votes, including six of the BJP and one Independent. CPI(M) candidate Vijayamma Philendran got four votes. The vote of a CPI(M) member was declared invalid. It was the third election in the last four months to the post of the president of the panchayat after no political front won a clear majority in the local body polls held in December 2020. In the local body elections, both the Congress-led United Democratic Front and the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won six seats each in the 18-member council. The CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front got five seats, including an LDF Independent. A UDF rebel who fought the polls as an Independent candidate secured one seat. Following the polls, Ms. Philendran was elected president of the grama panchayat on December 30 with the support of the UDF members. The post of president in the local body is reserved for Scheduled Caste woman. As the UDF did not have a Scheduled Caste woman member, its members had then voted for Ms. Philendran. Cong. support declined The CPI (M), which was averse to accepting the support of the Congress, however, asked her to resign from the post. She tendered her resignation in February. In the second election held in March, Ms. Philendran got elected again to the post with UDF support. However, immediately after her election, she resigned for a second time. Earlier, the BJP had come to power in the Pandanad and Kodamthuruth grama panchayats in the district after the 2020 local body polls. Chennithala Thripperunthura is the home panchayat of Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala. Mr. Chennithala and his family members were voters there. They recently transferred their votes to Haripad municipality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-member-is-chief-of-chennithala-panchayat/article34381102.ece
22 April 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Controversies dog CPI(M) Alappuzha district unit||The CPI(M) Alappuzha unit has found itself in a predicament over recent controversies involving its leaders. Last week, wife of Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran’s former personal staff member lodged a police complaint alleging that the Minister’s remarks at a press conference in Alappuzha on April 11 were damaging to womanhood and could provoke communal tension. While the complainant has been identified as a former Students Federation of India Alappuzha district committee member, her husband is the Purakkad local committee member of the CPI(M), who was ousted from the Minister’s staff a few months ago. After showing initial reluctance, the Ambalappuzha police recorded statements of the petitioner after she stood firm on her complaint despite “pressure to withdraw the petition”. The police have not yet registered a case based on the complaint. Factional feud It has been alleged that the complaint against the Minister was the result of “growing factional feud” in the party’s district unit. Mr. Sudhakaran, who denied denigrating womanhood, said the allegations against him were the handiwork of “political criminals”. Although the party district leadership has rallied behind Mr. Sudhakaran, the controversy has refused to die down. Even as the party is grappling with the police complaint against one of its senior leaders in the district, its Kayamkulam MLA U. Prathibha has landed in a controversy after an old Malayalam proverb appeared on her Facebook page on Tuesday night that loosely translates to ‘God would punish those who seek to harm innocent people’. Many on social media saw it as a jibe at Mr. Sudhakaran. Ms. Prathibha, however, denied posting the comment and said her Facebook account had been “hijacked”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/controversies-dog-cpim-alappuzha-district-unit/article34381120.ece

Ms. Kuruvila, representing the Mazhukeermel ward who won from there as a Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI (M)] Independent, was elected president with the United Democratic Front (UDF) support. In the first round of voting, Saju Idakkallil of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) polled five votes, while Ms. Kuruvila got four votes and Sajeev Valliyil of the Congress received three votes. This prompted a second round voting between Mr. Idakkallil and Ms. Kuruvila. To prevent the BJP from attaining power, all three Congress members voted for Ms. Kuruvila in the second round. She polled six votes against five by the BJP candidate. The vote of an LDF member was declared invalid. An Independent member abstained from voting. LDF Independent In the election to the post of vice president, Ms. Biju, an LDF Independent, defeated Geetha Surendran of the Congress. Ms. Biju got four votes, while her rival polled three votes. BJP members along with the Independent member abstained from voting. It was the third time elections were held to the posts, as no political front gained a clear majority in the last year’s local body polls. In the elections held to the grama panchayat in December 2020, the BJP-led NDA won five seats, followed by LDF (four seats), and UDF (three seats). An Independent candidate also won. Following the polls, both Ms. Kuruvila and Ms. Biju were first elected to the posts on December 30, 2020 with the support of UDF members. However, both quit before being sworn-in. The drama was repeated for a second time in March as LDF nominees who were elected to the posts with UDF support quit immediately after their victory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-wins-top-posts-in-thiruvanvandoor/article34381104.ece

The area is rich in archaeological findings. Earlier, a large burial urn was unearthed from Hydermettu, near Nedumkandam, and a number of menhirs were found on a hill slope at Santhanpara, 30 km from Nedumkandam. According to the members of the Archaeological and Historical Conservation Forum in Nedumkandam who discovered the stone, it is for the first time in south India that a clear image of a hero atop an elephant has been found. ‘Hero stones’ mark the valiant death of a person in a battle. “This hero holds a bow and other weapons. He has ornaments on his ears and neck. Another person and an animal form is also seen nearby,” said Rajeev Puliyoor of the forum. The stone was found near a banyan tree at the base of a hill at Chathurangapara. The place is believed to be part of an ancient trade route from Kerala to Madurai. Burial urns, menhirs, and dolmen have been unearthed from the stretch on the Western Ghats extending from Kumily to Marayur.  Archaeologists say the region must have harboured a culturally enriched society in the prehistoric era. According to historian Rajan Gurukkal, it is difficult to date hero stones without inscriptions. Right from the Iron Age, it was a practice to erect them. It continued even into the late 19th century. Considering the relief features, the stone found at Chathurangapara could be of 15-16th centuries, he said. Petroglyphs (carvings on rocks) similar to Indus script on megalithic-era menhirs were found at Chakkakkanam, near Nedumkandam, in 2019. Earlier, menhirs were found at Pezhumkandam on the banks of the Periyar. Muziris link According to P.J. Cherian, former director of the Kerala Council for Historical Research (KCHR), the banks of the Periyar were home to a rich civilisation. It was connected to international trade from Muziris. Ever before that a culturally vibrant society lived in the high ranges, as is evident from the archaeological findings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hero-stone-found-in-an-old-trade-path-on-western-ghats/article34381115.ece

With the movement of their product beyond the borders no longer an option, they had to forego their clients predominantly from Mumbai and Delhi and look for a new clientele for the highly perishable goods. Thus was born the idea of marketing it within the State with the help of social media. “We publicised our mango varieties initially through Instagram, which was done mostly as status. As we found the response encouraging, we started an Instagram page,” said Amal Eldhose, who is doing his MBA. Last year, the sale was mostly confined to Ernakulam, since the demand was mostly from there. Orders were mostly received through WhatsApp and the youngsters hired a truck and an employee to deliver the products. At times, they delivered it personally. Christened Lush Haven, their firm deals in six varieties of mangoes – Alphonso, Imam Pasand, Banganapally, Sindhooram, Totapuri, and Nadasaala. “Quality fruit devoid of preservatives remains the main attraction of our product,” said Amal Tom, a youth from Pala who is now doing his engineering graduation. The duo did considerable business for a pandemic-hit year logging sales of 4,100 kg. Buoyed, they have now expanded their business to Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, and Kozhikode. Apart from mangoes, they also deal in cardamom and pepper.

The drive aims to test people in professions that require them to be in close contact with people and 12,000 swabs were collected as part of the mass campaign on Wednesday, said a release from the district administration. The district’s test positivity rate has been rising since tests have been geared towards people who are more susceptible towards contracting the infection, according to Dr. S.

A report filed by the board before the State Level Monitoring Committee on Solid Waste Management pointed out that the sheds provided for windrow composting were in a dilapidated stage. Waste was seen dumped in the open yard. There was every chance of heavy leachate flow during rainy season for which proper collection facility was not provided, it said. The board, which held inspections at the yard in February and March, stated that the damaged windrow composting sheds were the root cause of the malfunctioning of the solid waste management facility. No effective facilities were seen there to process fresh biodegradable waste collected from the corporation area as well as from other local bodies. Rainwater will definitely come in contact with the deposited legacy waste and will be directed to the Kadambrayar. There were visible discharge routes intentionally constructed for this untreated sewage discharges that find its way to the marshy area beyond the sheds before reaching the river. A branch of the Chitrapuzha located close to the site was also facing the threat of untreated waste water from the yard entering it, according to the report. The board found that the septage treatment facility was not functioning properly. It is suspected that untreated or partially treated sewage/effluent was discharged into the nearby marshy area located approximately 50 metres away from the septage plant. Sewage in septic condition was seen spread over the entire area. The report said that it was distressing to note that almost all components of the septage treatment plant were seen kept idle. There was clear evidence of untreated sewage discharge using flexible hose directly into the marshy area, which remains connected to the Chitrapuzha. It was noticed that fresh biodegradable waste received in the plant was not properly segregated and disposed as such even though separate records were kept as per the type of waste reaching the yard, according to the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-warns-corpn-of-leachate-flow-from-yard-during-monsoon/article34381507.ece

22 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Jellyfish invasion of Vembanad lake hampers fishing||Swarms of jellyfish have invaded the inland waterbodies of Kochi, making life miserable for fishers. The presence of the marine species has been reported from many parts of Vembanad lake. The jellyfish, a passive swimmer, flows with the current. They get entangled in the stake nets, making fishery impossible during the infestation period, complain fishers. During peak summer months jellyfish moves from the sea to freshwater bodies. They usually settle down on the ocean floor and coral and rock structures. They also get attached to the sea walls and groynes laid in the sea for preventing sea erosion. As the salinity and temperature of the fresh waterbodies increase during summer, they leave the ocean floors to the inland waterbodies. It’s during March-April period that the presence of the animals is recorded in Kochi, explained those at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. Climate change, pollution and turbidity can trigger jellyfish bloom as they can outlive the extreme conditions. They may survive in the inland waterbodies during the pre-monsoon period and perish during monsoon when the water temperature and salinity come down with the influx of fresh water. The bloom would subside during the monsoon season. Researchers have identified the species present in the Kochi estuary area as belonging to the genus “Acromitus”, which is relatively harmless. However, Chrysora, its cousin, which is known in local parlance as Theechori,  could cause health hazards. The Chrysora species could cause severe itching and other discomfort and in some cases, medical support may be needed, warned researchers. Crambionella orsini, another variety, is harvested in large quantities by trawlers of Kollam, Kanyakumari, and Thoothukudi during November to be exported to south Asian countries. The tentacles of the species are used for export while the bell-like structure of its body is discarded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/jellyfish-invasion-of-vembanad-lake-hampers-fishing/article34381605.ece
22 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fearing another lockdown, migrants head homewards||Fear of another potential lockdown in the wake of a resurgent pandemic seems to be weighing heavily on migrants in the district as they begin to return home. Recent restrictions and night curfew have only further accentuated that fear with the uncertainty over getting stranded away from home during the last lockdown still fresh in their memory. Contract carriages have emerged as their popular mode of transport of which there seems no dearth. “The promised waiver of quarterly tax of Rs. 50,000 got stalled in the wake of the Assembly election and this has affected a section of the operators majority of whom could not afford to pay it,” said Bobby Varghese, an Aluva-based operator who though has paid the tax and has operated about 180 such trips since the first lockdown. He charges around Rs. 5,000 for a trip to West Bengal, which he said, was based on the operational costs including tax in the States the carriages pass through. George Mathew, coordinator, Progressive Workers Organisation, accused many operators of fleecing desperate migrants in the absence of any regulatory framework in fare fixation. “The government will have to intervene and ensure uninterrupted train services. Also, migrants need to be reassured about their situation in this climate of fear,” he said. Contract carriages operate in a circuit touching States including Odisha, Bihar, Telangana, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Assam, and Meghalaya. ‘Blow to economy’ Mujeeb Rahman, president, All Kerala Plywood and Block Board Manufacturers Association, lamented that another exodus seems on the anvil just when migrants who had gone en masse to cast their votes in eastern and north-eastern States were about to return. “It will be another blow to the local economy. Contract carriage operators for whom the lucrative trips transporting migrants remains the only lifeline seem to be instigating the return through speculations,” he alleged. K.A. Mohanan, a Perumbavoor-based contractor, said that assurances to take care of migrants have faltered in the face of anxious calls from their families back home asking them to return. However, a section of contractors is not dissuading migrants fearing that in the event of a lockdown they may have to bear their expenses as happened last year. Abu Mundatt, a Muvattupuzha-based contractor, said that during the last lockdown, he maintained 12 migrants for 45 days without any work only for them to return home when the lockdown was lifted. Shibin Jose, director of the Kochi-based KLR Facility Management which supplies manpower for housekeeping in malls and hotels across the State, is keeping his fingers crossed with operational restrictions for malls and hotels kicking in this week. “Lack of work will prompt them to go back home and whether that is the case will be known by this weekend,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fearing-another-lockdown-migrants-start-returning-home/article34381499.ece
22 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fishers seek study into catch ‘drought’||Fishers have said that there is a ‘drought-like’ situation in the fishing sector, with pelagic fish catch falling drastically this season. “The fish scarcity has never been so severe,” says Jackson Pollayil of the National Fish Workers’ Forum, calling on the Union and State governments to undertake a scientific investigation into the phenomenon that has left thousands of fishers in dire straits. The period just before monsoon is when fishers catch the bulk of pelagic fish. But this season has seen a severe shortage, resulting in the fishing community suffering extensive losses, he say. “The government must study the cause for the fall in catch as well as on the methods and vessels being used by fishers,” he adds. ‘Social catastrophe’ Charles George of the Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedi, a trade union of traditional fishers, says the COVID-19-induced lockdown and subsequent restrictions had delivered a big blow to fishers who make a living by day-to-day operations. The rising cost of fuel and the restricted fishing days have been huge setbacks in the recent times. The government, he says, should address the issues of sustainability, livelihood, and marketing of the catch. The issue of a severe fall in catch should be addressed. Social catastrophe He claims that oil sardine landing during 2019-20 had fallen to about 35,000 tonnes. This is a ‘social catastrophe’ and a serious livelihood issue, he adds.  Meanwhile, the All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators’ Association has written to the Union government that the move to extend the monsoon trawling ban, usually in place from June 1 and July 31, to 61 days would severely affect the mechanised fishing sector. The fishing ban for a ‘long period’ of 61 days would worsen the already precarious financial position of more than 3.5 lakh people directly and indirectly engaged in this sector, the boat operators say. The Union government had reduced the ban period to 47 days on appeal from the fishing community but the Kerala government extended it to 52 days last year. The ban came immediately after the restrictions imposed by the State to prevent the spread of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fishers-seek-study-into-catch-drought/article34381119.ece

His ordeal began six years ago when a newly-wed Subash met with an accident while working in Dubai. Hit by a truck and dragged by the moving vehicle, he was left paralysed in both legs when the nerves and vertebrae in his back were damaged. His trauma, however, did not end there. More recently, back home in Malappuram, he developed breathlessness and a CT scan showed that his liver, stomach and intestines had moved into his chest cavity through a rupture in the diaphragm. Consequently, his right lung had collapsed and his heart had compressed the left lung against the chest wall, which meant that he was living on one half of a lung. Subash’s diaphragm had ruptured six years ago in the accident, but it might have been a small tear then and might have gone undetected. Over time, the tear had grown to around 15 cm, and the pressure in the abdomen had pushed his organs into the chest, said Dr. Nasser Yusuf, cardiothoracic surgeon at Sunrise Hospital who performed the surgery on him on March 30 along with senior surgeon Dr. Mathew Sebastian. In the five-hour-long surgery, the liver, intestines and stomach were freed from the chest cavity without injuring the organs and the diaphragm was repaired with a mesh, restoring the normal functioning of both lungs. Back home, Subash says that his recovery has been progressing well. “Prior to the surgery, it had become very difficult to breathe. Breathing is a lot easier now,” says Subash who is looking forward to working again after a period of rest. “Subash’s family and his wife Sharanya have stood by him like a rock,” Dr. Nasser said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rare-surgery-brings-youth-back-to-life-after-ordeal/article34381494.ece

The treatment of leachate would not be a problem even in monsoon as the septage treatment plant has the capacity to store about 1 lakh litres. The leachate generated is collected in the one-lakh litre capacity collection tank behind the compost plant through a network of drains, pointed out the Secretary of the civic body in its reply to the notice issued by the State Pollution Control Board. The civic body admitted that the plant roof had collapsed, but heaping and composting of waste was being carried out at the site. No leachate was flowing into the Kadambrayar and Chitrapuzha. There are many industrial establishments in the upstream portion of the Kadambrayar in Brahmapuram itself. The board is remaining discreet on this issue. Without established data on the water quality of the Kadambrayar at the downstream and upstream portion of the solid waste treatment plant, it is to be inferred that the board is targeting and blaming only the corporation’s solid waste treatment plant for polluting the river, it alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-leachate-flow-into-kadambrayar-claims-corpn/article34381505.ece

The pandemic, which stripped her of the fun-filled lower kindergarten (LKG) year and reduced it to online sessions, now threatens to consume the upper kindergarten days as well, leaving her father Krishnakumar Menon worried about what it means for his little daughter emotionally. “We are trying to make up for her loss by creating a school-like atmosphere at home though it’s a very pale compensation,” he says. Loss of social skills Narendar Ananda Bhat, a private company employee in the city, is similarly worried for his three-year-old daughter Tanmaya, who in normal times should have been having fun at playschool. “The gap in academics could perhaps be bridged but not the loss of interactions in a peer group,” he laments.  Shirley Somasundaram, theatre personality and principal of the KG section of Vidyodaya School, observes that the loss of social skills in formative years could pose problems later. “There is no compensation for the loss of classroom atmosphere. No matter how effective the online sessions are, the child remains the centre of attraction in a household that pampers its ego unlike in school where it is nipped bit by bit as the child learns to be part of a group. It will be teachers in higher classes who will find it really tough to manage these children deprived of crucial foundational skills. We will have to design modules for them over and above the curriculum,” she says. A positive fallout Ms. Somasundaram, however, feels that the pandemic-induced online sessions that demand increased involvement of parents have a positive fallout of helping them realise that it is after all possible to find time for their children. V. Sudarshana Manoj, a counselling psychologist, feels that the gaps in formative years could hamper physical and mental development, besides social skills. “Since they are cut off from the larger society and their interactions are restricted to their immediate family, they could later develop a social phobia and even panic attacks in social interactions. They may also suffer from personality disorders like anger management issues and lack of confidence and turn out to be extremely shy and introverted. Creating a congenial home atmosphere, breaking the islands in which parents and children find themselves in despite being together at home remain the only feasible alternative,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/online-classes-rob-children-of-their-kg-experience/article34381139.ece

After taking him to his apartment at Karingachira and Muttar River where the body of the girl was found, the investigation team on Wednesday took him to Tamil Nadu where he had gone initially after giving the police a slip. This was part of recreating the entire trail the accused followed after allegedly murdering his daughter. He was reportedly taken to Coimbatore where he allegedly sold off his car to fund his life in hiding. Places where he is suspected to have stayed were also visited.  C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief, said that the car of the accused was recovered from Coimbatore. “We are in the process of completing procedures. The DNA result has also confirmed that the blood drops found in the flat belonged to the victim,” he said. The accused was caught on CCTV footage crossing over to Tamil Nadu through Walayar checkpost, which incidentally was the first information the police had about him since the body of the girl was found in the river a day after he had reportedly taken her in an unconscious state from their apartment. The police would also have to take him to the neighbouring Karnataka as well where also he stayed during his almost month-long life on the run. Sources said that the police are also looking into his claim that he had tried to end his life while on the run while evidence to piece together the truth behind his conflicting statements will also be sought. Meanwhile, the mystery behind the presence of alcohol found inside the girl’s body continues as the accused reportedly was yet to admit having fed her alcohol. The police custody of the accused will end on April 29 and the police are rushing to complete the evidence collection before that.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/murder-of-girl-police-take-accused-to-tn/article34381506.ece

Justice N. Nagaresh passed the verdict while allowing writ petitions filed by FACT and two private companies against levying of cess on use of water from rivers for industrial use. The court observed that Article 265 of the Constitution of India provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law. Tax, duty, cess, or fee were levied by the State government to raise revenue for the State. In fact, each expression denoted different kinds of “imposts” depending on the purpose for which they were levied.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-sets-aside-go-on-cess-on-water-use-by-industries/article34381121.ece

Similarly, Paseedha, a Bihari migrant from Kakkanad, and friends were allegedly cheated by the contractor who scooted without paying the Rs. 49,882 he owed them. Desperate migrants looking to supplement their income to compensate for their loss of livelihood during the lockdown and to feed their impoverished families back home are being taken for a ride by unscrupulous contractors and sub-contractors. “They are often taken to faraway places in districts other than Ernakulam and are then left in the lurch unpaid.

Since there are no work-related documents and being in alien surroundings with little knowledge about the contractor, migrants are hardly in a position to press their case,” said George Mathew, coordinator, Progressive Workers Organisation. The organisation has petitioned the collector about the plight of migrants and it has in turn been forwarded to the District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) for action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/desperate-labourers-taken-for-a-ride/article34381500.ece

With the fear of the infection spreading further in the district, she arrived at the taluk hospital with her daughter and was assisted by health officials and the hospital Superintendent. She left the hospital with the message that people must come forward to take the vaccine without any hesitation, in order to fight the disease. Additional stock To replenish the district’s depleting vaccine stock, additional doses of Covishield are expected to arrive on Thursday, said Dr. M.G. Sivadas, nodal officer for immunisation. A total of 1.5 lakh doses of Covishield are expected to arrive for five districts – Ernakulam, Palakkad, Idukki, Kottayam and Thrissur. No camps Mass vaccination camps will, however, remain suspended for now. With the stock that is set to arrive, the administration will prioritise people who are due to take their second shot, Dr. Sivadas said. “On-the-spot registrations will not be permitted. Only people who have already taken the first shot will be able to walk in to centres and take the second dose,” he added. Around 12,500 doses of the two vaccines were distributed to private hospitals on Wednesday and private centres would have their vaccination sites running on Thursday. If more doses of the vaccines are made available, the district would be able to administer around 25,000 doses daily even without mass vaccination centres, Dr. Sivadas said. So far, 7,40,446 people have taken the vaccine in Ernakulam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/oldest-recipient-of-vaccine-takes-first-jab/article34381502.ece

The Yeroor police had taken into custody Shaji’s brother Sajin Peter, mother Ponnamma and Sajin’s wife Arya on Tuesday following a tip-off. During interrogation, Sajin and his other confessed to the crime committed on the Onam day of 2018. Shaji, an accused in theft and assault cases, has been missing for two-and-a-half years and his family had created an impression that he had relocated to evade arrest. The police said the murder was committed when Sajin and his wife visited Shaji and Ponnamma at their house in Bharathipuram. A quarrel broke out between the siblings when Shaji tried to attack Ponnamma and Arya. Reportedly, Sajin hit an inebriated Shaji with an iron rod and when they realised he was dead, Sajin and his mother buried the body on the premises. The grave near the well was later sealed with concrete. Since the house stands in the middle of a vast rubber plantation with no other houses nearby, it was easy to bury the body without anyone noticing it. A tip-off It was a relative, a cousin of the deceased, who informed the police after he came to know about the incident during a recent visit. A resident of Pathanamthitta, he gave a statement before the Pathanamthitta Dy.SP who alerted the Yeroor police and the three accused were taken into custody on Tuesday. Sajin and Ponnamma have been booked under section 302 of Indian Penal Code for murder while Arya will face charges for destroying evidence and giving false information to screen the offenders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/brother-mother-held-for-kerala-mans-murder/article34380822.ece

Anjana, majority of the fresh cases were reported among people who attended various functions or among family members. “Two more spots where the virus has spread through the same route will soon be declared as clusters,” the official said. The authorities have decided to administer vaccines to only those who register in the ‘cowin’ portal or the Arogyasethu app. Besides closing the window for spot registration, the mega vaccination camps in the district too have been closed down . According to officials, the distribution of vaccine in Kottayam will now be carried out through 36 camps. Each venue will admit a maximum of 200 persons. The vaccination camp at Baker Memorial School here witnessed some tense moments following an altercation between the public and the police.

22 April 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||For singers, happy tune in tough times||Singer Devanand will soon receive a payment of Rs. 6,000 from the Indian Singers’ Rights Association (ISRA). The amount may not be much, but it is significant – because it is the first ever he is getting as royalty. “It feels nice that I have become eligible for getting royalty for the songs I have sung,” says Devanand, the singer of popular songs such as Karimizhi kuruviye... (Meesha Madhavan). “It is a promising beginning and I hope it could become one of the sources of income in the future for singers like me.” First for many Like him, it is for the first time that the majority of the Malayalam playback singers are getting royalty. It was only in 2012 that the singers became eligible for royalty. Till then, only the composer and the lyricist used to get it. ISRA members “Singers such as K.J. Yesudas and K.S. Chithra had become members of the ISRA earlier, so they have been paid from 2017 onwards,” says Sanjay Tandon, chief executive officer, ISRA. “This time around, some 60 singers from Kerala will benefit for the first time.” He adds it is only the beginning. “The amount will increase greatly once radio stations, television channels and OTT (over-the- top) platforms begin to pay royalty to the singers,” he says. “Our lawyers are negotiating with them, but it may take some time.” Seasoned playback singer G. Venugopal says he is glad that the money is being released during the tough times of COVID-19. “Our singers have been making this demand from the onset of the pandemic, and it is good to know that the ISRA has decided to distribute it now,” he says. “Of course, there is much more to be done to make the people concerned – radio stations, television channels, OTT platforms – pay us what is due to us,” he adds.  Mr. Tandon says at the moment only a few sectors, such as hotels and restaurants, are paying royalty to singers. “Hotels in Kerala and other parts of South India are not willing to pay even if we are asking them for the lowest charged item on the menu or Rs. 2.15 per room on yearly basis.” He says the ISRA is paying Rs. 6,000 each to all its 702 members from the Rs. 40 lakh it collected. “Every member is eligible for this amount, it used to be Rs. 3,225 in 2017,” he says. “Besides, singers are also paid directly for their logged songs, which are played in events like the Indian Premier League cricket tournament.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/for-singers-happy-tune-in-tough-times/article34381113.ece
22 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Kozhikode district too feels pinch of vaccine shortage||Kozhikode was not exempted from COVID-19 vaccine shortage that hit other districts on Wednesday. The Health Department is learnt to have claimed that it had stock to last only till Thursday, and if fresh stock does not arrive, it could trigger a crisis. Mega vaccination camps have been postponed until further orders. A mega vaccination camp scheduled in Koyilandy Municipality had to be cancelled, and chaos prevailed at the Cherooppa primary health centre for a while, as people thronged the premises in violation of the pandemic protocol. An official claimed that vaccine shortage was severe in the hilly areas of the district. Earlier, the number of vaccination camps had to be reduced from 117 on Tuesday to 107, reportedly in view of the scarcity. According to sources, however, camps could be held only at 103 places on Wednesday. By Tuesday night, the department reportedly had a stock of only over 1,300 vials. But replenishment arrived later. Health officials claimed that 26,000 vials were used on Tuesday. Sources said many people had thronged government-run vaccination camp sites without realising that only those who had registered with the COWIN portal could get the jab. People who wanted to have spot registration were left disappointed. Many senior citizens and those with co-morbidities had reached the centres early to have their second dose. Some of them were taken off guard by the rush. At the Government General Hospital, Kozhikode, those who had registered on the portal were given the injection, apart from 200-odd others on a first-come-first-serve basis. The rush for vaccines is reportedly driven by apprehensions about missing the second dose and also the rise in the number fresh cases in the past few days. Unruly scenes followed, and the police had to intervene in places such as Cherooppa. Wednesday is, in fact, marked for routine immunisation drives at all government healthcare institutions. From Thursday, only those who had registered with the portal will be given the jab.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-district-too-feels-pinch-of-vaccine-shortage/article34381044.ece

Consequent to the mass return of migrant fishers and allied workers to their respective States following the COVID-19 spread, many small and medium boat owners from Kozhikode district are calling off deep sea fishing and exploring options to survive the lean period. A situation akin to the trawl ban prevails at most harbours, with the number of anchored boats going up by the day. Fishermen from Puthiyappa and Beypore harbours said they were in deep crisis, and that they had no option but to cancel trips to save on fuel and labour expenses. “The sea has been turbulent for weeks making survival tough for small and medium boat owners. Though a few ventured into the rough sea, the catch was poor. We fear that the situation may prevail for a few more weeks,” said Irfan Habeeb, a fisherman from Vellayil harbour. He pointed out that several jobless fishers had opted for construction work. Fishermen from the Puthiyappa harbour said they were not even getting enough revenue to manage operational costs thanks to the fall in fisheries resources. They argued that at least Rs. 40,000 was required, including the fuel cost, to prepare a medium-size boat for a single trip. But the income generated is not even sufficient to meet the operational expenses. “A majority of migrant fishers from Odisha and Maharashtra have already returned home in the wake of the alarming COVID-19 spread. Only trawler boats with better facilities will be able to survive the crisis,” said Karichal Preman, vice president, All Kerala Fishing Boat Owners Association. He felt that the recurring accidents involving ships and fishing boats had deepened the sense of insecurity among fishers. Feeling blue, leaders of fishermen’s associations have called upon the State government and the Fisheries Department to address joblessness in the sector and provide relief packages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fishers-in-troubled-waters-yet-again/article34381049.ece

A decision of the finance standing committee of the Corporation to extend the contract with ISO consultancy firm Aqua Management Systems to October 31, 2021, was approved by the Corporation Council on Monday. The corporation entered into a contract with the consultancy in July 2019, following which the firm trained the civic body employees in various departments and set up 10 quality committees to ensure ISO standards in the day-to-day activities of the corporation. However, the renovation works at the corporation office building was a hindrance to the proper functioning of the maintenance and beautification committee, housekeeping committee, layout identification committee, front office committee and the record room arrangements committee. Pointing out the importance of an efficient front office and record room for the certification, the consultancy sought an extension of the contract period, which ended in January 2020 to either June 2020 or three months after the completion of the renovation works, assuming that works would be completed by July 2020. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 affected the plans, with restrictions at the office, as a result of which the renovation could not be carried out as expected. With local body elections scheduled for October 2020, it was decided to renew the contract with the consultancy from November 2020 and conclude it by March 2021. The local body elections were delayed for two more months, further affecting the plans. At present, the renovation works of the corporation office are progressing fast. The works on the first floor and third floor have been completed. However, it will take at least six more months to finish the work on the second floor. Hence, the corporation has decided to reschedule the ISO certification process to August 2021 and complete it by October 2021. The finance standing committee has noted that the project may even spill over to the next financial year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-corpns-iso-plans-to-be-extended-further/article34381057.ece
22 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Traders up in arms against imposition of time restrictions||Instead of imposing time restrictions, merchant outlets in the State should be allowed to function round the clock in view of the Ramadan season, Mujeeb Rahman, State working president, Textile and Garment dealers Association, Kerala, has said. Addressing the media here on Wednesday, he said more working hours meant less rush and hence less chance of COVID-19 spread. Ramadan shopping mostly takes place at night, and the new COVID protocol restraining shops from functioning beyond 9 p.m., would cause huge financial loss to the business community. Mr. Rahman was part of a group of merchant organisation representatives led by the Calicut Chamber of Commerce and Industry that asserted that the business community was not to blame for the spread of COVID-19, while rallies by political parties remained unchecked ahead of the Assembly polls. “The restrictions are being imposed in such a manner that they affect the merchant community seriously. The authorities are trying to create an impression that COVID-19 was spread by traders,” said Chamber president Zubair Kolakkadan. The business community is not against the COVID-19 protocol. On the other hand, all business establishments should be allowed to function freely in keeping with the protocol. The public should be allowed to visit beaches and malls freely. But the authorities should make sure that the COVID-19 protocol is being followed, he added. Biju K., district vice president, Hotel and Restaurant Association, said the thoughtlessness behind time restrictions on restaurants during Ramadan. “People come out of their homes only after breaking their fast, by around 7.30 p.m. If we have to close down by 9 p.m., what is the use of opening at all?” he asked. C.E. Chakkunni, State president, All Kerala Consumer Goods Distributors’ Association, said, “If they [business community] lose business in the coming season, most of them will not survive,” he said, adding that the State should compensate the loss facing small traders from the GST collected.

Speaking in the backdrop of the death of a woman officer, BEFI State general secretary S.S. Anil said employees were working under tremendous pressure owing to non-banking work. He blamed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for giving silent permission to banks to undertake such work. BEFI joint secretary N. Meena said the officer who allegedly took the extreme step was not the first to do so due to work pressure. She added that several officials had opted for voluntary retirement owing to intolerable work demands. Mr. Anil pointed out that many of the reforms in the banking sector were unscientific. Shortage of staff, lack of basic facilities, irrational targets, and unnecessary interventions by senior officials were destroying employee morale, he said. While banks have been entrusted with implementing Central projects such as Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyothi Bima Yojana, and Atal Pension Yojana, employees have additional responsibilities of life insurance, general insurance and medical insurance schemes and mutual funds. Besides, there are separate targets for deposits, loans, NPA, and recovery. As a result, employees are susceptible to severe mental stress, Mr. Anil said.

Anwar reportedly admitted that he waylaid Farhath as she was going for work at a dental clinic on March 10 at a deserted place near her house.

22 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||LSGD finds new way to use construction waste||The Local Self-Government Department (LSGD) has stipulated that local bodies need to make arrangements to monitor and collect construction/demolition waste and use part of it for government contract work. The fresh guidelines are part of an LSGD order issued to lay out the responsibilities of local bodies and their secretaries and other officials in waste management. According to the order, as much as 10% to 20% of the waste generated as part of building demolition or as construction waste can be used in government contract work. The local bodies are also expected to make available enough containers to collect such waste and take steps to transport them to processing centres. If such demolition waste contains dangerous substances or chemicals, the appropriate authority has to be contacted for the guidelines to process these. Waste management The order says that the local bodies have to prepare a waste management plan based on the State policy. There should be a mechanism to collect solid waste at the doorstep. An annual user fee should be collected from waste generators. Identity cards have to be provided for those involved in waste collection. Those who are not part of the unorganised waste collection sector should also be made to register. Sanitation workers employed in cleaning streets should be asked not to burn the waste in public spaces. They should collect, segregate, and hand it over to the agencies collecting waste. Biodegradable waste should ideally be treated at source or in common, decentralised composting facilities. Burning of plastic waste has to be completely avoided. Unscientific land filling by mixing it with different kinds of waste has to be completely avoided. Only waste which cannot be recycled or reused or the rejects which are produced during waste processing can be used for scientific sanitary land filling. Studies have to be conducted on legacy waste dumps and possibilities of bio-mining have to be explored. In case bio-mining is not possible in a particular place, scientific landfill capping measures have to be taken.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lsgd-finds-new-way-to-use-construction-waste/article34381111.ece
22 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||No one will have to pay for vaccine in State: CM||The State government will keep its commitment to the people to make COVID-19 vaccines free of cost to every one of its citizens, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Wednesday. Even though the new vaccine policy of the Union government leaves the State, already in dire financial straits because of the pandemic, to shoulder the burden of vaccine costs, the State government has no intention of going back on its word to vaccinate everyone for free, he said. Mr. Vijayan said that there was no politics involved in his demand that the Centre should fulfil its responsibility towards the States. It was a demand for the common good of people. It was up to the Centre to ensure that the States had adequate vaccine supplies to protect the people. ‘Stand together’ The State and the Centre should be standing together to fight the pandemic. Instead, the Centre had chosen to wash its hands of its responsibility regarding vaccines and has now left the State governments to compete in the open market along with private players for securing vaccines. Kerala is doing the best it can to vaccinate all its population above 45 years . The State has an enviable record of zero vaccine wastage too. But acute vaccine shortage for the past few days is threatening to derail the entire vaccination process, Mr. Vijayan said. Explaining the restrictions the government has decided to impose on civil life and movement of people, he said that the current situation is grave and that the intense pace of disease transmission has overshot all prediction of public health experts. The State is doing everything to prepare the health system so as to meet all medical emergencies that would arise. Though the current restrictions would create some difficulties, it is up to the people to understand the gravity of the situation, he said. Steps are being taken on a war footing to intervene in areas where the test positivity rate is over 35%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-one-will-have-to-pay-for-vaccine-in-state-cm/article34381132.ece
22 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||With shortage, vaccination hits a low||The uncertainty triggered by vaccine shortages persisted in the district on Wednesday as well, with people struggling to get their doses, even as the daily COVID-19 caseload crossed the 1,000-mark for the second consecutive day. Due to the shortage, the number of doses administered in the district fell to 5,444 on Wednesday, compared to 11,247 on Tuesday and 20,247 on Monday.  The Government Medical College Hospital, the General Hospital and the Women and Child Hospital, Thycaud, accounted for the bulk of Wednesday's vaccinations. This included 3,798 doses of Covishield and 1,646 doses of Covaxin. So far, 7,44,820 doses have been administered in the district. Vaccines awaited Health officials in the district said they expected the arrival of 2.5 lakh doses at the regional vaccine store by Thursday evening, but this was not yet confirmed. ''We were expecting the vaccines on Wednesday. They are now expected on Thursday. Once the consignment arrives, it will be shared among Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts. The quota for Thiruvananthapuram is yet to be ascertained,'' a senior official said. Several people called at the Jimmy George Indoor Stadium, Vellayambalam, on Wednesday unaware that the vaccination drive at this venue had been stopped until further notice due to vaccine shortage. Several people who had registered online on the CoWIN portal for their dose failed to get vaccinated at the General Hospital as the authorities reportedly gave preference to patients who were issued tokens on the spot. In all, 7,801 new cases have been reported in Thiruvananthapuram district in the past one week alone. Inoculation at 9 centres Meanwhile, District Collector Navjot Khosa announced that vaccines will be administered in nine centres in the district on Thursday. Covishield vaccine will be administered at the Government Medical College Hospital, General Hospital Thiruvananthapuram, SAT Hospital, Malayinkeezhu Taluk Headquarters Hospital and the city health centre at Rajaji Nagar. Covaxin will be available at Fort Taluk Hospital, Chirayinkeezhu Taluk Headquarters Hospital, the Family Health Centre at Chettivilakom, and the Idayadikkode Devi Tample Hall at Pangappara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-shortage-vaccination-hits-a-low/article34381595.ece

22 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||LSGIs to spearhead COVID-19 management in Kerala||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said ward-level committees of local self-government institutions (LSGIs) comprising elected members, ASHA worker, Health Department staff, the police, and volunteers would spearhead the State’s COVID-19 control drive. The teams would visit houses and evaluate the pandemic situation at the neighbourhood level. They would have a definite say in deciding micro-containment zones. The police would make a public announcement requesting people to observe the pandemic protocol. They would urge residents to remain indoors as far as possible on weekends and during curfew. Mr. Vijayan said the newly elected local body functionaries could draw on the experience of their predecessors to manage the pandemic. He asked LSGIs to give particular focus to migrant workers and ensure their welfare. Mr. Vijayan denied he had broken the COVID-19 protocol. His daughter had contracted virus. Later, he tested positive but remained healthy. The virus ran its course without hurting him much. Mr. Vijayan said there was nothing wrong with him travelling home from the hospital with his wife. “Such things are common in ordinary families,” he said.  Karnataka CM’s plea Amid raging cases in Karantaka, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Wednesday asked his Cabinet colleagues to work more proactively in districts to check the virus spread. The direction comes a day after opposition leaders, at an all-party meeting, criticised the government over its handling of COVID-19 crisis. In a letter to the Ministers, the Chief Minister said the second wave was taking the entire nation into its grip and all the districts should take measures to contain it. Also, the Karnataka government directed labs and testing agencies to give the RT-PCR test results within 24 hours after collecting samples. It instructed that the test results be updated on the ICMR portal. Oxygen shortage Amid concern over shortage of oxygen, the Karnataka government has requested the Centre to fill the lacunae, State Health Minister K. Sudhakar said on Wednesday. He said the State might require 1,500 metric tonnes of oxygen every day. “The Chief Minister has requested the Centre to provide 1,500 metric tonnes every day. I have appealed to the Central Ministers also to provide additional oxygen and we are hopeful of a positive response,” Mr. Sudhakar said.

The control room can be contacted at 0471-2377702, 2377706 According to Corporation officials, the control room will also be a contact point for ambulance services, disinfection services for institutions and complaints regarding violation of COVID-19 protocols. "Over the past few days, the Corporation has been getting calls with a variety of doubts about the protocol. Many are confused as to whether their house is located in a containment zone or a micro containment zone and what it means if their area is declared as one. Some others call with doubts as to whether they can travel to another city during the night for important functions or meetings. The control room will have a support system to address all such queries. We will consider expanding the control room further based on the public response," said an official. The Corporation had opened a control room last year as well after the pandemic outbreak. However, the load this time would be lesser as the Corporation is not running community kitchens, a major reason for the clarification calls last time. The rapid response teams in many of the wards have also been reactivated considering the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Only one camp Meanwhile, only one vaccination camp could be organised by the Corporation on Wednesday due to the lack of vaccine supply. The Corporation has till Wednesday organised decentralised vaccination camps in around 40 wards, with the last one held in Mudavanmugal.

22 April 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Sample fireworks go symbolic at Pooram||Just two ‘kuzhiminnal’ (a noisy firework) were burst at the sample fireworks, the first round of fireworks ahead of the main one at Thrissur Pooram, on Wednesday evening, indicating the grave COVID-19 situation in the State. One firework each was burst by the Thiruvambadi and Paramekkavu Devaswoms, the main organisers of the Pooram. Arguably for the first time, sample fireworks were held in such a minimalistic fashion, though the Devaswoms had completed all preparations for a grand show. Usually people would throng the Swaraj Round and the lanes around the Thekkinkadu Maidan when the skies above the Thrissur city explode in vibrant colours. On Wednesday, it was just like any other day. People did not even notice the sample fireworks with just two ‘kuzhiminnal.’ As disposal of the already prepared firecrackers is not easy, they will be displayed on April 24, but there will be no viewers. Poora Vilambaram, the declaration of opening of the pooram, will be held on Thursday morning without the usual festivities. The deity of Neythilakkavu Temple, one of the 10 participants of the Pooram, will open the Thekke Gopura Nada of the Sree Vadakkunnathan temple declaring open the Pooram. As elephant Thechikkottukavu Ramachandran, which used to carry the idol, did not get permission for parading, Ernakulam Sivakumar will carry the idol of the Neythilakkavu Bhagavathy. Nod for 50 persons Ezhinnellippu will start around 8 a.m. from the temple to the accompaniment of 17 percussion artists and 33 organisers. Permission has been given only for 50 persons for the Vilambaram ritual. The Thekke Gopura Nada of the temple will be opened only for Thrissur Pooram. The Animal Husbandry Department will examine the fitness of elephants to be paraded for the pooram and will issue certificates. A team of 30 veterinary experts have been appointed for this. The health of the elephant, its history of obedience and experience in participating in parades will be checked. An action force with elephant experts will be kept ready to handle emergency situations. As part of the Pooram, the District Collector declared holiday for all government offices and educational institutions in Thrissur taluk on April 23. However, pre-announced examinations will be conducted as per schedule. Shops and business establishments in Swaraj Round and approaching roads will not be opened on April 23. There will be traffic restriction in the city on April 23 and 24.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sample-fireworks-go-symbolic-at-pooram/article34381126.ece

22 April 2021||ANTANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Rayalaseema districts have sufficient oxygen supplies’||The oxygen supply in Rayalaseema districts is sufficient and the infrastructure set up during the peak of the pandemic last year has put the region in a comfortable position, Nodal Officer for oxygen and Assistant Director of Drug Control Authority Pullagarula Ramesh Reddy told The Hindu . “Anantapur district had a maximum per-day requirement of 23 tonnes of oxygen in all forms--either in bulk cylinders or for refilling large storage tanks installed at the GGH, Super Speciality Hospital, Cancer Hospital and Hindupur, Guntakal and Kadiri government hospitals--during the peak of the pandemic in September 2020 with 3,300 hospital beds occupied,” he pointed out. The Central government had allocated 4,500 new oxygen cylinders to the State last year with Anantapur district getting 300 out of them. The district now has 1,000 cylinders (7.1 cubic meters each) in addition to the 13 kl liquid oxygen tank installed on the GGH premises, another 10 kl tank in the new super-speciality block and a 6 kl tank at the Cancer Care Centre in the adjoining compound. In the private sector, RDT Bathalapalli has a liquid oxygen storage tank of 5 kl and the KIMS Saveera has an air separation unit for oxygen production. To augment the availability of oxygen-supporting beds in Andhra Pradesh, the Centre has allocated 20 MT of oxygen from JSW Steel Plant at Ballari, 28 MT from Linde Gas at Ballari, 10 MT from the Air Water, and another 10 MT from Barukha in Bengaluru. While the first two plants supply liquid oxygen through tankers to Anantapur, Kurnool and Kadapa, the Air Water and Barukha are supplying to hospitals in Tirupati and Chittoor. Four liquid oxygen tanker carriers of the contracted agency, Varasi Oxygen, are supplying to Anantapur hospitals, while Apex Oxygen with 20 kl capacity and Kumar Oxygen with 34 KL capacity oxygen refilling units in Anantapur is catering to the needs of other private hospitals. The Yerraguntla-based agency Varasi Oxygen supplies liquid oxygen to Kadapa also. The RS Gas with a bulk oxygen cylinder filling sunit at Kurnool caters to the needs of the district. ‘No shortage’ Special Correspondent from Ongole adds: There is no shortage of oxygen supply to treat critical COVID patients in Prakasam district, said Collector Pola Bhaskar. “We have taken all steps to avoid wastage and use the available oxygen judiciously to needy patients,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rayalaseema-districts-have-sufficient-oxygen-supplies/article34380873.ece

22 April 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||After 15 days, transport staff call off strike in Karnataka||After 15 days of protest, employees of road transport corporations called off the bus strike in Karnataka on Wednesday evening. The employees of the four transport corporations, including the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), had gone on an indefinite strike from April 7 demanding implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. At a press conference, honorary president of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Employees League Kodihalli Chandrashekar said the strike had been called off after the Karnataka High Court order on Tuesday. While hearing a batch of PIL petitions on Tuesday, the High Court observed that it was perhaps the “worst time” for employees to strike even if the demands are assumed to be legitimate. The withdrawal of strike will come as a huge relief to people who had to rely on other modes of transport since the strike began on April 7. After the court’s observation, a majority of the staff came for work on Wednesday morning itself.

The live telecast of Tiru Kalyana Mahotsavam (celestial wedding) from the temple across several television channels provided a virtual fete experience for devotees, offering some solace for the ardent devotees of Lord Sitaramachandra Swamy. In adherence to the age-old tradition, Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar and Endowments Minister Indrakaran Reddy presented mutyala talambralu and pattu vastrams on behalf of the government to the temple deity at the celestial wedding amid chanting of Vedic hymns by the temple priests. Bhadrachalam MLA Podem Veeraiah, Endowments Department Commissioner Anil Kumar, Additional Collector K Venkateswarlu, and Superintendent of Police Sunil Dutt, were present.

22 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||COVID genome sequencing hit by sample shortage||Three months into the formation of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) of top 10 regional labs of Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, they are yet to get sufficient number of samples from COVID-positive patients from both government and private healthcare centres. “In the last few months, the funds have come by and necessary reagent purchases have been made. Coordination among the labs is improving too. However, we are not getting the required number of samples. It is about 50-60 samples a day when we can do genome sequence up to 1,000 samples. Efforts are being made for samples to be received by the labs to sequence the maximum and get the best outcome of that,” discloses CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) director Rakesh Mishra. CCMB and Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) are among the 10 labs chosen by the Centre for genome sequencing of COVID-19 samples. “We are supposed to get 5% of the new positive samples collected from various districts, mandals and even villages from across Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, parts of Karnataka and Goa. But, we have been receiving samples from limited geographical locations whereas the supply from the remote places is not there. It is also because the government health machinery has once again been stretched to the limit in the second wave,” he points out. States like Karnataka and Goa seem to have preferred sending the COVID samples to the local labs. “Here, we need the help of governments and local bodies to secure more samples from those testing positive. We also need samples from private hospitals where people are getting admitted for effective and continuous monitoring,” says Dr. Mishra. The consortium had, so far, genome sequenced up to 14,000 samples across the country finding “large number of variants of which 2,000 variants fall into the ‘concerned’ category”. “The very nature of the virus is to mutate and check into other nearby hosts. We have to continuously keep monitoring the variants to look for any potent strains which may make the available vaccines redundant or cause more rapid transmission. For that, we need to enhance our sample collection and also sequencing numbers,” he affirms. The exercise is to ensure not a single variant arising from any remote corner escapes the notice of scientists. And, if one such dangerous variant is sighted, the particular area can be quarantined to keep it under check. “We are currently studying the double mutation variant and results should be out soon. Genome sequencing of the COVID samples will also establish whether the spike is due to superspreader events, look for high mortality, morbidity trends and co-relate with the associated symptoms. Reinfections, too, can be effectively monitored through this process,” says the CCMB director. Other labs involved in genome sequencing are NIBMG Kalyani, ILS Bhubaneswar, ICMR-NIV Pune, NCCS Pune, InStem/NCBS Bengaluru, NIMHANS Bengaluru, CSIR-IGIB Delhi, and NCDC Delhi. Dr. Mishra had already stated that double mutation or ‘B.1.617’ variant is largely prevalent in Maharashtra (up to 50%) and UK variant in Punjab (up to 50%). These are found to be 5-10% prevalent in other places and it could mean the current spike is likely due to the commonly prevalent virus strains and lack of COVID-appropriate behaviour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-genome-sequencing-hit-by-sample-shortage/article34381483.ece

22 April 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tobacco farmers worry over market correction, warn to stall auctions from Monday||Tobacco farmers have decided to serve an ultimatum on the traders that they will stall the auctions in all 11 platforms from Monday if there is no improvement in market price for their produce. Thanks to rising COVID-19 cases and uncertain demand in the global markets, exporters are adopting a wait-and-watch policy, giving farmers sleepless nights as they carry the bitterness of the pandemic disrupting trading last marketing season. Auctioning of tobaccohad begun on an optimistic note in the middle of March after a delay of about a month, especially on the platforms coming under the Southern Light Soil (SLS) region. ‘Nivar’ cyclonic storm had played spoilsport during the early phase of rabi, forcing the farmers to go for gap-filling and re-plantation in the farms that had witnessed damage, delaying plucking of leaves and curing. The bright grade varieties had initially attracted buyers at Rs. 180 per kg against Rs. 210 per kg expected by the growers as they fetched a price of up to Rs. 250 per kg in Karnataka. After a month, the market started to go southwards, inducing a correction of Rs. 10 to Rs. 30 per kg depending upon the variety of tobacco offered by the growers. The exporters, who are unsure of the global demand in the wake the second wave of coronavirus, have kept away from the market on the pretext of lack of confirmed orders. “We were hoping to recoup the losses incurred last year as the virus-induced lockdown coincided with the peak marketing season, as the bright grade varieties accounted for a majority of the crop this year. But our hopes are dashed in the wake of the market going southwards,” YSRCP farmers’ wing Prakasam district president Mareddy Subba Reddy said, and sought the immediate intervention of the Tobacco Board. “We will not hesitate to stall the auction from next week if the market continues to remain lacklustre,” Mr. V.V. Prasad, Farmers’ Welfare Association leader in Ongole II auction platform, told The Hindu . The farmers are in jitters as the authorities mulled imposing local restrictions in the red zones once again. Traders are trying to knock away with our produce offering low prices, taking advantage of COVID-19 health situation, according to a group of farmers in D.C. Palli. “We have not left with any other option than stalling the auctions in the absence of concrete steps by the Union and State governments to revive market buoyancy,” said Vellampalli II Tobacco Growers’ Association president N. Chimpriya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tobacco-farmers-worry-over-market-correction/article34381020.ece

Citing the industrial mishaps owing to the poor maintenance of safety equipment during the closure of factories during the COVID-induced lockdown last year, he said the factory managements must ensure the functioning of fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, fire sprinklers and fire hydrants among others. “Inspection of all major industries including pharmaceutical companies were completed last week.

22 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||No lockdown in Kerala; Karnataka seeks oxygen||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday ruled out a State-wide lockdown. However, the government would curb civic life to a considerable measure on the weekend to slow down the transmission of a resurgent and more virulent COVID-19 virus. There was no change in the higher secondary examination schedule, he said. Only essential services would operate on April 24 and 25. The government has declared Saturday a holiday. Mr. Vijayan said the government had not insisted on a lockdown. It was incumbent upon citizens to save the State a shutdown, he said. Hence, residents should sequester themselves indoors as far as possible on Saturday and Sunday.  The 9 p.m. to 5 a.m curfew would continue till May 3. Shops should down shutters at 7.30 p.m. District magistrates could relax hotel timings to deliver food to citizens observing Ramzan fast, he said. Karnataka CM’s plea Amid raging cases in Karantaka, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Wednesday asked his Cabinet colleagues to work more proactively in districts to check the virus spread. The direction comes a day after opposition leaders, at an all-party meeting, criticised the government over its handling of COVID-19 crisis. In a letter to the Ministers, the Chief Minister said the second wave was taking the entire nation into its grip and all the districts should take measures to contain it. “Against this backdrop, you need to swing into action to prevent the spread of the disease in your district concerned, get in touch with the district authorities continuously and create awareness among people on controlling the spread of the virus,” Mr. Yediyurappa stated. Also, the Karnataka government directed labs and testing agencies to give the RT-PCR test results within 24 hours after collecting samples. It instructed that the test results be updated on the ICMR portal. Oxygen shortage Amid concern over shortage of oxygen, the Karnataka government has requested the Centre to fill the lacunae, State Health Minister K. Sudhakar said on Wednesday. He said the State might require 1,500 metric tonnes of oxygen every day. “The Chief Minister has requested the Centre to provide 1,500 metric tonnes every day. I have appealed to the Central Ministers also to provide additional oxygen and we are hopeful of a positive response,” Mr. Sudhakar said.

22 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Buy vaccines directly, Union Minister tells State||Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan on Wednesday said Kerala should use the Centre's new vaccine strategy to procure vaccines directly from manufacturers. Kerala should also step forward to vaccinate citizens above the age of 18 freely. The Centre had delivered 62,42,833 doses to Kerala till April 21. Another six lakhs doses would reach State by April 25. “The Kerala government still sought to blame the Centre for vaccine shortage,” he said. He said the disparity between availability and allocation of COVID-19 vaccines had caused public order to break down at State-run inoculation centres in Kerala. “Kerala could deliver only fewer than 1 lakh doses a day. But it had invited double the number of citizens to State-run vaccination centres. The resultant anarchy turned the centres into virus transmission hubs,” he said. Criticised Mr. Muraleedharan drew sharp criticism from the CPI(M) for his comment. CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said Mr. Muraleedharan had no moral right to criticise the Left Democratic Front government. The administration had shielded the people from the ravages of the pandemic. Mr. Muraleedharan had not helped the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/buy-vaccines-directly-union-minister-tells-state/article34380827.ece
22 April 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD claims ‘Jabali’ as the original birthplace of Lord Hanuman||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has claimed ‘Jabali’, nestled in the Anjanadri Hills that forms a part of the sacred abode of Lord Venkateswara, as the original birthplace of Lord Hanuman. In a formal declaration on Wednesday, Vice-Chancellor of National Sanskrit University Muralidhar Sharma said the TTD had arrived at the conclusion “after taking all the historical, geographical and epigraphical evidence into consideration” . The TTD Pundit Parishad, specially constituted for the purpose, also echoed with the findings after corroborating the evidence. Prof. Sharma said that though there were several claims by various authorities regarding the actual birthplace, no material evidence as such could be produced by them to substantiate their assertions. Later, addressing the media, executive officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy said the TTD would soon initiate measures for taking control over ‘Jabali’, popularly known as ‘Jabali theertham’, which was now under the control of the Andhra Pradesh Endowments Department. In reply to a question, Dr. Reddy said, if required, the TTD would also take the issue to the notice of both the State and Central governments and get ‘Jabali’ officially declared as the original birthplace of Lord Hanuman. The claims by people of six other States, including Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana lacked concrete reasoning, he said. Book soon “All the evidence gathered so far will be soon brought out in the form of a book,” Dr. Reddy added. Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit, who was present at the declaration event organised at the Nada Neerajana Mandapam at Tirumala, concurred with the TTD’s decision and said he felt blessed to be present on the occasion.

22 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sri Rama Navami celebrations remain a low-key affair||The Sri Rama Navami celebrations remained a low-key affair in the city on Wednesday. Temples and local community associations chose to celebrate without fanfare owing to the steep rise in the coronavirus infections in the State. However, a festive mood prevailed as devotees visited local markets to buy mango leaves to decorate their houses. The activity at Rythu bazaars remained more or less the same. But, artisans selling the Rama idols in Vijayawada said that they had incurred losses as there were a few buyers. The festival were organised at Ramalayam at Satyanarayanapuram, Besant Road, One Town, Kodanda Rama temple at Patamata, the Ram Mandiram at Eluru Road and Sri Abhaya Anjanaya Swamy temple on Ghat Road in Vijayawada among other places. As part of the celebrtations, the wedding of Lord Rama and Goddess Sita was performed at 12 noon on punarvasu nakshatra yukta abhijit lagna pushkaramsa. However, the rituals were confined to the temples. There were no huge gatherings. The temples echoed with songs like ‘Sri Sita Ramula Kalyanam Chuddamu Rarandi’, ‘Kalyana Vaibogame, Sri Sita Ramula Kalyana Vaibogame’ and the film songs of ‘Lava Kusa’ and other movies. Several Rama and Anjaneya Swamy temples in the city reverberated with the chants of Jai Sri Rama, Kodanda Rama, and Janaki Rama. The temple trustees distributed panakamto people. Besant Road, which used to wear a festive look for nine days, surprised many with a little activity. There were no huge pandals that used to welcome the devotees.

22 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||No fresh recruitments in party, says surrendered Maoist Maranna||Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) Special Zonal Committee (SZC) member Muttannagari Jalandhar Reddy alias Maranna alias Karuna, who surrendered before Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang on Tuesday, said there were no recruitments in the CPI (Maoist) for the last few years. The Maoist leader, who had served in various capacities in the banned outfit for more than two decades, said the strength of the party had been dwindling by the day. “The main problem being faced by the Maoists is recruitments. The party is facing several other problems too. Being a senior leader in the party, I had disagreed with some issues and decided to join the mainstream,” Maranna told The Hindu . “As the local Adivasis are unwilling to join the movement, the Maoists are recruiting tribal people from Chhattisgarh. The Maoists have no support of the Adivasis in many hamlets now,” said Mr. Sawang. On the back foot “Due to the changed scenario in the cut-off area in the AOB, the Naxalites are facing difficulty in reviving the movement. With the A.P. and Odisha police launching joint operations, the Maoists are on the back foot,” the DGP said. According to the figures available with police, the cadre strength of the Maoist, which was about 170 in the AOB earlier, has come down to 80 now. The number of area committees, which was eight earlier, has come down to four. The People’s Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA), which once had two companies, has only one now. The two divisional committees in the AOB have one platoon. “This shows the cadre problem in the Maoist party,” Mr. Sawang said. The DGP said eight exchanges of fires had taken place in which eight Naxalites were killed. Six Maoists, who included one SZC member, one divisional committee member, and an area committee member, were arrested. As many as 31 Naxalites, including 20 from the AOB SZC, surrendered . Two DCMs and seven ACMs were among those who joined the mainstream, the DGP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-fresh-recruitments-says-surrendered-maoist/article34380828.ece

Implementation of the recommendations of the 11th Pay Revision Commission (PRC) is one of their major demands, and to build pressure on the authorities concerned, the UTF is spearheading an agitation in a phased manner. As part of it, the UTF leaders will lead protests by teachers, employees and pensioners on Thursday (April 22) in every mandal in the State. In a statement on Wednesday, N. Venkateswarlu and K.S.S Prasad, president and general secretary of the federation, said the 11th PRC formed to study the salaries and other benefits of the employees, had submitted its report in October last. But the government had been whiling away time without implementing the recommendations. Because of this, employees, teachers and pensioners were losing out heavily in terms of monetary benefits. They said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to implement the PRC without delay during his padayatra, and had included the issue in the manifesto. Pointing to the fact that it had been three years since the panel was formed, the UTF leaders sought that the authorities grant them 55 % fitment allowance and other monetary benefits retrospective from July 1, 2018. The federation mourned the demise of its senior leader and former president of Guntur district Mohammed Gous.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/utf-protest-today-seeking-implementation-of-prc-report/article34381554.ece

He said the rapid surge of the virus in the second wave had thrown life out of gear and it was the bounden duty of every section to shoulder the responsibility of helping the government mitigate the virus impact. He said shops and other businesses should not allow crowding of people and opt for door delivery, takeaway or online mode. Three cardinal rules Mr. Srinivasulu urged people to follow the three cardinal rules of wearing face masks, maintaining social distance and making frequent hand-washing a habit. He said in the last 20 days, his department personnel had collected fines from 50,000 people who were not wearing a mask.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/traders-told-to-implement-no-mask-no-entry-policy/article34381644.ece
22 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Exempt advocates, parties from physical appearance in trial courts’||The State branch of the All India Lawyers’ Union (AILU) has requested Chief Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court Justice Arup Kumar Goswami to disallow the physical appearance of advocates and parties at the trial court level keeping in view the rapid spread of COVID-19 and to declare vacation from May 1 to June 1. In a letter to the Chief Justice on Wednesday, AILU State president S. Rajendra Prasad and general secretary N. Srinivasa Rao said that though the filing of cases was being done in the High Court both physically and online, they were being heard only online. “Whereas, the functioning at the trial court level is by way of physical appearance of the advocates and parties,” they said. In the districts, many advocates, clerks and their family members had succumbed to the virus, they said, and added that “it is, therefore, better not to allow physical appearance of the advocates and parties as there is the risk of getting infected.” The AILU office-bearers further requested the Chief Justice to ask the government to give utmost priority to the vaccination to advocates and their family members as the advocates played a vital role in the administration of justice. “The Chief Justice will do well to send a proposal to the State government to extend financial support to the advocates in need,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/exempt-advocates-parties-from-physical-appearance-in-trial-courts/article34381558.ece
22 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Impose restrictions to curb COVID spread, say denizens||Denizens across the city, alarmed by a lack of concrete action to combat the rising second wave of COVID-19 cases, are calling for tight measures to be implemented in order to ensure people follow safety norms, such as wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing. With no restrictions in place, and feeble enforcement of norms, people moving freely in the city without wearing masks or following physical distancing norms has become a common sight. With the outbreak of the second wave, the district has been recording at least 350 new infections on an average every day. In this month, 28 persons affected by COVID-19 died while undergoing treatment. In a letter to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, retired IAS officer E.A.S. Sarma suggested him to make wearing masks in public places mandatory, and impose a fine of Rs. 2,000 on people found breaching the rule. He also sought that officials allow not more than 30 people for any kind of public gathering. He also suggested restrictions on inter-State movement, as neighbouring States too are witnessing spikes in infections. “The RT-PCR test must be made mandatory for passengers coming to A.P. via airports, railways, inter-State bus services, and private vehicles. The State should ramp up public healthcare infrastructure by creating special COVID hospitals with adequate beds, ventilators, oxygen supply, and other ICU facilities. The earlier system of containment zones should be revived urgently,” he stated. Human Rights Forum (HRF) AP & TS Coordination Committee member V.S. Krishna urged the State government to put an effective stop on large religious congregations, big assemblies and gatherings and election rallies. “The government should initiate measures to ensure that unorganised migrant labourers do not undergo the suffering they were subjected to last summer. They should be provided all basic amenities and their economic well-being and safety suitably addressed and assured,” Mr. Krishna said. Meanwhile, some people sought immediate restrictions on people converging on Beach Road in the evenings. “Beach Road is one place where people gather in large numbers. In such a situation, it is better to prevent entry of people, at least during weekends and public holidays,” said P. Vasu, a resident of Maddilapalem. “Officials should ensure COVID-19 safety norms are brought back in public transport. Overcrowding of auto-rickshaws and packed buses has been a common sight despite the increase in cases. Night curfew can be implemented to prevent public gatherings late at night. It would also raise awareness that the COVID-19 situation is not something to be taken lightly,” said Meghna M., a resident of Seethammadhara. Many feel that the government should also bring in some restrictions on shopping malls and multiplexes, where the distance between seats have already been done with. Enforcement of thermal scanners, hand sanitisers at malls, cinema theatres and public places should be monitored, said K. Padma of Mahila Chetana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/impose-restrictions-to-curb-covid-spread-say-denizens/article34381655.ece
22 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Oxygen generator plant at KGH to be operational soon||King George Hospital (KGH) will not only achieve self-sufficiency in meeting its own oxygen requirements but may also be able to supply it to other hospitals in the region, once work on the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plant is complete. Work on construction of a shed for the PSA plant, flooring and electrical works for the two oxygen generators, of 1,000 LPM (Litres Per Minute) capacity each, has been completed by the A.P. Medical Services Infrastructure Development Corporation (APMSIDC). “The two oxygen generators were received in the first week of this month. They were placed on the pedestals. Installation/erection of compressors, oxygen generator, air drier and air receivers and connection to the oxygen manifold system is pending completion by Airox Technologies Private Limited. We expect the plant to be ready in a few weeks’ time,” Dr. PV Sudhakar, Principal, Andhra Medical College said. It may be recalled that the Centre had sanctioned two oxygen generators of 1,000 LPM (Litres Per Minute) each to KGH in the past. KGH already has liquid oxygen tanks of 20 KL and 13 KL capacity on the hospital premises. The 20 KL tank meets the requirements of the superspecialty block and the 13 KL tank is connected to the different wards in the hospital. The tanks are refilled with liquid oxygen on a regular basis. The average daily oxygen requirement of KGH is around 3,500 litres. “The oxygen generators will be an alternative to us, when there is a shortage in the supply of liquid oxygen. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a huge demand for oxygen. The oxygen generators will be of immense help during such times,” he said. “The supply of oxygen gas from the liquid oxygen tanks, to the wards and superspecialty block is done through pipes. The purity of oxygen supplied through cylinders and by conversion of liquid oxygen ranges between 98% and 99%, the purity of oxygen produced by the oxygen generators will be in the 93% - 95% range. However, the 93 - 95% purity is enough for medical needs,” Dr. Sudhakar told The Hindu in the past.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/oxygen-generator-plant-at-kgh-to-be-operational-soon/article34381648.ece

22 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Reconsider move to suspend classes, APPSA urges Minister||The Andhra Pradesh Private Schools Association (APPSA) has appealed to Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh to reconsider the government’s decision to suspend school for students of classes I to IX, and instead allow them to function after taking all necessary COVID-19 precautions. In a letter to the Education Minister on Wednesday, APPSA State chairman K.S.N. Murthy said that if the schools are kept closed, it would result in a drop in literacy rate and create unemployment problems in the future. “Students have remained at home, and have become addicted to TV and mobile phones for nearly 10 months, and just when the situation was about to get back to normal, the announcement by the government that there would be no examinations for classes I to IX, and that holidays would be declared, has come as a big blow to private school managements, parents and students,” Mr. Murthy said. “When classes are not run, the low-budget schools would not be in a position to pay the salaries of their teachers and parents are reluctant to send their children to school in view of the surge in COVID-19 cases,” Mr. Murthy said, appealing to the Minister that managements be allowed to run the schools on a shift system or on alternate days or cancel the Class X examinations and announce that the academic year for 2021-22 would begin sometime in June, depending on the COVID situation. The government should come out with an announcement that examinations will be conducted for classes I to IX as soon as the schools are reopened. This would compel them to study at home for the examinations and not neglect their studies. They should also be directed to clear 70% of the fees, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/reconsider-move-to-suspend-classes-appsa-urges-minister/article34381652.ece

Thulasi Reddy on Wednesday said the “inefficiency and large-scale corruption resorted to by the YSR Congress Party government in the State is turning the Polavaram project into a curse for the State”. ‘Project lifeline of State’ In a statement on Wednesday, the Congress leader alleged that the Polavaram multi-purpose irrigation project, considered the lifeline of Andhra Pradesh, was hanging fire because of the inefficiency of the Jagan Government. With the Central government dragging its feet on releasing funds, a shadow of uncertainty loomed large over the project designed to irrigate lakhs of acres across the coastal region of the State, generate power and supply drinking water. The Congress leader said it was unfortunate that from a gravity project, Polavaram was being reduced to a life irrigation project, from a multi-purpose project to a small reservoir. Reverse-tendering process Referring to the the YSRCP government’s reverse-tendering process, Mr. Thulasi Reddy said though it had saved the State government Rs. 222.44 crore, the additional burden on the State exchequer was to the tune of Rs. 3,222 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/polavaram-hanging-fire-owing-to-ysrcp-inefficiency-congress/article34381643.ece

On Tuesday, 20 COVID-19 patients died and 6,542 were detected with the virus. Day after day, a new high number of cases and deaths is being recorded. The highest number of deaths in a day last year was 14. However, doctors in government and private hospitals have been claiming that the deaths are more than what is being mentioned in daily media bulletins. The rate at which number of people with coronavirus is increasing in the State can be understood when data from beginning of the second wave is considered. Steep surge The cases started to increase again from March 9. From 395 cases on March 20 — a month ago — the daily cases increased to 6,542 on April 20. Of the new cases, the highest of 898 were from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), 570 from Medchal Malkajgiri, 532 from Rangareddy. The lowest of 42 were from Mulugu. From March 2 last year to April 20 of this year, a total of 1,20,73,090 samples have been put to test and 3,67,901 persons across the State were detected with the virus. Of the total, 46,488 were active cases while 3,19,537 have recovered and 1,876 have died. The sudden spike in active cases has been a cause of concern. From around 1,900 to 2,000 active cases per day in February to March 14 this year, the number steadily rose to touch the 4,000-mark by end of March.

22 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Rules followed on second day of night curfew||On the second day of night curfew, employees and owners of several business establishments across the city were seen packing up early, even before the stipulated closing time of 8 p.m. Many superstores even put up notice at their entrance announcing closure of their premises by 7:45 p.m. The roads started looking deserted by 8 p.m. itself, even as people from residential areas thronged the nearest stores for last minute purchase of essentials. Similarly, heavy crowds were seen at liquor outlets in the twin cities, while executives of app-based food delivery aggregators queued up at several restaurants, as there was no restriction on e-commerce. Police started to make arrangements for imposing the curfew at the appointed hour by arranging barricades and deploying personnel at all strategic locations. They were seen moving in patrol vehicles, appealing to all shops and establishments to close the businesses and go home early. In view of the rapidly deteriorating situation in the State, policemen counselled people to avoid going and staying out unless absolutely necessary. There were check-posts every one kilometre, and huge police deployment across the city. Although the implementation of the night curfew was strict, there were no complaints of harsh behaviour by policemen, as instructions had come from the top for policemen on the ground to focus on awareness and implementation but avoid high-handedness. At many check-points, policemen were seen counselling commuters politely, telling them to stay at home for their own safety. Also, policemen counselled commuters to leave from their workplaces early and reach home well before 9 p.m. to avoid challans or detention. Meanwhile, an YouTube channel that claims to be a news platform was booked by Hyderabad police for sharing a false video of police exerting force (lathi-charge) on people to implement the night curfew. Police said that the concerned journalist would be arrested for creating panic and confusion in the minds of general public. “It also attempted to create dissatisfaction among the police force,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rules-followed-on-second-day-of-night-curfew/article34381486.ece
22 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||E-link to check bed status goes live||A government website that displays the status of beds in COVID hospitals in Telangana went live on Wednesday morning. The website, https://health.telangana.gov.in/, was mentioned in the media bulletin issued on Wednesday. Information on the number of regular, oxygen and ICU beds available at government and private hospitals, number of beds occupied, and those vacant, would be updated regularly. According to the updates on the website at 7.04 p.m. on Wednesday, there were 2,899 ICU beds available in private hospitals and 986 in government hospitals. However, since a lot of people had a tough time getting a bed, doubts were raised over the veracity of information. When checked, over 400 ICU beds were available at private hospitals in Hyderabad limits. In a few, all ICU beds were vacant. Sources from corporate hospitals said that the government should design a system where a person can get information about where a bed is available and at what time, they should reach the hospital. “Currently, family members of moderate to severe COVID patients are desperately going from one hospital to another to request a bed. If there is a system where a person is informed of a particular time to go to a hospital to admit their patient, it will bring down the anxiety levels and uncertainty among family members,” sources said. There is another reason for such a system to be introduced. When all family members test positive, including some with moderate or critical symptoms, the asymptomatic ones are stepping out of their house, and doing the paper work at hospitals. Multiple sources in corporate hospitals have informed of this situation, which is not at all safe. Sources said that the Health department would announce a few phone numbers to know the status of beds in a few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/e-link-to-check-bed-status-goes-live/article34381480.ece

The SLBC decision, especially date from when the changes come into force, are likely to be conveyed late in the night, the sources informed. According to the agenda of the meeting, the proposal was to have the arrangements in place from April 22-May 15. A clear picture will emerge on Thursday morning, source said. The proposals likely to be implemented include limiting business hours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and closing the banks by 4 p.m. Broadly, this would mean one hour less available to customers to conduct transactions at the branches. On banks operating with 50% staff, a senior official of a leading public sector bank said it was unlikely to be implemented in small branches or facilities with less than eight staffers. The 50% norm or alternate day working for the staffers will apply to controlling offices, administrative offices and large and medium branches. Alternate channels In doing so, the banks, however, will ensure that all alternate (banking) delivery channels will remain operative. Back office services of the banks, including currency chests, ATM cash loading vendors, Core Banking Solutions projects, offices in data centre, data recovery centres, ATM back offices, security operation centres for cyber security, service branches, clearing houses and bank treasury offices and others facilities authorised by the head offices of the bank will function as per normal routine. Leaders of bank unions said in State Bank of India, whose staff strength is 12,500 in the State, over 625 employees have tested positive for COVID-19 while the number across all banks could be anywhere between 1,200-1,500. Union demand The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine unions representing bank employees and officers, had also appealed to the SLBC to consider various measures in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases, including reduced working hours, functioning with limited staff, opting for hub banking or offering services at select branches as well as vaccinate the bankers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/banks-set-to-cut-down-business-hours/article34381469.ece
22 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Doctors weigh in on the possible ways to ease burden on ICU beds||With a steep spike in coronavirus infections in the State, ICU beds in hospitals are fast getting filled up or, worse, unavailable for COVID-19 patients showing severe symptoms. Filled with anxiety and desperation for critical care attention, family members of COVID patients are trying all means to arrange for an ICU bed. Many others are concerned over whether they will manage to arrange for an ICU bed should they or someone in their family test positive for the infectious disease. Considering the current situation, senior doctors have certain suggestions to help avoid tragic scenarios as witnessed in other States where COVID patients died waiting for hospital beds.  ‘Can allot trained staff to run expanded ICUs in govt. hospitals’  D. Nageshwar Reddy, chairman of AIG Hospitals, Gachibowli, says it is time for the government and private sectors to collaborate. He suggests that corporate hospitals can allot trained human resources to run expanded ICUs in State-run hospitals as the government can absorb costs. “We (private facilities) cannot set up ICU beds on a day’s notice. It takes 10 days or more. Two factors are involved — infrastructure and human resources. ICUs need specialised beds and other components such as high-flow nasal oxygen. It takes two to three weeks to get ventilators after placing an order. So, it takes 10 to 15 days to expand ICU,” Dr Reddy says. The same amount of time is needed to train staff in handling patients who need intensive care. He added that private hospitals will be at a loss as the expanded ICUs might not be used when the severity of the pandemic reduces. “Four to five private hospitals can take care of around 200 beds. It is not expensive to provide human resources. It will be a win-win situation,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/doctors-weigh-in-on-the-possible-ways-to-ease-burden-on-icu-beds/article34381461.ece
22 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Four lakh Remdesivir jabs for govt. hospitals in a week: KTR||Government hospitals in the State will be supplied with four lakh Remdesivir injections within a week, IT and Industries Minister K. T. Rama Rao said after a meeting with pharma companies producing Remdesivir injections. Keeping in mind the increased demand for injections, Mr Rama Rao asked the pharma companies to increase their production and ensure four lakh Remdesivir injections were supplied to government hospitals within the next one week. In the wake of spike in coornavirus infections across the State, hospitals are seeing a shortage of Remdesivir injections. Both, the inflow of patients in healthcare facilities and the demand for the injections is increasing by the day. Patients suffering from breathing problems are being given oxygen as well as Remdesivir injections which are said to be yielding good results. There were reports in the media that the shortage of injections was being commercially exploited by some agencies and medical shops that were selling the injections four to five times the original cost.  In the wake of surge in cases, the inflow of patients and demand for the injections is increasing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/four-lakh-remdesivir-jabs-for-govt-hospitals-in-a-week-ktr/article34381475.ece
22 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SBI frontline staff hit hard||Chief General Manager of State Bank of India, Hyderabad Circle, Om Prakash Mishra on Wednesday urged customers to conduct banking transactions through the host of safe and secure product offerings on the bank’s digital platform, YONO and internet banking. He said this after taking fresh stock of the situation arising from the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, especially how it many frontline staff across various facilities of SBI have been affected. The senior banker appealed to the customers to visit the bank branches only if it is extremely necessary. A release from the SBI Circle said Mr.Mishra during the discussions with a few important constituents of the bank expressed concern at the evolving situation. He cautioned that current state of infection from COVID of a large number of staff may impact the functioning of branches in the State. The rising COVID cases have “affected badly many of the frontline staff serving the customers at branches and loan processing cells, despite adequate precautions,” the release said.  Referring to various measures being taken by the bank, Mr. Mishra emphasised on continued strict adherence to preventive measures, including social distancing as well as use of sanitisers, masks and thermal scanners. Towards minimising the inconvenience to customers, SBI Hyderabad Circle has set up a dedicated, temporary helpline (040-23466233) that will function during business hours for customers to check the status of branch functioning. It will also provide information on any alternate branch arrangements, if available. Urging them to avail themselves of services of the helpline, Mr. Mishra asked customers to ‘Go Digital, Stay Home and Defeat Corona’, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sbi-frontline-staff-hit-hard/article34381468.ece
22 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BC body urges CM to fill up Group posts||National Backward Classes Welfare Association president R. Krishnaiah requested Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to issue notifications to fill Group-I, II and III posts since the issue over zonal system has been resolved. ‘No notification yet’ In a letter addressed to the Chief Minister on Wednesday, Mr. Krishnaiah said notification for Group-I posts was not issued for the last 10 years and about 1,600 posts in the direct recruitment quota in 18 departments were lying vacant. Many such posts were being handled by others with ad hoc promotions. He alleged that several direct recruitment posts were being filled with promotions as the higher authorities concerned were not identifying the direct recruitment posts properly while sending proposals to the government for filling them. He suggested the government to identify by taking into account the number of Group-I and II officers retired during the last 10 years and how many promotions were given to the two group posts during the period. Mr. Krishnaiah said even by the rough estimate about 1,600 Group-I posts, 4,000 Group-II posts, 5,000 Group-III posts and 36,000 Group-IV posts were under the direct recruitment quota and requested the government to fill them by issuing notifications. He also appealed to the Chief Minister not to give in to the pressure from the employees’ associations, who he said would want to delay the direct recruitment so that they could still stay in those posts. He also sought a clarification from the government on direct recruitment to the 34 categories of State cadre posts as there had been a talk that all such posts would be filled with promotions, causing grave injustice to the unemployed youth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bc-body-urges-cm-to-fill-up-group-posts/article34381478.ece
22 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||ICMR clears decks for more dry swab coronavirus tests||Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday issued a second advisory regarding using the RNA extraction free dry swab method for the RT-PCR-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 developed by CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB), thereby clearing the path for more usage of this faster testing method. The development comes in the wake of the current surge of cases in the pandemic. The dry swab method will save time and reduce cost as compared to the standard PCR test using Viral Transport Medium (VTM) and RNA extraction. This would help in increasing the testing “three fold with existing resources” and since it is as good as the standard test, according to senior scientists. ICMR had conducted two validations of the dry swab method in August and November 2020, respectively. The dry swab method involves collection of a VTM (imported and expensive virus transport medium) less dry oropharyngeal / nasopharyngeal swab from suspected patients. It is distinctly safer and convenient for healthcare workers as no liquid handling is involved. The swab is then transported to the lab. Thus, the sample can be directly isolated from the patient swabs, and testing using a one-step protocol. In comparison, the current gold-standard RT-PCR method requires many expensive reagents and steps that add to the expertise, money and time required for the tests. Senior scientists have stated that the dry swab or DArRT-PCR test reduces the time and human effort by 40-50% in the current setting of testing. ICMR in the latest advisory states that if a sample comes out as positive after a dry swab test, it has to be reported as such and inscribed in the online database. However, if the dry swab test indicates negative for a person with symptoms, a repeat dry swab test with standard RT-PCR test is recommended. CCMB has tied up with Apollo Hospitals, Spice Health and Meril Life Pvt ltd. for commercially upscaling the dry swab testing method across the diagnostic labs in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/icmr-clears-decks-for-more-dry-swab-corona-tests/article34381470.ece

Remdesivir is considered a key drug in the treatment of coronavirus. Along with that, people are also finding it hard to lay their hands on Tocilizumab. Officials had earlier said that enough doses of the drug are available with the State Health department. Heads of corporate hospitals said though they have the capacity to attend more patients with coronavirus, shortage of the anti-viral drug is posing a problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/shortage-of-remdesivir-tocilizumab-continues/article34381467.ece

22 April 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Row over compensation to project oustees||There seems to be a difference of opinion among oustees over vacating villages. This was evident at a meeting held at Etigaddakishtapur village in Toguta mandal, which passed a resolution not to vacate the village till all the pending payments were made. The meeting was presided over by Sarpanch K. Pratap Reddy on Tuesday. Collector P. Venkatarami Reddy had held a meeting with the oustees of Etigaddakishtapur and Brahmana Banjerpally of Toguta mandal on Sunday and requested them to vacate the village stating that the project was nearing completion. He had promised to clear all their compensation money once they shift to the R&R Colony. The meeting was held with the elders of different castes who were finally convinced with the arguments put forth by the Collector. “While admitting that injustice was meted out to some of the genuine oustees due to some technical issues, Mr. Venkatarami Reddy promised that all those who are eligible, will get their due without fail and if any remaining payments were pending they would be cleared once we vacate the village,” Bhum Reddy, a farmer from Etigaddakishtapur told The Hindu . Similar was the case with Brahmana Banjerpally. “There are about 325 families in our village and about 25 of them initially asked for houses that would be constructed by the government at R&R Colony. But, later, they changed their mind and opted for open plots. The Collector has given us six months for temporary accommodation at Sangapur to construct the houses. We have the option of staying outside as well for which they pay Rs. 5,000 per month as rent,” said S. Ramu. He said that some of those claiming pending payments from the government were not coming forward to meet the Collector though district authorities were ready to clear them. “I was not informed about the meeting held on Sunday. We have decided not to vacate the village till all payments are cleared in the village itself. The officials have promised to provide temporary accommodation for about 325 families but what about others. Can all of them get rented accommodation? Is it possible to complete the construction within six months, the grace period sanctioned by the authorities?” asked Mr. Pratap Reddy, a TRS sarpanch.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/row-over-compensation-to-project-oustees/article34381587.ece

22 April 2021||New Delhi,||Chaotic scenes outside GTB Hospital ward||People dying outside emergency ward of the second largest Delhi government-run hospital, relatives not getting bodies from the mortuary even after 18 hours, people not finding a bed even after going to five hospitals: these were the scenes at Delhi government hospitals as COVID-19 cases are at a record high in the city. As the largest Delhi government hospital and several others filled up two days ago, pressure has been more on GTB Hospital, the second largest Delhi government hospital and officials are struggling to cope up with it. Inside the emergency ward of GTB hospital, stretchers doubled up as beds with one touching the other, people shared beds and there was a constant queue outside the crowded emergency ward. Deaths at emergency Around 11.15 a.m., an unconscious 75-year-old man with low oxygen levels was brought to the emergency of GTB Hospital in a car by her wife and daughter. Doctors carried out the ECG on the patient, but did not convey anything to the relatives and left. The family understood that he might be dead. Still, his wife and daughter kept rubbing his hands, trying to keep him warm, and the wife repeated even after it: “Please open your eyes once... Please open your eyes once...” It was around 11.45 a.m., after waiting in a line outside the emergency and several requests to the doctors, his ECG was done again, which drew a straight line. The doctor tore a small paper, which was the ECG report, and the family left. The death was not recorded at the hospital. A woman in her early thirties, who was for the past half an hour either lying outside the emergency or walking with the help of her husband was declared dead outside the emergency. Surender Kumar, 35, her husband was seen shifting her body into the ambulance without any help and he struggled to alone drag her body from the stretcher into the ambulance. “We were waiting outside the emergency and she breathed her last while waiting,” Kumar, a daily wage labourer from Bihar said outside the emergency. In a span of one hour, two people were declared dead outside the emergency. “Our resources are stretched and doctors are testing positive. The staffer number has not gone up with the increase in patients, but we are trying our best,” a senior doctor of the hospital said. “Many people are dying inside and outside the emergency ward. It’s not that doctors are not trying, but there are too many patients. I was there the whole night,” Deepak Kumar, 32, who came for his uncle’s treatment said. Delay in bodies Outside the mortuary of GTB Hospital, Muskaan, 25, complained that her 29-year-old brother, a COVID-19 patient, died at the hospital around 11 p.m. on Tuesday, but they have not got his body till 2 p.m. on Wednesday, even after 15 hours. “We have fought with them, but they’re saying that our number is 13 and we’ll have to wait,” Muskaan said. The family alleged that he had only minor symptoms when he was admitted and the hospital did not take care of him well. At 4 p.m., Mehraj Ali, 36, said that they have been waiting for his elder brother’s body for more than 18 hours. “We were looking for a bed from 8:30 am on Tuesday and finally got a bed here around 8 pm and my brother died at 10 pm,” he said. A Delhi Police officer posted at the mortuary said that he has been on duty from 6:30 am. “It’s not that we are not working, but 40-45 people are dying every day. How will we manage it? The workers had lunch just now. I’ll be on duty till 7 pm. We need more manpower,” he said. Outside Rajiv Gandhi Hospital, a COVID-19 dedicated hospital, Sumit Yadav, 33, said that they have been waiting outside for over one hour for a bed for his 67-year-old father, who was gasping for air inside the ambulance. “This is the fifth hospital we are going to and our oxygen cylinder is also about to be over,” Mr. Yadav said as he broke down. Rajiv Gandhi Hospital has 30 vacant beds at 5:30 pm, as per Delhi government data, but officials at the hospital said that there are no beds and Mr. Yadav was turned away. People have been facing the same issue with government data on beds for many days. “We don’t know where we will go now, we are going with fate now,” a teary eyed Mr. Yadav said.  Our resources are stretched and doctors are testing positive.

22 April 2021||New Delhi,||Private oxygen suppliers struggle to keep up||Private oxygen suppliers and NGOs volunteering to provide oxygen to seriously ill COVID-19 patients in the city are running from pillar to post to fulfil the demand over the last three to four days but to no avail. While some who mainly deal in supplying oxygen for industrial purposes have switched over completely to dealing in medical oxygen, the cost of a 10-litre cylinder of oxygen had, they claimed, shot up three times in as many days since the Delhi government’s admission that oxygen supplies were running low at city hospitals. “Patients are coming to us in visible desperation, folding their hands and requesting whatever amount of supply we can provide because they are somehow managing to get hospital beds but not oxygen,” said Pramila Juneja (name changed on request), from Patel Nagar, who runs an industrial oxygen supply business with her husband. “We are trying our best to help as many patients as possible and have switched completely to supplying medical oxygen from industrial oxygen. Things have gone from worse to worst over the last three to four days,” she said. Distress calls Mohammad Umair, a businessman who volunteers for the NGO ‘Youth for Nizamuddin’ in south east Delhi, said distress calls for food and water during last year’s lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic had been replaced by distress calls for oxygen this time around. “Four days ago, I got a 10-litre oxygen tank, which can last around five to six hours for one patient, filled for Rs. 6,000. But the very next day, after issues about oxygen supply were raised by the Delhi government the same tank now costs Rs. 16,000,” Mr. Umair said. “We are managing small supplies from U.P. but no matter how much we get it is not adequate due to the current panic around the supply of oxygen,” he complained. Dheeraj Kumar, an oxygen supplier based in north-west Delhi’s Rohini said the panic around oxygen supply had set in all of a sudden after the weekend. “All I can say is that I have received 450 calls which started around 5 a.m. today. This was not the case two days ago, but has happened since last night,” he said. “I am trying my best to be able to help anyone and have missed three calls while talking to you. The demand has suddenly shot up but the supply has not kept pace,” he said.

22 April 2021||New Delhi,||Over 1,000 last rites performed in 3 days||Over a thousand residents, 1,057 to be precise, were laid to rest after losing their battle to COVID-19 in the last three days, according to official data maintained by the Capital’s three civic bodies. A daily average of around 352 deaths, compiled data from the three municipal corporations released by the BJP posited, was recorded between April 18 and April 20 at 21 crematoria and burial grounds located in the nine municipal zones in the city. Municipal data According to the data, 290 last rites which included 273 cremations and 17 burials were performed on April 18; 357, including 334 cremations and 23 burials on April 19 and 410, including 391 cremations and 19 burials were performed on April 20. The most cremations, 208, were carried out at Nigambodh Ghat in north Delhi followed by 185 at the Punjabi Bagh crematorium. Most burials, 22, were recorded at ITO Ferozeshah Kotla Muslim Kabristan followed by 17 at the Mongolpuri Christian Burial Ground. Giventhe rising daily death toll, the authorities concerned have ramped up the capacity dedicated to the last rites of victims at such facilities from 475 to 655 over the same period. Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana attacked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accusing him of “politicking over deaths” due to the mismatch between the number of deaths officially categorised as COVID deaths by the Delhi government and the numberof cremations and burials of COVID patients occurring at such facilities over the same period. According to the Delhi government, 678 deaths — 161 on April 18, 240 on April 19 and 277 on April 20 – were recorded. “Delhi government statistics say that 678 deaths occurred due to COVID-19 but the municipal corporation figures show that 1,057 deaths occurred. Arvind Kejriwal you are politicising deaths too,” Mr. Khurana alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/over-1k-last-rites-performed-in-last-3-days/article34381174.ece
22 April 2021||New Delhi,||HC entrusts circus hippopotamus with welfare trust||“The journey of Chotu – the Hippopotamus has finally been a happy one!” the Delhi High Court said while giving the responsibility of life-long care of Chotu, who was part of the Asiad Circus, to Radhe Krishna Temple Elephant Welfare Trust. ‘Chotu’, a male hippopotamus, has been at the centre of a three-year-long legal battle fought by the PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) India against the Asiad Circus. The hippopotamus was originally part of the Asiad Circus, which went into difficulties due to financial constraints. PETA India, after acquiring knowledge that ‘Chotu’ could be in danger, approached the Delhi High Court seeking immediate seizure of the hippopotamus. Illegally retained PETA India argued that the animal was being illegally retained by the Asiad Circus, despite licence of the circus having been cancelled. It was alleged that the circus was making the animals perform illegally. On January 22 this year, PETA India informed the High Court that despite repeated orders, Asiad Circus had failed to disclose the status and location of the hippopotamus. Following this, the High Court had then directed Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Delhi, to immediately take steps for seizure of the hippopotamus from the custody of Asiad Circus. Last week, the court was informed that Radhe Krishna Temple Elephant Welfare Trust has been given the custody of the hippopotamus on October 27, 2019, and since then, he has been living in the facility maintained by the Trust. Satisfied with care An inspection done at the facility by the Animal Welfare Board (AWB), including representatives of PETA India, found “complete satisfaction in the manner in which the hippopotamus is being kept in the said facility, in terms of its living condition, food etc”. The AWB also confirmed that all the facilities and minimum standards are being completely taken care of. It said the Trust may continue the life-long care of the hippopotamus. The report also concluded that the hippopotamus was found to be healthy, mentally as well as physically. Taking note of the submission, Justice Prathiba M. Singh said, “It is heartening for this court to learn that such a facility with good living conditions and high standards is being run by the Trust”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-entrusts-circus-hippopotamus-with-welfare-trust/article34381167.ece
22 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi Police keeps the spirits high||From arranging oxygen cylinders to providing green corridors and facilitating movement of the same; supplying food to admitting COVID-19 patients to hospitals, the Delhi police have saved hundreds of lives by going beyond the call of duty. The police have received zero calls for food or money assistance but have received around 130 calls of medical assistance mainly oxygen cylinder requirement. Since the last two days, the police have been flooded with requests by city hospitals to arrange oxygen cylinders amid shortage of supply during the ongoing pandemic. On Wednesday, 32 lives were saved after they managed to arrange 11 oxygen cylinders for Amarleela Hospital in west Delhi’s Janakpuri after they got a distress call around 9 a.m. saying oxygen stock at the facility was nearly exhausted. “The police contacted local oxygen suppliers and succeeded in finding medical oxygen. Eleven cylinders were arranged for the hospital from three different locations — Kirti Nagar, Gole Market and Mayapuri,” Additional DCP (West) Prashant Gautam said. In another instance, a green corridor was provided to facilitate movement of a truck carrying oxygen containers from Singhu border to Jaipur Golden Hospital in Rohini. The Alipur police station received an information around 9 a.m. that a Haryana-bound truck carrying oxygen containers was stuck on KMP flyover at Kundli border. “A green corridor was established for quick movement of the oxygen tanker. Under police escort provided by Alipur police station, the oxygen tanker was escorted to Jaipur Golden Hospital and it was ensured that the truck safely reached the hospital in minimum possible time,” said DCP (Outer North) Rajiv Ranjan Singh. According to the police, in Shahdara, SHO Vivek Vihar and his team managed to save 52 lives in ESI Hospital in Jhilmil by arranging oxygen cylinders on emergency basis on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-police-keeps-the-spirits-high/article34381175.ece

22 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Cheap politics being played over oxygen’||The Delhi Congress on Wednesday said that cheap politics is being played in the name of oxygen for patients and lashed out at the Delhi government for its failure to tackle the spread of COVID-19 infection in the Capital which has lead to a breakdown of the healthcare system. Congress leader Alka Lamba said that Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia tweet about the lack of oxygen in the Capital created an outcry due to which the family of patients could not sleep peacefully all night and the government had not made it clear whether oxygen had reached those hospitals. She accused the “sleeping government” of playing a “tweet-tweet game” which worked to shock the public and patients of Delhi. “There is not a single ICU, ventilator vacant in government hospitals. Why is the Delhi government silently watching the spectacle while serious patients are doing the round the hospitals,” Ms. Lamba asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cheap-politics-being-played-over-oxygen/article34381171.ece
22 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Congress leader writes to Assam CM on ‘separate State’ barb||A former Congress MP has sought action against the chairman of Assam Higher Secondary Education Council (AHSEC) for allegedly asking people of Bengali-dominated Barak Valley to secede if they are unwilling to learn the Assamese language. In a letter to Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Tuesday, All India Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev said AHSEC chairman Dayananda Borgohain’s remark was unacceptable and discriminatory. She also forwarded a video of his “controversial” statement in a tweet tagging the Chief Minister. Referring to a notification of the Board of Secondary Education, Assam (SEBA), on students opting for the Assamese language as the seventh subject, Mr. Borgohain allegedly said people in Barak Valley must live in a separate State if they do not want to learn Assamese. “It is shocking that an officer issues a threat to the people of Barak Valley to learn the Assamese language or get separated from Assam. It reeks of chauvinism,” Ms. Dev said. “This comment is in complete ignorance of our history and comes as an insult to the people of Barak Valley. To say the least, it alienates us and is discriminatory. Mutual respect for each other’s language and culture is the idea of India. People speak different languages in Assam and have peacefully coexisted and comments like these are against the interest of Assam. The government must take action immediately, failing which it will only prove to me that it condones the comment and shares the same views,” the letter said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/congress-leader-writes-to-assam-cm-on-separate-state-barb/article34381544.ece
22 April 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan CM seeks free COVID-19 vaccine for people above 18 years||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday sought free COVID-19 vaccination for youths above 18 years, while affirming that a uniform policy should be adopted for people belonging to different age groups. “The youths’ resentment against the Union government will increase on not getting free vaccine,” Mr. Gehlot said. Appreciating the Centre’s decision to vaccinate every person above the age of 18 from May 1, as demanded by the Congress party, Mr. Gehlot said it would not be appropriate to charge a price from youngsters when others were getting it for free and that the same medical staffers were engaged in inoculations for all age groups. “The virus is now spreading fast and the death rate is also high. In such a situation, the Central government should speed up free vaccination instead of putting the financial burden on those above 18 years,” Mr. Gehlot said on Twitter. In another tweet, the Chief Minister reiterated his call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stop his political programmes and rallies in West Bengal and instead pay attention to the improvement of medical and health infrastructure. “Despite India being among the leading countries producing oxygen, medicines and vaccines, people are dying because of lack of these basic facilities... No other country has witnessed deaths owing to this reason,” Mr. Gehlot said.

The activists said workers of the unorganised sector needed immediate attention owing to loss of livelihood. In a memorandum submitted to CM Ashok Gehlot here on Wednesday, following announcement of COVID-19-related restrictions till May 3, rights groups said that homeless workers, street vendors, ragpickers, construction labourers and house helps should get financial assistance of Rs. 5,000 each per month. The beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act should be given pulses and cooking oil in addition to foodgrains, which should also be increased to 10 kg per person, they said. Besides, the State government’s Indira Rasoi Yojana should be implemented in all small and big towns to provide cooked food to the poor for free, said the groups. For making health services available to patients, a COVID-19 dashboard should be created in the State following the pattern of Mahrashtra and Delhi, the memorandum stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/special-package-sought-for-needy-during-pandemic/article34381453.ece

Padvi said on Wednesday. Mr. Padvi said Maharashtra was witnessing a rise in number of COVID-19 cases and this pandemic was not limited to urban areas but had spread to rural parts and even tribal hamlets. “Considering the lack of resources with the tribal population, the State government has decided to pay for the Remdesivir injection if administered in private medical facilities,” he said. The minister said that he had approved the use of Rs. 10 lakh for every project officer of the integrated tribal development project from the nucleus budget of the department. “We will ensure that a shortage of funds does not cause hindrance to implementation of any tribal schemes. The department has allocated Rs. 172 crore solely to provide health-related facilities,” Mr. Padvi said. The department has, however, applied certain criteria for providing free Remdesivir injections. Among those are, annual income of the beneficiary should be within Rs. 8 lakh and the private hospital should not have been enrolled in the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Aarogya scheme. Besides, primitive tribes, widows, deserted women, handicapped, and those below poverty line will be given preference.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/state-to-foot-remedisivir-bill-for-tribal-patients-says-padvi/article34381082.ece

In a letter to Mr. Thackeray, State Congress president Nana Patole wrote, “All citizens above 18 years will be eligible for vaccination from May 1. This will pose the danger of the virus spreading due to crowds at vaccination centres.” Mr. Patole added that universal vaccination has proved to be an effective measure against COVID-19. “Maharashtra has undertaken a massive vaccination drive, but due to strict restrictions, beneficiaries are facing difficulties in reaching the vaccination centres. In rural areas, people are suffering because of fewer vaccination centres, which are situated at distant locations.” Meanwhile, the Mumbai (Suburban) Guardian Minister Aaditya Thackeray on Wednesday said a vaccination centre should be set up in each of the 227 wards of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. “It is important to open vaccination centres in all wards ,” said Mr. Thackeay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-appeals-to-cm-to-start-door-to-door-vaccination/article34381081.ece

I am not a medicine expert, but I appealed only with the knowledge about the Centre’s protocol and the WHO’s solidarity clinical trial,” she said. Ms. Choudhari said as per the WHO’s solidarity trial, the injection made a difference only in clinical assessment and had no effect in reducing mortality or the infection. “The task force treatment protocol of the State stipulates that the injection should be used only in the patients on oxygen support, and it has to be administered within five days of treatment,” she said. The Collector further said that the injection shouldn’t be recommended blindly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/collector-urges-doctors-for-cautious-use-of-remdesivir/article34381083.ece

22 April 2021||Washington,||Chauvin convicted of Floyd’s murder||Former Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin, 45, was foundguilty of murder and manslaughter by a juryon Tuesday, nearly a year after he used his knee to pin the neck of an African American man, George Floyd, to the ground, killing him. Mr. Chauvin, who is white, faces a potential 40-year jail sentence. Floyd’s deathsparked ‘Black Lives Matter’ protestsfor racial justice across America, the likes of which the country had not seen since the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, speaking to CNN , described sitting in the courtroom listening to the verdict as, “a moment I would never be able to re-live, I will always have inside of me.” An emotional Mr. Philonise talked about his faith and listed the names of other victims of police violence. Tuesday’s result was announced after a jury of six white and six racial minorities reached a (necessarily) unanimous verdict deliberated for some 10 hours and found Chauvin guilty on counts of second degree unintentional murder, third degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Floyd had said, “I can’t breathe”repeatedly during the approximately nine-minute encounterwith Chauvin on May 25 last year, an encounter that was filmed by bystanders, particularly a teenage girl, whose footage went viral on social media. Witnesses to the incident pleaded with the police to let go of Floyd. Others charged Three other officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder in the second degree. The trial was televised and Mr. Chauvin, 45, dressed in a grey suit and wearing a surgical mask, appeared to listen intently, eyes darting from side to side, as the judge read out the verdict for each of three charges brought against him by the State of Minnesota. The judge revoked his bail $1 million and Chauvin was handcuffed and taken into custody immediately. While the verdict was welcomed in Washington D.C., the expressions of relief were tempered with reminders that this was a beginning and not an end to systematic racism. “Today a jury in Minneapolis did the right thing,” former U.S. President Barack Obama wrote, saying justice was done in this particular case at least. “But if we’re being honest with ourselves, we know that true justice is about much more than a single verdict in a single trial,” Mr. Obama, said. Biden’s address President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the first African American woman in her position, addressed the nation on Tuesday night after the verdict was announced. “America has a long history of systemic racism,” she said, adding that Black people — Black men in particular — have been treated as “less than human” throughout the course of history. “Black men are fathers, and brothers, and sons, and uncles, and grandfathers, and friends, and neighbours. Their lives must be valued in our education system, in our health-care system, in our housing system, in our economic system, in our criminal-justice system, in our nation,” Ms. Harris said. “It was a murder in the full light of day,” Mr. Biden said, calling systemic racism “a stain on the nation’s soul.” Mr. Biden said he had spoken with the family of Mr. Floyd again — he had spoken with them on Monday. “I’m praying that the verdict is the right verdict,” Mr. Biden had said earlier. It is rare for a sitting President to comment on the outcome of a trial before its conclusion. However, Mr. Biden said he had waited until the jury was sequestered (i.e., without access to the outside world) before calling the family. “Let’s also be clear that such a verdict is also much too rare,” Mr. Biden said on Tuesday night. “For so many people, it seems like it took a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors. A brave young woman with a smartphone camera, a crowd who was traumatised... a murder that lasts [sic] almost ten minutes in broad daylight... officers standing up and testifying against a fellow officer instead of just closing ranks… for so many it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver... just basic accountability.” Chauvin will be sentenced in approximately eight weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chauvin-convicted-of-floyds-murder/article34380764.ece
22 April 2021||Washington,||India should be a ‘country of particular concern’: U.S. panel||The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), an independent bi-partisan commission, has recommended for the second year in a row that the State Department put India on a list (‘Countries of Particular Concern’ or CPCs) for the worst violations of religious freedoms in 2020. One of the 10 USCIRF commissioners presented a dissenting view. The USCISRF recommended that the administration impose targeted sanctions on Indian individuals and entities for “severe violations of religious freedom”. A second recommendation was for the administration to promote inter-faith dialogue and the rights of all communities at bilateral and multilateral forums “such as the ministerial of the Quadrilateral [the Quad]”. Another recommendation — to the U.S. Congress — was to raise issues in the U.S.-India bilateral space, such as by hosting hearings, writing letters and constituting Congressional delegations. The USCIRF recommendations are non-binding and the Trump administration had rejected the USCIRF recommendation to designate India a CPC last year, when it released its own determinations in December. The key concerns of the 2021 report include the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The report says, “Mobs sympathetic to Hindu nationalism operated with impunity,” and used “brutal force” to attack Muslims in Delhi’s riots in February 2020. On the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the report says, “The consequences of exclusion — as exemplified by a large detention camp being built in Assam — are potentially devastating…” Efforts to prohibit interfaith marriage — such as those in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh — are also highlighted as a concern. “These efforts targeting and delegitimising interfaith relationships have led to attacks and arrests of non-Hindus and to innuendo, suspicion, and violence toward any interfaith interaction,” the report notes. In an apparent reference to the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in March 2020, the USCIRF says, “At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, disinformation and hateful rhetoric — including from government officials — often targeted religious minorities, continuing familiar patterns.” Johnnie Moore, an evangelical who is the president of The Congress of Christian Leaders as per his USCIRF bio, included a dissenting note in the text of the report saying India should not be designated a CPC but was at a “crossroads”. India is “diversity personified” and “its religious life has been its greatest historic blessing,” Mr. Moore wrote. “India’s government and people have everything to gain and nothing to lose from preserving social harmony and protecting the rights of everyone,” he said. Last year, three of 10 commissioners — including Mr. Moore — had presented dissenting views.

22 April 2021||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka marks Easter bombing anniversary||Sri Lanka  on Wednesday marked the  second  anniversary of the Easter terror bombings that killed more than 250 people on April 21, 2019, amid mounting criticism from the Catholic church and political opposition over the delay in completion of the probe into the incident. On Wednesday morning, hundreds of devotees, including relatives of victims, gathered at the St. Anthony’s Church in Colombo, which was one of the sites of the serial bombings executed by suicide bombers from an IS-inspired local Islamist radial group. Most gathered at the church were attired in black, as they mourned and prayed for their loved ones. Bombs had simultaneously exploded two years ago at the St. Sebastian’s church in Negombo, 40 km north of Colombo, the Zion Church in the eastern city of Batticaloa, and three luxury hotels in Colombo, griping the country in shock a decade after its civil war. The head of Sri Lanka’s Roman Catholic Church Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said he was “deeply saddened” by the lack of progress in the investigation. “We have to stress that what is happening at the moment is an attitude of ‘don’t care’, where all factors are not properly investigated,” he said, speaking at the commemorative service at St. Anthony’s Church. More time Days before the anniversary event, however, the cardinal — who earlier called for an international investigation into the bomb attacks — told a media conference he was willing to give the government some more time as such investigations take time. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fought elections in November 2019, six months after the Easter attacks, on the plank of enhanced national security, vowing to bring perpetrators to justice. His victory brought hope to many who were outraged by the security lapses in the former Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe administration ahead of the terror attack, despite receiving prior intelligence, including from India. Making a special statement in Parliament on Wednesday, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said all those responsible for the Easter attacks would be brought to justice. His statement came a day after Opposition lawmaker Harin Fernando from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB, or United People’s Front) made serious accusations in Parliament, linking a senior intelligence official with the Easter terror network. Earlier, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader and MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake alleged that the Easter day attacks were “politically motivated”, and the “real mastermind” is yet to be identified. A Parliament Select Committee, set up under the former government, and a commission appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena, which continued its probe after regime change, submitted detailed reports on the incident. However, neither has conclusively established what or who drove the nine suicide bombers who blew up themselves, killing and injuring hundreds. Although the police have arrested some 200 people since the suicide attacks, no one has yet been charged in connection with the bombings. On the eve of the second anniversary, 16 men among them were charged for allegedly desecrating Buddha statues in December 2018, an incident that investigators consider a precursor to the Easter day attack.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-marks-easter-bombing-anniversary/article34380773.ece
22 April 2021||N’Djamena,||Slain Chad leader’s son takes over reins||Chad faced an uncertain future on Wednesday as the son of slain leader Idriss Deby Itno took power in what the opposition called a coup even as Western allies that rely on the country’s military might pleaded for stability. Deby had ruled the impoverished desert country for three decades before the Army announced his death on Tuesday from wounds suffered while leading troops in battle against rebels. The shock demise of the 68-year-old led to immediate concerns of a power vacuum in Chad, which sits at the heart of the troubled Sahel region and is key to the West’s anti-jihadist efforts. Deby’s death was announced only a day after provisional results declared him the winner of an April 11 election giving him a sixth term in office. Allies of the late leader moved swiftly to assure power remained in their hands, installing Deby’s 37-year-old son Mahamat Idriss Deby as President and head of a transitional military council while dissolving Parliament and the government. They tore up Chad’s Constitution and established a “Transition Charter” that lays out a new basic law for the country of 16 million people that spans western and central Africa. The charter issued on Wednesday proclaimed that Mr. Mahamat, a career soldier like his father who had been head of the powerful presidential guard, will “occupy the functions of the President of the republic” and also serve as head of the armed forces. The transition period is meant to last 18 months and lead to democratic elections, though it can be extended once. Chad’s main opposition parties were unconvinced, denouncing an “institutional coup d’etat” in a statement and calling on citizens “not to obey illegitimate decisions” by the military council. Beyond that, the threat remained from rebels who launched an incursion into the country’s north from Libya on the day of the April 11 election despite army claims they had been defeated. The rebel group, known as FACT, told AFP on Tuesday it would pursue its offensive after a pause for Deby’s state funeral on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/slain-chad-leaders-son-takes-over-reins/article34380761.ece
22 April 2021||WASHINGTON,||Justice department to probe Minneapolis policing||The Department of Justice is opening a sweeping investigation into policing practices in Minneapolis after a former officer was convicted in the killing of George Floyd there, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Wednesday. The decision comes a day after former officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death last May, setting off a wave of relief across the country. ‘Pattern or practice’ The new investigation is known as a “pattern or practice” — examining whether there is a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing — and will be a more sweeping probe of the entire police department and may result in major changes to policing there. It will examine the use of force by police officers, including force used during protests, and whether the department engages in discriminatory practices. It will also look into the department’s handling of misconduct allegations and its treatment of people with behavioural health issues and will assess the department’s current systems of accountability, Mr. Garland said. It’s unclear whether the years under investigation will begin when Floyd died or before. Mr. Garland said a public report would be issued, if the department finds a pattern or practice of unconstitutional policing. The department could also bring a lawsuit against the police department, which in the past have typically ended in settlement agreements or consent decrees to force changes. The Minneapolis Police Department is also being investigated by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, which is looking into the department’s policies and practices over the last decade to see if it engaged in systemic discriminatory practices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/justice-department-to-probe-minneapolis-policing/article34380776.ece
22 April 2021||Moscow,||Putin warns rivals against ‘crossing red line’ with Russia||President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday warned Russia’s foreign rivals against “crossing the red line” with Moscow, as he gave a state of the nation speech amid deep tensions with the West. Russia’s ties with the West have deteriorated to near Cold War lows, with Moscow and Western capitals at loggerheads over jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, a Russian troop build-up on Ukraine’s borders and a series of espionage scandals. Blame game “In some countries, they have started an obscene custom of blaming Russia for anything,” Mr. Putin told gathered lawmakers and regional governors in a speech broadcast on national television. “It’s some kind of sport — a new kind of sport.” Mr. Putin added that Moscow wants “good relations” with all members of the international community — even with those that it does not see eye to eye. “But if someone perceives our good intentions as weakness... let them know that Russia’s response will be asymmetric and harsh,” he said. “I hope that no one will think of crossing the red line in relation to Russia. And where it will be — we will determine that ourselves,” he added. Moscow has seen its diplomats in recent months expelled from a host of Western countries, which have imposed sanctions on Russia over allegations of cyber attacks, hacking and the poisoning of Mr. Navalny. The Kremlin last week said it was “good” that U.S. President Joe Biden was seeking dialogue with Mr. Putin by offering a summit between the two leaders, even as Washington slapped Moscow with new sanctions. It has said, however, it is still considering the offer. Meanwhile, thousands of supporters of Mr. Navalny took to the streets in Moscow and elsewhere on Wednesday to protest his detention. Police detained over 450 protesters, according to monitoring group OVD-Info.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/putin-warns-rivals-against-crossing-red-line-with-russia/article34380771.ece

The vessel has been asked to leave the Port, according to officials, as the shipping company  failed to  obtain prior clearance for “dangerous cargo”, as per Sri Lankan law.

Officials said a local shipping company, handling the vessel sailing under the flag of Antigua and Barbuda, from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to China, cited a “mechanical emergency” and sought permission from the harbour manager at the China-run Hambantota Port. However, the company did not declare that the cargo was radioactive material, a requirement under Sri Lanka’s Atomic Energy Act. The vessel was found to be carrying uranium hexafluoride, which is classified under “dangerous cargo”, according to officials. “Uranium hexachloride is nuclear material that is commonly transported from one country to another. But as per Sri Lankan law, we need any vessel carrying radioactive material to obtain prior permission before berthing at any of our ports. This vessel had not obtained that clearance,” H.L. Anil Ranjith, Director General of Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Regulatory Council, told The Hindu on Wednesday. Ordered to leave “After consulting the Ministry of Defence, we have asked the vessel to leave the Port,” he said. Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB or united people’s front) Sajith Premadasa raised the issue in Parliament on Wednesday. The Navy had “not been allowed to board the vessel to carry out an inspection”, he said, adding: “The government appears to be under pressure from a diplomatic mission.” He did not name the mission. “I am asking the government to examine this …this is a very serious matter, something that can affect the life of our community,” Mr. Premadasa said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-detects-nuclear-material-on-china-bound-vessel/article34380775.ece
22 April 2021||Islamabad,||Pak. frees 669 TLP supporters||Pakistani authorities freed nearly 669 supporters of outlawed radical Islamist group Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), hours after it agreed to end a week of violent protests following talks with the government. TLP’s leader, however, will remain behind bars with charges pending against him, the country’s Interior Minister said on Wednesday. Saad Rizvi was arrested April 12 after threatening protests if the government did not expel France’s Ambassador over the publication in France of controversial cartoons depicting Islam’s Prophet Muhammed. Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad for the first time acknowledged that eight supporters of the hard-line Islamist group were killed in violence that broke out April 12 after Mr. Rizvi’s arrest. Mr. Ahmad said five police officers were “martyred” and 800 were injured in the clashes with Mr. Rizvi’s supporters. Mr. Rizvi faces a murder charge after police officers died in the clashes with his supporters. Mr. Ahmed said Mr. Rizvi could approach the courts to seek relief.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-frees-669-tlp-supporters/article34380769.ece
22 April 2021||TOKYO,||Japan PM sends offering to controversial shrine||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday donated a religious offering to a Tokyo shrine viewed by China and both Koreas as a symbol of wartime aggression, though he avoided a visit. Mr. Suga’s offering of “masakaki” leaves at Yasukuni Shrine was his second since taking office in September. Victims of Japanese military aggression during the first half of the 20th century, especially the Koreas and China, see the shrine as a symbol of Japanese militarism because it honours convicted Second World War criminals among about 2.5 million war dead. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters that Mr. Suga’s offering at the shrine was considered “an activity as a private person” and the government was not in a position to comment on it. Mr. Suga’s predecessor, Shinzo Abe, known for revisionism concerning Japan’s wartime atrocities, visited the shrine on Wednesday. Mr. Abe stayed away from the shrine for seven years after his 2013 visit triggered outrage from China and the Koreas. However, he has regularly visited since he resigned as Prime Minister last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japan-pm-sends-offering-to-controversial-shrine/article34380768.ece

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||The last word on the state and temples||In the midst of the recent electoral campaign in Tamil Nadu, a movement to free Hindu temples from state control gained some traction. Ask the proponents of the movement who they see as the state’s successor and the answer you get is, the community of Hindus. But by that, what do they mean? Who selects the personnel that will constitute this community? Does the movement want a reversion to the status quo ante that existed before the state intervened in the management of temples? If so, what was that status quo ante ? A lack of clear answers to these questions suggests that what the programme really seeks is to plant in the state’s position powerful private interests, and in the process, reinstate some of the hierarchical divisions that might have been negated, albeit not nearly entirely, through the Constitution and its processes. Civic history and faith At an intuitive level, the idea of governments overseeing the management of religious institutions strikes one as anathema to a secular, democratic republic. But the principles on which secularism rests in India are distinct from their western antecedents. The makers of India’s Constitution were conscious of the dangers in promising an American style right to non-establishment. To them, there was little doubt that all persons must be entitled to a freedom of conscience. But that freedom, they believed, ought not to be circumscribed by extending to extreme limits the divide between the state and religion. The Constituent Assembly was especially mindful of the civic history surrounding matters of faith in India. It understood that left unattended, religion could lead to a perpetuation of historical evils. To treat religion as a subject beyond the state’s sovereign reach was to thwart the Constitution’s aim of establishing a free and egalitarian society at its very founding. The framers were also conscious that achieving these goals meant that the government had to ensure that resources vital to the commonweal were properly managed. As they saw it, it was the state’s responsibility to guarantee, for instance, that a temple dedicated for public use was, in fact, being put to such use. Caveats and provisos It was with these ends in mind that various caveats and provisos were written into Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution. The former makes the freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health. What is more, this right, the provision clarifies, will not stand in the way of the state making laws regulating any economic, financial, or other secular activity associated with religion, or in the way of the state making laws providing for social welfare and reform. Article 26, on the other hand, protects group rights. It grants to every “religious denomination” the right to establish institutions; to manage its own affairs in matters of religion; to own and acquire property; and to administer that property in accordance with law. This right too is bound by considerations of public order, morality, and health. A plain reading of these provisions shows us that a religious denomination has substantial freedom over matters concerning its faith. But this right does not override the state’s power to make laws regulating the management of properties belonging to these denominations. The state’s authority is wider still in attending to religious institutions that partake a public character. The protections of Article 25 are expressly restricted to matters within the domain of religion. Government has every authority to regulate and restrict a secular function performed by a public religious institution. It was in exercise of this power that the government of Madras enacted a Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act in 1951, which was replaced in 1959 by the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Act. As essential role of the state But this power to oversee administration of religious bodies was seen as an incident of sovereignty long before the Constitution came into force. In his 1918 treatise, The Law Relating to Hindu and Mohammedan Religious Endowments, P.R. Ganapathi Iyer points to how Hindu kings habitually employed ministries to supervise temples and charitable bodies. Indeed, the regulation of temple management was seen as an essential role of the state. The book also shows us how under Mughal administration, the governments of the time recognised that it was their duty to guarantee that all religious endowments were “applied according to the real intent and will of the grantor,” and appointed Mutawallis to manage Waqf properties. To be sure, that this was once the case does not by itself suggest that state control over religious institutions must now continue. But the circumstances that existed in the 1920s, when the government of Madras enacted its first endowment law, have not substantially changed. The provincial administration of the time introduced the law because it found that the colonial regime, in ceding regulatory authority over temples, had paved the path for a division of power in which powerful castes and communities within the Hindu fold appropriated control over religious institutions. The statutes of 1951 and 1959 which succeeded the 1927 legislation were both framed with the same objective: to ensure that Hindu public endowments were being put to use for the true purposes for which the endowments were first made. To that end, the law accords to a state-appointed commissioner a power of general superintendence over all Hindu religious endowments, and it authorises the commissioner, among other things, to appoint executive officers to temples to ensure that their funds are being properly applied. The Supreme Court of India tested the rationale for this oversight in the Shirur Mutt case (1954). In substantially upholding Tamil Nadu’s 1951 legislation — which was repealed and re-enacted in 1959 — the Court recognised that the basic framework of the law was in perfect consonance with the authority vested in the state under Articles 25 and 26. Today, with no obvious successor available, should the state surrender its regulatory authority, it will surely be acting in breach of its sovereign duties. The consequence of such action will be precisely what the Constituent Assembly strived to avoid: a reassertion of social power by dominant groups. In other religions Those calling for deregulation also point to the state’s approach to other religions. But a reading of the Waqf Act, 1995, will show us that the government also exercises substantial supervisory control over management of properties dedicated for religious purposes under Muslim law. It is possible to argue that this legislation does not go far enough, as Justice S.A. Kader, a former judge of the Madras High Court has in his book, The Law of Wakfs . Similarly, in the State of Kerala, repeated demands have been made by reformist Christian groups for the creation of state-managed committees to administer the church’s finances and properties. Perhaps a time will come for such laws. In the meantime, though, we must consider the HR&CE law on its own merits. An examination of the legislation enforced in Tamil Nadu demonstrates that the movement seeking a delinking of state and religion misprizes the law’s value. If applied properly, the regime will allow the state to act as a genuine tribune of social justice. No doubt there might be deficiencies in how the statute is applied today. For this reason, we must constantly demand transparency and hold the state responsible to the administrative standards prescribed under the law. But a call to do anything more is to risk the abandoning of the promises that underpin the Constitution.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||A recipe for vaccine inequity||With the stroke of a pen, the Central government on April 19 abdicated its responsibility to ensure equity in vaccine availability by clearly stating that free vaccination would be limited to healthcare and frontline workers and people above 45 years of age. Worse, the government has set the stage for State governments, private hospitals and the private market vying to have access to vaccines from the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech. The April 19 announcement of the roll-out of vaccines in the third phase, wherein anyone above 18 years is eligible for vaccination, comes at a time when many States have already been reporting shortages in supply, which is reflected in the dropping number of vaccine doses administered daily, the four-day Tika Utsav (vaccination festival) notwithstanding. While allowing all adults above 18 years is indeed a welcome move, the Centre’s announcement comes with several caveats. The two vaccine manufacturers will supply 50% of their vaccine doses to the Union government, while the remaining doses will be made available to State governments and private hospitals. A press release from the SII says Covishield will be available in retail and free trade after four to five months. Unlike the rest of the world, the Indian government took the first step of charging for vaccines by fixing the cost of jabs at private hospitals at up to Rs. 250 per dose. But with the April 19 announcement, the government has gone the whole hog by allowing the two companies to decide the price of vaccines. A contradictory approach Many developed countries have sealed vaccine supplies many times their total population; most countries, including the U.S., where healthcare is highly privatised, are vaccinating adults for free. Against this, India has taken a dangerous gamble in allowing companies to sell vaccines at huge profits amid a pandemic, and particularly so when the second wave is ravaging the country and daily deaths are spiralling. The government’s projected population for the year 2021 for the 18-44 years age group is 595 million. With two doses per person, this translates to 1,190 million doses. This huge population has not been included in priority groups to have access to vaccines, and it would be covered solely by State governments and the private sector. While the private sector may be able to cater to a small percentage of the population that can afford to pay a higher price per dose, the States must buy vaccines and administer them for free for a huge number of people, lest the poor are left out. Whatever policy each State government formulates to identify those eligible for free vaccines, it would need to allocate huge resources to buy the doses. A significant number of people are likely to be left out in this process. As per the Centre’s demand, on Wednesday, the SII announced the price at which vaccines will be sold to States and private hospitals. Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India,toldCNBC-TV18that Covishield will cost Rs. 400 for both Central and State governments and Rs. 600 for private hospitals. On April 6, Mr. Poonawalla went on record saying that even at the subsidised price of Rs. 150–Rs. 160 per dose, the company was not selling at the cost price but was making a profit. “I would not say we are not making any profits, but we have sacrificed what we call ‘super profits’,” he told NDTV . “Super profits are needed to further build capacity, innovate and compete with the western companies. But we don’t care for these at the moment as we want to address the needs of the nation first … and we can make profits after a few months.” However, since the Centre has already agreed to advance Rs. 3,000 crore to the SII and Rs. 1,500 crore to Bharat Biotech to ramp up manufacturing facilities, would the two vaccine manufacturers still feel the need to make a killing? Rising costs On several occasions, thelatest beingDecember 30 last year, both Oxford University and AstraZeneca promised to manufacture and distribute the vaccine “on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic”. When AstraZenecawalked backon its word with Brazil, the company said it had the right under the contract “to declare the pandemic over by July 2021” and that it could extend the agreement beyond July 2021 but only in “good faith” and if it considered that the COVID-19 pandemic was not over. In India, the SII, despite not selling the vaccine at the cost price, is making a small profit while supplying it at Rs. 150 per dose. With the price tags of Rs. 400 and Rs. 600 per dose, the company will be earning more than 2.5 to three times the profit as early as May 1, when the pandemic is nowhere close to ending and the second wave is raging in India. How much vaccine inequity will be seen in each State will depend on the policies that governments design to identify beneficiaries. Since no one is safe till at least a vast majority is protected to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, it is imperative that the Indian government ensure that companies do not become greedy while selling to State governments. Any “super profit” that a company plans to make can come from retail and free trade about four to five months later. Further, India may soon have three more vaccines, in addition to the three already approved for restricted use. The rich can then avail of the best vaccines in the open market, in line with the government’s announcement that all imported vaccines will be available only in the private market.  The second wave has amply demonstrated that unlike last year, more people in the age group of 18-40 years have been symptomatically infected, with many requiring hospitalisation. Hence, a policy that promotes vaccine inequity based on age bands is a dangerous proposition. A bigger issue is that with States required to procure 50% of vaccines directly from manufacturers, the governments will end up competing with each other and with private players. A similar situation was seen in the United States last year, when former President Donald Trump made individual States procure ventilators and Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) on their own, leading to a chaotic situation where States outbid each other and diversion of supplies from one State to another became rampant. With around 2.4 million doses being produced a day, the SII is currently manufacturing 60-65 million doses a month. According to Mr. Poonawalla, the company will be able to ramp up production only after June; capacity addition at Bharat Biotech, too, will take a few months. Hence, the current shortage is likely to continue for a few more months. Amid the sharp criticism for the shortfall, the Central government, by allowing States to procure vaccines directly from manufacturers, has deftly shifted any future blame to State governments. prasad.ravindranath@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-recipe-for-vaccine-inequity/article34380759.ece
22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Strengthening the process of choosing the police chief||Recent developments in the Mumbai Police which resulted in the removal of Param Bir Singh from the Mumbai Police Commissioner’s post focus the spotlight once again on long overdue reforms needed in the process of appointing and removing police chiefs. A crucial way in which governments exercise control over the State police is through their unregulated power to decide who the chief will be. There is no independent vetting process to assess the suitability of qualified candidates, and the government’s assessment, if it is done at all, remains opaque and is an exercise behind closed doors. While the principles of democratic accountability necessitate the police chief to remain answerable to the elected government at all times, the moot reform issue is in ensuring the right balance between conditioning the government’s legitimate role in appointing or removing the police chief with the need to safeguard the chief’s operational autonomy. Have an oversight panel Two elements are vital to reforms in this area. The first is the need to shift the responsibility of appointment and removal from the government alone to a bipartisan, independent oversight body of which the government is one part. Establishing a state-level oversight body with a specified role in the appointment and removal of police chiefs was first suggested by the National Police Commission (NPC), constituted in 1979, and much later reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of India in its judgment in 2006, in Prakash Singh . While the top court entrusted the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) with a role in shortlisting candidates from which the State government is to appoint the police chief, the Model Police Bill, 2015 (https://bit.ly/3at9U8q) places the responsibility with a multiparty State Police Board, also referred to as the State Security Commission (SSCs), instead (Section 8). Made up of government officials, the Leader of the Opposition as well as independent members from civil society, the board provides the additional safeguard of civilian oversight over the appointment process. Gaps in SSCs India, however, has made little progress in constituting truly independent bodies. While 26 States and the Union Territories (https://bit.ly/2P8nab3) have established SSCs, either through new police acts or amendments or through executive orders, not a single one adheres to the balanced composition suggested by the top court. Some do not include the Leader of the Opposition; others neither include independent members nor follow an independent selection process of the members. In essence, the commissions remain dominated by the political executive. Keeping aside the concern over non-functioning SSCs (as of 2019, information secured through the Right to Information Act (https://bit.ly/3n7D1n1) indicates that only four SSCs have held meetings since 2014), their design itself will have to be strengthened if they are to drive meaningful reforms. Moreover, in as many as 23 States (https://bit.ly/3as9aAC), governments retain the sole discretion of appointing the police chief. Assam, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Meghalaya and Mizoram are the only States where, on paper, the SSC is given the responsibility of shortlisting candidates. Whether this process is followed in practice each time remains to be verified. Need for transparency The second element critical to police reforms is instituting an independent and transparent selection and decision-making process around appointment and removal, against objective criteria. Much standard-setting work is needed on this as only basic safeguards have been defined in reform measures towards protecting the operational autonomy of the police chief. On appointments, the Court and the Model Police Act require the UPSC/SSC to shortlist candidates on the basis of length of service, service record, and range of experience and a performance appraisal of the candidates over the past 10 years. However, no further guidance has been developed on explaining these terms or specifying their elements to guide the appointments. What qualifies as a “good” range of experience? How is the integrity of a candidate measured during appraisals? What is the process required to be followed by the SSC in reviewing the suitability of candidates? Should not interviews with the candidates be considered as a requirement, for instance? Similarly, no scrutiny process has been prescribed to justify removals from tenure posts. The NPC had required State governments to seek the approval of the State Security Commission before removing the police chief before the end of term. This important check was diluted under the Prakash Singh judgment that only requires governments to consult the SSC. Most States omit even this cursory step. Broad terms such as “on administrative grounds” or “in the public interest” continue to be retained in police acts to justify the government’s power to remove the police chief. Such terms remain liable to misuse. Indeed, the Supreme Court has rightly emphasised that “prima facie satisfaction of the government” alone is not a sufficient ground to justify removal from a tenure post in government, such as that of the police chief ( T.P. Senkumar vs Union of India , 2017). The rule of law requires such decisions be for compelling reasons and based on verifiable material that can be objectively tested.  Clear and specific benchmarks need to be integrated into decision-making processes, both on appointments and removals, to prevent politically motivated adverse actions. In improving transparency of the review process, the United Kingdom provides a useful example. The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act, 2011, introduced public confirmation hearings as an additional layer of check for the appointment of the heads of their police forces known as Chief Constables (outside of London city). Enabling fairness The proposed candidates are required to participate in a hearing organised by the police and crime panel in each area(made up of representatives from local councils and co-opted independent members) where questions centre on the candidate’s ability to “recognize and understand the separation of political and operational responsibilities in relation to the post”. This constitutes a crucial step of the time-bound vetting process based on which the panel makes its recommendations on the suitability of the candidate. Importantly, these panels have the power to veto (by two-thirds majority) the proposed appointment as well. On removals too, the panels allow the police chief an opportunity to respond to the allegations on the basis of which their removal is being sought as part of the scrutiny process. Such steps can help ensure fairness in administrative decisions and need to be considered in our context as well in order to protect the political neutrality of the police. Any further delay in implementing reforms in this area will continue to demoralise the police and cripple the rule of law.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Data and a new global order||The shift of global power from the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific raises strategic questions for India. Is the world divided because of an assertive China or is the shift of power to Asia a switch to the historical norm? Is the United States defending multilateral rules or the hegemony over the rules it had set? Should India take sides or bide its time as a neutral contender to both China and the U.S.? The Industrial Revolution restructured the global manufacturing order to Asia’s disadvantage. But in the ‘Digital Data Revolution’, algorithms requiring massive amounts of data determine innovation, the nature of productivity growth, and military power. Mobile digital payment interconnections impact society and the international system, having three strategic implications. First, because of the nature and pervasiveness of digital data, military and civilian systems are symbiotic. Cybersecurity is national security, and this requires both a new military doctrine and a diplomatic framework. Second, the blurring of distinctions between domestic and foreign policy and the replacement of global rules with issue-based understanding converge with the growth of smartphone-based e-commerce, which ensures that massive amounts of data give a sustained productivity advantage to Asia. Third, data streams are now at the centre of global trade and countries’ economic and national power. India, thus, has the capacity to negotiate new rules as an equal with the U.S. and China. A renewed strategy Innovation based on data streams has contributed to China’s rise as the second-largest economy and the “near-peer” of the U.S. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander recently said the erosion of conventional deterrence capabilities was the greatest danger in the strategic competition with China. The national security strategy of the U.S. puts more emphasis on diplomacy than military power to resolve conflicts with China, acknowledging that its military allies have complex relationships with Beijing, as it seeks to work with them to close technology gaps. China’s technology weakness is the dependence on semiconductors and its powerlessness against U.S. sanctions on banks, 5G and cloud computing companies. But its Fourteenth Five Year Plan emphasises a $1.4-trillion strategy for the development of science and technology. China’s digital technology-led capitalism is moving fast to utilise the economic potential of data, pushing the recently launched e-yuan and shaking the dollar-based settlement for global trade. China has a $53-trillion mobile payments market and it is the global leader in the online transactions arena, controlling over 50% of the global market value. India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) volume is expected to cross $1 trillion by 2025. The U.S., in contrast, lags behind, with only around 30% of consumers using digital means and with the total volume of mobile payments less than $100 billion. The global strategic balance will depend on new data standards. Earlier this year, China formed a joint venture with SWIFT for cross-border payments and suggested foundational principles for interoperability between central bank digital currencies at the Bank for International Settlements. The U.S., far behind in mobile payments, is falling back on data alliances and sanctions to maintain its global position.  India’s goal is to become a $5-trillion economy by 2025.While the country is fast-tracking its digital rupee, the challenge is promoting engagement with major powers while retaining its data for innovation and competitive advantage. Fluid dynamics With Asia at the centre of the world, major powers see value in relationships with New Delhi. India fits into the U.S. frame to provide leverage. China wants India, also a digital power, to see it as a partner, not a rival. And China remains the largest trading partner of both the U.S. and India despite sanctions and border skirmishes. These fluid relationships have their own trade-offs, raising the question: whose interests do the current rules really serve? India, like China, is uncomfortable with treating Western values as universal values and with the U.S. interpretation of Freedom of Navigation rules in others’ territorial waters. New Delhi’s Indo-Pacific vision is premised on “ASEAN centrality and the common pursuit of prosperity”. The European Union recently acknowledged that the path to its future is through an enhanced influence in the Indo-Pacific, while stressing that the strategy is not “anti-China”. The U.S. position in trade, that investment creates new markets, makes it similar to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. India alone straddles both U.S. and China-led strategic groupings, providing an equity-based perspective to competing visions. It must be prepared to play a key role in moulding rules for the hyper-connected world, facing off both the U.S. and China to realise its potential of becoming the second-largest economy.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||A fresh push for green hydrogen||India will soon join 15 other countries in the hydrogen club as it prepares to launch the National Hydrogen Energy Mission (NHEM). The global target is to produce 1.45 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2023. Currently, India consumes around 5.5 million tonnes of hydrogen, primarily produced from imported fossil fuels. In 2030, according to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), green hydrogen demand could be up to 1 million tonnes in India across application in sectors such as ammonia, steel, methanol, transport and energy storage. However, several challenges in scaling up to commercial-scale operations persist. We propose five recommendations. Key steps First, decentralised hydrogen production must be promoted through open access of renewable power to an electrolyser (which splits water to form H2 and O2 using electricity). Currently, most renewable energy resources that can produce low-cost electricity are situated far from potential demand centres. If hydrogen were to be shipped, it would significantly erode the economics of it. A more viable option would be wheeling electricity directly from the solar plant. For instance, wheeling electricity from a solar plant in Kutch to a refinery in Vadodara could lower the transportation cost by 60%, compared to delivering hydrogen using trucks. However, the electricity tariffs could double when supplying open-access power across State boundaries. Therefore, operationalising open access in letter and spirit, as envisioned in the Electricity Act, 2003, must be an early focus. Second, we need mechanisms to ensure access to round-the-clock renewable power for decentralised hydrogen production. To minimise intermittency associated with renewable energy, for a given level of hydrogen production capacity, a green hydrogen facility will typically oversize the electrolyser, and store hydrogen to ensure continuous hydrogen supply. However, such a configuration would also generate significant amounts of excess electricity. Therefore, as we scale up to the target of having 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, aligning hydrogen production needs with broader electricity demand in the economy would be critical. Third, we must take steps to blend green hydrogen in existing processes, especially the industrial sector. Improving the reliability of hydrogen supply by augmenting green hydrogen with conventionally produced hydrogen will significantly improve the economics of the fuel. This will also help build a technical understanding of the processes involved in handling hydrogen on a large scale. Fourth, policymakers must facilitate investments in early-stage piloting and the research and development needed to advance the technology for use in India. The growing interest in hydrogen is triggered by the anticipated steep decline in electrolyser costs. India should not be a mere witness to this. Public funding will have to lead the way, but the private sector, too, has significant gains to be made by securing its energy future. Finally, India must learn from the experience of the National Solar Mission and focus on domestic manufacturing. Establishing an end-to-end electrolyser manufacturing facility would require measures extending beyond the existing performance-linked incentive programme. India needs to secure supplies of raw materials that are needed for this technology. Further, major institutions like the DRDO, BARC and CSIR laboratories have been developing electrolyser and fuel-cell technologies. There is a need for a manufacturing strategy that can leverage the existing strengths and mitigate threats by integrating with the global value chain. Even before it has reached any scale, green hydrogen has been anointed the flag-bearer of India’s low-carbon transition. Hydrogen may be lighter than air, but it will take some heavy lifting to get the ecosystem in place.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Open and safe||If Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the country amid the raging storm of COVID-19 cases was intended as reassurance of the government’s commitment to averting economic decline and ramping up health facilities, he provided little insight into specific measures. It should be evident from the pace of infection spread and the large number of deaths in several regions that the sensible course open to the Centre and State governments is to enable economic production and consumption while massively scaling-up the health response. Mr. Modi, who advised States to treat lockdowns as a last resort, has virtually acknowledged, with the benefit of hindsight, that last year’s measure dealt a severe blow to unorganised labour and the self-employed. The priority now is for the workforce to be vaccinated and containment measures against disease spread to be restricted to micro locations. Yet, the crucial question is that of universalising vaccinations for everyone above 18 years of age from May 1. The Centre’s latest policy has effectively opened the floodgates to an unregulated system with market-determined vaccine pricing. Rather than use monopsonist power to procure all vaccines for price-capped distribution, extending the model that has been in place since March 1, the move has led to a 266% to 400% price increase for Covishield for State governments and private hospitals, respectively. Bharat Biotech has also hinted at the need to recover its investments in Covaxin through price flexibility. Manufacturers should not be rushing to seek approvals in those regions where the profits are the highest, leaving out the poorer territories. All vaccines need a sustainable manufacturing base, but the government must ensure a good, free people’s vaccine for all. With 2,94,365 new cases and 2,011 dead on just April 20, India is waging a war against the virus that calls for strong leadership, decentralisation to allow States to take speedy action and the effective use of regulatory authority. The Prime Minister is right to identify urban workers and labour as key coverage groups for vaccination, with support from the Centre and States. Here, the Union Budget allocation of Rs. 35,000 crore for COVID-19 vaccines should be able to cover more categories this year and the outlay can be enhanced if necessary. Worldwide, governments have made COVID-19 vaccination a fully state-funded effort. The case for free market pricing for vaccines, on the ground that private enterprise is leading vaccine development, is overstated. For AstraZeneca-Covishield, the single biggest research funding component, at over £38 million, came from the British government, followed by overseas governments, universities and charities. What India needs is free universal vaccination, modelled on the polio campaign. The Centre cannot abdicate that responsibility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/open-and-safe/article34380742.ece
22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Towards racial justice||A U.S. judge found Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, guilty of murdering an unarmed African-American man, George Floyd, an incident last May that ignited a nationwide storm of protest against police brutality and a worldwide outpouring of anger at America’s racial injustice. Mr. Chauvin has been convicted of second-degree and third-degree murder, and manslaughter — all three for an encounter that lasted around nine minutes, during which he pinned Mr. Floyd’s neck to the roadside with his knee until he stopped breathing. Mr. Floyd’s final words, “I can’t breathe”, became the clarion call of a massive wave of street protests across the U.S. At the time, erstwhile President Donald Trump fanned outrage when he described the protests a result of the “radical left” and threatened to send in the National Guard. President Joe Biden, at the time a presidential race frontrunner, contrarily went to Houston to meet with Mr. Floyd’s relatives. He said at the time that he would not “fan the flames of hate”, but instead, “seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country”. A few months ahead of one of the most remarkable presidential elections in recent history, his words lent hope to many Americans that should he win, there might be a real possibility for reform in law enforcement and criminal justice that could result in less violence against racial minorities. Yet, it is clear that the road towards achieving a more perfect union is laden with pitfalls that render the task at hand formidable. Literally minutes before the verdict in the Chauvin trial, a teenage girl in Columbus, Ohio, was killed by the police. Her death comes in the wake of others felled in police encounters, including Eric Garner, Michael Brown and Tamir Rice in 2014, and Breonna Taylor in 2020, to name but a few. In most such cases, charges have been rare, and convictions rarer still. Analysis of these cases suggested that most often charges were dropped, or plea bargains and civil settlements agreed. It is only a minority of these instances of what many consider police brutality against people of colour that result in convictions at trial. Four years under Mr. Trump did little to build, across communities, bridges of the sort necessary to bring about a greater measure of empathy and nuance in policing. Now, Mr. Biden’s ambitious police reform bill, which bans chokeholds, offers qualified immunity from lawsuits for law enforcement and creates national standards for policing towards greater accountability, has cleared the House and faces a steep climb at the Senate, where analysts say it is unlikely to pass without the support of at least some Republicans. If some of these Republicans can eschew unproven allegations about Democrats seeking to “defund the police” that will be a good start.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/towards-racial-justice/article34380743.ece

West Pakistani troops combed the villages around Thakurgaon town, apprehended pro-Mujib students, officials and Awami League workers, assembled them at one place and machine-gunned them according to eyewitness accounts. At some places, West Pakistan troops sprinkled petrol on innocent people and burned them. The refugees said that the West Pakistani troops first shot dead a batch of people and then asked another batch to dig graves for those killed. After they had dug graves, they too were shot dead. The local non-Bengali Muslims, the refugees said, helped the troops in locating the liberation fighters. The troops set fire to houses in Thakurgaon town and a number of villages around.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/6000-bengali-muslims-killed/article34380753.ece
22 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Exporters fret over delay in rebate rates||Even as exporters fret over an inordinate delay in notification of the rates under a new WTO-compliant scheme for rebating taxes and duties to the export sector, they are also seeking greater clarity from the government on some grey areas in the scheme’s functioning, according to tax consultancy firm RSM Astute. ‘Very near future’ On Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan had said that the rates under the RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products) scheme, which came into effect on January 1, would be notified in the ‘very, very near future’. Exporters have been urging the government to lift the uncertainty over the benefits that would accrue to them under the scheme, as they are it finding it difficult to price fresh global orders in the absence of the crucial information especially in sectors with thin margins. “The trade and industry is hopeful that the scheme’s operation would be smooth, and concerns would be addressed in the early stages of operationalisation,” RSM Astute noted in a white paper on the scheme. “Due to COVID-19, India’s exports may require more stimulus and the exporters hope that RoDTEP would not be an impediment to their business plans,” it added. Grey areas The consultancy flagged the power given to Customs officers to suspend the scrips or refund credits or even to bar exporters from utilising these scrips especially as the grounds on which such suspensions could be done have not been spelt out. As per government statements, the refund of taxes on exports would be credited to exporters’ ledger account with the Customs department, which could be utilised to pay basic customs duty on imported goods. “Clarity would be required whether the refund could be utilised to pay other taxes on imported goods such as IGST and Social Welfare Surcharge,” the tax consultant said. Under the MEIS scheme, which RODTEP has replaced, these refund credits could be used to pay customs duty, additional customs duty (with some exceptions) as well as central excise duties. The delay in operationalising the scheme is affecting the exporters by restricting their ability to price products competitively and the uncertainty was making it harder to finalise contracts, RSM Astute pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/exporters-fret-over-delay-in-rebate-rates/article34380728.ece

She added that the PM’s address and new vaccination norms would add ‘a sense of reassurance’. “With all these steps, we should hope to see a positive change in the way the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is moving,” she said in a meeting with the FICCI national executive. “I would request the industry to watch the next few days a bit more carefully, and then assess for yourself what this quarter is going to be like,” the minister added.

22 April 2021||new delhi,||Fundraising via bonds jumped 14% in FY21||Listed firms mopped up Rs. 7.72 lakh crore through issuance of bonds on private placement basis in 2020-21, an increase of 14% from the preceding fiscal, supported by low interest rate and surplus liquidity in the system. This also marks the highest level of fund raising through such a route in a financial year. Going forward, sustainability of growth trend mainly depends on the trajectory of cost of funds and incremental liquidity in the system, Binod Modi, head-strategy, Reliance Securities, said. According to data available with markets regulator SEBI, companies listed on the BSE and NSE garnered a total of Rs. 7.72 lakh crore through issuance of bonds in the just concluded financial year, much higher than Rs. 6.75 lakh crore raised in 2019-20. However, Mr. Modi is of the view that cost of funds is unlikely to remain as low as witnessed in the last two years and therefore, any noticeable growth in fund raising through debt private placement does not look to be on the cards in FY22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fundraising-via-bonds-jumped-14-in-fy21/article34380736.ece

On March 24, it had projected growth for FY22 to be in the 11-11.2% range based on Gross Value Added (GVA) growth of 10.2%, and on April 5, a day after Maharashtra imposed restrictions, it further lowered its GDP forecast to 10.7-10.9%. “With conditions changing very swiftly it does become imperative to revisit these numbers more often to get a better sense of the future; and the picture shows a 1% dip from our forecast on March 24, 2021,” it added. Earlier this month the RBI had stuck to its FY22 GDP forecast of 10.5% despite the surge in infections.  “As tax collections too would be affected, there would be an impact on GDP growth which is now placed at 10.2%. Therefore, the loss in GDP this year due to the lockdowns would be... 0.8-1% from our earlier estimate of 11-11.2%,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/care-ratings-lowers-fy22-gdp-forecast-to-102/article34380720.ece

Similarly, imports of agriculture and allied commodities increased by 3% to Rs. 1,41,034 crore during the April-February period of 2020-21 from Rs. 1,37,014 crore in the year earlier period. Despite COVID-19, balance of trade in agriculture has favourably increased to Rs. 1,32,579.69 crore from Rs. 93,907.76 crore in the said period, the ministry said in a statement. “India has consistently maintained trade surplus in the agricultural products over the years. ...Even during the difficult time of the pandemic, India took care not to disturb the world food supply chain and continued to export,” the ministry said. During April-February of the 2020-21 fiscal, the country exported agri-commodities worth Rs. 2.74 lakh crore as against Rs. 2.31 lakh crore in the same period of the previous year.

But it was KSEB, which had topped the tough Group ‘B’ in the league phase earlier, that looked the better side for a major part of the match. The electricity board men played with purpose and appeared to have a well-planned strategy in place for Gokulam which had won all its matches in this KPL’s seventh edition. The electricity board men even took the lead early in the second half — through striker M. Viknesh, who beat the defenders with his sheer pace and the goalkeeper Satyajit Bordoloi with a nicely timed shot from the right — and held it till the 80th minute. But after substitute Nimshad Roshan struck the Gokulam equaliser with a long-ranger from the left, KSEB did not have much of an answer while the Kozhikode side grew in confidence. Alert Ganesan The teams were level 1-1 at the end of the regular period and an alert Ganesan produced the match-winner in the second minute of extra-time off a freekick. Defender Deepak, who took the kick, rattled the KSEB goalkeeper Shain Khan with a fiery shot. Shain pushed away the danger but could only watch in horror as midfielder Ganesan ran in and found the net with a nice chip shot. Gokulam Kerala’s main team won the I-League title late last month and now its reserve team boys are the kings of Kerala football.  The result (final): Gokulam Kerala FC, Koz 2 (Nimshad Roshan 80; Ganesan 92) bt KSEB, Tvm 1 (M.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Du Plessis, Deepak Chahar help CSK conquer KKR and go top||Riding on Faf du Plessis’ brilliant unbeaten 95 (60b, 9x4, 4x6) and Ruturaj Gaikwad’s 64 (42b, 6x4, 4x6), Chennai Super Kings continued its winning momentum, beating Kolkata Knight Riders by 18 runs at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Wednesday. The openers came together for a 115-run partnership to help CSK post a mammoth score of 220 for three. However, the three-time champion’s third win on the bounce did not come easy. KKR gave CSK a run for its money despite a disastrous start to its chase. Deepak Chahar ran through the top-order with four wickets in his first three overs. And when Lungi Ngidi had Rahul Tripathi caught behind, KKR was struggling at 31 for five. Andre Russell, Dinesh Karthik and Pat Cummins then came out all guns blazing, staging a brilliant counter-attack. Russell slammed a 22-ball 54 with six sixes and added 81 in just six overs with Karthik. The West Indian was brutal on Shardul Thakur, hitting him for three sixes and a four in a 24-run over. However, in the 12th over, Russell inexplicably tried to move away from a back-of-a-length delivery from Sam Curran and was bowled behind his legs. Karthik did his part with a 24-ball 40 before he was trapped leg-before off a slower one from Ngidi. Just when CSK thought it had things under control, Cummins unleashed his fury on Curran, smashing the left-armer for 30 in the 16th over, with four sixes and a four. The Australian did well to shepherd the lower-order by farming the strike and landed some lusty blows in an unbeaten 66 (34b, 4x4, 6x6). He kept his side in the game until the last over but ran out of partners. Earlier, du Plessis and Gaikwad started positively, going after Cummins and Varun Chakravarthy to put the pressure on KKR straight away. Gaikwad stroked some delightful drives through the off-side and was quick on his feet when challenged with the short ball, playing some well-executed pull shots. Du Plessis assumed charge of the innings towards its latter half, helped by cameos from Moeen Ali and M.S. Dhoni. The South African played an array of shots, be it standing tall and clearing the straight boundaries or getting down on one knee for his trademark scoop over short fine-leg. CSK hit three sixes off the 20th over bowled by Cummins, and that proved vital in the end.  I know there was a bit of pressure from outside, but inside the camp there was absolutely no doubt about what he is capable of.

22 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||‘India Open postponement is disheartening’||The postponement of the India Open, an Olympics qualifying tournament scheduled to be held in New Delhi from May 11, is disheartening and shows that the players’ interests are not taken care of, said P. Kashyap, husband of Saina Nehwal. Helpless “It is really upsetting that the Delhi event is postponed. We are helpless. “We have serious doubts whether anyone cares for the players when they take these decisions,” the 34-year-old Kashyap told The Hindu here on Wednesday. Kashyap, who also dons the role of a mentor to Saina besides pursuing his own career, said the India Open, along with Malaysian and the Singapore Opens, are the last three Olympics qualifying events and now players like Saina and Srikanth are left with only the last two events. “Our calculations were that if Saina were to make it to the quarterfinals in two of the three tournaments, her chances of making the Olympics cut were bright,” Kashyap said. “Now, it has come to two out of two. It is not going to be easy and I strongly believe no one cares about the players getting a fair chance of qualifying for the Games. “Exactly for this reason, I feel the All England Championships early this year should also have been treated as a qualifying event.” Kashyap added that Saina is nearing full fitness, despite being troubled by niggles which are taking a long time to heal. Tough phase “It has been a very tough last two years for her. Because of the pandemic, the conditions are bad. “But when IPL and tennis can go on, a way should be found out to ensure the Olympics qualifying events are held,” he said. “Now all we can do is to hope that at least the Malaysian and Singapore Opens will be held on schedule.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-open-postponement-is-disheartening/article34380895.ece
22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Sunrisers Hyderabad dismantles Punjab Kings, gets off the mark||Sunrisers Hyderabad made light work of Punjab Kings’ 121-run target, romping home by nine wickets at Chennai’s M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Wednesday for its first win of IPL-14. Positive start David Warner and Jonny Bairstow got SRH’s chase off to a positive start, racing to 50 for no loss in the six-over PowerPlay, with the latter’s two sixes off Fabian Allen and Moises Henriques the highlights. The duo blunted the PBKS attack with some good running and positive strokeplay. PBKS captain K.L. Rahul would have hoped his spinners would take control through the middle overs and up the asking rate. But the SRH openers kept the scoreboard ticking with occasional big hits while pinching ones and twos. Williamson returns Warner added 73 for the first wicket before holing out for a run-a-ball 37. That didn’t deter Bairstow, who hit an unbeaten 63 off 56 balls and in the company of Kane Williamson — who returned after an elbow niggle — saw the team home with eight balls to spare. Earlier, electing to bat, PBKS openers Rahul and Mayank Agarwal were suffocated by tight bowling. With the wicket dry and offering turn, left-arm spinner Abhishek Sharma opened the attack and would have dismissed Agarwal in his first over had Rashid Khan held on to a tough chance at deep mid-wicket. Rahul goes cheaply SRH, though, didn’t have to wait long for its first breakthrough, with Rahul hitting a short-of-a-length delivery from Bhuvneshwar Kumar straight to Kedar Jadhav — one of three changes made by SRH — at short mid-wicket. Warner gave his bowlers one-over spells in the first six except for Bhuvneshwar, who bowled three up front. Rashid made up for his earlier dropped catch immediately after the PowerPlay when he took a sharp catch at mid-wicket to get rid of Agarwal, and off the first ball of the very next over, Nicholas Pooran, batting at No. 4 for the first time this season, was run out without facing a delivery. Two balls later, Deepak Hooda would have been caught if Siddarth Kaul had been on the fine-leg boundary instead of being well inside it. Then the spinners took over, and PBKS lost its way further. Rashid trapped Chris Gayle in front with a leg-break before Hooda was given out lbw off Abhishek. The batsman reviewed the decision, but DRS upheld the umpire’s call.

The move came a day after the six Premier League clubs involved — Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur — in the project gave up on the controversial breakaway competition. Only Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona are still officially involved. The English clubs deserted amid an escalating backlash from their supporters and warnings from the government that legislation could be introduced to thwart them. AC Milan signalled it was leaving a few hours after Atletico and Inter Milan made their announcements. “The voices and the concerns of fans around the world have clearly been expressed about the Super League, and AC Milan must be sensitive to the voice of those who love this wonderful sport,” the Italian club said. Not yet abandoned Juventus followed moments later, but didn’t completely abandon plans for a future Super League. “While Juventus remains convinced of the soundness of the project’s sport, commercial and legal premises, it believes that at present there are limited chances that the project be completed in the form originally conceived,” the club said. Atletico said the decision was made after its board of directors met on Wednesday.  I said yesterday that it is admirable to admit a mistake. But they are back in the fold now and I know they have a lot to offer Aleksander Ceferin UEFA president   It goes without saying but should be said that the project put forward was never going to stand without the support of the fans.

22 April 2021||London,||Chelsea fourth despite goalless draw against Brighton||As Chelsea’s ownership climbed down from plans to join a breakaway Super League, the team climbed into the top four of the Premier League with a far-from-impressive 0-0 draw against Brighton on Tuesday. Thomas Tuchel’s side was stifled inside Stamford Bridge, barely creating a clear-cut chance against the relegation-threatened visitor. The point moved Chelsea above West Ham on goal difference and into fourth place. Schalke was finally relegated — for the first time since 1991 — from the Bundesliga after a dismal season with a 1-0 loss at relegation rival Arminia Bielefeld on Tuesday. Fabian Klos’ 50th-minute goal was enough for the home side to boost its own chances of survival. Bayern Munich capitalised on second-place Leipzig’s shock 2-1 loss at Cologne by moving 10 points clear at the top with a 2-0 win at home over Bayer Leverkusen.  The results: Premier League: Chelsea 0 drew with Brighton 0.   Serie A: Hellas Verona 1 (Salcedo Mora 72) lost to Fiorentina 2 (Vlahovic 45+2-pen, Caceres 65).   Bundesliga: Cologne 2 (Hector 46, 60) bt RB Leipzig 1 (Haidara 59); Bayern Munich 2 (Choupo Moting 7, Kimmich 13) bt Bayer Leverkusen 0; Arminia Bielefeld 1 (Klos 50) bt Schalke 0; Eintracht Frankfurt 2 (Hinteregger 37, Silva 58) bt Augsburg 0.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chelsea-fourth-despite-goalless-draw-against-brighton/article34380917.ece
22 April 2021||Coimbatore,||RVSS ties up with RaK’s Pallikkoodam||Former India footballer Raman Vijayan’s dream of setting up an exclusive high-power soccer training centre here seems to have finally taken shape as he has found the right place in RaK’s Pallikkoodam. Fully convinced with its sports facilities, the skilful striker has now struck a deal with the institution to push his School, the Raman Vijayan Sports School (RVSS), up further from the RaK’s campus. “It has always been in my mind to set up a high-power training centre in Coimbatore. “That’s because the boys from this region are physically strong, talented and wealthy as well. The city also has solid facilities which is quite important,” said Vijayan. Three-year search It has been a three-year search for him to find the right people and the place. “I was eagerly looking for someone who can help us do that and, I am glad to have found one in RaK’s Pallikkoodam,” he added. Swetha Krishnamurthy of RaK’s was also thrilled to have tied up with RVSS as its sole idea is to offer equal opportunities that balances sports and academics. The institution recently tied up with Badminton Gurukul, an initiative by Pullela Gopi Chand. “I am happy partnering RVSS, Chennai. It is an honour to tie up with a person who has the vision of empowering and enabling football in Coimbatore. “Ours is a sports-oriented school and we give equal importance to sports and academics,” said Swetha. “Vijayan, who has been a player himself, will certainly understand the needs and difficulties of a player. So, I believe he will bring about great transformation in our children,” she added. Great vision Vijayan, on the other hand, pointed out that Swetha has a great vision of supporting all sports, leave alone football. “Her contribution to sports is unbelievable and it is nice that her vision is long-term, which is important. Now that things are in place, we will start working from the grassroots level and further make it professional in the years to come,” said Vijayan. The training centre launch took place recently and Vijayan spent some time out playing and interacting with the children and their parents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rvss-ties-up-with-raks-pallikkoodam/article34380909.ece
22 April 2021||Tokyo,||Tokyo Games: decision on fans or no fans delayed until June||Japanese residents with tickets to the Tokyo Olympics may not know until weeks before the games open if they’ll be allowed to attend. Fans from abroad have already been barred, and on Wednesday organising committee president Seiko Hashimoto said a decision on venue capacity — or if there will be any fans at all, or just empty venues — may not be made until June. She had previously promised that decision for this month. Still studying “We are still studying the timing,” Hashimoto said at a news conference in Tokyo after she and CEO Toshiro Muto finished an online, closed-door briefing with the IOC executive board in Switzerland. She confirmed that June “was an option. I guess we need a little more time to make a proper judgement.” Government minister Taro Kano, who is in charge of the vaccine rollout in Japan, hinted last week that empty venues seemed likely as COVID-19 surges across Japan. Hashimoto’s backpedaling is typical of the ever-changing planning as virus cases rise in Japan with Tokyo’s postponed Olympics set to open in three months in the midst of a pandemic. Hashimoto acknowledged the low public support in Japan for going ahead with the Olympics, particularly since less than 1% of the population has been vaccinated. Polls repeatedly show 70-80% are opposed to going ahead with the games.“In local municipalities the situations are rather dire,” Hashimoto said. “And in this context, Japanese citizens and residents have worries and concerns. I know that. ... For the safety and security of the games, we must contain the spread of the virus as soon as possible." Many of the worries now center around the torch relay. A leg of the relay on Wednesday was moved off the public streets in Matsuyama City in the prefecture of Ehime. It was to take place in a city park with “no spectators or stage performances," an organising committee statement said. This followed the torch being detoured last week in Osaka — Japan’s second largest metropolitan area — and run only in a city park. Some legs of the relay will also be taken off the public streets on May 1-2 on Japan’s southern island of Okinawa. The torch relay will feature a total of 10,000 runners crisscrossing Japan until it arrives on July 23 at the opening ceremony in Tokyo. The relay began on March 25 in northeastern Japan and, though it has run with few incidents, organisers have cautioned that it may need to be rerouted as conditions change. Osaka and Tokyo were expected to come under new emergency orders this week. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has said measures needed to be taken "as soon as possible" to stem the spread. Death toll Japan has attributed more than 9,600 deaths to COVID-19, good by global standards but poor by standards in Asia. "If the coronavirus infection keeps getting worse, it's no time to be holding the Olympics," Kotaro Nagasaki, the governor of Yamanashi prefecture, said this week. Yamanashi is located southwest of Tokyo and is the home of the famous Mt. Fuji. Some Tokyo test events are also being postponed or rescheduled. Many that are going forward are being held without athletes — so-called operational events — or with only Japanese athletes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/decision-on-home-fans-delayed/article34381087.ece
22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Timings were tampered with, says Likith||India swimmer S.P. Likith has alleged that organisers at the recently held Uzbekistan Open Swimming Championships (April 13-17) tampered with race timings to suit local athletes. The competition was a Tokyo 2020 qualification event, where Srihari Nataraj came within 0.22 seconds of making the A-cut in 100m backstroke and Indian swimmers finished with a rich haul of medals. Likith, who was looking the make the B-cut for Tokyo, secured silver medals in 50m and 100m breaststroke events. In a YouTube video uploaded on Wednesday, Likith claimed that timings in the 100m freestyle heats on the opening day and the 100m butterfly heats on the final day were fudged and urged FINA, world swimming’s governing body, to look into the matter. Mark of protest On the final day of the competition, Likith had refused to dive into the pool in the 200m breaststroke event and just stood on the starting block for over two minutes. He said it was a mark of protest. “I touched the pad and stopped my own time and asked the officials if it was the new world record to show them that what they were doing was wrong,” Likith said. He even claimed that the local officials offered him a bribe so that he doesn’t go public with his grievances. But the Swimming Federation of India (SFI) said that the issues with the heats timings were corrected before the final in the respective events after Indian coaches and swimmers present at the site flagged them. Disapproval Monal Chokshi, SFI secretary also didn’t approve of Likith’s conduct on the final day of the event in Tashkent. “He didn’t approach us,” said Chokshi, about Likith airing his views in public. “On the first day, heats times were a problem and the display was not working. So, our coaches brought it to the organisers’ attention. Last day too, heats timings were wrong. But the final start lists and the results were fine. That is what our coaches told us.” “He [Likith] cannot protest the way he did. Heats timings were wrong and for even our swimmers they posted faster times! Everything was corrected,” Chokshi added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/timings-were-tampered-with/article34381376.ece

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Can RR ground RCB?||Royal Challengers Bangalore holds all the aces in its fixture against Rajasthan Royals at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Thursday. RCB is flying high with three wins in as many games, while RR has slipped to two losses in three outings. RCB has fired in all departments and looks a dominant force. The evergreen AB de Villiers underlined his class in the 38-run victory over Kolkata Knight Riders with a whirlwind unbeaten 34-ball 76. The middle-order is further solidified by Australian Glenn Maxwell, who has back-to-back fifties to his name. On the bowling front, pacers Harshal Patel and Mohammed Siraj have withstood the pressure at the death. Harshal, with nine scalps so far, has emerged as a wicket-taking match-winner. If skipper Virat Kohli — going at a sub-par tournament average of 23.67 — finds the big runs, RCB could be unstoppable. After notching up an exciting three-wicket win over Delhi Capitals, RR came undone against Chennai Super Kings on Monday. The team depends heavily on Jos Buttler and captain Sanju Samson, both of whom have all the shots in the book. Samson was magnificent in the campaign opener against Punjab Kings, nearly taking his side over the line with a 63-ball 119. The Kerala cricketer, however, has since recorded two single-digit scores. Opener Buttler made 49 against CSK, but is yet to light up the tournament. RR’s bowling is led by left-arm fast-bowler Chetan Sakariya, who has two three-wicket hauls in his maiden season. Chris Morris can contribute handsomely with bat and ball. RR will need its big-match players to step up if it hopes to halt RCB’s charge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/can-rr-ground-high-flying-rcb/article34380837.ece

The victory for Giri, the only winner of the day, was described as World champion Magnus Carlsen as a “very, very, very good game.”  Playing white, Giri used a great new idea in the opening phase and then tightened the noose around his Chinese rival who struggled with his time-management during this 38-move encounter.

Fognini was trailing World No. 147 Bernabe Zapata Miralles 6-0, 4-4 when he clashed with the official and was defaulted by the umpire for unsportsmanlike conduct. He is one of only a small number of players to have been defaulted from a match.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||The politics of Mandela||Congratulatory messages have been pouring in for Madonne Ashwin, director of Tamil political satire Mandela . “Everyone is talking about the film, which shows that it has made an impact,” says Madonne. Mandela premièred on TV earlier this month and is currently streaming on Netflix. Though Madonne was initially disappointed about his debut flick not having a theatrical release, the reception it is receiving has more than made up for it. “People who watched it on OTT have kept discussing it on social media.”  Mandela , a political satire set in a village divided by two prominent caste groups led by two brothers, holds a mirror to what plays out in Tamil Nadu during the time of elections. A hair-dresser, played by Yogi Babu, becomes a game-changer in the scheme of things in the film.“Though the premise is political, we were very particular that the storytelling should be light-hearted and yet make you ponder. I just had to look around at all the political events happening around me to spot situations for the film,” laughs Madonne, whose clever writing has won praise. Madonne, who has made seven short films till date, fleshed out one of his popular shorts titled Ward Enn 325 into Mandela . “ I wrote 20 drafts before locking the script and screenplay. When I narrated the story to Yogi Babu, he liked it as he was also looking for a change too. Mandela matched his vision.” Madonne says though filming a small-budget filmcomes with a lot of challenges,there are enough opportunities for learning. “ We had to to wrap up the film in 40 days. So, we had the storyboard of every single scene in place to ensure that the shoot went like clockwork. We shot at a village called Puliayankulam in Tirunelveli (where Pariyerum Perumal was also filmed).” The director is all praise for Yogi Babu’s performance. Talking about the film ending, Madonne says he wanted to show three things — the hair-dresser gaining self-respect, the entire village coming together for him and the voting process. “To bring all these aspects together organically was the most difficult part.” Though filmmakers like Gautam Menon and Balaji Sakthivel and actors like Sivakarthikeyan congratulated him, there’s one call he treasures the most: from acclaimed Tamil director Bharathiraja. “He was so moved by the film that he spoke to me for 15 minutes and in detail. I will value that call.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-politics-of-mandela/article34381333.ece
22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Love thy crustaceous neighbour||When we relax on our favourite Chennai beaches, we have very little idea about who we are sharing that space with. Often, the creatures scuttling by, swimming past and flying overhead are not only residents of the beach, but also its architects, having lent a hand in shaping it over the years. Our sands are teeming; but, we have to know where to look. “Lack of knowledge makes a place look barren when it is not,” says city-based naturalist M Yuvan, who is part of a six-member team that is documenting the biodiversity of this coastline and making it available for the public. Besides what qualifies as strictly Chennai limits, the team is also including “a bit of Thiruvallur, Kanchipuram and Villupuram areas, that have similar sandy beach fauna,” he adds. So far, the online guide — which can be viewed on the citizen science website iNaturalist — lists over 315 species, including mollusks, crabs and other crustaceans, jellyfish, birds, algae, mangroves and more. And they still have many to add. “We haven’t even begun listing the butterflies and insects yet. There is also a lot of local movement to be tracked, for example those between longshore and offshore organisms and creatures that can be spotted at low tide or high tide,” says Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, who is part of the team along with Yuvan, Rohith Srinivasan, Nandita Ram Satagopan, Anooja A and Aswathi Asokan. But while the team collates the final data, the real contribution comes from much larger groups of people on the ground, says Yuvan. “We are building a relationship with the fisherfolk of Urur Kuppam [Besant Nagar], Nalla Thaneer Odai Kuppam [Thiruvottiyur], Valmiki Nagar and Pattinapakkam, so that we can work together. We go and observe their bycatch, and they call us if they find something interesting as well,” says Yuvan. The team began this task in September 2020 and is still on it, says Vikas. Why? Because our shoreline populace differs from tide to tide, from season to season, from night to day. Besides winter migratory birds like the greater and lesser flamingos, there are other guest appearances to be tracked – by smaller, intriguing creatures. Stunning, jewel-blue, jellyfish-likePorpita porpita, for instance, dot the city’s shores between January and March and make for a lovely sight (from a safe distance). And then there are living, breathing, stationary beings that we often dismiss as just another structure of the beach. Says Vikas, “At high tide at Kovalam, there are a lot of rocky patches created by man-made structures, where I observe many barnacle species in action — their polyps can be seen coming out. Sometimes, the sea anemones will be alive as well.”  “It is very difficult to love something if you don’t know its name; if it is not a part of your mind and your imagination,” observes Yuvan. “That is why field guides work. And in our guide, we have also included Tamil names that the fisherfolk use for these species.”  Meet your dune binders  We are often unaware of what to be grateful for, when it comes to our basic resources like potable freshwater: something we have access to despite living by the sea.  “Sand dune ecosystems give us freshwater. Where sand dune ecosystems are destroyed — for instance in North Chennai — are the spaces where seawater can then travel underground, into our freshwater ecosystem. You take away the sand, and this is what happens,” says Yuvan. The character that build these sand dunes in the first place is the spinifex, informs Yuvan. These humble-looking coastal plants “create this hydrology by arresting sand, stabilising it and letting it build over centuries”.  Since these plants don’t look impressive, they are often dismissed as “just another random plant growing on the side. But if you live in Besant Nagar and you have freshwater to drink, you have to thank this plant,” states Yuvan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/love-thy-crustaceous-neighbour/article34381362.ece
22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||I’ll see you soon?||It’s been a year since I joined college, and I haven’t once stepped into my classroom. I haven’t run across the campus, I haven’t whiled away afternoons oversamosasat the canteen, I haven’t conspired a mass bunk in the back benches. All my classmates are in tiny boxes on a screen in my lap. Can you be friends with someone you have never met, but spent over 100 hours talking to? It is a strange idea of friendship, one that us first-year college students have been perplexed by, ever since we enrolled in 2020. A year into the COVID pandemic, this is the new college experience. What seemed like a stop-gap measure in 2020, online classes have changed the way 17- and 18-year-olds are approaching new friendships. For many teenagers, college is their first window into adult life. The homogeneity of schools gives way as they meet people from a wider variety of backgrounds. The hours and hours spent together in libraries, hostels and dive bars result in a lifetime of influential alumni networks and friendships. Could this experience be just the same on a single computer screen? I ask others in the same boat as me. A digital family In the past year, over group projects, assignments, and Zoom classes, Vedant Dugar found a close bond with his classmates from Mumbai, Gurugram and Kolkata. Often, their days would begin by waking each other up for attendance. By February 2021, they decided to fly down to Mumbai, even though their college was still shut, to finally spend some time in real life. “It didn’t feel like I was meeting them for the first time because I already knew so much about them,” says Vedant. “I didn’t expect the first year of college to be like this even in my wildest dreams. But once you find the right people — online or offline, everything works itself out,” says Ayushi Jain, an 18-year-old studying Economics at MOP Vaishnav College in Chennai. The girls in her batch, she says, cherish a close bond — surprising, as a majority of them had not met each other despite being in the same city. “Initially, it was funny knowing your new best friend lives only 15 minutes away and you still can’t meet her,” says Ayushi of her friend, Chetana Boothra, who like her, lives in T Nagar. Long calls for work eventually turned into lighter conversation and fostered deeper, meaningful relationships. But to help break the ice, they first had to move away from the stilted formality of Zoom classes. In after-school icebreaker sessions, party games like ‘2 truths and 1 lie’ helped get them more comfortable. When they did finally meet, it was at college while submitting their documents. Spotting and recognising mask-covered faces that they had only so far seen on their screens was like a game in itself, says Ayushi. She and Chetana have now started to coordinate their morning walks so they can meet each other safely. The girls hope to eventually be able to meet up as a class at least once a month — at cafes, restaurants or the beach. “It’s such a tough time but having each other’s back through it all helps,” she says.  Back in 2020, Salem-based Mithali Surana, a 1st year BBA student had zero expectations from online classes. Making friends had never been an issue for the self-proclaimed extrovert, but she adds, “I was very sceptical about how genuine virtual friends could even be.” What she did not foresee was that she would be binge-watching romcoms till 2.30 am every other night and practising Chloe Ting workouts in the day, with these very new-found friends. When Mitali came to visit her friends in Chennai for the first time, she stayed at her best friend’s house, whom she had just met, for two days. Because, she eventually discovered that as difficult as it is making friends online, the more real is the connection for it requires that much greater time and effort. Just ask the first-year students of ISDI, Mumbai. In the class of 28 people, everyone is scattered across 22 states including Gujarat, West Bengal, Delhi, Haryana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and more. That did not stop 13 of them from playing a cross-country Secret Santa last December. In a sisterhood of travelling gifts, everyone couriered their presents to another and on Christmas Eve, unwrapped them together while guessing who it was from. “Whenever it is someone’s birthday, or the end of an exam, or a festival, we party online. Everyone grabs some snacks and something to drink. We synchronise our virtual backgrounds and this one friend plays the DJ and makes us dance,” says Khushiyaa Taleda from Chennai. Cross country for you At Chennai’s Loyola college, however, the party was not virtual. Before the second surge began, and the situation seemed stable, the first year batch planned an informal fresher’s day in March 2021. Of the 26 people that made it, 15 were from Chennai. The rest flew in from Delhi and Kerala, and other parts of Tamil Nadu such as Salem, Coimbatore and Erode. Hosted at Level Up in Aminijikarai, they met the faces they had only ever seen on Zoom calls, muddling through awkward introductions. A twisted version of Bingo to crown a Mr Fresher soon warmed things up. The boys, joined by their seniors, headed over to a private villa on ECR and stayed up the entire night, talking. When they left the next day, they were unsure if they would ever meet again in person. Cut to the second wave of the pandemic, and now with Mumbai under a crippling load of positive cases, the ISDI batch can only dream of meeting their friends from other cities. They wonder out loud how they would react when they do. Dramatic gushing? Sprinting? Bear hugs? “If we meet.. No, wait not ‘if’, when we meet it’s going to be a full Bollywood kind of run and hug,” says Khushiyaa, "And I can’t wait.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/ill-see-you-soon/article34381366.ece
22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||John Stamos on ‘Big Shot’, fatherhood and Uncle Jesse’s legacy||John Stamos describes his Indian trip from seven years ago a “very special” experience. “I went to Rishikesh where the Maharishi’s (Mahesh Yogi) Ashram is. I had heard so many tales from when The Beatles met him, and my friends, The Beach Boys, told me all about their fascinating concert tour with him. But you know what, we couldn’t find the place! Still, it was an incredible trip and I loved the people there, who had great hearts and lived life to the fullest really.” Stamos is as handsome, if not more, as he was during his Full House days. “Call it good genes, I guess?” grins the 57-year-old actor, as he gets ready to talk about his latest project, the Disney+ dramedy Big Shot , which is produced by David E Kelly (the creator of Ally McBeal, Big Little Lies, Boston Legal and several other blockbuster dramas). By the looks of it, Big Shot seems like a strange call to cast Stamos as Marvyn Korn, a disgraced, disgruntled basketball coach who gets sacked by the NCAA for his anger issues, and has to take on a role at the Westbrook School for Girls where he attempts to steer the teens towards success. Moreover, the actor didn’t know the first thing about playing basketball. “I had never shot hoops earlier, and I am just not a sports person at all. I was a band geek back then...I still am,” he laughs. “So when I first got the call for a new David E Kelley show, I immediately thought I was going to play a lawyer. Maybe I had a role on Big Little Lies ? But when I heard it was about basketball, I was like oh no.” Stamos, who has also appeared in other successful shows like ER and Grandfathered , says Big Shot feels like a “show for the times” because of how much it bats for women’s equality in sports. “It reiterates that women are just as good as men, if not better. It focusses on the relationship between individuals, and shows how this character of a resentful coach lets go of his preconceived notions, and listens and learns from the teenagers he is mentoring.” The actor is also full of praise for co-actors such as Yvette Nicole Brown and Jessalyn Gilsig and calls them “super-pros”. Were they impressed that they were working with Uncle Jesse himself? “Well, they acted very cool about it in the beginning and all, but eventually, it snuck out that they were fans ( laughs ). They all came to my place once for a socially-distanced screening of a couple of episodes, and were such a hit with my three-year-old!”  The way forward Despite the sets shutting down a few times during the pandemic, Stamos is very grateful that they could go back and finish the shooting of Big Shot ’s first season. He says he hated being in quarantine though, as it meant being away from his wife and son. “Fatherhood has changed me, and watching my son become his own person — even at the age of three — is magical. There is actually a monologue my character Marvyn has in the show, where he explains why being a dad is all about sacrifice. You put aside what you want for the good of your child. You don’t get a banner or trophy for it, but if you do it right, you get a kid who is more loving, more caring, a better version of you. That rings true everyday with my kid.” What is next for him? “I have had a nice steady career, stayed under the radar and kept working constantly. There are several highlights, working with other great actors and producers, being mentored by Jack Clugman, and getting into theatre on Broadway, and so on. I was fearless then, much like the young teen actors I have worked with on Big Shot . Now? Apart from my career, I love fatherhood so much that I am looking forward to having my second child soon.”  The first episode ofBig Shotis currently streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||What the comet left behind||It never hurts to look up at the night sky. Stars explode, comets careen, cosmic miracles take place at an inconceivable scale far beyond our line of sight, and the only indication we get is the lightest of twinkles above our heads. Every once in a while, however, one of these phenomena deigns to enter our humble fields of vision. And while the Lyrids meteor shower is not the most exciting of them, it is among the first meteor showers of the year — and one of two reasons for us to keep our eyes trained towards the sky this month. The showers can be seen at their peak tonight (as well as a few days before and after), however their glow might be dimmed by the other phenomenon of the month: a supermoon on April 26. “What would have happened is that a comet would have broken up, probably centuries ago. We [the Earth] will be passing through the tail of the comet, or through what is left of it. This particular one is what we pass every year, around the third week of April,” explains Jayant Murthy, a scientist and professor at the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Astrophysics, over the phone. He adds, “The comet itself came by our solar system in the mid-1800s, and won’t be coming back for a while.” Neeraj Ladia, head of education organisation SPACE Chennai, explains further: “When the debris is left in space, it has a fixed space in the sky. Due to the Earth’s revolution it will cross the debris that lies in the path of its orbit.” The parts of debris that encounter our atmosphere begin to burn, creating the spectacle of bright, streaking meteors. Murthy adds that this particular shower does have a few bright fragments, and can be best viewed after midnight on a dark sky, ideally one not lit up by bright city lights. “It will be brightest between April 21 and 23. Look towards the Lyra constellation to spot it,” he suggests. The constellation, which the meteor shower has been named after, is considered the radiant point of the shower, explains Ladia. In simple terms, as the Earth nears this debris, that constellation is the point from where the shower appears to begin, to us. Ladia calls this radiant point a meteor shower’s “address in the sky”. Whichever constellation it seems to be coming from, he says, is what the meteor shower is named after: Lyrids for Lyra, Geminids for Gemini, Perseid for Perseus and so on. How powerful a meteor shower is, depends on a number of factors, such as how powerful the debris is, the size of each individual particle, its luminosity, and its rate per hour. The standard for measuring that last factor, says Ladia, “is zhr or zenithal hourly rate: how many meteors can one person see per hour on a clear night. It is the measure of the quality of a meteor shower.” Lyrids has a zhr of 15 to 20 on dark skies, adds Ladia: “It isn’t very good, it is considered a fairly normal zhr. Geminids [in December] on the other hand has almost 120 zhr. Perseid, which is coming in August, will have around 80 meteors per hour.” He further adds that Lyrids might be even less bright this year, because of its close proximity to the supermoon. “There is already a gibbous moon in the sky, which will only set around 1 am or 2 am each night,” he states, adding that post-1 am is the best time to make an attempt if you live close to dark skies. Clash of the titans The biggest danger of the meteor shower being drowned out by luminosity still stems from the supermoon, which also happens to be the first of its kind this year. Supermoons are generally the brightest and largest full moons of the year, and can occur two or three times a year if certain factors fall exactly into place. Shweta Kulkarni, chief executive officer of Pune-based organisation Astron, which works to spread awareness of astronomy, explains the concept of a supermoon. “The lunar orbit around the Earth is elliptical. So the moon is sometimes very close to the Earth, and sometimes moves further away during its orbit. When it is very close to us and we happen to have a full moon at the same time, we call it a supermoon.” For any satellite, the closest point of orbit to Earth is termed its perigee. According to NASA, both a new moon and a full moon can be termed a supermoon, as long as it is within 90% of perigee. So what does this mean in visual terms? According to both Kulkarni and Ladia, it is difficult to gauge the difference between a usual full moon and a supermoon unless you put their photographs side by side. “The difference in size is just about 10% to 14%, so there isn’t much to notice once it’s up in the sky,” adds Ladia, “You can tell it most drastically when the moon is still rising. Closer to the horizon, with buildings, trees or other structures for reference, it can look amazing.” Space Chennai is organising a photography contest, as well as a Facebook Live on April 26. “Anyone can join in and enjoy it,” adds Ladia. So you can keep your cameras and telephoto lenses ready, or you can just sit back and watch the sky and all its miracles, letting it provide some of the succour we so desperately need.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||The old Danish road in Bengal||It is snooker night at The Denmark Tavern. Dressed in my weekend best, I wait for the ferry to take me across the Hooghly river. As the motor vessel glides to my destination, I see my friends waving from the grand balcony of the tavern. The 10,000 square-feet property looks like a large yellow fondant cake. In its elegant new avatar, it houses a restaurant, bar, an outlet of the popular Flurys, and six cosy rooms — all run by The Park. There are wooden stairs, large green louvered windows, high ceilings and arched doorways. More Danish elements make their presence felt, right from prints in the upholstery, cane headboards and wood carved flowers to distressed white furniture and vintage chandeliers. It might be 2021, but here, in Serampore it still feels like 1786 at the tavern, started by Englishman James Parr in this area once known as Frederiksnagore (after Danish King Frederik VI). Over the centuries, the charming Denmark Tavern and a few other notable buildings — set up between 1755 and 1845, during the years of the Danish Colony in Serampore — fell into obsolescence. All that remained were crumbling vestiges of their thriving past, overrun by creepers. Fortunately, The Serampore Initiative, founded in 2008 by the National Museum of Denmark, (funded by Realdania) came up with the idea of documenting and preserving cultural heritage from the Danish period. In 2013, work started on some of these buildings; the first being St Olav’s Church. It was a mammoth effort. “For the first time in West Bengal you saw external funding coming from Denmark, and the State Tourism Department of the Government of West Bengal also chipped in,” says conservation architect Manish Chakraborti, who worked on these projects. “The church also received the UNESCO award for conservation in 2016,” says Bente Wolff, associate professor at University of Copenhagen and project director of the Serampore Initiative, adding that INTACH Kolkata Chapter was its project partner in India for the tavern and other buildings, while the Bishop of Calcutta, CNI (Church of North India) was for the church. “In the meantime, in 2009 the Government of West Bengal had decided to restore the former Danish Governor House,” says Wolff. “Fully ready now, the house is known as the Serampore Information and Culture Centre. It will house, among other things, an exhibition space that will showcase Serampore’s history and restoration,” she says, pleased with the way these projects have given the area more visibility over the last few years. The church, today, is a vision in yellow and white. From barely existing with a collapsed roof and weak columns, to now living an awe-inspiring life with its majestic spire visible from as far as Barrackpore, it has come a long way. While working on the church, a detailed paint analysis was followed. To ascertain the original colour, the team went through the different layers of paint and found that the last level of mortar on the external wall was yellow. The restored Governor House also has the same yellow paint. In 2016, after the team (comprising Danish architect Flemming Aalund and Indian architects along with Chakraborti) completed work on the church, it rolled up its sleeves and plunged neck deep into Denmark Tavern and the unspeakable quantity of debris that lay around it. Getting access was a project unto itself, laughs Chakraborti, who is delighted with the final outcome. “It has a fantastic presence. To anybody passing by it says, “I am here. Look at me!” “When the decision was taken at the highest level, to restore the whole building, we looked at a lot of documents in India and Copenhagen, Denmark. We didn’t get a plan, but we got a lot of sketches,” says Chakraborti. Aided by solid documentation and archaeological evidence — that required a lot of exploring — the team, including restoration agency Mascon Kolkata, tried to retain authentic, building walls exactly where they existed earlier. “We are true to the layout of the site,” announces Chakraborti. As an example, he mentions a spiral staircase and the controversy surrounding it. There was ambiguity about where it originally stood: At the rear, or front of the building. After a few excavations they found proof that it actually was at the rear. A portion of the original brick spiral staircase still exists right next to the new steel staircase that people use. In keeping with the old world charm, the team stuck to materials like lime, surkhi , and brick. “Earlier, all old buildings used to be limewashed as it is porous and allows breathability, unlike acrylic paint,” says Chakraborti. Whenever the team had doubts, it conducted an excavation. “The construction is based on a lot of research and evidence,” he explains. The tavern was completed in 2018. The stunning results can be credited to the 100-plus workers from Bengal who toiled on it. Thriving with life  Initially, there was talk of turning the space into a museum. “If you put so much cost into restoring a building, then why convert it into a museum? It is not a money earner,” says Chakraborti. In its third year now, the restored tavern is a popular hangout for locals as well as those coming from Kolkata and the surrounding districts. Some take a cab, some cover half the distance by local train, and then there are those who prefer the ferry. The area is fairly quiet, but by sundown, every other sound gets drowned out by the birds. As night falls, lights come alive and the river glitters like molten gold. The large verandah, overlooking a narrow street and a wide expanse of the river, is filled with the aroma of roast chicken and Danish pastry. Patrons settle down with their meals and drinks. In the distance, ferries lit in psychedelic lights float past, their passengers singing songs of Kishore Kumar, set to what sounds like orchestral background music. Trees sway, their leaves rustling melodiously, and a cool breeze frolics through the imposing façade, caressing each face and dishevelling hair. In that moment, all that matters is being alive and present in the now.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Small frames, big stories||In 1971, KCS Panicker, president of the Progressive Painters’ Association founded in 1944, led a brigade of artists from Madras to Pune to display miniature works. To everyone’s surprise, they returned empty-handed having sold all the artworks. Veteran artist P Gopinath was one among them. He recalls, “Back then, the artworks were priced from Rs. 25 to Rs. 100.” Students and unconventional patrons who wished to make inroads into art collection through accessible art, made up most of the buyers. “They used to tell us that they liked paintings and sculptures but didn’t have a big space to exhibit large artworks,” says Gopinath. Thanks to the overwhelming response, the same group then showed in Bombay and Madras in 1972, only to meet a similar interest. In 2021, after a bleak year coloured by an ongoing pandemic, the same format makes up Micro Trends 2021, a physical exhibition that shows works of 23 artists at Cholamandal Artists’ Village. Though Micro Trends was earlier shown in 2015 and 2017, this time around, it becomes the first physical exhibition that the participating artists have been in, since a year. With a rich line-up of veteran and budding artists, the display boasts of multiple narratives and many themes — the only common factor being that the works are of a smaller format (small in size, and affordable) . S Saravanan, the sitting president of the Progressive Painters’ Association says, “The price and size of an artwork is always in the way of the viewer. Nowadays, big paintings or sculptures can’t be seen in modern homes because of the lack of space. So, the small works if priced low, can reach a larger art-loving public. The accessibility can also create a genuine home for art. Art should not be considered a luxury.” Each of the artists have contributed four of their works to the display that houses paintings not more than 1 ft x 1 ft and sculptures not taller than 1 ft. Senior artists who make up the Madras Art Movement, like P Gopinath, SG Vasudev, M Senathipathi, D Venkatapathy, C Douglas, Akkitham Narayanan, PS Nandhan, Premalatha Seshadri are contributors. A miniature format is often the only way through which first-time buyers, amateur collectors and art students can get their hands on works by these giants. “Apart from canvases, works done on granite, metal relief, copper-welded sculptures... are part of the exhibition. And these are especially difficult to make in a miniature format,” says Saravanan who also strayed away from his medium of comfort (acrylic on canvas) to experiment with handmade metal relief work. Gopinath agrees. “Making smaller works is more difficult because you are constantly concentrating on the space. There is more work involved.” His semi-abstract paintings (acrylic on canvas) with emphasis on patterns and colours, asks the question, “What makes a real picture?” This untitled series was done over a few weeks. “Working and reworking goes on until one is satisfied,” he adds. S Hemalatha, a sculptor who specialises on lending contemporary tones to mythological characters and traditional temple motifs, has displayed sculptures of Ganesha, Jesus Christ and a rendition of a dancing fish. Though the past year had been financially difficult for many in Cholamandal Artists’ Village, they were able to work undisturbed for longer periods, resulting in collections that are ready to be displayed. The market however continues to be dull. Micro Trends 2021 hopes to reach out to the city, and capture imaginations through art again.  Micro Trends 2021 will be on display till April 30 from 9.30 am to 6.30 pm, including Sundays. There will be thermal screenings and sanitising stations at the gallery. Viewers will be allowed entry in a staggered manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/small-frames-big-stories/article34381356.ece
22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||A bauhinia-n rhapsody||It all started with the bauhinia leaves. Ten years ago, Sunder Ram and Sriram Ramesh, 30-year-old twin brothers with cerebral palsy, a congenital neurological impairment, discovered a business idea in the mantharai plant. Dried, stitched by hand, and moulded by a machine, these leaves could be used as cups, saucers, plates, bowls and tumblers. Not only would they smell good, but they would also be eco-friendly. And most important of all, the business would help the twins become self reliant. In January 2021, Sunder and Sriram realised their dream by opening a gift shop of products made by people with disabilities, under the brand name, Twin Twigs, in Navallur. “We sell our leaf plates, along with wooden, cane and terracotta products, crockery, marble paintings, and cloth bags,” says Sunder, who is the point person at the shop. Sriram, on the other hand, is more interested in the manufacturing aspect of things; they have a unit to mould plates, attached to their home. Before the pandemic, they had up to 10 people at the factory employed under them. They are partnered by their friend, K Karthikeyan, who also helps them with their special needs. Their mother Radha Ramesh explains further, “Sunder is the one who likes dealing with people and taking orders, as his interpersonal skills are more developed. Sriram is more routine oriented, so he supervises the manufacturing.” Radha has been instrumental in setting up the business. When her children were toddlers, Radha went to Vidya Sagar (formerly The Spastics Society of India) in Kotturpuram to become a special educator. “I did not want to be dependent on anyone to understand them,” she says. Soon, she became a teacher there, and is now the Director at Vidya Sagar. Sunder and Sriram too, were given ‘life skills training’ there. No formal schooling meant they can not read or write, but that does not stop them from their chosen career as entrepreneurs. “They use apps that incorporate assistive technology to suit their needs. Instead of letters, data can be input pictorially, and the app does the calculation,” says Radha. At the shop, the footfall is the highest during the weekends. “With Twin Twigs, they wanted to create a platform for the products made by people with disabilities,” says Radha, translating for Sriram. The products on sale here are procured from all parts of India, including organisations for people with disabilities such as Vidya Sagar in Chennai, Umang School in Jaipur and Koshish in Delhi. Radha’s contacts at Vidya Sagar came in handy while building this network. Despite the setback of the pandemic, Sriram and Sunder are persevering. “We want to expand this unit so that it provides more employment opportunities to disabled as well as non-disabled people. This is just the start,” they say.  Twin Twigs is at D5, OMR Bazaar Street, Navallur.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Spotting the elusive big cat||Hyderabad-based wildlife photographer Ismail Shariff was enroute to Ladakh on work when he decided to take a break at Dras, in Kargil, in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Himalayan brown bear. Ismail and his team knew they were in luck when they learnt that a brown bear had strayed into a nearby village for food; he whipped out his camera and captured them at leisure. While Ismail’s photos of the brown bear show the mammal in all its glory, something unexpected happened when he posted the shots on various wildlife photos websites — his photos of a snow leopard in 2017 resurfaced started trending, receiving over 12K shares and 58K likes. “The snow leopard has been my muse ever since I first saw its photograph in 2012 taken by Dhritiman Mukherjee, the baap of Indian Wildlife photography,” he says. Ismail started photographing snow leopards in 2014; this particular photograph that has gone viral shows the animal camouflaged in the rocky Himalayan terrain. Ismail is a regular to Spiti Valley; every year he visits to photograph snow leopards. The last time he went was in February 2020, just before the nation went into lockdown. “Unfortunately, my hard disk crashed and the only image that I could salvage was that of the snow leopard drinking water.” A snow leopard expedition conductor for bespoke tour operator Voygr in India and Central Asia, Ismail says that it is an extremely shy animal. “One needs trained eyes to spot it in the snow,” he adds. Snow leopards are smaller in size to regular leopards found in the wild, but they appear bigger due to their thick fur. “The thickness of their fur in the stomach can be upto 12 inches, and the tail is as long as its body. The snow leopard uses its bushy tail as a muffler to wrap around when sleeping curled up,” he notes. It took him several visits to track the animal’s movement in the snow. “The photograph resurfacing shows that there are a lot of people who are learning about Indian wildlife.” The comments on his viral photo made him wonder if conducting online sessions may help add more awareness on the elusive big cat. “I will conduct sessions for another week,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/spotting-the-elusive-big-cat/article34381365.ece

The museum opened its doors to the public in August 2017 after more than a year of planning and development of what would be the world’s first museum and memorial on the Partition. It comprises 14 galleries, all housing audio-visual records, artworks of various mediums (photographs to paintings), as well as numerous refugee artefacts. During the pandemic, the museum adapted to social distancing by making tours virtual and hosting online film screenings, talks and exhibitions. The museum also teamed up with Google Arts & Culture for virtual interactive showcases like The Railways and Partition. It also collaborated with the District Education Department for an educational programme with audio-visual files to facilitate a virtual tour for schoolchildren. There will be a second museum on the Partition at the Dara Shikoh Library Building, Old Delhi, which will be ready by August 15, in time for India@75. The adaptive reuse of this historic building has been possible through the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India, and the Art, Culture and Language Department, Government of Delhi. Thrilled at the win, Lady Kishwar Desai, Chair of the Arts and Culture Heritage Trust, speaks of the future of museum tourism amid a difficult year. “What we are experiencing now is a temporary phenomena, perhaps disrupting travel for a year or two which is nothing in the history of civilisation.

In a statement, Ajay Devgn said, “My attempt has always been to tell unique stories and work with good talent. The idea is to raise the bar of entertainment in India. The digital world excites me. Playing a cop on screen is not new to me, but this time the character is more intense, complex and dark. What drew me most to his persona, is that he is possibly the greyest character you may come across in recent times.” Rudra , produced by Applause Entertainment in association with BBC Studios India, will be out later this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/ajay-devgn-plays-a-cop-in-digital-debut/article34381339.ece
22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||I’ll see you soon?||It’s been a year since I joined college, and I haven’t once stepped into my classroom. I haven’t run across the campus, I haven’t whiled away afternoons oversamosasat the canteen, I haven’t conspired a mass bunk in the back benches. All my classmates are in tiny boxes on a screen in my lap. Can you be friends with someone you have never met, but spent over 100 hours talking to? It is a strange idea of friendship, one that us first-year college students have been perplexed by, ever since we enrolled in 2020. A year into the COVID pandemic, this is the new college experience. What seemed like a stop-gap measure in 2020, online classes have changed the way 17- and 18-year-olds are approaching new friendships. For many teenagers, college is their first window into adult life. The homogeneity of schools gives way as they meet people from a wider variety of backgrounds. The hours and hours spent together in libraries, hostels and dive bars result in a lifetime of influential alumni networks and friendships. Could this experience be just the same on a single computer screen? I ask others in the same boat as me. A digital family In the past year, over group projects, assignments, and Zoom classes, Vedant Dugar found a close bond with his classmates from Mumbai, Gurugram and Kolkata. Often, their days would begin by waking each other up for attendance. By February 2021, they decided to fly down to Mumbai, even though their college was still shut, to finally spend some time in real life. “It didn’t feel like I was meeting them for the first time because I already knew so much about them,” says Vedant. “I didn’t expect the first year of college to be like this even in my wildest dreams. But once you find the right people — online or offline, everything works itself out,” says Ayushi Jain, an 18-year-old studying Economics at MOP Vaishnav College in Chennai. The girls in her batch, she says, cherish a close bond — surprising, as a majority of them had not met each other despite being in the same city. “Initially, it was funny knowing your new best friend lives only 15 minutes away and you still can’t meet her,” says Ayushi of her friend, Chetana Boothra, who like her, lives in T Nagar. Long calls for work eventually turned into lighter conversation and fostered deeper, meaningful relationships. But to help break the ice, they first had to move away from the stilted formality of Zoom classes. In after-school icebreaker sessions, party games like ‘2 truths and 1 lie’ helped get them more comfortable. When they did finally meet, it was at college while submitting their documents. Spotting and recognising mask-covered faces that they had only so far seen on their screens was like a game in itself, says Ayushi. She and Chetana have now started to coordinate their morning walks so they can meet each other safely. The girls hope to eventually be able to meet up as a class at least once a month — at cafes, restaurants or the beach. “It’s such a tough time but having each other’s back through it all helps,” she says.  Back in 2020, Salem-based Mithali Surana, a 1st year BBA student had zero expectations from online classes. Making friends had never been an issue for the self-proclaimed extrovert, but she adds, “I was very sceptical about how genuine virtual friends could even be.” What she did not foresee was that she would be binge-watching romcoms till 2.30 am every other night and practising Chloe Ting workouts in the day, with these very new-found friends. When Mitali came to visit her friends in Chennai for the first time, she stayed at her best friend’s house, whom she had just met, for two days. Because, she eventually discovered that as difficult as it is making friends online, the more real is the connection for it requires that much greater time and effort. Just ask the first-year students of ISDI, Mumbai. In the class of 28 people, everyone is scattered across 22 states including Gujarat, West Bengal, Delhi, Haryana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and more. That did not stop 13 of them from playing a cross-country Secret Santa last December. In a sisterhood of travelling gifts, everyone couriered their presents to another and on Christmas Eve, unwrapped them together while guessing who it was from. “Whenever it is someone’s birthday, or the end of an exam, or a festival, we party online. Everyone grabs some snacks and something to drink. We synchronise our virtual backgrounds and this one friend plays the DJ and makes us dance,” says Khushiyaa Taleda from Chennai. Cross country for you At Chennai’s Loyola college, however, the party was not virtual. Before the second surge began, and the situation seemed stable, the first year batch planned an informal fresher’s day in March 2021. Of the 26 people that made it, 15 were from Chennai. The rest flew in from Delhi and Kerala, and other parts of Tamil Nadu such as Salem, Coimbatore and Erode. Hosted at Level Up in Aminijikarai, they met the faces they had only ever seen on Zoom calls, muddling through awkward introductions. A twisted version of Bingo to crown a Mr Fresher soon warmed things up. The boys, joined by their seniors, headed over to a private villa on ECR and stayed up the entire night, talking. When they left the next day, they were unsure if they would ever meet again in person. Cut to the second wave of the pandemic, and now with Mumbai under a crippling load of positive cases, the ISDI batch can only dream of meeting their friends from other cities. They wonder out loud how they would react when they do. Dramatic gushing? Sprinting? Bear hugs? “If we meet.. No, wait not ‘if’, when we meet it’s going to be a full Bollywood kind of run and hug,” says Khushiyaa, "And I can’t wait.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/ill-see-you-soon/article34380890.ece

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||What the comet left behind||It never hurts to look up at the night sky. Stars explode, comets careen, cosmic miracles take place at an inconceivable scale far beyond our line of sight, and the only indication we get is the lightest of twinkles above our heads. Every once in a while, however, one of these phenomena deigns to enter our humble fields of vision. And while the Lyrids meteor shower is not the most exciting of them, it is among the first meteor showers of the year — and one of two reasons for us to keep our eyes trained towards the sky this month. The showers can be seen at their peak tonight (as well as a few days before and after), however their glow might be dimmed by the other phenomenon of the month: a supermoon on April 26. “What would have happened is that a comet would have broken up, probably centuries ago. We [the Earth] will be passing through the tail of the comet, or through what is left of it. This particular one is what we pass every year, around the third week of April,” explains Jayant Murthy, a scientist and professor at the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Astrophysics, over the phone. He adds, “The comet itself came by our solar system in the mid-1800s, and won’t be coming back for a while.” Neeraj Ladia, head of education organisation SPACE Chennai, explains further: “When the debris is left in space, it has a fixed space in the sky. Due to the Earth’s revolution it will cross the debris that lies in the path of its orbit.” The parts of debris that encounter our atmosphere begin to burn, creating the spectacle of bright, streaking meteors. Murthy adds that this particular shower does have a few bright fragments, and can be best viewed after midnight on a dark sky, ideally one not lit up by bright city lights. “It will be brightest between April 21 and 23. Look towards the Lyra constellation to spot it,” he suggests. The constellation, which the meteor shower has been named after, is considered the radiant point of the shower, explains Ladia. In simple terms, as the Earth nears this debris, that constellation is the point from where the shower appears to begin, to us. Ladia calls this radiant point a meteor shower’s “address in the sky”. Whichever constellation it seems to be coming from, he says, is what the meteor shower is named after: Lyrids for Lyra, Geminids for Gemini, Perseid for Perseus and so on. How powerful a meteor shower is, depends on a number of factors, such as how powerful the debris is, the size of each individual particle, its luminosity, and its rate per hour. The standard for measuring that last factor, says Ladia, “is zhr or zenithal hourly rate: how many meteors can one person see per hour on a clear night. It is the measure of the quality of a meteor shower.” Lyrids has a zhr of 15 to 20 on dark skies, adds Ladia: “It isn’t very good, it is considered a fairly normal zhr. Geminids [in December] on the other hand has almost 120 zhr. Perseid, which is coming in August, will have around 80 meteors per hour.” He further adds that Lyrids might be even less bright this year, because of its close proximity to the supermoon. “There is already a gibbous moon in the sky, which will only set around 1 am or 2 am each night,” he states, adding that post-1 am is the best time to make an attempt if you live close to dark skies. Clash of the titans The biggest danger of the meteor shower being drowned out by luminosity still stems from the supermoon, which also happens to be the first of its kind this year. Supermoons are generally the brightest and largest full moons of the year, and can occur two or three times a year if certain factors fall exactly into place. Shweta Kulkarni, chief executive officer of Pune-based organisation Astron, which works to spread awareness of astronomy, explains the concept of a supermoon. “The lunar orbit around the Earth is elliptical. So the moon is sometimes very close to the Earth, and sometimes moves further away during its orbit. When it is very close to us and we happen to have a full moon at the same time, we call it a supermoon.” For any satellite, the closest point of orbit to Earth is termed its perigee. According to NASA, both a new moon and a full moon can be termed a supermoon, as long as it is within 90% of perigee. So what does this mean in visual terms? According to both Kulkarni and Ladia, it is difficult to gauge the difference between a usual full moon and a supermoon unless you put their photographs side by side. “The difference in size is just about 10% to 14%, so there isn’t much to notice once it’s up in the sky,” adds Ladia, “You can tell it most drastically when the moon is still rising. Closer to the horizon, with buildings, trees or other structures for reference, it can look amazing.” Space Chennai is organising a photography contest, as well as a Facebook Live on April 26. “Anyone can join in and enjoy it,” adds Ladia. So you can keep your cameras and telephoto lenses ready, or you can just sit back and watch the sky and all its miracles, letting it provide some of the succour we so desperately need.

22 April 2021||April 22 2021 00:00 IST,||The old Danish road in Bengal||It is snooker night at The Denmark Tavern. Dressed in my weekend best, I wait for the ferry to take me across the Hooghly river. As the motor vessel glides to my destination, I see my friends waving from the grand balcony of the tavern. The 10,000 square-feet property looks like a large yellow fondant cake. In its elegant new avatar, it houses a restaurant, bar, an outlet of the popular Flurys, and six cosy rooms — all run by The Park. There are wooden stairs, large green louvered windows, high ceilings and arched doorways. More Danish elements make their presence felt, right from prints in the upholstery, cane headboards and wood carved flowers to distressed white furniture and vintage chandeliers. It might be 2021, but here, in Serampore it still feels like 1786 at the tavern, started by Englishman James Parr in this area once known as Frederiksnagore (after Danish King Frederik VI). Over the centuries, the charming Denmark Tavern and a few other notable buildings — set up between 1755 and 1845, during the years of the Danish Colony in Serampore — fell into obsolescence. All that remained were crumbling vestiges of their thriving past, overrun by creepers. Fortunately, The Serampore Initiative, founded in 2008 by the National Museum of Denmark, (funded by Realdania) came up with the idea of documenting and preserving cultural heritage from the Danish period. In 2013, work started on some of these buildings; the first being St Olav’s Church. It was a mammoth effort. “For the first time in West Bengal you saw external funding coming from Denmark, and the State Tourism Department of the Government of West Bengal also chipped in,” says conservation architect Manish Chakraborti, who worked on these projects. “The church also received the UNESCO award for conservation in 2016,” says Bente Wolff, associate professor at University of Copenhagen and project director of the Serampore Initiative, adding that INTACH Kolkata Chapter was its project partner in India for the tavern and other buildings, while the Bishop of Calcutta, CNI (Church of North India) was for the church. “In the meantime, in 2009 the Government of West Bengal had decided to restore the former Danish Governor House,” says Wolff. “Fully ready now, the house is known as the Serampore Information and Culture Centre. It will house, among other things, an exhibition space that will showcase Serampore’s history and restoration,” she says, pleased with the way these projects have given the area more visibility over the last few years. The church, today, is a vision in yellow and white. From barely existing with a collapsed roof and weak columns, to now living an awe-inspiring life with its majestic spire visible from as far as Barrackpore, it has come a long way. While working on the church, a detailed paint analysis was followed. To ascertain the original colour, the team went through the different layers of paint and found that the last level of mortar on the external wall was yellow. The restored Governor House also has the same yellow paint. In 2016, after the team (comprising Danish architect Flemming Aalund and Indian architects along with Chakraborti) completed work on the church, it rolled up its sleeves and plunged neck deep into Denmark Tavern and the unspeakable quantity of debris that lay around it. Getting access was a project unto itself, laughs Chakraborti, who is delighted with the final outcome. “It has a fantastic presence. To anybody passing by it says, “I am here. Look at me!” “When the decision was taken at the highest level, to restore the whole building, we looked at a lot of documents in India and Copenhagen, Denmark. We didn’t get a plan, but we got a lot of sketches,” says Chakraborti. Aided by solid documentation and archaeological evidence — that required a lot of exploring — the team, including restoration agency Mascon Kolkata, tried to retain authentic, building walls exactly where they existed earlier. “We are true to the layout of the site,” announces Chakraborti. As an example, he mentions a spiral staircase and the controversy surrounding it. There was ambiguity about where it originally stood: At the rear, or front of the building. After a few excavations they found proof that it actually was at the rear. A portion of the original brick spiral staircase still exists right next to the new steel staircase that people use. In keeping with the old world charm, the team stuck to materials like lime, surkhi , and brick. “Earlier, all old buildings used to be limewashed as it is porous and allows breathability, unlike acrylic paint,” says Chakraborti. Whenever the team had doubts, it conducted an excavation. “The construction is based on a lot of research and evidence,” he explains. The tavern was completed in 2018. The stunning results can be credited to the 100-plus workers from Bengal who toiled on it. Thriving with life  Initially, there was talk of turning the space into a museum. “If you put so much cost into restoring a building, then why convert it into a museum? It is not a money earner,” says Chakraborti. In its third year now, the restored tavern is a popular hangout for locals as well as those coming from Kolkata and the surrounding districts. Some take a cab, some cover half the distance by local train, and then there are those who prefer the ferry. The area is fairly quiet, but by sundown, every other sound gets drowned out by the birds. As night falls, lights come alive and the river glitters like molten gold. The large verandah, overlooking a narrow street and a wide expanse of the river, is filled with the aroma of roast chicken and Danish pastry. Patrons settle down with their meals and drinks. In the distance, ferries lit in psychedelic lights float past, their passengers singing songs of Kishore Kumar, set to what sounds like orchestral background music. Trees sway, their leaves rustling melodiously, and a cool breeze frolics through the imposing façade, caressing each face and dishevelling hair. In that moment, all that matters is being alive and present in the now.

Still, it was an incredible trip and I loved the people there, who had great hearts and lived life to the fullest really.” Stamos is as handsome, if not more, as he was during his Full House days. “Call it good genes, I guess?” grins the 57-year-old actor, as he gets ready to talk about his latest project, the Disney+ dramedy Big Shot , which is produced by David E Kelly (the creator of Ally McBeal, Big Little Lies, Boston Legal and several other blockbuster dramas). By the looks of it, Big Shot seems like a strange call to cast Stamos as Marvyn Korn, a disgraced, disgruntled basketball coach who gets sacked by the NCAA for his anger issues, and has to take on a role at the Westbrook School for Girls where he attempts to steer the teens towards success. Moreover, the actor didn’t know the first thing about playing basketball. “I had never shot hoops earlier, and I am just not a sports person at all. I was a band geek back then...I still am,” he laughs. “So when I first got the call for a new David E Kelley show, I immediately thought I was going to play a lawyer. Maybe I had a role on Big Little Lies ? But when I heard it was about basketball, I was like oh no.” Stamos, who has also appeared in other successful shows like ER and Grandfathered , says Big Shot feels like a “show for the times” because of how much it bats for women’s equality in sports. “It reiterates that women are just as good as men, if not better. It focusses on the relationship between individuals, and shows how this character of a resentful coach lets go of his preconceived notions, and listens and learns from the teenagers he is mentoring.” The actor is also full of praise for co-actors such as Yvette Nicole Brown and Jessalyn Gilsig and calls them “super-pros”. Were they impressed that they were working with Uncle Jesse himself? “Well, they acted very cool about it in the beginning and all, but eventually, it snuck out that they were fans ( laughs ). They all came to my place once for a socially-distanced screening of a couple of episodes, and were such a hit with my three-year-old!”  The way forward Despite the sets shutting down a few times during the pandemic, Stamos is very grateful that they could go back and finish the shooting of Big Shot ’s first season. He says he hated being in quarantine though, as it meant being away from his wife and son. “Fatherhood has changed me, and watching my son become his own person — even at the age of three — is magical. There is actually a monologue my character Marvyn has in the show, where he explains why being a dad is all about sacrifice. You put aside what you want for the good of your child. You don’t get a banner or trophy for it, but if you do it right, you get a kid who is more loving, more caring, a better version of you. That rings true everyday with my kid.” What is next for him? “I have had a nice steady career, stayed under the radar and kept working constantly. There are several highlights, working with other great actors and producers, being mentored by Jack Clugman, and getting into theatre on Broadway, and so on. I was fearless then, much like the young teen actors I have worked with on Big Shot . Now? Apart from my career, I love fatherhood so much that I am looking forward to having my second child soon.”  The first episode ofBig Shotis currently streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.

22 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||RWAs face hurdles as they plan to set up COVID care facilities||The concept to set up small COVID care facility in residential areas was a novel initiative, but practical difficulties have made life difficult for Resident Welfare Associations in the Capital. Several RWAs are thus facing hurdles in establishing these centres in residential areas as per the guidelines. Nothing has vexed them as procuring oxygen cylinders, a shortage the whole country is reeling under. Saurabh Gandhi, Rana Pratap Bagh RWA president and member of United Residents of Delhi (URD), said they possess four oxygen cylinders of 10 litres each while another one was to reach them. But that is proving to be inadequate. “We are getting calls for oxygen cylinders every few minutes. All our cylinders are currently with residents. We are also helping people with contacts to buy oxygen cylinders, whoever can afford them. But it’s been extremely tough,” he said. This RWA has been able to help 11 persons with oxygen in the last few days. “Oxygen, in these times, is being prioritised to those that desperately need it and can’t find a hospital bed,” he added. Facilitating oxygen Rajiv Kakria (62), member of an RWA in Greater Kailash, said they possess just two oxygen concentrators and a cylinder and hence, facing acute shortage. “We [RWAs] are possibly doing more than what the government is. Four days ago, a person needed to be admitted to a hospital because his oxygen levels dropped. We provided him with oxygen concentrator. Unfortunately, he died Wednesday morning,” he said. B.S. Vohra, a resident of Krishna Nagar and president of East Delhi RWA Joint Front Federation, said while they don’t have oxygen cylinders in their possession, they are trying their best to facilitate oxygen. “We are helping people in need with information and making calls for them. The situation, however, is terrible,” he said. Their woes don’t end there. Mr. Kakria said they could not get the builder to agree to lend building space to set up the COVID care centre. “There is stigma. The builder says he won’t be able to sell any flat for the next one year,” he said, adding that doctors were exhausted and no one was willing to consult. Mr. Gandhi said they have a community hall in their area which they could have turned into a COVID care facility and they had also spoken to doctors who were willing to consult but they couldn’t find nursing staff. “The cost of one nursing staff is about Rs. 25,000 a month but either they are not available or they are demanding Rs. 80,000 for a month. It is not affordable,” he said. Managing perils He also said that given the situation, they wouldn’t be able to manage the facility because people need oxygen, which they are hard-pressed to provide. “For refilling an oxygen cylinder, one has to wait for two hours in the queue. Earlier, the price of refilling was Rs. 50-Rs. 100 and now it has crossed Rs. 400,” he said. Talking about house helps being allowed in colonies, members said that unlike last lockdown, this time, house helps are allowed in most of the localities. It’s down to individual residents whether to hire them or not. “We have told everyone that if they decide not to call them, they have to pay their salaries,” Mr. Vohra said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rwas-face-hurdles-as-they-plan-to-set-up-covid-care-facilities/article34381071.ece
22 April 2021||New Delhi,||Hospitals should have oxygen stock for at least 48 hrs: doctors||Doctors of several hospitals in Delhi said that ideally there should be a buffer stock of oxygen for at least 48 hours. But since the record surge in COVID-19 cases for the past two weeks, they have less stock and they are refilling almost on a daily basis, doctors said. Meanwhile, a Delhi government spokesperson said that currently almost all hospitals have less than 12 hours of oxygen. The State does not have its own source of oxygen and supply comes mainly from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia appealed to the Central government to increase Delhi’s oxygen quota from 378 metric ton to 700 metric ton. “It is a fact that supplying oxygen to people is a collaborative effort of Central and State governments. The way the Central government has supported us in the last year in terms of COVID-19, we hope that they support us in the same stride, in our demand to increase oxygen supply in Delhi. Central government should ensure States do not capture oxygen and stop supply to other States that need oxygen,” Mr. Sisodia said. He said that State governments do not decide which State will receive how much oxygen. “Even if a State has an oxygen plant, it does not mean it will decide who will get how much oxygen. Only the Central government decides that. Today, the cases are increasing in Delhi so we are requesting for more oxygen, tomorrow if any other State feels a similar need, they will put out their request forward,” he said. Less for Haryana Meanwhile, Haryana Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan told The Hindu that Haryana’s share of liquid oxygen was unilaterally reduced by the Union government from 118 MT to just 80 MT and Rajasthan too had arbitrarily stopped supply to the Post-graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak. “The hospitals in Gurugram have a large number of patients spilled over from Delhi and even outside the country. We are managing with 70-80 MT now, but it can soon go up to 100 MT in a couple of days. It will then be difficult to manage,” said Mr. Vardhan. He said that he had made a request to Home Secretary for a videoconference meeting with the Chief Secretaries of 5-6 affected States and find a solution to it. “This problem is going to crop up every day. One possible solution could be to airlift liquid oxygen from North-eastern States where it is in abundance. It could be expensive proposition, but can be the only solution,” said Mr. Vardhan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hospitals-should-have-oxygen-stock-for-at-least-48-hrs-doctors/article34381448.ece

22 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Private schools told to discontinue online classes during vacation||After several private schools continued online classes despite Directorate of Education’s (DoE) order declaring summer holidays from April 20, the DoE on Wednesday issued a circular saying that all online and semi-online teaching and learning activities shall remain suspended during the summer vacation from April 20 to June 9. “lt has been brought to the notice of this directorate that despite the summer vacation, which has been advanced due to surge in COVID-19 cases, the regular online learning method continues to be adopted in one way or the other by some private schools. The online classes are being used as a substitute of physical classroom learning without any break,” the DoE said in its circular. “Keeping in mind the prevailing situation due to the virus and in the overall interest of all stakeholders of the management of private schools, it is expedient that direction issued in respect of government schools regarding suspension of online classes is extended for private schools too,” it added. In letter and spirit The DoE stressed on the significance of summer vacation, saying that it plays an important role in the academic cycle, both for students and their teachers. In the present circumstances it is all the more important that the intent of summer vacation is realised in letter and spirit. “Having been in this online mode for more than a year continuously, they need a much deserved break from the routine online teaching activities,” the circular said. It added that a vacation provides an opportunity for students and teachers to relax, learn skills, read books and pursue hobbies, which could rejuvenate them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/private-schools-told-to-discontinue-online-classes-during-vacation/article34381074.ece

22 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||NGT seeks petitioner’s reply on his plea for relief from DPCC order||Following an appeal against a Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) order imposing a fine of Rs. 5 lakh on a shop owner for carrying out industrial activities in a residential area, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has sought the petitioner’s reply and also directed him to deposit 50% of the fine amount till the matter is resolved. Taking note of submissions made by the appellant, a Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said: “It is seen that the residential premise was being admittedly used as godown for storing manufactured items in the factory operated in non-conforming area in the adjoining premises. It is not explained whether the manufacturing process was legally permissible and non-polluting.” “Thus, while it is difficult to accept that the appellant is not at all liable when the premises have been admittedly sealed for illegal user, at the same time in the impugned order, there is no specific consideration of stand of the appellant,” the Bench said. Stating that the appellant either failed to provide a reply or it was not satisfactory, the NGT Bench directed, “We direct that the appellant may deposit 50% of the assessed amount within one month upon which recovery of the remaining amount will remain suspended till the stand of the appellant is duly considered by a speaking order by the DPCC.” The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by petitioner Madan Singh who stated that on receiving a recovery notice he had informed the Delhi Pollution Control Committeee that no polluting activities were being carried out in the godown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ngt-seeks-petitioners-reply-on-his-plea-for-relief-from-dpcc-order/article34381080.ece

22 April 2021||New Delhi,||More farmers joining protest at borders: SKM||Farmers in large numbers have started coming towards Delhi after the harvesting season to strengthen the protest against the Centre’s new farm laws, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) said on Wednesday. The only way for the Centre to resolve the deadlock with the protesting farmers is by repealing the contentious farm laws and coming out with a legislation to guarantee the minimum support price (MSP), it said. “On the call of the SKM, farmers in large numbers have started coming towards Delhi. The farmers are coming back after harvesting, to strengthen the protest at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Shahjahanpur borders,” SKM leader Darshan Pal said in a statement. “If the government is equally worried about the health of farmers, it should immediately repeal the three laws and make a new law on the MSP,” he said. Mr. Pal, who also virtually participated in the International Press Conference at Press Club Geneva, claimed that the Indian government failed to consult the farmers, farmer organisations, people living in rural areas, pro-farmer economists or political parties, while framing the controversial laws in violation of a UN declaration which grants rural dwellers a right on such issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/more-farmers-joining-protest-at-borders-skm/article34381069.ece
