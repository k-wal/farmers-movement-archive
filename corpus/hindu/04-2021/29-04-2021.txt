29 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccine registrations begin for those above 18, amid glitches||Vaccine registrations for those aged 18-44 began on Wednesday with several people able to enrol — after some glitches — but unable to get appointments at hospitals for vaccination. Though no figure was available for precisely how many in this age bracket registered, Ram Sewak Sharma, Chairman, CoWIN, told The Hindu via text message that “most” of the 8 million who registered on Wednesday belonged to the 18-44 age bracket. Though vaccines are to be given to all adults below 45 from May 1, as per the Centre’s new policy, this is contingent on the States — and not the Centre — making them available to citizens. The Centre will continue to provide vaccines to the States and vaccinate for free those over 45. The States, on the other hand, have to negotiate with vaccine companies the price at which they will buy. This again will be from 50% of the vaccines made and cleared by the Central Drug Research Laboratory, Kasauli. The remaining will continue to go to the Centre for its programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccine-registrations-begin-for-those-above-18-amid-glitches/article34435112.ece
29 April 2021||Pune,||It’s official: those below 45 to get free vaccine jabs in Maharashtra||Officially announcing the Uddhav Thackeray government’s decision to provide free vaccination to all those between 18 and 44 years, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said the government could not commence the third phase of the anti-COVID-19 vaccination drive from May 1 owing to paucity of vaccine doses. Following the Cabinet meeting, Mr. Tope said the State exchequer would bear an estimated expenditure of Rs. 6,500 crore to inoculate around 5.71 crore citizens in the 18-44 age-group. The government planned to complete the drive over the next six months. Curbs to be extended Mr. Tope said the State government had decided to extend the ‘Break the Chain’ restrictions currently in force for a minimum of 15 days or more after May 1 as the number of cases and fatalities were yet to come down. While hoping that the State’s daily case surge had peaked, the Health Minister said restrictions could not be eased with Maharashtra still reporting around 60,000 cases each day. “The Cabinet has unanimously taken the decision to provide free vaccination to all its citizens above 18 years in the third phase . The government needs to purchase at least 12 crore vials, while administering two crore vaccine doses each month to complete this drive over the next six months,” he said. Mr. Tope stressed that despite the Centre announcing the third phase to begin on May 1, it would not be possible to commence the vaccination on that date as the only two indigenous producers — Serum Institute of India (which produces Covishield) and Bharat Biotech (which rolls out Covaxin) — could not supply the requisite amounts of doses for the smooth conduct of the inoculation drive. Expression of Interest “Bharat Biotech, in its Expression of Interest (EOI) to the State government’s request, has said it could only supply us with 10 lakh vaccines in May and the same number in June. From August, the firm has said it could provide us with 20 lakh vaccines every month,” he said. He hoped to commence the drive only by the end of May. Mr. Tope said Serum Institute had given a verbal promise of supplying one crore vaccines a month to the Maharashtra government and that the State Cabinet had taken a decision to import vaccines to meet its required quantity. “The Chief Minister is in talks with the manufactures of the Russian ‘Sputnik V’ vaccine to see if they can provide us doses in the right quantity at a reasonable price,” Mr. Tope said. He said the State hoped to procure the ‘Virafin’ vaccine by Zydus Cadilla in August, along with that of Johnson & Johnson’s ‘Janssen’ vaccine. A micro-planning committee comprising Health Department officials and senior ministers would be working out the modalities of managing the third phase of vaccination. “We are planning to divide the 18-44 age-group into three categories: 18-25 years, 25-35 and 35-44 years. We may decide to give preference to a particular sub-group or may think of giving first doses to citizens with co-morbidities in these groups,” Mr. Tope said. Both Mr. Tope and Chief Minister Thackeray exhorted people to avoid needlessly rushing to vaccination centres. “There must not be any indiscipline or unwarranted rush at any of the centres. We do not want them to become virus spreading centres … all registrations must be done compulsorily through the CoWin app only,” Mr. Tope said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/its-official-those-below-45-to-get-free-vaccine-jabs-in-maharashtra/article34435845.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Rush to buy essentials on day 1 of lockdown||On any normal day, the market on Hutchins Road, Fraser Town, is abuzz with activity – vegetable cart sellers jostling for space with pedestrians; people sipping tea or coffee outside the local newspaper store and long queues outside the local butcher. For the past three days, however, business has been dull. “Even today, the first day of the lockdown, I had very few customers, so I will close early. But I think more locals will come and buy fresh produce in the coming days when they run out of stock. We had huge orders on staples such as rice, dal and flour yesterday before the lockdown kicked in,” said a local store owner, on Wednesday, the first day of the 14-day lockdown. People were allowed to come out of their houses to purchase essential commodities from 6 a.m to 10 a.m. Thereafter, police were seen forcibly closing shops and markets and barricading roads to discourage non-essential movement of people. Vehicles seized A total 434 vehicles, including 395 two wheelers, 22 three wheelers and 17 four wheelers were seized in the city for violating the lockdown. The police also booked 19 cases against shops and commercial establishments under the Disaster Management Act for violating the lockdown. Closure of shops and markets irked shop owners who could not sell perishable items such as vegetables and flowers. Vendors were seen arguing with police about the 10 a.m. deadline. At the historical K. R. Market, police forcibly closed shops after 10 a.m. G.M. Divakar, president of K.R. Market Flower Merchants’ Association, said just around 10% of the flowers that usually come to the market were brought in by farmers. “There is still some confusion among farmers, Wednesday being the first day. We hope business picks up eventually though,” he said and added that there were around 1,000 daily wage workers who lived in the market. Most citizens either decided to stick to online shopping or went early to stock up on essentials. Mahadev, a resident of Jayamahal, said he was uncomfortable ordering vegetables online and chose to make a quick visit to his neighbourhood vendors to buy what was needed. “I went early as even I am scared to step out now. I have only got one dose of the vaccine,” he added. Those who were banking on online portals to deliver essentials complained of long waits, sometimes extending up to two to three days. Some citizens also said that in inner residential areas, movement of personal vehicles continued unhindered despite the lockdown kicking in. By afternoon, most major roads bore a deserted look. Police were seen checking all personal and other vehicles on major roads such as Mysuru Road and Tumakuru Road.  With public transport suspended, hundreds of migrant workers, students and others were seen waiting for trains at Yesvantpur and KSR-Bengaluru city railway stations - a majority of them since Tuesday evening - as non-availability of public transport after 9 p.m. on Tuesday forced them to reach the stations almost a day in advance. Divisional Railway Manager (Bengaluru Division) Ashok Kumar Verma said, “As per the State government guidelines, public transport is not allowed. People who had booked tickets to travel to various destinations in Bihar, West Bengal and other areas in north eastern parts of the country had reached on Tuesday evening itself,” On Wednesday evening too, similar scenes were seen as some passengers who had booked ticket for Thursday travel reached the stations. People reaching the airport also had a tough time as cabs were not easily available. “I was trying to book a cab online to reach the airport. I reached out to both Ola and Uber on social media, but no response was received,” Sudarshan, an air passenger said. The BMTC operated only six ‘Vayu Vajra’ services from Majestic to the Airport. The KSRTC is operating FlyBus from Mysuru and Madikeri to the Airport. Fake message on passes Meanwhile, though the guidelines on lockdown clearly states there are no restrictions for people during the time of emergency, fake messages were being circulated on social media and on Resident Welfare Association groups stating that passes from the police station are required to go out in the time of emergency. City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant clarified that the police is not issuing any passes during the period of lockdown. “Those who are permitted under the guidelines of the government may commute by showing their ID cards or documents justifying their travel,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rush-to-buy-essentials-on-day-1-of-lockdown/article34435274.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Negative test or vaccination must for agents, candidates||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Wednesday made it mandatory for candidates and agents to have either negative COVID-19 test results or both doses of a vaccine before entering the counting halls on May 2, when votes of the five Assembly polls are tabulated. The ECI issued instructions for counting of votes in the West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry elections at a time the country is going through an unprecedented surge of COVID-19. On Tuesday, the ECI banned all victory processions on May 2, and restricted the number of people accompanying winning candidates to collect their certificate of election from the Returning Officer to two. “In view of the second wave of pandemic and in order to ensure completely COVID-safe arrangements during counting, the Commission has been regularly consulting the Chief Secretaries and the Chief Electoral Officers of all five States/UT and has taken their views and safety measures/ protocol to be followed,” an ECI statement said. The poll panel ordered the District Election Officers to be the Nodal Officers for the counting centres to make sure COVID-19 norms are followed.

29 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||State to vaccinate everyone in 18-45 age group for free||The State will purchase one-crore doses of COVID-19 vaccines directly from two manufacturers to make it available for those in the 18-45 age group. A Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Wednesday took the decision hours before the online registration for those in the 18-45 age group began. The vaccines will cost the State Rs. 483 crore. Of the one-crore doses, 70 lakh doses will be Covishield from the Pune-based Serum Institute of India and the remaining Covaxin from the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. The first 10-lakh doses will be purchased next week and the entire purchase will be completed by July. Committee report The Cabinet decision is based on a report of a committee led by Chief Secretary V.P. Joy. Additional Chief Secretary, Finance, Rajesh Kumar Singh and Principal Secretary, Health, Rajan Khobragade were the members. The State will have to pay Rs. 294 crore for the 70 lakh doses of Covishield, with each dose costing Rs. 400 and 5% GST and another Rs. 189 crore for the 30 lakh doses of Covaxin with each dose costing Rs. 600, including GST. “The direct purchase will be subject to the verdicts in the petitions in the High Court and Supreme Court,’’ the Chief Minister told the media. Vaccination policy “The pricing of the vaccine is inappropriate. They are giving it to the Centre for Rs. 150 a dose. We have asked them to change the policy and make it available free-of-cost. There is no response from the Centre,” he said. To a question, the Chief Minister said the government will not shy away from the responsibility and two doses will be given free for all in the 18-45 age group. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had told The Hindu on Sunday that the State Treasury has a cash balance of Rs. 3,000 crore to purchase vaccines directly. On the hassles faced in vaccination for those in the 45 years and above, Mr. Vijayan said the State did not have adequate vaccines in stock for them. “Vaccination is based on the availability of vaccines provided by Centre,” he said. No lockdown The Cabinet has also decided not to go by the Union Health Ministry’s directive to impose lockdown in districts having test positivity rate (TPR) above 15%. If the Centre approved the proposal, lockdown would have to be implemented in 12 districts, except Pathanamthitta and Kollam. “Lockdown is the last measure before us to contain the pandemic. Now, we will go for stringent measures,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-to-vaccinate-everyone-in-18-45-age-group-for-free/article34435298.ece

29 April 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC grills Centre over oxygen supply||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the city government to explore the possibility of seeking assistance of the armed forces in setting up field hospitals in the Capital, even as it grilled the Centre for its failure to supply the allocated 490 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen per day to Delhi. “Not for a single day has Delhi received the full allocated quantity [of oxygen]. The primary reason for this is that three of the plants that supply the oxygen are in Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinganagar — all at a distance of not less than 1,600 km,” a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said. “You have to look at the allocation yourself to reduce the turnaround time. Obviously, if you go 1,600 km, the turnaround time is bound to be more,” it noted. When Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma submitted that oxygen allocation has been done after an all-India mapping, the Bench said: “We are not in a position to tell the Centre to change it. The proof of the pudding lies in its eating.” It added that plants such as the one in Durgapur could serve nearby States while Delhi should be allocated oxygen from plants closer to the city. “Whatever is humanly possible is being done. There is complete coordinated effort in this regard,” the ASG replied. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said the three plants were sending on average 50 MT of oxygen each to Delhi instead of the allocated 100 MT. The HC directed senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao, appointed as amicus curiae, to study the Centre’s allocation order and give suggestion to optimise tanker usage and cut turnaround time. ‘Airlift empty tankers’ “We hope and expect that the Centre will look at the logistic problems being faced in transporting oxygen from the three plants to Delhi,” the HC said, adding: “What has happened to the promised 490 MT of oxygen for Delhi? Till today it has not reached that figure. We were told this about a week ago. The kind of shortage Delhi is facing, how many States are facing? People will keep dying and you [the Centre] will not do anything about it,” the Bench remarked. “You have to do this on SOS basis. You can airlift the empty tankers back,” the High Court suggested. During the hearing, senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal said, “The Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat has said that the defence services should be called upon under what is called the aid to civil authorities provisions. They can help set up field hospitals.” Mr. Venugopal said the Delhi government can seek such assistance with the approval of the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-hc-grills-centre-over-oxygen-supply/article34435458.ece
29 April 2021||LUCKNOW,||Seven patients dead in Meerut, hospitals blame lack of oxygen||Seven patients died in two hospitals in Meerut district, allegedly due to scarcity of oxygen supply, doctors said at a time when the Uttar Pradesh government has asserted that there was no shortage of medical oxygen or medicines at any hospital. While three patients died at Anand Hospital, four died at the KMC Hospital in the city, reported NDTV, the TV channel. Anand Hospital’s Medical Superintendent Subash Yadav told the channel on Tuesday that the hospital had been facing acute shortage of oxygen for two days. “We were allotted 400 cylinders in a day but were getting only 90, that too five or ten at a time. We were left with four cylinders. There was no oxygen for two hours. We lost three patients due to lack of oxygen,” he said. ‘Important factor’ Sunil Gupta, head of the KMC Hospital, said that though he could not pinpoint and say that the deaths had happened only because of lack of oxygen, “Not getting oxygen was an important factor.” Mr. Gupta further said his hospital was receiving only 50-60% of its required oxygen supply. While the availability of oxygen remains an issue, its distribution was also not well-organised, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/seven-patients-dead-in-meerut-hospitals-blame-lack-of-oxygen/article34435461.ece

There was no shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir injections, he told the media after taking stock of the situation in a meeting of the Group of Ministers (GoM) at the APIIC headquarters in Mangalagiri on Wednesday. Mr. Srinivas said the State had 60 COVID Care Centre, where people with mild symptoms were being treated, while those in relatively serious conditions were admitted to hospitals. The officials were ordered to ensure that there was no dearth of doctors, and patients did not suffer for want of medicines. Private hospitals were being permitted to increase the number of beds, subject to the fulfilment of certain criteria. As far as oxygen supply was concerned, Mr. Srinivas said the requirement last year was close to 240 tonnes per day. The Central government had recently allocated 420 tonnes to the State. “The government is supplying Remdesivir injections to private hospitals, and has taken steps to curb their black marketing, he added.

29 April 2021||Mangaluru,||MP asks companies to pitch in for controlling COVID-19||With the second wave of COVID-19 surging, Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP, on Wednesday appealed to the private and the public sector companies to assist the government in creating, arranging medical facilities to tackle the disease in the district. Speaking at a meeting on COVID-19 control, Mr. Kateel asked the companies to contribute funds for setting up medical oxygen plants, purchase of oxygen cylinders, and creating, facilitating other medical facilities in the district. Mr. Kateel said that the infection is spreading fast and there is a crisis. Saving the infected persons has emerged as a challenge both to doctors and the government. In such a situation the companies should join hands with the government to overcome the crisis. The MP instructed that the MRPL should assist for setting up a 930-LPM (Litres Per Minute) capacity oxygen plant on the premises of Government Wenlock Hospital and MCF Ltd. should help in building 80-LPM capacity oxygen plants on the premises of ESI Hospital in Mangaluru and at the taluk hospital in Bantwal. GAIL (India) Ltd. and GAIL Gas Ltd. should come forward for contributing in the setting up of plants in Puttur and Belthangady and KIOCL should assist in establishing plants in Uppinangady and Moodbidri. Mr. Kateel said that Infosys, Mangaluru, should contribute for building an electrical crematorium at Ullal and MSEZ Ltd. should help in the maintenance of ambulances and arranging ambulances on rent. The Mangaluru chapter of the CII will have to assist in the supply of 100 oxygen cylinders on rent. He instructed New Mangalore Port Trust and the BASF India Ltd to help in the supply of 20 ‘dura cylinders’ each. The representatives of industries who attended the meeting agreed to the call. Mr. Kateel asked the district administration to conduct the swab tests of those who came to Dakshina Kannada from outside. More beds with oxygen supply should be kept ready for treating COVID-19 patients whose numbers are likely to increase in the coming days. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said that private hospitals have reserved 50% of their beds to the government for treating COVID-19 patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mp-asks-companies-to-pitch-in-for-controlling-covid-19/article34435829.ece
29 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Govt. to streamline hospital admissions||The intense pace of disease transmission in the State and the burgeoning number of patients in the active case pool has necessitated a streamlining of hospital admissions in the State, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. Speaking to the media here on Wednesday, he said the expert committee advising the government on COVID-19 would prepare detailed guidelines on hospital admission. People who have been getting infected after receiving at least one dose of the vaccine have been found to be generally safe and hence need not get admitted in hospitals. Also, people whose oxygenation status is satisfactory also can stay home, if they did not have any other illnesses and follow the directions given by doctors, Mr. Vijayan said. He pointed out that the current surge capacity of the health system seemed to be satisfactory at present but going by the case graph, this was certainly not going to be enough in another two weeks. While increasing the capacity and infrastructure in hospitals, shortage of human resources was a major problem that seemed to have few solutions, he said. Bed occupancy status The State is taking all possible measures to ensure that people will not have to go hospital hunting in the eleventh hour. As the number of patients are rising exponentially, the government has decided to devise a system wherein at the district-level, every hospital, public and private, will update its bed occupancy, ICU occupancy and oxygen position every four hours on a web portal, so that patient referrals can be suitably made. This will help the district authorities keep track of the utilisation and availability of hospital resources. This data will be made available soon on the public domain. People can contact the State Health helpline 1056 for advice on whom to contact for assistance.  Chief Minister also advised that every citizen on home quarantine to be in close contact with the local health workers, councillors or ward members and to keep their contact numbers and to get in touch with them if at all any symptoms aggravate, for fast removal to hospitals. Mr. Vijayan pointed out that the test positivity rate was rising alarmingly in many panchayats in Thrissur and Kottayam districts. Some 21 panchayats in Thrissur had a TPR of over 50%. In Kottayam, 58 out of the 71 panchayats had a TPR of over 20% and another five had a TPR between 40-50%. Lock-down-like regulations would have to be imposed in all these places for bringing down disease transmission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-to-streamline-hospital-admissions/article34435300.ece

29 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||HM warns black marketeers of oxygen and life saving drugs||Home Minister Mohd. Mahmood Ali has reiterated that the State government is committed to initiate stringent action against those indulging in black marketing of oxygen and other life-saving drugs in view of the steep rise in cases of COVID-19. The Police Department would not give any scope for black marketing of COVID-19 related drugs in the State. Those found guilty of violating the provisions would be arrested and prosecution would be launched against them under relevant provisions of law. The Home Minister held a review meeting on the measures being taken to tackle COVID-19 cases with senior officials of the department headed by DGP M. Mahender Reddy and Home department Principal Secretary Ravi Gupta on Wednesday. Mr. Mahmood Ali said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao would take a serious view of incidents involving black marketing of life saving drugs. The department was equally focused on the social media to check rumours and false reports being posted through them. Asserting that the government had initiated several measures to ensure that there was no shortage of beds of oxygen supplies in the State, he wanted the Muslim community to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour during the ongoing holy month of Ramzan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hm-warns-black-marketeers-of-oxygen-and-life-saving-drugs/article34435759.ece
29 April 2021||Pune,||Serum Institute cuts Covishield price for the States to Rs. 300||The Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) on Wednesday announced that it was reducing the price of its Covishield vaccine for the States from Rs. 400 to Rs. 300 per dose as a “philanthropic gesture”. “This will save thousands of crores of state funds going forward. This will enable more vaccinations and save countless lives,” Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla said on Twitter. The SII had earlier said its per dose price of Covishield was Rs. 150 for the Centre, Rs. 400 for State governments and Rs. 600 for private hospitals. Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, quoted Rs. 150 for the Centre, Rs. 600 for the State governments and Rs. 1,200 for private hospitals. Earlier, the SII had faced criticism over its pricing. Following the criticism, the SII had stated last week that Covishield remained “the most affordable COVID-19 vaccine available in the market today”. “The initial prices were kept very low globally as it was based on advance funding given by those countries for at-risk vaccine manufacturing. The initial supply price of Covishield for all government immunisation programmes, including in India, has been the lowest,” the SII had said in a statement. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said on Wednesday that despite the Centre announcing the third phase of vaccination from May 1, it would not be possible to begin inoculations on that date as the only two indigenous producers — SII and Bharat Biotech — could not supply the requisite doses. Mr. Tope further said that the SII had only given a verbal promise of supplying one crore vaccines a month to the Maharashtra government and that a written assurance was pending. Accordingly, the Maharashtra Cabinet had taken the decision to import vaccines to meet its required quantity of an estimated 12 crore doses in order to inoculate 5.71 crore citizens between 18-44 years for the third phase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/serum-institute-cuts-covishield-price-for-the-states-to-rs-300/article34435101.ece
29 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||HC concerned over virus spread||A Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and comprising Justice C. Praveen Kumar, directed the State government to make up the shortfalls in tackling COVID with the urgency it deserves, and suggested that the related Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petitions not be considered as adversarial actions. During a hearing on PILs filed by AP Civil Liberties Association and Guntur-based social activist Thota Suresh Babu on the COVID containment measures on Wednesday, the court expressed concern on the hardships being faced by COVID patients, particularly the alleged inaction against their exploitation by private hospitals, and inquired about the vaccination drive and other steps taken by the government to control the pandemic. The Chief Justice and Justice Praveen Kumar also questioned Advocate-General S. Sriram about the availability of oxygen and Remdesivir injections and a host of other issues involved in mitigating the devastating impact of COVID. The court ordered that the names and mobile phone numbers of nodal officers in government-notified COVID hospitals and Covid Care Centres should be prominently displayed and wide publicity given to the same to enable the people to avail themselves of their services without much difficulty. It has been further ordered that flying squads be set up to crack the whip on erring hospitals and efforts made to ensure COVID-appropriate behaviour. Advocates N. Srinivasa Rao and P. Suresh Kumar represented the petitioners. The matter is going to be heard next on May 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-concerned-over-virus-spread/article34435107.ece
29 April 2021||COIMBATORE,||Couple’s gift is a ‘fan moment’ for Kovai||When some give, they prefer to do it anonymously. A couple called on authorities of the Government Medical College and ESI Hospital, Coimbatore, on Tuesday and offered to donate fans for the COVID-19 wards. But they would do so without any publicity. The hospital Dean, M. Raveendran, thought they wanted to give a few fans. When he stepped out of his office, escorted by the couple, he found 100 new pedestal fans lined up in the corridor. Raised Rs. 2.2 lakh The couple then made another surprising revelation: they had pledged their jewellery for Rs. 2.2 lakh to buy the fans, as they could not pool in the required sum quickly. “We initially thought they would give just a few. We were pleasantly surprised to see 100,” Dr. Raveendran said. The decision to present one hundred fans came after a Tamil daily carried a report on Tuesday, stating that fans could be donated to the COVID-19 wards as the hospital administration was unable to operate the central air-conditioning. A local FM station also highlighted the requirement in its morning programme. “We got 300 fans from the government for the COVID-19 wards. But the number of patients under care was more than double. There were 720 patients as of Wednesday,” the Dean said. The medical superintendent, T. Ravikumar, said the couple had come to the hospital for COVID-19 vaccination and took an immediate decision to enable much-needed ventilation after coming to know of the requirement. “When we saw they had pledged their jewellery, we insisted that they limit the donation to five or ten fans and return the rest to the shop. But they requested us to accept all of them. A final call was taken after getting the consent of the District Collector who asked us to honour the couple for their humanitarian gesture,” he said. When contacted, the couple did not wish to comment on the donation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/couples-gift-is-a-fan-moment-for-kovai/article34435110.ece

29 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||New Act gives more powers to Delhi L-G||The Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday issued a gazette notification stating that the provisions of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, would be deemed to have come into effect from April 27. The Act, which gives the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi more teeth and significantly waters down the powers of both the elected government and the Legislative Assembly, will clarify the expression “Government” and address “ambiguities” in the legislative provisions to promote “harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive”. In middle of pandemic The move comes a day after the Delhi High Court cautioned the Delhi government to put its “house in order” over the issue of inadequate oxygen supply in the city, adding that the Centre would be asked to take over if it could not manage the situation. Coming as the development does in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Act is expected to trigger another round of confrontation between the L-G and the Delhi government under AAP. The Act defines the responsibilities of the elected government and the L-G along with the “constitutional scheme of governance of the NCT” interpreted by the Supreme Court in recent judgments regarding the division of powers between the two entities. It will also seek to ensure that the L-G is “necessarily granted an opportunity” to exercise powers entrusted to him under proviso to clause (4) of Article 239AA of the Constitution. This particular clause provides for a Council of Ministers headed by a Chief Minister for the NCT to “aid and advise the Lieutenant-Governor” in the exercise of his functions for matters in which the Legislative Assembly has the power to make laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/new-act-gives-more-powers-to-delhi-l-g/article34435115.ece

A preprint of the study carried out by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech researchers has been posted in biorXiv . Preprints are yet to be peer-reviewed and published in medical journals. So far, 21 countries have detected the B.1.617 variant. Of those, the majority of cases has been reported from India. The researchers used the sera collected from 28 people who had participated in the Covaxin phase-2 trial. They also collected sera samples from 17 people who were infected with older strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus and had recovered. “The study found that the neutralising capacity against the double mutant [B.1.617] variant was found to be good in both groups — people who have received the vaccine and those who have recovered from COVID-19,” say Dr. Samiran Panda, a senior scientist at ICMR and one of the co-authors of the preprint. “Compared with people who have recovered from COVID-19, the ability of the sera of vaccinated people to neutralise the B.1.617 variant was found to be two-fold less.” An earlier study had found that Covaxin neutralises the B.1.1.7 variant first found in the U.K. “The assurance of neutralisation of B.1.617 variant with sera of Covaxin vaccinees and recovered COVID-19 sera will provide the much-needed boost for the COVID-19 vaccination programme in India,” the authors write. Speaking to presspersons during a conference call on April 27, Dr. Antony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said: “Despite the real difficulty that we’re seeing in India, vaccination could be a very important antidote against this [variant].” The B.1.617 variant has two mutations — E484Q and L425R — of concern. These mutations are found in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. Though how the two mutations behave individually is well-known, the combined effect of these mutations when present together is not known. “Further studies are needed to understand the transmissibility and infectivity of the B.1.617 variant,” the authors write.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covaxin-shields-from-b1617/article34435033.ece

The fire broke out around 3.40 a.m. at Prime Criticare Hospital in the Mumbra-Kausa area in Thane district, Thane Municipal Corporation officials said. The hospital had no COVID-19 patients. Three fire engines and five ambulances were rushed to the spot, and the blaze was doused after a few hours, they said. The incident comes just five days after 15 COVID-19 patients were killed in a fire at a hospital in Virar, around 50 km from Mumbai. State Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said the fire broke out due to a short circuit in the meter room of the hospital. “A high-level inquiry has been ordered to look into the reasons behind this fire and whether any safety rules were violated,” Mr. Awhad said. He added that the kin of each of the deceased would get a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh, while the injured would be given Rs. 1 lakh each. Around 20 patients, including six from the intensive care unit, were shifted to other hospitals. Thane Guardian Minister and State Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde said the deaths may have been caused due to smoke inhalation while the patients were being shifted. “The Thane Municipal Corporation will give an additional Rs. 5 lakh to the kin of those who died, and Rs. 1 lakh to those who were injured,” he said. The inquiry into the incident would involve the police and the Thane Municipal Corporation officials, Mr. Shinde said. He added that the government had issued directions to conduct fire, structural and oxygen audit of every hospital within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hospital-fire-kills-4-near-mumbai/article34435039.ece
29 April 2021||Pune,||In Pune, alone and penniless||With Pune facing an acute shortage of ventilators and oxygen beds, accessing critical health care is not easy. Balaji Phad, a 28-year-old preparing for his Maharashtra Public Service Commission exam, had a nightmarish experience trying to find an oxygen bed in Pune city. “I tested positive last week. When I went to the nearest Pune Municipal Corporation Hospital for a check, they merely took down my details and put me on a wait list. As my oxygen levels began dropping, I searched for a bed in vain for two days,” he said. Mr. Phad, who hails from Latur district, had no relatives to help him; financially strapped, he was close to tears and frantically began calling his friends as his health deteriorated. “A friend finally took me to Naidu hospitals, but there were no beds available. After searching high and low, I was finally taken to a private hospital near Pune Railway Station. There, too, all beds were occupied, but I was asked to sit and given oxygen support. It was only then that my condition began to improve,” he says. ‘Forced discharge’ IT engineer Prithviraj Bhosale says that his father was given a “forced discharge” by a private hospital as it had run out of oxygen. “I had to hunt for an oxygen bed in another hospital... it beggars belief that the district administration and the State government had not planned for a second wave… what was the need to shut down Pune’s jumbo COVID centres in such a hurry early this year? Furthermore, vitals drugs and medicines are in short supply owing to hoarding and rampant black-marketeering that is going unchecked,” Mr. Bhosale said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-pune-alone-and-penniless/article34435058.ece
29 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||2 die of shock after earthquake in Assam||Two people died of shock and at least 10 others sustained injuries after an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 struck Assam at 7.51 a.m. on Wednesday. The earthquake, which was felt across northeast India, Bihar, West Bengal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, also left several buildings and roads in the northern and western parts of the State damaged. The National Centre of Seismology (NCS) said the epicentre of the earthquake, at a depth of 10 km, was Dhekiajuli in Sonitpur district, and preliminary analysis showed it was located near the Kopili Fault closer to the Himalayan Frontal Thrust. “The area is seismically very active falling in the highest Seismic Hazard Zone V associated with collisional tectonics where Indian Plate subducts beneath the Eurasian Plate,” the NCS said in a statement, adding that the last major earthquake in the region was of the magnitude 6.0 on July 29, 1960. “Two persons died due to shock or cardiac arrest. The deaths were reported from Chandrapur in Kamrup (Metropolitan) and Nagaon districts. We received reports that at least 10 people were injured in different parts of the State,” G.D. Tripathi, Chief Executive Officer of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, said. He added that many high-rise buildings and hotels, mostly in Guwahati, were among the structures that suffered damage. Roads and fields, mostly in Sonitpur and in the adjoining Darrang district, developed cracks, too. Some inmates of apartments in Guwahati decided against returning to their accommodations as the structures developed cracks. But the Assam Real Estate & Infrastructure Developers’ Association (AREIDA) allayed fears. “We have extensively surveyed the earthquake damage and found that these are primarily non-structural damage. We, therefore, request all to act responsibly and discourage the offensive practice of spreading panic,” AREIDA president P.K. Sarma said. Soon after the earthquake, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and took stock of the situation. “PM @narendramodi ji is taking regular updates about the situation after the earthquake at Dhekiajuli this morning. Got a 2nd call from the Hon’ble PM within a span of few hours. I have apprised him about the latest situation,” Mr. Sonowal tweeted. Wednesday’s earthquake also left a trail of destruction in western Arunachal Pradesh, with at least 22 houses — seven of them razed — damaged in Tawang district. Two people, injured after their houses collapsed, were undergoing treatment, officials said. Several buildings in the adjoining West Kameng district suffered damage, too. There were reports of quake-induced landslides, including one between Membachur and Gorbow villages blocking a vital road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-die-of-shock-after-earthquake-in-assam/article34435023.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Hard to understand why corrective action was not taken sooner’||As India grapples with a massive second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chandrika Bahadur , chair of the Regional Task Force of the Lancet Commission, speaks on why this happened and the way ahead:  India is undergoing a very severe second wave of COVID-19, something that could have been anticipated. What in your view went wrong in terms of anticipation and capacity building? India prepared reasonably well for the pandemic in its early stages. The lockdown gave the medical system time to expand infrastructure, train staff, and build capacity to absorb patients. The rationale for lockdowns across the world in March-April 2020 was to “flatten the curve”. It meant taking actions that would bring down the number of cases that needed hospitalisation and treatment enough that they would not breach the limits of the medical capacity of the country. This preparation allowed the country to manage the first wave in 2020, while keeping overall mortality rates relatively low (apart from brief periods of stress in the larger cities). The number of new cases began to decline nationwide after September (despite localised spikes in some places), and by January 2021, there was a dramatic reduction in hospital utilisation rates. Vaccinations began in January, and this led to the expectation that India would be able to vaccinate its frontline health workers, and the most vulnerable segments of the population by the summer, so even if a second wave hit, it would not be severe, and the country would be better equipped to handle it. Three factors belied this expectation: first, the dedicated volunteer networks, special COVID-19 facilities, and emergency measures that the administration and health system had taken, were scaled back and in some cases wound down, just as cases were beginning to rise. Second, the vaccination campaign was slower to roll out, largely because of a lower sense of urgency. And third, we didn’t invest enough resources to study the emergence of new variants quickly enough. All these factors were predicated on the assumption that the worst was behind us. So, when the wave began, from a preparedness point of view, we were, in some ways more unprepared than we were towards the end of last year. Was there enough research being done on why we saw a major dip in the months of January and early February? Did that make the government and people complacent? There was research, but there was no overarching compelling explanation for why recorded numbers dipped so rapidly and so much at the start of the year. The last sero-survey carried out by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) showed exposure rates of 1 in 5 amongst the respondents sampled, but with wide variations across urban and rural, and within urban between different categories of populations. So, the prevailing popular theory of “herd immunity” was not really backed by evidence. The falling numbers coincided with a continued opening of the economy; new cases didn’t rise despite increased mobility, reinforcing the sense of confidence. The lack of a compelling explanation for the fall, in my view, led to the willingness of many people to believe that the worst was behind us. When the Lancet Commission on COVID-19 India Task Force was convened in January, several Task Force members expressed their grave concerns that the prevailing optimism was misplaced, and that a second wave was imminent. Unfortunately, those fears have been completely validated. What is harder to understand is why corrective action was not taken at the beginning of this wave when numbers started to rise in Maharashtra and Punjab. There were enough indications that the situation was going to get difficult. And even if no one predicted the intensity of the wave, the fact that it was happening should have immediately triggered actions to limit large gatherings and reinforce safe behaviour. None of that happened till it was too late and we are seeing the consequences play out. We are being told that new mutants are more infectious than the last time around. How much of the current situation, just in terms of spread, can be laid at the door of the mutations? It is too early to answer this question precisely. The Lancet Commission Task Force has recommended that the Indian SARS-COV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), led by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), set up in December 2020, be supported so it can achieve its goal of testing 5% of all cases every month on a continuous basis. We also recommend that in the short term, laboratories are equipped with TaqPath test kits to identify the B.1.1.7 and other variants. Right now, we are a long way from systematically gathering and analysing this information. What public health interventions, do you think, need to be made urgently for the mitigation of some of the appalling shortages in medical resources we see? In the short-term, the immediate priority is to save lives. Enough has been said on the shortages that hospitals face immediately, in terms of beds, logistics around the supplies of oxygen, and availability of drugs. The more fundamental issue is of a structure that supports patients at home and helps triage patients effectively, so that only the most critical go to hospital, and those that need to, get the help they need. Mumbai has done that well, and we are seeing the results in terms of hospitalisation rates, and overall management of the pandemic. Reducing movement and activity (through voluntary or imposed closures) is necessary step right now — to break the chain of transmission and stabilise the numbers. In April, we saw the rise of new cases growing at the rate of nearly 7%. This has to be brought down urgently. Scaling up of vaccinations is also key as a medium-term strategy to boost protection and reduce the severity of illness and eventually (hopefully) transmission rates. The supply constraints that the vaccine manufacturers are facing right now could not have come at a worse time, given the intensity of the wave. We need to ramp up production and distribution urgently. Finally, our health care staff: doctors, nurses, attendants, administrators and ambulance drivers are under enormous stress and strain. Supplementing them with senior residents and medical students, retraining, counselling and supporting them: these are all steps that need to be planned for immediately. Is the second wave it? Or are more waves and troughs anticipated? I don’t believe anyone expects this wave to be the last. But the intensity of the next wave will depend on how well we learn the lessons from this one. If we can ramp vaccinations by an order of magnitude over the next few months, prepare our primary care system to effectively supervise home care and triage patients, ensure a steady supply of the inputs that hospitals need to effectively treat patients, and if we can collectively practise COVID-safe behaviours moving forward, the subsequent waves we face can be managed.  There were enough indications that the situation was going to get difficult||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hard-to-understand-why-corrective-action-was-not-taken-sooner/article34435043.ece
29 April 2021||New Delhi,||Capital casesheet: many do not even make it to ICU||In the national capital, a horror story that starts with “I have fever” is being played out in almost every family as COVID-19 cases continue to surge. At every step of the way, from getting tested to finding oxygen support and a hospital bed, the healthcare system has been overwhelmed. Outside hospitals, and in makeshift COVID Care Centres (CCC), patients can be seen waiting in ambulances, cars, autorickshaws and even on the pavement, struggling to breathe as attendants scramble to plead with hospital security and staff to get them admitted. Palam resident Shradha Singh, who lost her 42-year-old sister to the virus, said, “She was doing fine initially. However, with a sudden drop in the oxygen saturation level, she required hospitalisation. We frantically searched for places that would take her in and even tried seeking help on social media. But the sheer amount of information — a lot of it not leading anywhere — became difficult. We took her to a hospital nearby and there, in the emergency ward itself, she passed away.” Some do not even make it to the emergency ward. On Thursday, outside the Sardar Patel CCC, a 45-year-old man who was in the back seat of a car, died after waiting for two hours to seek admission. The long queues to procure oxygen or have cylinders refilled have seen people queue up overnight. Anupama Gupta, 56, underwent pacemaker surgery at Artemis Hospital on April 15 and developed COVID-19 symptoms five days later. Her daughter Deeksha said she stood in queues with her mother’s reports, seeking beds in several hospitals, but was turned away. “I have tried at least 40 hospitals in Delhi, Gurugram, Sonipat and Panipat, but there are no beds. The Artemis has given us a waiting list number of 600,” said Ms. Deeksha, a Gurgaon resident. Family members of a 63-year-old COVID-19 patient based in east Delhi, who requested that they not be named, said they were forced to purchase an oxygen concentrator for three times its original price when they failed to get her admitted to the Sardar Patel CCC on Tuesday. While the struggle to find hospital beds goes from bad to worse, even getting an RT-PCR test in the National Capital Region has become a task in itself. Mayank Gaur, a resident of IP Extension said, “My wife tested positive on Monday and I am trying to get my test done but no laboratory is willing to come for home collection.” ( Inputs from Shinjini Ghosh, Jatin Anand, Saurabh Trivedi, Ashok Kumar and Nikhil Babu )||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/capital-casesheet-unending-replay-of-pathos-pain/article34435054.ece
29 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Over 3,000 die for second straight day||India registered 3,13,648 new COVID-19 cases and 2,679 deaths till 9.30 p.m. on Wednesday. The country has so far reported a total of 1,83,02,441 cases and 2,03,845 deaths. Maharashtra reported 63,309 infections, followed by Karnataka (39,047) and Kerala (35,013). Maharashtra also recorded a whopping 985 casualties, followed by Uttar Pradesh (266) and Karnataka (229). The figures do not include cases and deaths from Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Assam, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh. The data are sourced from covid19india.org , an independent aggregator of daily figures. As many as 2,20,927 recoveries were recorded on Wednesday, taking the total past the 1.5-crore mark. 25 lakh vaccine doses Over 25 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the country in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Wednesday, more than 8 lakh shots fewer than what was recorded in the previous 24 hours. Only about 9% of the country’s population has received the first dose of the vaccine. Nearly 20% of the population in Himachal Pradesh has received the first shot, the highest coverage among the States, followed by Kerala (16.81%).  Lowest coverage Uttar Pradesh (4.33%), Bihar (4.67%), Assam (5.02%) and Tamil Nadu (5.93%) had the lowest coverage of the first dose of vaccination. Only 1.7% of the country’s population has received both doses of the vaccine. Uttarakhand (3.33%) and Kerala (3.31%) led the States in this aspect. More than 17.2 lakh tests were conducted on Tuesday (results of which were made available on Wednesday), over 65,000 more samples compared with the previous day. Globally, India’s average daily deaths over the past seven days (2,662) was the highest. Brazil, where fatalities are on a declining trend, ranked second (2,431).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-records-over-2600-fatalities/article34435041.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,||False leads on hospitals tire out breathless patients||Prabhu Prasad (name changed), 41, tested positive for COVID-19 last week. Since then, he and his wife, who also tested positive, had been isolating themselves at home. On Wednesday morning, when Mr. Prasad’s oxygen saturation levels were dropping, he contacted the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) control room seeking a bed in a hospital. After several calls, he was sent an ambulance and asked to go to a private hospital in south Bengaluru. He was in for a shock when he reached the hospital, oxygen cylinder in tow. He was told that there had been “a mistake” and no beds were available. Mr. Prasad had to wait in the lobby of the hospital for nearly two hours after which the hospital authorities asked him to wait outside in the ambulance. He was eventually allotted a bed at another private hospital in the opposite end of the city. The BBMP administration has admitted that High Dependency Unit (HDU) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds are limited, though the number of beds with oxygen had been increased. There is not yet a transparent system to track the number of beds available in private hospitals. The civic body has also been cracking down on private laboratories that have not been uploading COVID-19 test results on the Indian Council of Medical Research portal. So far, six private labs have been shut down. Though 79-year-old K. Chandrappa underwent a rapid antigen test and tested positive on April 16, the private hospital lab had not uploaded the test result or issued a Specimen Referral Form (SRF) ID to him. His daughter found this out the hard way on Wednesday when she scrambled to find him a hospital as his oxygen saturation levels fell. “The lab has been highly irresponsible. Without SRF ID, the BU (Bengaluru Urban) ID cannot be generated. Both of these are important for seeking any COVID-19 related service, be it ambulance or beds,” said Divya C., a teacher and Mr. Chandrappa’s daughter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/false-leads-on-hospitals-tire-out-breathless-patients/article34435052.ece
29 April 2021||Chennai,||Tense drive for a gulp of oxygen||Sandhya Kumar got a call from a friend in Dubai two days ago to help his sister get a hospital bed as she was becoming breathless. Ms. Sandhya and her husband were then returning from Chengalpattu to Chennai. They started making calls as they were driving back to the city. “We were trying desperately, contacting friends, doctors in the family to find her a bed. Her oxygen saturation level had fallen to 72. Her husband hired an ambulance and took her to two hospitals, but they could not admit her as they were overflowing with patients. They were getting nowhere and they came back home.” All the networking over the phone helped and Ms. Sandhya finally managed to find a hospital with a bed after two hours. The next problem was getting an ambulance. An ambulance service in Purasaiwalkam agreed to transport her for Rs. 3,500. The ambulance took her to the Government Omandurar Multi Super Speciality Hospital. “But she collapsed even as they were preparing for admission as her oxygen level fell to 40. She was revived in the corridor. Now, we have been told she is out of danger,” says Ms. Sandhya. All-day search Iyyavu called many hospitals to admit his father, a stroke patient, the whole of Tuesday. But all of them said they had no beds. Finally, a private medical college in Poonamallee said they had two beds. “I called the 108 ambulance and he drove us from our house in T. Nagar to the hospital. But when I arrived there, they told me there were no beds with oxygen support. But there were many beds as I went in and checked. I realised they were hesitating as my father was aged. He is 64 years old, and his oxygen saturation level was 91.” Mr. Iyyavu asked the Government Omandurar Multi Speciality Hospital, but there were no beds there. He said private ambulance providers demanded Rs. 6,000 to transport him. Finally, an 108 ambulance came to his aid. “As we tried hospital after hospital, my father’s oxygen saturation level fell to 65. The ambulance driver was helpful. He brought us to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, where he waited until the admission was completed. We had been on the road for eight to nine hours.”  We were trying desperately, contacting friends, doctors to find her a bed ... but they could not as hospitals were overflowing with patients||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tense-time-before-a-gulp-of-oxygen/article34435049.ece
29 April 2021||CHENNAI,||‘Allow free movement of aviation staff’||In view of the COVID-19 lockdown in various States, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has called for the free movement of aviation staff heading to their workplaces. In a note to the Chief Secretaries of all States, except Maharashtra where suitable orders were issued, the Ministry’s Joint Secretary, Usha Padhee, said considering the prevailing pandemic situation, various State governments had come out with State-specific guidelines on lockdowns and definitions of exempted/essential services. “You will agree that air transportation is an essential service for movement of people in need as well as for cargo. However, it is observed that in few States, the employees involved in aviation and related services are facing problems in reaching their workplaces,” she said. The Joint Secretary urged the States to issue necessary instructions and ensure the free movement of persons connected with aviation and its related services, including airlines, airports, maintenance, cargo, ground services, fuelling, security, catering, etc. In Tamil Nadu, police officers said there was no bar on employees of the aviation industry and related services travelling to airports. Possession of photo identity cards issued by the competent authority was sufficient to permit them to travel during the full or partial lockdown. After the Ministry opened the domestic operations in a calibrated manner post lockdown and increased the lower band of dates on all sectors by 5%, the number of passengers carried by domestic airlines in January-February 2021 stood at 1.55 crore, which was a drop by 38.13% compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/allow-free-movement-of-aviation-staff/article34435015.ece
29 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Maruti Suzuki to make oxygen available for medical needs||Maruti Suzuki on Wednesday said it would advance its bi-annual maintenance by a month and shut down factories in Haryana to make oxygen available for medical needs. A similar decision was taken by its parent company which owns the Suzuki Motor plant in Gujarat. Saving lives “In the current situation, we believe that all available oxygen should be used to save lives. Accordingly, Maruti Suzuki has decided to advance its maintenance shutdown, originally scheduled for June, to May 1 to 9. Production in all factories will close for maintenance during this period. The company has been informed that Suzuki Motor Gujarat has taken the same decision for its factory,” it said in a statement. Hyundai Motor India Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Hyundai Motor India, announced a relief package of Rs. 20 crore for measures, including deploying multiple oxygen generation plants in hospitals across Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. The Foundation will also set up medicare facilities, infrastructure and provide support staff for immediate relief in collaboration with the State governments and hospitals. Paytm reaches out Separately, home grown start-up Paytm said it was set to airlift 21,000 oxygen concentrators which were expected to reach India in the first week of May. Paytm said it had received a contribution of Rs. 5 crore from citizens, which it matched to take the total contribution to Rs. 10 crore. “These devices would be immediately sent to government hospitals, COVID care facilities, private hospitals, nursing homes as well as Resident Welfare Associations,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maruti-suzuki-to-make-oxygen-available-for-medical-needs/article34435046.ece
29 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Driven from hospital to hospital, a young life is lost||Sheikh Reshma, a 24-year-old PG student, began coughing in the morning at her home at Namdevwada in Nizamabad on Tuesday. Her parents Razzaq and Fatima did not think much of it. But by afternoon, the cough became intense and she was taken to the Nizamabad Government Hospital at 4 p.m. “A rapid antigen test came out negative. The doctors told us to take her home,” says M. Prashant, who helped the family. The family got a CT scan at the hospital and showed it to a private practitioner, who diagnosed serious damage to the lungs, suggestive of COVID-19. But the Nizamabad hospital refused to admit her. “By 9 p.m., she had difficulty breathing and we hired an ambulance with oxygen and started towards Hyderabad to admit her in a government hospital,” Mr. Prashant says. At 10.15 p.m., with the ambulance speeding towards Hyderabad, the family sent out a tweet tagging IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao, the Health Minister and the MLC of Nizamabad: “Any leads. No ventilator beds vacant in govt. hospitals in Hyd. Her condition is serious. Shifting from Nzb to Hyd.” The family reached the gates of the Osmania Hospital at 10.50 p.m. where they were told there was an oxygen bed available. After a 20-minute wait, the hospital staff said there were no vacancies, and they should try at the Gandhi General Hospital. At 11.40 p.m. the ambulance reached the GGH. But after a 20-minute wait, the family was told there was no vacancy. At 12.20 a.m., the ambulance raced to the Fever Hospital with Ms. Reshma struggling to breathe. The family was told there were no beds, and they should try the TIMS in Gachibowli. At 1.12 a.m. when the ambulance reached the TIMS, Ms. Reshma breathed her last.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/driven-from-hospital-to-hospital-a-young-life-lost/article34435055.ece
29 April 2021||New Delhi,||10,787 ventilators installed: govt.||The Union Home Ministry claimed in an affidavit in the Supreme Court on Tuesday that since October 2020 as many as 10,787 ventilators have been installed in various hospitals across the country.  The Ministry said that post-April 1, following requests by the State governments, 3,835 additional ventilators had been dispatched. It said that in April, “oxygen concentrators received in donation from other sources” had also been given to the States. The Ministry said the machines were purchased by the Union Health Ministry and there was no mention in the affidavit if they were procured from the PM-CARES fund. The Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund was created on March 27, 2020. Though the government has claimed that it is a “public charitable trust,” it is not subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General or answerable under the Right to Information Act (RTI). In a statement on May 13, 2020, the Prime Minister’s Office said PM-CARES would allocate Rs. 3,100 crore for COVID-19 relief, including funds for ventilators, migrant workers and vaccine development. On March 12, the Union Health Ministry told the Lok Sabha that till March 5, as many as 35,269 out of 38,867 ventilators were installed and the “total amount incurred by the government for procurement” was Rs. 1,850.76 crore. The affidavit also said that India has only 1,224 oxygen tankers with a capacity of 16,732 MT and that is being increased to 2,000 by converting 600 nitrogen and argon tankers to transport oxygen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/10787-ventilators-installed-since-oct-2020/article34435044.ece
29 April 2021||Chennai,||Career guidance series for students||The SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST) in association with The Hindu Group has launched a 15-part webinar series that spotlights science and technology courses and their relevance to the 2020s workplace. Called ‘SRM Virtual Conclave for Career Guidance 2021’ (May 8 to June 6), the series is offered free to all (registration via bit.ly/SRMISTTH). Experts representing industry and academia will handle the 15 sessions, primarily meant to assist students from Classes 9 to 12 choose streams that resonate better with the evolving requirements of the industry. C. Muthamizhchelvan, Vice-Chancellor (Interim), SRMIST, said the exercise would help school students and their parents make the right education choices, amid the pandemic-induced challenges. He pointed out that “there are enormous opportunities available in core and allied engineering programmes” and not only in computer science programmes. “There are also opportunities for students to have a major degree and a minor certification. For example, a student can have a mechanical engineering degree and a minor certification in artificial intelligence or data science.” He underlined that this exercise was aligned with other thriving initiatives at SRMIST, including a Career Guidance Cell; an SRM Innovation and Incubation Centre that encourages product development among students; and an Idea Cell that invites problems from students across disciplines to be solved by student teams. Underlining how SRMIST offered scholarships to students from rural and semi-urban geographies, Mr. Muthamizhchelvan said the webinar series would have Dr. T.R. Paarivendhar Scholarships awarded to a deserving student from such areas in each of the four zones. Besides, Dr. T. R. Paarivendhar Recognition Awards of Excellence will go to institutes and individuals for exemplary career guidance to students from rural areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/virtual-career-guidance-conclave-for-students/article34435008.ece
29 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Shift journalist Kappan to a hospital in Delhi: SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Uttar Pradesh government to shift journalist Siddique Kappan to a hospital in Delhi, like the Ram Manohar Lohia or the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). A Bench of Chief Justice N.V. Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and A.S. Bopanna directed Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the State, to shift Mr. Kappan to a Delhi hospital for “proper medical treatment”. The order came despite serious objections raised by Mr. Mehta on behalf of the State. Mr. Mehta said Mr. Kappan was found COVID-19 negative in a RT-PCR test and he could not be singled out among other inmates for treatment in a hospital in Delhi. Mr. Mehta said he could be kept in a hospital in Mathura. The Bench said the State had an obligation to protect the health of an individual. It said it was not going into anything except that Mr. Kappan received medical treatment at a hospital outside U.P. Once he was of sound health, he would be brought back to Mathura jail, from where he could take appropriate measures for relief in accordance with the law, the Bench noted. On Tuesday, the court had asked the State to submit the medical records of Mr. Kappan, who was arrested last year en route to Hathras where a young Dalit woman had died after she was allegedly gang-raped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/shift-journalist-kappan-to-a-hospital-in-delhi-sc-tells-up/article34435010.ece
29 April 2021||New Delhi,||Dead candidate’s wife files case against ECI official||In a first, the widow of Trinamool Congress candidate Kajal Sinha, who recently died of COVID-19, has filed a case of culpable homicide against Sudip Jain, Deputy Election Commissioner in-charge of West Bengal, accusing the Election Commission of India (ECI) of “deliberate and intentional omission” leading to her husband’s death. Sinha was the Trinamool’s candidate from the Khardaha Assembly constituency, which went to the polls in the sixth phase of the ongoing West Bengal Assembly election on April 22. He died three days after voting for his seat was held on April 25. Other than Sinha, three other candidates died during the prolonged election campaign in the State. Two candidates were from the Jangipur constituency — the Revolutionary Socialist Party’s Pradip Nandi and the Congress’ Rezaul Haque. Samir Ghosh, an independent candidate from the Baisnabnagar Assembly constituency, also succumbed to COVID-19. In her complaint, Nandita Sinha said the ECI had shown “complete unpreparedness, negligence, lack of accountability and utmost disregard towards the lives of the common people”. West Bengal alone, she said, had 95,000 COVID-19 cases and the ECI had decided to conduct the election over eight phases spanning over 33 days, despite the already precarious situation in the rest of the country. “It has malignantly chosen to continue with the eight phases of the election despite having reason to believe that the infection would spread at an alarming rate, causing widespread death across West Bengal and the nation,” she said. She also accused the ECI of “intentionally” not taking any steps to ensure that COVID-19 protocols were followed at public rallies. She pointed out that on April 16, days before her husband contracted COVID-19, the Trinamool Congress had written to the ECI, warning the election body about the massive flare-up in COVID-19 cases, and requested it to club the remaining three (sixth, seventh and eighth) phases of the election. The ECI, she said, “frivolously applied its illusory and cosmetic safeguards” in the form of prohibition of campaign after 7 p.m., and extended the silent period of no campaigning prior to polling from 24 hours to 72 hours. The Trinamool Congress wrote again to the ECI on April 22 to say that these provisions were not enough to control the situation, reiterating its demand to club the remaining phases. “Despite continuous alarms raised by the Hon’ble High Court at Calcutta, TMC and other stakeholders including the media, The EC has deliberately ignored all evidences of the impending catastrophe, turned a blind eye towards ensuring compliance of COVID-related protocols and chosen to continue with its elaborate eight phased polls in the State of West Bengal, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people, including my husband,” Ms. Sinha said in her complaint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dead-candidates-wife-files-case-against-eci-official/article34435014.ece

Though the drug has not been proven to confer significant benefits on those severely afflicted by the virus, it is prescribed by doctors to reduce inflammation that results from a cytokine storm. The drug went out of stock in the last few weeks and has been replenished in limited quantities, the Health Ministry said. Maharashtra has been allotted the highest quantity, 800, followed by Delhi at 500. Most States have got between 25 and 200 units of the drug. The States will distribute them to government and private hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-allots-fresh-stock-of-tocilizumab-to-states/article34435658.ece

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||SII cuts Covishield price for the States to Rs. 300||Following the criticism, the SII had stated last week that Covishield remained “the most affordable COVID-19 vaccine available in the market today”. “The initial prices were kept very low globally as it was based on advance funding given by those countries for at-risk vaccine manufacturing. The initial supply price of Covishield for all government immunisation programmes, including in India, has been the lowest,” the SII had said in a statement. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said on Wednesday that despite the Centre announcing the third phase of vaccination from May 1, it would not be possible to begin inoculations on that date as the only two indigenous producers — SII and Bharat Biotech — could not supply the requisite doses. Mr. Tope further said that the SII had only given a verbal promise of supplying one crore vaccines a month to the Maharashtra government and that a written assurance was pending. Accordingly, the Maharashtra Cabinet had taken the decision to import vaccines to meet its required quantity of an estimated 12 crore doses in order to inoculate 5.71 crore citizens between 18-44 years for the third phase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sii-cuts-covishield-price-for-the-states-to-rs-300/article34435028.ece

Reports abounded of the CoWIN website remaining inaccessible. However, towards later in the evening more reported as being able to register but unable to get an appointment. The common message was that hospitals were only offering appointments on various dates for those over 45. An exception was Sanket Vijayasarathy, 29, a technology journalist based in South Delhi, who told The Hindu that he had got an appointment for a first dose of the Covishield vaccine. “I tried online at a few hospitals in my pin code but didn’t succeed. But when I attempted another place, at Hope Clinic, South Delhi, it showed me an available slot.” He added that he was not asked to pay. The Hindu verified his appointment form, “When I tried for a friend, I couldn’t get another,” he said. So far, Delhi, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have said that they have ordered batches of Covaxin and Covishield. Close to 20 States have said they will be offering the vaccine free to their residents. Though vaccines for those below 45 can only be availed at private COVID-19 centres on payment, States and Union Territories can decide to vaccinate those below 45 from their quotas negotiated with companies by setting minimum age eligibility criteria. Only 1.8 million doses were administered on Wednesday, a far cry from the 4.5 million peak on April 5. India has so far administered at least 145 million doses, and less than 10% of the country has been fully vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-registrations-begin-for-those-above-18/article34435029.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||New Act gives more powers to Delhi L-G||The move comes a day after the Delhi High Court cautioned the Delhi government to put its “house in order” over the issue of inadequate oxygen supply in the city, adding that the Centre would be asked to take over if it could not manage the situation. Coming as the development does in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Act is expected to trigger another round of confrontation between the L-G and the Delhi government under the AAP. The Act defines the responsibilities of the elected government and the L-G along with the “constitutional scheme of governance of the NCT” interpreted by the Supreme Court in recent judgements regarding the division of powers between the two entities. It will also seek to ensure that the L-G is “necessarily granted an opportunity” to exercise powers entrusted to him under proviso to clause (4) of Article 239AA of the Constitution. This particular clause provides for a Council of Ministers headed by a Chief Minister for the NCT to “aid and advise the Lieutenant Governor” in the exercise of his functions for matters in which the Legislative Assembly has the power to make laws. It will also provide for rules made by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi to be “consistent with the rules of the House of the People” or the Lok Sabha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-act-gives-more-powers-to-delhi-l-g/article34435031.ece

District Medical Officer R. Tatan attributed the faux pas to a clerical error and said officials with the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project have been asked to conduct a re-test on the 11. The error was made on April 26. “Action will be taken against those responsible for the error, but people need to cooperate at the testing centres too. They are so impatient that they start pushing and shoving instead of waiting for their turn,” he told journalists in the district headquarters of Roing. Dr. Tatan said the error could have occurred due to pressure on the staff, causing loss of concentration. He added that the district police must strengthen the security at the testing centre at the entry point to control the crowd that “should ideally follow the COVID-19 protocols”.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Divine will prevails||The Purana and the Itihasa stories reflect the truth that the events in the lives of individuals are governed by Divine Will and that destiny’s sway cannot be ignored. For instance, in the Valmiki Ramayana, it is said that Dasaratha reigned over Ayodhya for 60,000 years, but that he had remained childless until then. Then one day, he gets this idea that by performing Aswamedha and Putrakameshti yagnas, he might be blessed with progeny. He then consults with Vasishta, the purohits and others about this proposal. It may be asked, why he did not get this idea earlier. The only answer can be that things take place according to what is destined in each one’s life at the appropriate time in the way it has to happen, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. Another interesting fact is also revealed at this juncture. Sumantra, who has been the counsellor for the kings since the time of Ikshvaku, recalls an incident from the past that had taken place in Krita Yuga. At that time Sanatkumara had foretold that Dasaratha would perform a Putrakameshti yaga to beget a son. Sanatkumara had also said sage Rishyasringa would be invited by Dasaratha to conduct the yagna after which Rama would be born. More astonishing is the fact that the wise sage Vasishta, a Tri-Kala-Jnani , is aware of these issues, but has never talked of all this to Dasaratha. The sensible approach is to bide by the course as destined. Any interference would be as foolish as killing the goose that lays golden eggs. Dasaratha’s yagnas coincide with the happenings in the celestial world when Brahma, Indra and others seek surrender at the Lord’s feet with the prayer to put an end to Ravana’s atrocities. Then the Lord decides that Dasaratha would be His father and He incarnates as Rama in human form.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/divine-will-prevails/article34435050.ece

29 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Only hospitals treating the poor are entitled to tax breaks: HC||The Madras High Court on Wednesday ruled that exemption from payment of property tax, water tax, sewerage charges and the like must be given only to institutions which predominantly serve the poor and not to hospitals which predominantly provide their services to the rich and affluent on collection of hefty amounts of money. The court held that only a hospital which provides free access to the poor and does not deny admission to them could be termed as a charitable institution. Justice S.M. Subramaniam passed the ruling while dismissing two writ petitions filed by Sundaram Medical Foundation, which runs Dr. Rangarajan Memorial Hospital on 2,542 sq m of land allotted to it by the State government at Shanthi Colony in Anna Nagar in April 1992. The present petitions had been filed in 2018 against demand for property tax and other charges by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and the Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB). The judge said the institution was started with the avowed object of offering services free of cost to the poor and at concessional rates to others. However, now, it had turned into a super speciality hospital and an inspection by the GCC officials found that the hospital was charging equivalent to other private hospitals in the city. The Corporation also claimed that the hospital itself admitted that it was providing its services free of cost only to 15% of the patients. After recording the submission, the judge said an institution which was charging heavy amount of money from 85% of its patients could not be termed as a charitable institution entitled to tax exemptions. ‘An exception’ “Payment of property tax is the law… Application for exemption is a right. Granting exemption is a concession and grant of exemption must be an exception. Such grant of exemption should also be strictly in consonance with the provisions of the statutes,” he observed. Justice Subramaniam went on to state: “We, the people of India, are generous in recognising and appreciating charitable institutions. However, for the purpose of granting exemption from payment of tax, charity should be established to such an extent so as to form an opinion that the access to the poor, needy and deserving for treatment are not only provided but they are allowed to get admission without any restrictions or hindrance.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-hospitals-treating-the-poor-are-entitled-to-tax-breaks-hc/article34435693.ece

29 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Looting in the name of vaccines is the worst tragedy’||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday said looting people in the name of differential pricing of vaccines was the worst tragedy. He said the Centre’s and the AIADMK government’s failure to contain the first wave of COVID-19 and learn a lesson from it had resulted in the second wave. In a video message, “Let us save us and the country”, he said the two governments had committed a big mistake. “They did not take any precautions in the period between the first and the second waves. We are witnessing the consequences now,” he said. Even though the Parliament Standing Committee warned about an oxygen shortage in November, the Centre did not pay attention. The report was submitted in the Lok Sabha on February 2. “Vaccines and Remdesivir were exported even when the second wave was surging. Above all, the country sold oxygen to foreign countries. This looting, in the name of vaccines, is the worst tragedy,” he said. He recalled the Delhi High Court’s observation that the government could take over factories that refused to supply oxygen. It was not fair to increase the prices of vaccines and fix different prices for the Centre, the States and private hospitals. “While the BJP government propounds the idea of one nation, one ration card, one tax, one market, one food, one religion and one language, the country has three different prices for life-saving drugs,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the Prime Minister should implement a free vaccination scheme for all. “Tamil Nadu is able to cope with the situation because of its medical infrastructure. But the AIADMK government is not able to utilise it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/looting-in-the-name-of-vaccines-is-the-worst-tragedy/article34435210.ece
29 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Schools planning to juggle two batches of Class 12 students||The postponement of the Class 12 board exams across CBSE and State Board schools has meant that most private schools in the city have a unique challenge now with two batches of students in Class 12. While one batch is waiting to take up the board exams, the other set of students are those who have just moved up from Class 11. In such a scenario, many schools have started online classes for the new batch of Class 12 students. “We will first be taking online classes for the new batch and have given the old batch a break of around 10 to 12 days. When we start revision classes for them, it will be in the form of small capsule sessions and tests so they do not get overwhelmed by preparing over and over again for the exams,” said Lakshmi Prabha, principal, Prasan Vidya Mandir. As Ms. Prabha said, the focus for most schools has also been on ensuring that students who are to take up their board exams do not get bored or overwhelmed during the time they now have. “Beginning a revision early might not work well for these students, so we have planned to wait till the new board examination dates are announced to get the students ready for the same. The students are now free to study at their own pace and prepare for entrance exams,” said K. Vasudevan, chairman, Prince Matriculation Higher Secondary School. For the fresh batch of students, Mr. Vasudevan said they would soon commence online classes after a 15-day summer break. Both the CBSE and State Board have said a decision was expected to be taken about a fresh schedule for the board exams only in June and that students would be given a notice of at least 15 days before the exams begin. K.R. Maalathi, founder, Auuro Educational Services, said it was important for schools to also take note of the additional pressure that teachers and students were under given how the schedules have extended this academic year. “While students who are to take the boards might continue to require guidance and revision, schools should also consciously take a decision to give other senior students a break of at least three to four weeks, as a sort of digital detox,” she said. Keeping their teachers in mind, Ms. Prabha said they drew up their schedule for both batches of Class 12 in such a way that the teachers too would work in batches and be able to take a break in-between.  We will first be taking online classes for the new batch and have given the old batch a break of around 10 to 12 days Lakshmi Prabha Principal, Prasan Vidya Mandir||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-planning-to-juggle-two-batches-of-class-12-students/article34435891.ece
29 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Work on Thirumudivakkam bridge nearing completion||Work on the bridge across the surplus channel of the tank at Thirumudivakkam is nearing completion. The water course cuts across the Pallavaram-Thiruneermalai-Thirumudivakkam Road. “It was a pipe culvert earlier and the stretch was flooded in 2015 and 2017 since the culvert could not carry the excess water, which is why we have converted it into a minor bridge with six spans. This will allow a two-way traffic,” said a source in the Highways Department, which took up the work with an estimate of Rs. 1.8 crore. Although the work began in 2020, lockdown delayed the project. “We have already allowed two-way traffic on the side that has been completed. The last span is to be taken up shortly. It is likely to take a month to finish the work,” said an engineer associated with the project.  Since the bridge connects the Thirumudivakkam industrial estate and is near the Chennai Outer Ring Road, it witnesses high traffic. Around 20,000 passenger car units use the stretch making it imperative for the upgradation from a small pipe culvert. K. Sundar of Pallavaram said that it was good to see the bridge getting completed. He said that lighting in the locality, especially the roads that connected the ORR, needed to be improved. The department was finishing work on another minor bridge at Balaji Nagar on the Tambaram-Velachery Road. The cost of the work, which would allow excess rainwater to be drained into the Pallikaranai Marsh, was estimated to be Rs. 2 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/work-on-thirumudivakkam-bridge-nearing-completion/article34435889.ece
29 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||One more counter opened at KMC to supply Remdesivir||The Government Kilpauk Medical College will operate two counters to sell Remdesivir, according to hospital Dean P. Vasanthamani. On Monday, the State Health Department launched a counter at KMC to sell the drug. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation set up a counter after people complained of the steep price of the injection in the open market. The drug is administered to people who are on oxygen support. Some people had complained that the drug had to be procured from other States and it was priced as much as Rs. 20,000. The government sold the drug at Rs. 1,560 per pack. The rush for the drug was heavy even on the first day. People are issued tokens and wait their turn to get the medicine. The rush only increased subsequently. On Wednesday a man said his brother had been waiting in the queue since morning. “The queue is not moving at all. There are around 500 people in the queue and it takes forever to dispense the medicine. Why can’t the government have five more counters? These people are potential carriers of the infection as they are buying the medicine for their sick relatives,” he said. Dr. Vasanthamani said two counters would operate from the medical college from Thursday. The announcement did not come as much of a relief as some said even on Wednesday many people were disappointed as there was no stock.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/one-more-counter-opened-at-kmc-to-sell-remdesivir/article34435679.ece

29 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Poor response to portability of ration cards||Tamil Nadu, which is implementing the One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme, seems to be an outlier when it comes to the execution of the initiative aimed at achieving “seamless intra-State and inter-State portability” of ration cards. Ever since the State joined the scheme on October 1 last year, it has been recording lesser transactions than other States. Only a negligible number of transactions is being recorded. Consequently, an insignificant quantity of foodgrains (rice or wheat) is being distributed through the public distribution system. One of the key features of the scheme is ensuring that migrant workers can claim their quota of rations from anywhere in the country without disturbing the entitlements due to their family members residing in their native places. The Central government, in May last year, made the ONORC’s implementation a condition to be fulfilled by the States for making use of the additional borrowing of 0.25% of GSDP. The Tamil Nadu government has allowed families migrating to the State to receive their entitlements at prices determined by the Centre at the fair price shops concerned. Several reasons are cited for the poor response to the scheme. A senior official of the State Civil Supplies Department says inter-State migrant workers prefer obtaining fresh ration cards from the State Department to getting their original cards transferred to Tamil Nadu. This is because of better benefits being provided by the Tamil Nadu government when compared to their home States. In Tamil Nadu, edible oil and tur dal  are being supplied to ration cardholders, along with rice or wheat and sugar. But under the ONORC scheme, only rice or wheat and sugar are covered. While 5 kg rice or wheat per month per person, at Rs. 2 per kg for wheat or Rs. 3 per kg for rice, would be given only to those holding priority household (PHH) cards, Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) cardholders, representing the “poorest of the poor”, would also get sugar at the price stipulated by the Central government, apart from rice or wheat. The official explains that the authorities also cannot refuse to issue ration cards to the migrant workers who, using their Aadhaar numbers, first get cooking gas cylinder connections in the State. One of the requisites to obtain a ration card is that the applicant must have a cooking gas cylinder connection, the official says, adding that the card is issued before an inspection of the place of stay of the applicant by the department’s staff. The unwillingness of migrants to make use of the scheme and procedural hassles are also cited as reasons for the perceptibly low number of transactions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poor-response-to-portability-of-ration-cards/article34435219.ece

Action taken reports would be submitted to the Commissioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/complaint-boxes-for-women-police-launched/article34435682.ece
29 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Judge wants to learn about same sex relationships before penning judgment||In an unprecedented move, a judge of the Madras High Court has decided to undergo psychoeducation before penning a judgment on same sex relationships. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh felt the words on the subject should come from his heart and not from his head. Therefore, he requested a psychologist to give him an appointment so that the professional could help him understand such relationships and pave the way for “his evolution”. Passing interim orders on a petition filed by two young women with same sex orientation, the judge, on Wednesday, said, “Insofar as the request made by the learned counsel S. Manuraj, for the petitioners, to set out guidelines in cases of this nature is concerned, I want to give myself some more time to churn. Ultimately in this case, the words must come from my heart and not from my head, and the same will not be possible if I am not fully woke on this aspect.” Hence, he wanted to subject himself to psychoeducation with Vidhya Dinakaran, a psychologist. “If I write an order after undergoing psychoeducation, I trust that the words will fall from my heart.” The two women graduates from Madurai had approached the High Court last month fearing threat to their lives from their parents. They had fled home, taken refuge with a non-governmental organisation in Chennai and were looking for jobs. After holding in-camera proceedings with them and their parents, the judge found that they all required counselling by a psychologist and accordingly asked them to attend a session with Ms. Dinakaran. After the first round of counselling, the psychologist submitted a report on Wednesday, stating that the petitioners perfectly understand the relationship between them and had absolutely no confusion in their minds. After taking the report on file, the judge said the parents could not be expected to change their notions overnight. Therefore, he directed them to attend one more counselling session before the case could be heard next on June 7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/judge-wants-to-learn-about-same-sex-relationships-before-penning-judgment/article34435695.ece

Police identified the victim as Kovilraj, 25, from Cholan Nagar in Mangadu. He was staying with his brothers — Madhanraj, 27, and Michaelraj, 28 — and mother Sarala, 71. On Tuesday, the elder brothers informed their mother and neighbours that Kovilraj was found dead on his bed. They attributed it to his drinking habits and said he had suffered cardiac arrest. While they buried the body the same evening, Kovilraj’s friends complained to the police suspecting foul play. The police interrogated the brothers, who allegedly confessed that they smothered Kovilraj to death. The family members were upset by Kovilraj’s behaviour and a fight erupted on Tuesday, which lead to them killing him and passing it off as cardiac arrest. The duo was arrested and remanded in judicial custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-held-for-murdering-their-younger-brother-in-mangadu/article34435677.ece
29 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CIBA releases first indigenous vaccine for fish||The Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA) in Chennai has developed an indigenous vaccine for viral nervous necrosis (VNN) affecting several fish species. Dr. M. Makesh, principal investigator of the project, said VNN is a serious viral disease affecting many marine, brackishwater and freshwater fishes resulting in 100% mortality in larval and early juvenile stages. The disease is caused by nervous necrosis virus (NNV). “Red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) is the only genotype prevalent in India and most other tropical countries. Infected adults remain as carriers and transmit the virus to offspring through eggs,” Dr. Makesh said. The practical way to control the disease and prevent vertical transmission is to vaccinate fingerlings and adult fish. The new vaccine, Nodavac-R, developed by CIBA can be injected to fingerlings. The vaccine is safe and efficacious and can be used in all species susceptible to VNN such as milkfish, grey mullet, mangrove red snapper etc, he said. K. K. Vijayan, Director, ICAR-CIBA, said it was the first vaccine to be released for aquaculture in India and it would prevent VNN in fish hatcheries and bring down the incidence of VNN in grow-out farms. Dr. J.K. Jena, Deputy Director General (Fisheries), Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), released the vaccine, in the presence of Dr. S. K. Chaudhari, Deputy Director General (NRM), ICAR, and Dr. V. K. Singh, Director, ICAR-CRIDA, in a virtual event held on April 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/first-indigenous-vaccine-for-fish-released/article34435231.ece
29 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Veteran writer Pe. Su. Mani no more||Pe. Su. Mani, Tamil writer-historian, died on Tuesday evening at his residence in New Delhi after a brief illness. He was 87. He is survived by two daughters. His wife died in 2017. Born on November 2, 1933, in Pennathur of Tiruvannamalai district, Mani had a modest academic background and did not pursue beyond school education. He had worked in the postal department and retired as a supervisor. In his youth, he got attracted to eminent Tamil scholars Ve. Swaminatha Sarma, an author of a number of Tamil works on European social and political philosophers, and M. P. Sivagnanam (also known as Ma. Po. Si.), who ran a political group, ‘Tamilarasu Kazhagam’. He had worked as a leader of the group’s West Mambalam unit in Chennai. After realising that Tamil Nadu’s contribution to the freedom struggle had not been given the attention it deserved, Mani took to writing biographies of a number of nationalists hailing from the State, such as G. Subramania Iyer, V.V.S. Iyer and P. Varadarajulu Naidu.  The writer, who visited Sri Lanka thrice in the 1990s on the invitation of the government and the Ramakrishna Math, wrote a book on the history of the math in the neighbouring country. He also wrote in detail about rare journals of the 19th century. He was a recipient of several awards. In 2001, he received the Bharati award, instituted by the State government. Three of his works, including those on Subramania Bharati, Subramania Siva and Ramakrishna Paramhamsa, bagged the awards. Thiruppur Krishnan, editor of a Tamil journal, ‘Amudhasurabi’, observes that Mani specialised in three broad areas — history of the freedom struggle, spiritualism, and Bharati. Pointing out that he followed the idea of nationalism propounded by Ma.Po.Si., former head of Tamil Department at the University of Madras, V. Arasu describes Mani’s book on Brahma Samaj as an important work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/veteran-writer-pe-su-mani-no-more/article34435160.ece

Baskaran as the chairman of Tamil Nadu State Human Rights Commission (SHRC). The court held that the petition was utterly misconceived, and judicial time could not be wasted any further on adjudicating upon the case filed against the appointment. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy rejected the contention of the PIL petitioner S. Logeshwar of Chennai that there was lack of transparency in appointment since the vacancy was not advertised and applications were not called for from eligible candidates. The judges pointed out that the statute does not require any advertisement since only sitting or retired judges could be appointed. The first Division Bench also pointed out that the selection was made by a committee chaired by the Chief Minister and comprising of the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the Leader of the Opposition, the Home Minister and others. “As long as the appointee fulfils the eligibility criteria, that would suffice. This is because, unlike ordinary appointments, these are crucial posts where appointments are primarily made by invitation,” the Bench said. The Bench, concurred with the submissions of Advocate General Vijay Narayan, and went on to state: “The Selection Committee may discuss such names as they may choose and even if there is no advertisement issued, the process cannot be flawed. From the counter affidavit of the State, it appears that the selection was made from a list of two retired Chief Justices and 39 retired Judges of this Court, all of whom fulfilled the eligibility criteria.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/case-against-appointment-of-shrc-chief-dismissed/article34435159.ece

29 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. teachers can now work from home||The School Education Department has said that teachers of government and government-aided schools will not have to come to the campuses from May 1. While they wait for an announcement to be made about the board exam schedule for Class 12 students, teachers could work from their homes and guide the students, a circular from S. Kannappan, Director, School Education Department, said. The circular further said teachers handling other classes could help those students with regard to the bridge courses being telecast on Kalvi TV and related resources, by reaching out to them through WhatsApp, phone calls or other digital and alternate modes from home. For students of other classes, the Department is attempting to bridge the learning gap through bridge courses that are being telecast on Kalvi TV. It had distributed resources, such as workbooks, for the same. To prepare schools for the next academic year and to discuss the learning levels of the students, Mr. Kannappan said that the teachers might be expected to come to school towards the end of May, and separate instructions for the same would be issued later.

Ramadoss on Wednesday said that Remdesivir, a drug used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, should be made available even in the districts as it is becoming difficult to source it for patients. In a statement, he said the price of Remdesivir drug had gone up many times because of increase in demand. “After Central government intervention, the price of the drug, which was selling at Rs. 5,400, has been fixed between Rs. 899 and Rs. 3,490. The drug was sold in the black market anywhere between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 25,000,” said Dr. Ramadoss. He said in Kilpauk Medical College, people had to stand in queues for a long time to buy the drug. “Six doses of Remdesivir are being sold at Rs. 9,400. Those in need of it appreciated this move. But many also complained that they had to stand in queue for 20 hours,” he said. Dr. Ramadoss said many in districts had to travel long distances to buy the medicines. “The government should take efforts to sell the drug in district headquarters through the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation offices. It should also increase vaccination centres to manage the crowds after May 1 when vaccination will be open to all above 18 years of age,” he said.  After Central government intervention, the price of the drug, which was selling at Rs. 5,400, has been fixed between Rs. 899 and Rs. 3,490||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ramadoss-plea-to-govt/article34435824.ece

Sources in the civic body said the tender was for developing that stretch of the canal between the Mettupalayam Road and Avinashi Road, which would be the first phase. First phase The project cost for the first phase was around Rs. 40 crore, which the civic body had sought from the Directorate of Town and Country Planning under the Infrastructure and Amenities Fund. The corporation would in the next few days open the tender, scrutinise the bids and award the contract to the lowest bidder to develop the road along the canal. As a part of the project, the corporation would also look at removing encroachments along the canal banks and that included shifting people who had built their houses. It had a resettlement plan for such people. The corporation had in the past few years proposed the canal development project, which the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had announced as a part of the special package for the Coimbatore Corporation. Thereafter, the corporation prepared a detailed project report for developing the stretch of the canal from Mettupalayam Road to Trichy Road – 11.50 km – for Rs. 575 crore. It was to develop the road in phases. The proposal also found a mention in the corporation budget for three successive years. As a part of the proposal, the civic body had also proposed bicycling and walking tracks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-floats-tender-for-laying-road-along-sanganoor-canal/article34435699.ece
29 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Private hospitals bear the brunt of vaccine shortage||Many private hospitals in Coimbatore have complained of shortage of COVID-19 vaccines as they are unable to administer doses to people who come for first and second jabs alike. Some hospitals had to send back people who had come from faraway places after making registrations through the CoWIN portal. One of the directors of a private hospital told The Hindu that it was unable to give first and second shots to people who came for vaccination on Wednesday. “We had to return people who took the first dose of Covaxin from our centre and came for the second shot on Wednesday due to lack of supply. Covishield also ran out of stock. The Health Department is not giving clear information regarding the supply due to which we are unable to give assurance to people,” said the director-cum-doctor. He added that if the shortage of supply persists, the crisis will escalate from May 1 when vaccine rollout for all aged above 18 starts. An administrative official from a private hospital in Coimbatore said that private hospitals were not getting proper communication about the registrations done through CoWIN portal. “People come to private vaccination centres after making registration through the CoWIN portal. However, the centres are not getting details of the registrations from the central portal. The portal allows registration for vaccination from a centre when it is not having vaccine stock. We had to send back people who had come from faraway places,” said the official. According to the official, the hospital had returned vaccine doses to the Health Department after it demanded and they were not allotted again. “We are having minimal stock. We have not been informed about the next allotment though we are constantly contacting the Health Department,” said a spokesperson of another hospital. An official in the know of vaccine supply in Coimbatore district said that the stock at the main walk-in cooler of the Health Department was minimal. He added that all the districts in the State were in the wait for adequate stock of vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-hospitals-bear-the-brunt-of-vaccine-shortage/article34435256.ece
29 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Mismatches crop up in COVID-19 deaths data in Coimbatore district||In what appears to be a glimpse of possible irregularities in the data related to COVID-19 cases across the State, glaring mismatches have cropped up in the death toll in Coimbatore district. Cross-checking of COVID-19 related data shared by the district administration with the data shared by the State Health Department in the daily bulletin have shown mismatches in death toll. It was also found that the media bulletin has been listing COVID-19 deaths days after their actual dates. As per the daily statement issued by the District Public Relations Office (DPRO), four people died of COVID-19 in Coimbatore district between April 20 and 26. However, the bulletin issued by the Health Department reported eight COVID-19 deaths (all at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital). According to district administration, a total of 46 private healthcare facilities, two government medical colleges, including CMCH, and government hospitals are treating COVID-19 patients in the district. On several days, the DPRO release did not list any COVID-19 deaths whereas the Health Department bulletin reported deaths due to the disease at CMCH alone. Similarly, when the DPRO release listed three deaths on April 26, the Health Department reported only one death, that too on Tuesday’s bulletin. The man had died of the disease at CMCH at 5.30 a.m. on April 26. Late reporting of deaths by the Health Department in its bulletins was evident as a death reported at CMCH on April 21 was listed on April 26. The district’s total death toll was also different in DPRO release (717) and in the bulletin (719). A health official said the deaths are reported late in the bulletin due to the time taken for verification. Also, deaths that occur after preparing the DPRO release and the report which is sent to Chennai for bulletin in the evening are reflected in the coming days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mismatches-crop-up-in-covid-19-deaths-data-in-coimbatore-district/article34435703.ece

The State Government had a few days ago banned the eateries and tea stalls from serving customers within their premises. In a release issued here on Wednesday, the corporation said if its officers found a gathering of customers or violation of COVID-19 safety guidelines, it would not hesitate to close those establishments and that included bakeries, tea stalls and eateries. It had also said that it would close down weekly markets or markets near places with a high number of COVID-19 positive cases, if its officers found the markets to be crowded. Likewise, the corporation would also place sheets to barricade houses with positive persons if the residents were found violating the COVID-19 safety guidelines. And, on streets with three or more positive houses, the civic body would barricade the entire street, the release said. It also appealed to the people to follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, get vaccinated and help control the infection spread.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eateries-tea-stalls-warned-against-flouting-norms/article34435268.ece
29 April 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Couple’s gift is a ‘fan moment’ for Kovai||When some give, they prefer to do it anonymously. A couple called on authorities of the Government Medical College and ESI Hospital, Coimbatore, on Tuesday and offered to donate fans for the COVID-19 wards. But they would do so without any publicity. The hospital Dean, M. Raveendran, thought they wanted to give a few fans. When he stepped out of his office, escorted by the couple, he found 100 new pedestal fans lined up in the corridor.  The couple then made another surprising revelation: they had pledged their jewellery for Rs. 2.2 lakh to buy the fans, as they could not pool in the required sum quickly. “We initially thought they would give just a few. We were pleasantly surprised to see 100,” Dr. Raveendran said. The decision to present one hundred fans came after a Tamil daily carried a report on Tuesday, stating that fans could be donated to the COVID-19 wards as the hospital administration was unable to operate the central air-conditioning. A local FM station also highlighted the requirement in its morning programme. “We got 300 fans from the government for the COVID-19 wards. But the number of patients under care was more than double. There were 720 patients as of Wednesday,” the Dean said. The medical superintendent, T. Ravikumar, said the couple had come to the hospital for COVID-19 vaccination and took an immediate decision to enable much-needed ventilation after coming to know of the requirement. “When we saw they had pledged their jewellery, we insisted that they limit the donation to five or ten fans and return the rest to the shop. But they requested us to accept all of them. A final call was taken after getting the consent of the Collector who asked us to honour the couple for their humanitarian gesture,” he said. When contacted, the couple did not wish to comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/couples-gift-is-a-fan-moment-for-kovai/article34435207.ece

29 April 2021||Erode,TAMIL NADU||Help desk opened for migrant workers at Erode Railway Junction||With migrant workers in the district heading towards their native States, a help desk where volunteers fill-up the railway reservation forms and listen to the grievances of the workers, started functioning round-the-clock at Erode Railway Junction on Wednesday. Run by the Rights Education and Development Centre (READ), an NGO based at Sathyamangalam, the desk is manned by three volunteers, who can read and write in Hindi. There are about 1.25 lakh workers from various States working in industries at SIPCOT, Perundurai, textile processing units and involved in other activities in the district. With spike in COVID-19 cases and fear of lockdown, workers started returning to their native through trains from the district in the past two weeks. R. Karuppasamy, director, READ, said various problems were encountered during the first wave of COVID-19 last year when there was a mass exodus of migrant workers. Hence, to ensure that the situation does not arise, the help desk was started. Since trains are operated only with reserved coaches, workers face difficulty in filling-up the forms. “Staff fill-up the reservation forms after which workers reserve their tickets”, he added. Workers along with their family arrive at the station without knowing the train timings for their destination and wait at the station even for two days. “On an average 500 migrant workers arrive at the junction every day in the past two weeks”, he said. Mr. Karuppasamy said that many workers complain of non-receipt of wages and the issue is forwarded to the labour department for necessary action. Also, face masks and awareness pamphlets on COVID-19 were distributed to them, he said and wanted a helpline number to be launched by the labour department for the benefit of the migrant workers. “Since many workers say that they will not be returning, staff also explain them on the Provident Fund (PF) claim process that can be made online”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/help-desk-opened-for-migrant-workers-at-erode-railway-junction/article34435264.ece

A team led by J. Ranjith, Archaeology Officer and Project Director for the Kodumanal excavation, K. Suresh, Archeological Officer,began excavations on February 26and had so far dug 28 quadrants and unearthed iron smelting units and found furnaces and other processing materials.  The team identified over 10 cairn-circle mounds, all located about 500 metres from the river, and excavation works began at three mounds. A team from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had previously carried out excavation at the burials here. Mr. Ranjith told The Hindu that, “Only secondary burials were unearthed in all the previous excavations at Kodumanal and hence the focus is on identifying primary burials which would throw more light on the earlier human settlements”. During the excavation last year, the team opened 27 burials that revealed three tyres of burials, cairn circle, urn burial and urn burial with and without cists. “Burial methods and their size revealed that multi-ethnic groups lived in the area”, he added. Ceremonial pots along with beads and graffiti were found inside the burials that were sent for carbon-dating. Earlier excavations also revealed that the site served as a trade-cum-industrial centre dating it to over 2,500 years.

On the Tamil Nadu side, town buses plied to the border at the Zuzuvadi post to drop off passengers, who scurried their way by foot across the border on Wednesday to Athibelle for work. Many workers said that they were employed in the construction sector and had decided to hitch a ride on day one of the lockdown, whilst the border surveillance still remained lax. Construction activities, apart from essential services, have been exempted from the lockdown. In the wake of the announcement, workers and those employed in pharma firms across the border on the outskirts of Bengaluru, got rides on the few town buses that plied up to the border. From the border, many hitched rides on Karnataka-registered tempos and tractors to their job sites. However, unlike the national lockdown last summer, which saw a steady stream of migrants returning to Tamil Nadu, the flurry of workers returning to their homes in Tamil Nadu was absent on Wednesday.

29 April 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Noticee entitled to fair adjudication: High Court||Taking note of the fact that two petitioners accused of trying to smuggle gold and electronic gadgets into India in 2019 were denied access to a vital piece of evidence – CCTV footage collected at Tiruchi airport – to establish their defence, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed that their right to fair adjudication had been violated. The court was hearing the petitions filed by Mohammed Haroon and Shaik Mohammed, seeking a direction to the authorities to allow re-export of the gold ornaments and electronic gadgets. They claimed that they had intended to declare the contents of their baggage to the Customs officials and pay duty. But they were intercepted by Customs officials and the goods were seized. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths said they received information that passengers arriving at Tiruchi by four flights from Kuala Lumpur, Dubai, Sharjah and Singapore would be attempting to smuggle goods. The information turned out to be well-founded as 128 of the 640 passengers of the flights were detained and undeclared gold and electronic gadgets seized from them. From the two petitioners, gold weighing 200 gm each and electronic gadgets worth Rs. 40 lakh were seized. Adjudication proceedings were initiated against them. While the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence said the accused were intercepted and apprehended, the duo sought CCTV footage from Tiruchi airport. Their request was declined. They wrote to the DRI stating that if the CCTV footage was verified, their contention would be proved. The authorities, however, submitted that the CCTV footage from 2019 had been erased. Justice G.R. Swaminathan took cognisance of the submission and observed that the airport authority was the limb of the State and the DRI could not wash its hands of the responsibility. The court said where the fundamental right of the noticees to fair adjudication had been violated, the adjudication proceedings could not be allowed to determine their guilt. It could continue only for the limited purpose of determining whether the goods could be allowed to be re-exported. The court directed the authorities concerned to pass the order within four weeks after hearing the petitioners. However, it clarified that it was not giving a clean chit to the petitioners. There was every possibility of their being ‘kuruvis’ (regular carriers of smuggled goods). Suspicion was one thing while proof was another, and it was the prosecution that had to cover the distance, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/right-to-fair-adjudication-has-been-violated-says-high-court-bench/article34435157.ece
29 April 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court raps Tirunelveli officials over unauthorised construction||Taking serious view of a case of unauthorised construction in Palayamkottai, which was functioning as a hospital, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday observed that if not for the COVID-19 pandemic, the court would have ordered lock and seal of the building. A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi took note of the fact that there was also a deviation of 2,800 sq mt in the structure. The authorities should have acted when the construction was taking place in deviation of the submitted plan. However, they had closed their eyes. The court was informed that the authorities had imposed a penalty on the hospital and a charge sheet had also been filed. Merely imposing a penalty would not legalise an unauthorised structure. The authorities should have exercised their statutory power, the court said. The authorities were directed to examine a revised plan that was submitted. The court was hearing a petition filed by S. Ferdin Rayan of Palayamkottai. The plea said the building, V.J. Hospital, was built in violation of the approved plan. Also, mandatory safety measures and requirements were not followed. Under the circumstances, the owner of the hospital was putting up additional construction on adjacent land, extending the existing structure. The petitioner said that through an RTI reply he found out that plan approval was obtained for a commercial building. Instead, a hospital was functioning there now. He sought direction to authorities concerned to take steps against the illegal/unauthorised construction. Also, legal action must be taken against those involved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-raps-tirunelveli-officials-over-unauthorised-construction/article34435226.ece

Two offering pots have been found in one urn and the remaining one in the other. The first offering pot, which is a shallow black-and-redware, was found at a depth of 65 cm. The second was a broken offering dish found at a depth of 71 cm. The third is a shallow offering pot. “The offering pots could have been used to store milk, water or other food items depending on the customs. But similar graffiti marks found on them indicate that they may be symbols of a clan or a particular family,” said Mr. Sivanandam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/three-offering-pots-found-inside-unearthed-urns-at-konthagai/article34435228.ece

29 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Health Dept. renews mission to achieve ‘zero malaria’, amid a decline in cases||The Health Department renewed its mission to achieve ‘zero malaria’ by intensifying field activities as part of observance of World Malaria Day on Tuesday amid a gradual decline in indigenous cases in the Union Territory. According to M. Ganesan, Assistant Director, (Malaria), National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, malaria continues to be a major life-threatening disease across countries affecting an estimated 2 million people, though in India it is more prevalent in the forested and hill regions of the north and northeast. As part of efforts, the prevalence of the environment-linked vector-borne disease transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito has gradually declined in the Union Territory. “Only seven indigenous malaria cases were reported in 2020 out of the 15 cases with the rest being imported or contracted during travel,” Dr. Ganesan said. In 2021, there has only been one imported case to date. The mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, in large receptacles or man-made containers drawing a focus on source reduction strategies around these sites. As per the guidelines of the World Health Organisation, the Health Ministry has fixed a zero malaria target as theme for the year's observance. Dr. Ganesan administered a pledge to staff at the PHC in Kosapalayam in the presence of Aswini, medical officer. The staff would campaign for removal of water containers in houses which can provide an ideal breeding habitat for the vectors and to reduce waterlogging in residential neighbourhoods and public drains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/health-dept-renews-mission-to-achieve-zero-malaria-amid-a-decline-in-cases/article34435893.ece

29 April 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Anti-Sterlite protesters to observe ‘Black Day’ today||The Anti-Sterlite People’s Confederation has appealed to the residents of the port town to observe a ‘Black Day’ on Thursday as a mark of protest against the Supreme Court permitting Sterlite Copper’s oxygen plant to operate. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday after submitting a petition to the Collector, advocate Hari Raghavan of the confederation said Sterlite Copper, exploiting the pandemic, had used the Supreme Court to reopen its premises in the guise of producing oxygen. Unfortunately, a section of parties in Tamil Nadu had taken a unilateral decision in favour of opening the oxygen plant, while parties like the MDMK, Makkal Needhi Maiam, VCK, Naam Tamilar Katchi and other anti-Sterlite groups were not invited for the all-party meeting, which was chaired by the Chief Minister. “Since all parties did not discuss the issue before the State government submitted its affidavit to the Supreme Court, the decision favouring Sterlite Copper should be scrapped. The Tamil Nadu government should convene an all-party meeting afresh, and solicit the opinions of all parties,” Mr. Raghavan said. Since Sterlite Copper’s plant can produce oxygen only for industrial purposes and not for medical use, the State government should change its decision to open the plant. The move is nothing but a stepping stone to open the copper smelter through the back door, he said. “Opposing the anti-people move, we appeal to the residents of Thoothukudi to hoist black flags in their houses on Thursday and put rangolis to express their dissent,” he said. “Those who go for work should wear black badges and keep black colour as profile picture on social media platforms instead of individual photos,” Mr. Raghavan said.

29 April 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||No need for people to panic, says Thoothukudi Collector||Collector K. Senthil Raj has made it clear that the Supreme Court has given permission only for operating the oxygen plant for three months and not for the operation of the copper smelter on the premises of Sterlite Copper. “Hence, there is no need for any suspicion or panic among the people,” the Collector told reporters on Wednesday. The Collector said the State government, after sealing Sterlite Copper in 2018, had presented its case effectively in the Madras High Court, which endorsed the action taken by the government. Even when an appeal was preferred against this verdict in the Supreme Court, the State government presented all evidence before the top court to strengthen its decision to close the copper smelter. “The State government is firm on its decision of closing down the copper smelter and a case challenging the closure is still going on in the Supreme Court. The permission granted for operating the oxygen plant has got nothing to do with the main case,” he clarified. “Permission has been granted only for operating the oxygen plant for three months in view of the unprecedented demand for medical-grade oxygen for COVID-19 patients. If the demand for oxygen comes down after three months, operation of the oxygen plant will be stopped and the premises sealed again,” he said. The district administration will take steps to implement the Supreme Court’s verdict upon getting the order, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-need-for-people-to-panic-says-thoothukudi-collector/article34435215.ece

29 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Allot 50% of beds to treat cases, private hospitals told||As new cases of COVID-19 infections continue to surge in Tiruchi, the health authorities have asked private hospitals in the city to allot at least 50% of their beds to treat the patients. It is aimed at increasing oxygen-supported beds to treat the patients. Upon receiving instructions, the private hospitals have begun the task of augmenting the bed capacity to admit COVID-19 patients in more numbers. S. Ram Ganesh, Deputy Director of Health Services, Tiruchi, said that Tiruchi district was getting 400 to 500 fresh cases of daily. It might continue for one or two weeks. Patients with both mild and acute symptoms are admitted. While the patients with mild symptoms were treated at the COVID care centres, others were admitted to the hospitals. Five COVID care centres had been established in the district so far. About 2,000 patients could be accommodated in these centres. Of them, 500 patients could be admitted in Yatri Nivas in Srirangam, which was thrown open on Wednesday. Each centre would have two teams of doctors and paramedical staff for the round-the-clock monitoring of patients. The patients with breathing difficulty would need hospitalisation in any of the established government or private hospitals. This factor had warranted the need for augmenting beds both in government and private hospitals. The number of beds allocated for the COVID 19 patients in the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital in the city had been increased to 650 from 450. A few more private hospitals in the district had been permitted to admit COVID 19 patients. Twenty private hospitals with required facilities have been identified to treat patients with breathing difficulties. They had been asked to increase at least 50 % of the beds to treat COVID 19 patients. Several of them had made arrangements in accordance with the demand, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allot-50-of-beds-to-treat-cases-private-hospitals-told/article34435176.ece

29 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Malls and showrooms down shutters||Most of the shopping malls, textile showrooms and jewellery marts downed their shutters on Wednesday here in compliance with the directive of the State government. The employees of the commercial establishments came for duty as usual on Wednesday. However, the officials of the Tiruchi Corporation, who visited the establishments even before the arrival of the employees, served notices asking them to close their businesses until further instructions from the government. The officials told them that the State government had stated that the establishments with 3000 square feet area should close their businesses in order to prevent crowding so as to check the spread of the COVID 19 infections. Following this, major establishments on NSB road, Big Bazar Street, West Boulevard Road, College Road, Chathiram Bus Stand, Cantonment and other areas declared leave to their employees. The textile and departmental stores on Tiruchi-Thanjavur road also closed their businesses.   Thanjavur The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI), Thanjavur, has sought exemption of big format shops, shopping malls/complex and hotels/restaurants from COVID-19 lockdown restrictions taking into consideration their precarious financial situation. In a memorandum addressed to the Chief Minister, it said that many of its members were running supermarkets, electronics, textiles and ready-made showrooms, most of which fall under the big format shops category, and some of them were in restaurant/hotel business. Stating that the standard operating procedures (SOP) laid down by the government to check the spread of novel coronavirus has been practised at these establishments where only the asymptomatic staff were deployed for duty and customers are allowed to enter premises after complying with the SOPs, it said that the working capital and fund flow of these establishments would be hit badly if they were remain closed for a longer period once again. Since the stock in trade was the capital reserve, jeopardising the cycle of the debit and credit in the business would stymie the ability of these institutions to foot the salary bill of their staff during this period. The moratorium or interest subsidy extended by the financial institutions was very meagre, the memorandum added. The State government must consider the plea on humanitarian grounds to ensure both investors and employees of these institutions stay afloat and are not bogged down by debt, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/malls-and-showrooms-down-shutters/article34435164.ece
29 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Authorities gearing up to handle more patients||Hospital beds earmarked for COVID-19 treatment are fast filling up at government tertiary care hospitals in the district as the number of cases reported is at an all-time high.

All other departments including the Speciality Block with trauma, burns cases, and other out-patient departments were fully functional with a requirement of doctors and nurses for patient care. ‘During the COVID-19 lockdown last year, we had diverted all resources to treat COVID-19 patients. However, this time around, patients need emergency care there too,’ the source said. The hostel is being used as a step-down ward where patients in recovery phase are being cared for. ‘If things get worse we will require more beds, especially in the ICU, but we are ready to handle it,’ the source said. The hospital also has enough oxygen supply too, they added. Meanwhile, six COVID Care Centres were functional while Yatri Nivas and another COVID Care Centre were being prepared to accommodate asymptomatic patients. The Bharathidasan University, Khajamalai campus, has 150 beds, Government Engineering College Sethurapatti has 600 beds, Nehru Memorial College in Thuraiyur taluk has 150 beds, SRM Medical College Hospital has 160 beds, Bishop Heber College has 500 beds and Kurinji College of Engineering and Technology in Manapparai has 150 beds, coming up to a total of 1,710 beds.

29 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Industrial park likely to get environmental clearance||A formal order on environmental clearance from Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for the SIPCOT Industrial Park on a 1,077-acre site near Manapparai is expected to be issued shortly, sources said. With the State government eyeing an annual growth rate of 15 % in manufacturing sector, as specified in the Tamil Nadu Industrial Policy 2021 and State MSME Policy, the TNPCB is understood to have expedited the process of issuing environmental clearance for the Industrial Park in which the decks are being cleared for establishment of a Food Park on a 250-acre portion. Last month, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami laid the foundation for the SIPCOT Industrial Park in Manapparai entailing Rs. 500 crore investment. TNPCB officials subsequently conducted an inspection of the site for environemental clearance. The clearance is only for the site, and production units will have to obtain individual certification from the TNPCB, sources said. At least 60 producers of food materials like biscuits, bakery products, dairy products, and moringa powder are expected to establish their manufacturing units at Manapparai, Chairman of Tiruchi Trade Centre N. Kanagasabapathi said. SIPCOT had appointed Grant Thornton Bharat LLP to conduct a detailed research on potential of the proposed food parks at Manapparai in Tiruchi district and in Theni district. Namakkal, Thanjavur, Tiruchi, Karur, Pudukottai, Dindigul, Madurai and Sivaganga have been identified as the catchment areas for the food park in Manapparai. The processing infrastructure in the food parks constitute common collection centres, primary processing centres (pre-cooling, grading, pulping, ripening chambers, sorting, waxing, packing and storage); central processing centres for pulping, aseptic packing, logistics centre; storage infrastructure including warehouses; and specialised cold storages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industrial-park-likely-to-get-environmental-clearance/article34435198.ece

29 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Action sought against Vaikundarajan||Seeking action against mining baron S. Vaikundarajan of V.V. Minerals for allegedly removing machinery and beach minerals from sealed premises, a complaint has been submitted to the Tirunelveli Collector. In his complaint submitted on Tuesday, K. Sermakani of Thalaiyoothu said the premises belonging to V.V. Minerals at Vallanvilai, which had 2,384 tonnes of garnet and 1,374 tonnes of ilmenite and machinery, were sealed by the then Collector M. Karunakaran in 2015 for “illegal mining”. However, some people had taken out the minerals and the machinery from the defunct industry premises after breaking the seals affixed by the Revenue Department, the complainant said. When contacted, Tirunelveli Collector V. Vishnu told The Hindu that he had received a petition from Mr. Sermakani, who had also sent a copy of the complaint to Sub-Collector, Cheranmahadevi, Superintendent of Police, Tirunelveli, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tirunelveli Range, Principal Secretary, Department of Industries, Commissioner for Geology and Mining and Chief Electoral Officer of Tamil Nadu. Refuting the allegations, Mr. Vaikundarajan said the charges made in the complaint “were malicious and false”. “The charges made against me are the result of intra-family property dispute, which is in court. Neither the machinery nor the beach minerals in the sealed building were taken out. Anyone can verify it at any time after obtaining permission from the Collector as the building was sealed on the instructions of the then Collector in 2015,” Mr. Vaikundarajan said. He also said he had filed a complaint with Uvari police against his nephew J. Senthilrajan (son of his younger brother S. Jegadeesan) for allegedly trespassing into his property, taking photographs, videographing the property and assaulting him when he stopped him and his accomplices during an inspection of the sealed premises by a court-appointed receiver in connection with a case few days ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/action-sought-against-vaikundarajan/article34435230.ece

29 April 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Image of banner declaring AIADMK candidate's victory causes stir||An image of a flex banner allegedly made by AIADMK supporters that declared the victory of A.S. Ramalingam, the party’s candidate for Kangeyam Assembly constituency, even before the votes have been counted has surfaced on social media platforms. The candidate denied any links with the banner. Said to have been placed at Palayakottai village panchayat near Kangeyam, the banner thanked the voters and party cadre for helping Mr. Ramalingam “win with a margin of 13,483 votes”. Mr. Ramalingam told The Hindu on Thursday that the banner was allegedly placed during the election campaign in March and that the supporters were not members of the party. “Immediately after seeing this banner, our [AIADMK] functionaries had removed it back then,” he said, adding that the supporters who placed the banner and the printing press that allegedly printed it were warned after the incident. He further alleged that the photo of the flex banner is being deliberately circulated on social media platforms ahead of counting of the votes to “spoil his name”. Mr. Ramalingam said he would lodge a complaint with the Cyber Crime police against the circulation of the banner’s image. The AIADMK fielded Mr. Ramalingam and the DMK fielded former Minister M.P. Saminathan from Kangeyam constituency in the Assembly election held earlier this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/image-of-banner-declaring-aiadmk-candidates-victory-causes-stir/article34435246.ece

29 April 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Nilgiris’ last surviving freedom fighter, J. Halli Gowder, dies||The last surviving freedom fighter from the Nilgiris, J. Halli Gowder from Nanjanad village, died on Tuesday. Mr. Gowder, who was a fixture at Independence Day and Republic Day events till a few years ago, was more than 90-years-old. He had stopped attending public events organised by the district administration in recent years due to failing health. He was active in protests against the British government and was even arrested and lodged in jail in Coimbatore and Bangalore (now Bengaluru), said officials from the district administration. Dharmalingam Venugopal, honorary director of the Nilgiri Documentation Centre (NDC), said Mr. Gowder was among 30 freedom fighters from Nanjanad village in the Nilgiris. “There were around 150 active freedom fighters from the district, with Nanjanad village having the highest number. It’s a sad day for the Nilgiris, as Mr. Gowder, along with the other freedom fighters were a key link to the district’s history with the Independence movement,” said Mr. Venugopal. Speaking of Mr. Gowder and of other freedom fighters in the Nilgiris, P.J. Vasanthan, a local heritage enthusiast said “Freedom struggle as a nationalistic movement was a largely peaceful one in the Nilgiris, barring a few stray incidents, such as the burning of a small bridge in Thiashola in 1942”. Mr. Vasanthan recalled Mahatma Gandhi’s visit to the Nilgiris in 1933, during his crusade against untouchability, while prominent leaders Annie Besant and Sarat Chandra Bose, the brother of Subash Chandra Bose, were in house arrest in the Nilgiris. The district witnessed its people participating in the Swadeshi Movement, the Salt Satyagraha, toddy shop picketing and pamphleteering when the struggle against the British grew stronger during the Quit India Movement in 1942, he said. “Official records show that nearly 83 leaders from the Nilgiris were arrested, fined or imprisoned… with a few of the prominent leaders being Rao Sahib V.I. Munuswamy Pillai from Ooty (who served as Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development), Bokkai Gowder of Bikkaty village (elected Coonoor MLA in 1967) and M.K.Nanja Gowder of Ketti (elected as MP in 1971). Nilgiris District Collector J. Innocent Divya visited Mr. Gowder’s home in Nanjanad on Tuesday to pay her last respects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nilgiris-last-surviving-freedom-fighter-j-halli-gowder-dies/article34435249.ece

Its district office-bearers on Wednesday gave a petition to the District Differently Abled Welfare Officer said that the monthly assistance was disbursed only on April 23 for April. “Even now, some 15% of the beneficiaries were yet to get the assistance,” said its district treasurer M. Sundarapandian. Stating that the differently abled persons were given Rs. 1000 a month and those with 100% disability were given Rs. 1,500 a month, Mr. Sundarapandian said that ever since COVID pandemic broke out, the assistance was being disbursed once in three months. “Many of them were crippled totally and were bed-ridden. Many of them have no other resources even for their medicines. Some of the mentally-ill patients become aggressive, if their medicines are not given regularly. And for medicines, only the monthly assistance helps them get it on time,” Mr. Sundarapandian said. Stating that while the district had around 35,000 differently abled persons and not all of them have registered with the department, Mr. Sundarpandian said that while the need for various appliances was very high, the supply by the department was very meagre. “While over 300 people had attended an interview meant for distribution of motorized wheel-chairs, only 40 were allotted by the Government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/assistance-not-disbursed-on-time/article34435237.ece

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Poor patronage leads to suspension of seven trains||Southern Railway has suspended seven pairs of trains from May 1 due to declining passenger patronage. Among them is Rameswaram-Kanniyakumari-Rameswaram tri-weekly specials, which have been fully cancelled from May 1 until further advice. “It looks like people are avoiding public transport due to growing number of COVID-19 cases,” an official said. For instance, Chennai Egmore-Madurai-Chennai Egmore Tejas is running with a lot of vacant seats in the last few days, he added. Although exodus of migrant labourers is less this time, there is still a steady flow in number of the outside workforce returning to their homes by trains. “They are worried about growing speculation over imposition of a stricter lockdown in the State in May,” a travelling ticket examiner (TTE) said. Meanwhile, a section of TTEs wants the railway administration to intensify ticket checking on platforms so that the number of personnel on onboard duty can be brought down. “In the last few weeks, at least 10 of our colleagues have been infected with COVID-19 after they continued to travel in trains,” the TTE said. Instead, of putting them to risk of contracting infection, the administration can intensify ticket-checking and allow only genuine passengers to enter platforms and trains. “If this is done, only three TTEs will be travelling in trains to assist passengers. Only those who are young and do not have co-morbidities should be allotted onboard duty,” he added. This practice has come into force in Maharashtra and in Thiruvananthapuram division of Kerala and other divisions in Southern Railway, including Madurai, can implement it as a precautionary measure. “In Western Railway, only two TTEs are allowed in trains as intensified ticket checking is done on platforms and only genuine passengers are allowed,” one of them said. According to an official here, the railway division has not received any such orders from the zonal headquarters. Besides, the pandemic situation in the State is still not worse. “We are taking ample precautions in handling our staff. They have been provided with masks. We are also providing them with sanitiser bottles and face shields,” the official said. Besides, three of the TTEs who were identified as having co-morbidities have not been given even platform duties. The Southern Railway Mazdoor Union has urged the Divisional Railway Manager, Madurai, to provide station duty for women TTEs and those above 55 with co-morbidities. Meanwhile, checking of passengers, especially those coming from other States, for fever and other symptoms of COVID-19 is being carried out by health officials at all railway stations. The officials will also look for e-registration from passengers coming from other States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poor-patronage-leads-to-suspension-of-seven-trains/article34435158.ece

29 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Umesh Katti to head district-level COVID-19 committee in Belagavi||A district-level committee headed by Umesh Katti, Food and Civil Supplies Minister, will monitor COVID-19 management in Belagavi. Laxman Savadi, Deputy Chief Minister, announced this at a review meeting with officials on Wednesday. The other three Ministers and 14 MLAs would be part of the committee. The committee would ensure that patients get beds, oxygen, ventilators and necessary drugs including Remdesivir. Senior officers like DC, SP, CEO, DHO and others will be in constant touch with the committee. Public grievances can be forwarded to this committee. People can submit their grievances to the members or to taluk and district officers, Mr. Savadi said. At the meeting, Mr. Savadi urged officers to provide all data about the status of the epidemic in the district. Please tell us what challenges you are facing so that we can help resolve them, he said. Senior officers have told me that the scarcity of Remdesivir was created due to the reduced production in the last few days. But it has been addressed, he said. He asked drug control officers to see that there was proper supply of the injection to government and private hospitals, that there was no black marketing and that hospitals did not charge extra for the drug. He asked the police to help the department in this. There are 30 ICU beds at the Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences and 350 beds with oxygen supply. These can be increased to 822, officials told Mr. Savadi. The Deputy Chief Minister asked Health Department officers to see that each taluk had at least 500 beds for COVID-19 patients, with adequate oxygen supply. Raghuram Nidavanda, Assistant Drug Controller, said that there was a scarcity of Remdesivir drug and that they had sent a request to the State government to send additional supplies. At one point, Mr. Savadi lost his cool when he found out that some officers were absent at the meeting. “This is the most important meeting in the district and officials have the audacity to skip it. How is that possible,” he asked ZP CEO H.V. Darshan. He said that if the officers did not attend the meeting, he would get them arrested. Following this warning, Vinay Dastikopp, Director, Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences, and other officers came to the meeting. Mr. Savadi asked them to treat patients with humanity and see that people don’t die due to scarcity of medicine or oxygen supply in hospitals. He asked the director why people were avoiding BIMS teaching hospital despite it having the best facilities. Mr Savadi asked officials to ensure that all the problems in BIMS were resolved and all facilities were provided to the State-run tertiary health care provider within a week. Y. Yogeshwar, Additional DC, said that there were discrepancies in the supply of food to inmates in the district civil hospital and asked officers to rectify them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/umesh-katti-to-head-district-level-covid-19-committee-in-belagavi/article34435284.ece

29 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||KMF struggles as time frame for milk sale shrinks||One of the largest milk farmers’ bodies in the country, the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) is facing a herculean task of sustaining during the curfew. A very short window of four hours between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. for milk business to operate daily has brought down sales by over 27%. KMF has seen an average decline in milk and curd sales together between 6.5 lakh and 8 lakh litres a day since Saturday, when business is restricted. In Bengaluru alone, the biggest market for KMF, milk and curd sales have dropped by more than 1.5 lakh litres. KMF operates about 1,700 milk parlours, including 1,000 in Bengaluru, and its Nandini brand is sold in thousands of outlets across the State. Before the restrictions, on an average, about 36 lakh litres of milk was being sold daily. At the same time, daily procurement of milk has gone up from about 72 lakh litres daily to 80 lakh litres a day now as farmers have turned to KMF for milk supply after private dairies stopped procurement. It is set to go up further since several milk producing districts have received good pre-monsoon rain. With a shrinking market for a portfolio of milk products, the unions have either stopped producing or have drastically cut production. This is especially true with products such as cheese, paneer, and sweets. Meanwhile, a whopping 23 lakh litres of milk is being converted to skimmed milk powder (SMP) a day now from about 11 lakh litres a day before the stringent curfew norms were announced. The federation loses about Rs. 5 per litre of milk under the current SMP rates in the market. While the production cost of a kilo of SMP is Rs. 265, current market rate is Rs. 230. In fact, the north Indian States, among the biggest SMP market for KMF, is reeling under COVID-19 attack, further shrinking its base. The federation is laden with a stock of over 10,000 tonnes of SMP currently. “Despite this, unions have to maintain farmers’ payment schedule and cannot refuse milk from its 25 lakh members. We have asked the government either to purchase milk and distribute to the needy or allow the unions to declare holiday if time extension is not possible. Otherwise, payment to farmers has to be delayed, which has never been the case in the past. Milk will go down drains if unions do not purchase and farmers will be left in a lurch,” Bangalore Milk Union president Narasimhamurthy told The Hindu . BAMUL is already losing about Rs. 30 lakh daily, he said. During the lockdown in 2020, the State government had paid KMF Rs. 79 crore for about 2.11 crore litres of milk that it purchased for 28 days and distributed among the poor free of cost. The federation is seeking a similar gesture this time too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kmf-struggles-as-time-frame-for-milk-sale-shrinks/article34435421.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Lockdown: Surge in online purchases slows down deliveries||Bengaluru and many tier-2 and tier-3 cities of Karnataka have been witnessing an unprecedented surge in online orders for groceries and food items over the last five days. Many households in Bengaluru are planning to depend on home deliveries (34% via e-com sites and 16% from local stores) as their primary channel of purchase in the next three months, indicating a quantum jump from 21% in February and 33% in March this year, as per data shared by LocalCircles, a community platform that tracks data across spaces. Harish Bijoor, founder of Harish Bijoor Consults Inc., said, “The word lockdown provokes a sentiment to stock up. And that is exactly what is happening today.” As a result, many app-based e-grocers are reporting a sudden spike in orders. Online grocer BigBasket reported a huge surge in orders in many cities, including Bengaluru, and consequently it is now taking multiple days, up to five days in some cases, to deliver orders instead of its usual same day/next day delivery schedule. Hari Menon, CEO and co-founder of BigBasket, said, “The whole team right now is working towards getting deliveries back to normal. Till April 26, we did not have any delivery issues in Bengaluru until the government sprung this lockdown on us.” Shoppers on Amazon Fresh, Flipkart Supermarket, Grofers and JioMart are also facing delays in delivery. Amazon Fresh now takes up to three days to deliver orders from its usual three to six-hour delivery capability. JioMart takes four days from earlier two days, and Grofers and Flipkart Supermart take up to four days from two days earlier. However, customers on food platforms, such as Zomato and Swiggy, are not witnessing any unusual delay in delivery. “Most grocers are unprepared for a flood of orders. They are fine stretching the limit of deliveries by as much as 30%. “The current demand for stock and hoard possibly means a 120% delivery stretch for e-grocers,” estimated Mr. Bijoor. “This demand surge is putting stress on the delivery times of major e-grocery providers whose promised delivery time has increased from a few hours to many days in Bengaluru, and they will need to scale up to meet this surge,” said Sachin Taparia, founder & chairman, LocalCircles. According to K. Vaitheeswaran, CEO at city-based AGAIN Drinks, although there is some delay in delivery of orders, the supply chain is intact. “However, in the next few weeks, we will see more stress coming on the supply chain and consequently delivery circles could get even longer,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lockdown-surge-in-online-purchases-slows-down-deliveries/article34435671.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||CT scan machines can be spreaders if protocols not followed||With High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest becoming a common investigation method for COVID-19 and for suspected cases to rule out lung involvement, doctors said diagnostic centres, CT scan rooms and machines are the latest spreaders. As many patients turn up for the investigation, there is not enough time for the staff to properly sanitise the machines and the packed room where the scan is conducted. In such a situation, many patients are catching the infection there and those who are already positive end up with an increased viral load, said doctors. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said: “There should be different time slots for symptomatic and asymptomatic people. It is ideal to have a dedicated machine for COVID-19 patients.” He added that only those who have breathing difficulty, saturation less than 94-93 or an abnormal X-ray need HRCT. Haleema Yezdani, a general physician who has been tele-triaging and tele-treating through the Emergency Response Team and Project StepOne volunteer groups, said she has seen many SARI patients testing positive after visiting scanning centres. “A person undergoing the scan is made to inhale and exhale/cough several times during the scanning. If a COVID-19 positive patient does it, the virus gets discharged in the air and also the particles land on the surface of the machine,” she explained. “Besides, I have also seen several positive patients’ viral load increasing after visiting diagnostics centres for the scan. We doctors should be selective in prescribing HRCT. Patients with mild symptoms and without any respiratory problems should be managed at home and monitored. Unless required, patients should not be sent out of the house for investigations,” she asserted. Agreeing that CT scan machines can become a source of infection, H.M. Venkatappa, Managing Director of Kanva Diagnostic Services, said such a risk exists if the machines are not sanitised properly after every scan. “But, all diagnostic centres follow protocols diligently. We change the paper roll on the bed of the machine for every patient and sanitise the machines. It is important that precautions are followed both by patients and staff as a majority who come for HRCT are those who would already had the infection,” he said. A senior Health Department official said the risk is high in government diagnostic facilities where there is a huge rush of patients. “It is very difficult to elaborately sanitise the machine after every scan as many patients would be waiting,” he said. V. Ravi, member of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee, said spread through diagnostic centres and CT machines can be prevented if proper COVID-19 protocols are followed. “If people wear masks they will not just protect themselves but also others,” he added.  A person undergoing the scan is made to inhale and exhale/cough several times during the scanning. If a COVID-19 positive patient does it, the virus gets discharged in the air and also the particles land on the surface of the machine||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ct-scan-machines-can-be-spreaders-if-protocols-not-followed/article34435295.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Four hours an impractical window to function; will create bottlenecks in supply’||The State government’s decision to allow Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yards to function only for four hours (6 a.m. to 10 a.m.) has been described by traders as “impractical”. They say that it would create bottlenecks in essential supplies. They have suggested they be allowed to work longer hours, but on alternate days like during the lockdown last year. Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, chairman, APMC committee, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the norm could only have been introduced by people who do not understand the functioning of an APMC yard and the crucial role it plays in the supply chain. “A lorry load takes nearly three to four hours to be loaded or unloaded, while the window for business is actually less than four hours, since we can leave home only by 6 a.m. and be back by 10 a.m.,” he pointed out. Traders are at a loss on how farmers and hamalis can come to the yard and return home in this time frame. Ravi Kumar, a trader, said many did not turn up and open shops on Wednesday. “Opening shops for two hours of business does not make sense,” he said. Moreover, both wholesalers and retailers are to be open during the same four- hour window, after which is a curfew. “I have only four hours to open my shop, and the same four hours to go and replenish my supplies. I am not a supermarket with a large staff strength. How do I do this? Many small kirana stores will find it tough to replenish their stocks,” said Asif, who runs a kirana store in Mahalakshmi Layout. This, it is feared, will create bottlenecks in the supply chain. Sources in the Cooperation Department said the department had raised these issues with the Chief Secretary and the CM, but their requests for more time were turned down. “We have suggested to the State government that we will work till 2 p.m. on alternate days, with weekend lockdown, ensuring no scarcity of food in the market, keeping the infection at bay. But the government doesn’t seem to be in the mood to listen,” Mr. Lahoti said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/four-hours-an-impractical-window-to-function-will-create-bottlenecks-in-supply/article34435416.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Registration for vaccination hit by huge volume of traffic||The process of registration for vaccination on COWIN portal for the 18-44 age group kicked off on Wednesday, but encountered some glitches at 4 p.m. on account of high traffic. Eventually, many said, they were able to register. “There was some glitch when I tried accessing COWIN through the mobile phone. After a few failed attempts, I switched over to the laptop. I have registered four persons for vaccination with my number,” said Chandana R., a resident of Jalahalli. Others reported similar experiences. “I think the problems were because of the traffic. The site was behaving erratically. There were no appointments for those below 45 years. But everyone should be able to register. I was able to,” said Supraja Shenoy, a resident of Peenya. Namana C., a resident of Kaggadasapura, said she was not getting the OTP during the first hour. “It kept reaching me late. I gave it an hour and tried again, and was able to register without any problems,” she said. Arjun B. had a smoother experience. “I had no problems. Probably because everyone tried at 4 p.m., the site was crashing. I registered around 5.30 p.m. and could do it without any glitch,’ he said. No supply to private hospitals from govt. With registration for vaccination of those aged above 18 years, health officials said Karnataka would halt supply of vaccines to private hospitals. “Hospitals will have to procure vaccines directly from suppliers,” an official said. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said Karnataka now has a stock of four lakh doses, and another four lakh are expected by Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/registration-for-vaccination-hit-by-huge-volume-of-traffic/article34435669.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rope in retired doctors, medical students, says Siddaramaiah||As Karnataka is facing a severe shortage of health infrastructure, Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday said the State government should hire the services of retired doctors and paramedical staff, including nurses, temporarily to mitigate the problems created by the pandemic. In a letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the Congress leader has given 11 suggestions for management of the COVID-19 situation in the State and asked the government to rope in final-year MBBS and paramedical students for providing treatment for patients under the guidance of experienced doctors. He urged the government to release salary to doctors and medical staff on a timely basis to boost their morale. Blaming the Central and the State governments for the state of affairs, Mr. Siddaramaiah wanted to know what had the State government done for the last 14 months since the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. “How many beds have been increased? How many ICU beds have been increased? How much production of oxygen and Remdesivir was increased?” he asked. ‘Import equipment’ With shortage of beds in government and private hospitals, the former Chief Minister suggested establishing beds at schools, colleges, community halls, and marriage halls temporarily. On the shortage of ventilators and oxygen, Mr. Siddaramaiah suggested importing both to ensure timely treatment. He pointed out that the country had exported 11 lakh doses of vaccine and urged the Centre to step up its production. On patients being charged Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 50,000 per day in some private hospitals, the Congress leader urged the government to issue guidelines to private hospitals for regulation of fees. The State should get vaccination free of cost and the State MPs should put pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rope-in-retired-doctors-medical-students-says-siddaramaiah/article34435287.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Confusion prevailed in construction sector||Confusion prevailed in the construction and allied services as the curfew norms came to force from Tuesday night. A large part of the business remained closed due to local intervention by the administration on Wednesday. While the Revenue Secretary N. Manjunath Prasad had on Tuesday clarified to The Hindu that stores dealing with all kinds of construction sector materials have been allowed to remain open, the past President of Karnataka Hardware and Allied Merchants Association Anil Talreja said that not all stores were allowed to function. “In many places local police and revenue administration got the hardware stores closed,” he said. In fact, he pointed out, in Bengaluru CBD area the stores were not allowed to function while in some residential neighbourhood and outskirts they remained open in the stipulated 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. window. An estimated 25,000 stores dealing with hardware, sanitary, electrical, glass, plywood, pipes and paints that mostly make up the interior works support the construction activities besides the supply of cement, bricks, sand and stone. According to the addendum issued to the guidelines, all shops and establishments dealing with construction materials have been permitted to operate. “The business may not be much in the short window during early morning. But this will enable us to meet our supply commitments. In many cases, some small items would hold back further progress,” a leading hardware dealer in Mysuru said. The Builders' Association of India’s Karnataka Chairman M. Ramesh also confirmed that confusion exists in the functioning of the allied businesses to construction. “There was no consultation before the guidelines were announced. Most contractors do not keep stock of the materials. Depending on the construction progress materials are bought,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/confusion-prevailed-in-construction-sector/article34435672.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||PHANA seeks police protection in hospitals||Concerned over the families of COVID-19 victims allegedly assaulting healthcare professionals, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) has written to Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant seeking police protection. In the letter, PHANA president H.M. Prasanna and secretary Rajashekara Y.L. have pointed out that many patients are reporting late to the hospitals, have co-morbidities, delayed recoveries, and sometimes succumb. “The hospitals are witnessing a lot of anxious and emotional moments of patients, as well as their kinnear and dear ones. This is aggravated by the scarcity of beds and need for ventilators. There are many deaths happening due to COVID-19 in spite of best treatments. That is the magnitude and nature of the pandemic and is the same in other parts of the world too,” the letter said. “Such emotions, misconceptions, blame games, hardships/misunderstandings in the billing, interferences of the local hooligans, etc. are happening in our country resulting in mob violence in the hospitals/clinics. Many doctors and healthcare professionals have suffered injuries.” Urging the Commissioner to sensitise all police stations regarding such possibilities and to take necessary steps, PHANA has requested that prohibitory orders should be imposed in the vicinity of all healthcare establishments treating COVID-19 patients (similar to that in place in election booths). They have also requested police personnel in the hospital premises round the clock.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/phana-seeks-police-protection-in-hospitals/article34435296.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||12% of beds in CCCs to be oxygenated by next week||There now are a total of 14 COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs) in the city. They have been set up by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), some in association with private hotels and companies, such as HAL and BOSCH. Of the 2,054 beds available, just around 18% beds are occupied. The Karnataka government has directed the BBMP to ensure that at least 10% of total beds in CCCs are oxygenated. These CCCs are for those who have tested positive for COVID-19, but have either mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, and do not have the wherewithal for home isolation. Home isolation requires a COVID-19 patient to be isolated in a separate room with an attached bathroom and toilet. According to war room reports, over the past week, over 95% of those who have tested positive in the city have been placed in home isolation while 4.75% have been admitted to various hospitals and just 0.12% have been admitted in the various CCCs. The reports also show that, for various reasons, around 0.016% of patients are untraceable. Of the 2,054 beds, 215 – around 12% – will be oxygenated. In many centres, empty cylinders and oxygen concentrators are available. Civil works for creating the infrastructure have now been taken up in many centres. Currently, 15 oxygenated beds are available at the Mangala Raitha Bhavan in Hebbal. Of these, three are occupied. BBMP Joint Commissioner Sarfaraz Khan, who is in-charge of the CCCs, told The Hindu that civil works are likely to be completed by the weekend and oxygenated beds would be available from Monday onwards. On Wednesday, a new CCC was opened by Minister for Revenue R. Ashok, taking the total to 14. Inspecting the newly created facility with Minister for Excise and in-charge for Dasarahalli zone K. Gopalaiah, Mr. Ashok said doctors and nurses would be deputed in two shifts at the centre. In each shift, there would be 14 health care workers.  Of the 2,054 beds available, just around 18% beds are occupied. The Karnataka government has directed the BBMP to ensure that at least 10% of total beds in CCCs are oxygenated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/12-of-beds-in-cccs-to-be-oxygenated-by-next-week/article34435289.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Agri war room’ reopens in Bengaluru to help farmers||The State Agriculture Department on Wednesday reopened the ‘Agri war room’ in Bengaluru to help farmers during the period of lockdown, on the lines of what was done during last year’s lockdown. The war room would help farmers seek guidance on the price situation in different markets for their produce including vegetables, fruits, and flowers. They can also get information on availability of farm inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, farm implements, and subsidy schemes, Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil said. Farmers can seek guidance from the department by calling helplines 080-22212818 and 080- 22210237 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Two technical officers and a deputy director (agriculture) will monitor the helpline. The government is also considering a proposal to form a district-level team of officers from the departments of agriculture, horticulture and sericulture in the days to come to help farmers. However, farmers are apprehensive about not just transporting their produce, but also getting a proper market during the lockdown period. Their concern is that there are not many bulk buyers and they have to pay more for transport of produce. In fact, some experts have been pitching for formation of cooperation of digital platform for selling of farm produce. However, the Agriculture Department is yet to act on such ideas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/agri-war-room-reopens-in-bengaluru-to-help-farmers/article34435420.ece

29 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Task force for supply of oxygen, helplines set up in Dharwad||On day one of the partial lockdown even as the police were busy ensuring the COVID-19 guidelines were strictly followed, the Dharwad district administration took several measures to help the citizens in the fight against the pandemic by setting up helplines, a task force and also provided assistance for funerals. Considering the significance of the availability of liquid medical oxygen for emergency use in private hospitals and ensuring its hassle-free supply, Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil constituted a task force. In an order issued on Wednesday, Mr. Patil said that the Drug Controller of Dharwad Circle Mallikarjun K.S., Regional Transport Officer (East) Appayya Nalwatwadmath, RTO(West) B. Shankarappa and senior motor vehicle inspectors of both the RTOs would be part of the task force. The task force would ensure quick supply of liquid medical oxygen and for the purpose of helping the needy patients, a 24x7 helpline (0836-2233925 or 9449864025) too had been set up, the Deputy Commissioner said. Patients in need of oxygen could call the helpline to get the supply immediately, he said. Help The district administration and the Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) have taken steps to extend assistance to the family members of the patients who succumb to COVID-19 in conducting the funeral. “The municipal corporation will arrange transport for carrying the mortal remains to the crematorium or graveyard and will bear the funeral expenses,” Municipal Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde said. He said that arrangements were being made in the wake of ambulance vehicle owners seeking additional money for transportation of bodies of COVID-19 patients and reports about the family members’ difficulties in arranging funerals. “Steps will be taken to transport the bodies from KIMS, district hospital, and private hospitals to the graveyards and conduct the funerals as per COVID-19 protocol,” he said. The State government under the revised guidelines has allowed only five persons to take part in the funeral of patients who succumb to COVID-19 infection. Three separate ambulances have been kept at KIMS, district hospital, and SDM hospital and a helpline too has been set up for the purpose. Family members of the deceased patients are requested to call 0836-2213888/ 898 or 9141051611.

29 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Pandemic: SUCI hits out at governments||With the COVID-19 numbers surging, Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) celebrated its 74th Foundation Day in Dharwad through the virtual mode on Wednesday. Delivering the foundation day speech through the virtual mode from the party’s district office in Dharwad on Wednesday, District Secretary of SUCI(C) Ramanjanappa Aldalli said that it was a day to rededicate oneself to the cause of social revolution in the country by the workers. Elaborating on the developments which led to the foundation of SUCI on May 24 in 1948, Mr. Ramanjanappa said that even as the country was celebrating the independence, Comrade Shivadas Ghosh felt that the country was yet to get real independence and founded the party based on the ideologies of Karl Marx and Lenin. He said that after years of misrule and other evils, people of the country had slowly understood that they were yet to get real freedom. COVID-19 pandemic had further disillusioned the citizens of the country who were under the impression that they had chosen a responsibility government, he said. “The government seems to think that its only responsibility is announcing lockdown and is least bothered about the plight of the commoners. While crores of people have lost their livelihood and thousands are dying like worms due to lack of healthcare facilities, the capitalists are making profits over the dead bodies, and the government is a mute spectator,” he said. Mr. Ramanjanappa lambasted the governments --- State and Central --- for their anti-people policies and urged them to at least show empathy towards the suffering people and provide them relief instead of abandoning their responsibilities. District secretariat member Gangadhar Badiger presided over the foundation day programme and another secretariat member Laxman Jadagannavar was present. A few others took part in the programme adhering to the COVID-19 protocol, while scores of others participated through the online mode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pandemic-suci-hits-out-at-governments/article34435281.ece

29 April 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||People stay indoors as fortnight-long lockdown begins in DK and Udupi||The districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi went into the fortnight-long lockdown, intended to break the spread of COVID-19, from 10 a.m. on Wednesday with personnel from police, Revenue, and local bodies ensuring shops selling essential commodities were closed and people remained indoors. The four-hour window for people to buy essentials witnessed hectic movement of vehicles and people across important cities and towns in the districts, including Mangaluru, Udupi, Puttur, Bantwal, Karkala, Kundapur, and other places. Those working in essential services made use of the window to reach their workplaces in the absence of any kind of public transport. Consequently, highways and major roads in the districts saw increased movement of personal modes of transport along with goods vehicles in the early hours. Police personnel erected barricades across major roads and junctions in Mangaluru and Udupi cities after the 10 a.m. window to curtail unnecessary movement of people. Both district administrations had asked those intending to get inoculated against COVID-19 to visit their nearest health centres and cautioned against wandering in the guise of vaccination. Crew of public transport vehicles, including buses, autorickshaws and taxis, parked their vehicles following total curb on public transport. Drivers and conductors of these vehicles were seen worried over the life during the fortnight with no income. Similar was the situation of daily income earners, namely, tailors, dhobis, hairdressers, mechanics, pushcart vendors and others, who had to shut their operation following the lockdown. With ban on movement of public transport vehicles in the State, inter-State bus operations were limited to the borders. Private and RTC buses from Kerala plied till Talapady to drop and pick up passengers. However, there were very few passengers as almost all the activities have come to standstill in Karnataka. As people resorted to panic buying ever since lockdown was announced, groceries went out of stock in many departmental stores even as neighbourhood grocery shops witnessed huge rush. Supply of vegetables and fruits remained unaffected while their prices remained stable unlike the last lockdown. Meanwhile, Railways has cancelled services of Mangaluru-Mumbai LTT-Mangaluru Matsyagandha Express from April 29/30 and Madgaon-Mangaluru-Madgaon DEMU from April 29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/people-stay-indoors-as-fortnight-long-lockdown-begins-in-dk-and-udupi/article34435835.ece

The external members of the committee included University College Mangaluru Environment Association Deputy Director M.N. Siddaraju, and Mangalore University Department of Biosciences professor Prashanth Naik. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Siddaraju said the green audit was a management tool that enhances the overall environmental performance of an institution. As there was no standard model for such an audit, the committee brainstormed and evolved a questionnaire. With the help of student volunteers, the basic data was compiled, which the committee analysed. By and large, the audit revealed a healthy environment on campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/green-audit-conducted-at-canara-college/article34435834.ece
29 April 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘50 beds in health centre ready for oxygen supply’||Mangaluru MLA and former Minister for Health and Family Welfare U.T. Khader has said that 50 beds in the government’s community health centre in Ullal has been provided with a pipe connection for supplying oxygen to patients. It is as a precaution in case if the centre is to be converted as a COVID-19 hospital in the future. Presently, there is no need as over 4,000 beds are already available in other hospitals in the State. In addition, many patients visited the health centre for testing and treatment related to Allopathy, Homoeopathy, Unani, and Ayurveda. The number of such patients varied between 200 and 250 daily. If the centre is made a COVID-19 hospital it will trouble all such patients who will have to approach other hospitals for treatment. In addition, there is a risk of the virus spreading to such patients. If the situation warranted, the health centre can be converted as COVID-19 hospital in the future. Then the 50 beds can be supplied with the oxygen. Mr. Khader said that Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra told him on Wednesday that an electric crematorium has been sanctioned at Chombugudde in Ullal. An action plan for its construction will be made following a discussion with the managing committee of the crematorium and local elected representatives. Earlier the Deputy Commissioner had visited the existing crematorium at Chombugudde in connection with setting up the electric crematorium, he said, adding that the managing committee had also submitted a memorandum to him to set up an electric crematorium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/50-beds-in-health-centre-ready-for-oxygen-supply/article34435837.ece

29 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Safeguard the interests of working class: Rai||Former Minister and senior Congress leader B. Ramanath Rai on Wednesday urged the government to immediately provide ration kits to the poor in view of the lockdown. Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Rai said it was easy to enforce the lockdown. However the same would result in untold misery to the working class. It was the government’s responsibility to ensure their well-being, Mr. Rai said, and noted migrant workers were the most vulnerable. He urged the government to waive utility bills, including power, water, and telephone, during the lockdown as people would not have the earning capacity. Some States have already waived such bills and Karnataka should follow the same. Mr. Rai demanded a White Paper on PM Cares fund as well as the Rs. 20,000 crore released for COVID-19 management last year. While there were reports of shortage of medical oxygen, a proposal to establish oxygen plants in all States does not include Karnataka, he regretted. He said the Governor convening an all-party meeting despite there being an elected government goes to show that the government was not pro-active. Though there were three Deputy Chief Ministers, the Governor convened the meeting when the Chief Minister was hospitalised. This indicates a lack of coordination between the Ministers, Mr. Rai said. Former Minister K. Abhayachandra Jain, J.R. Lobo, former MLA, Ivan D’Souza, former MLC, and other leaders were present. Meanwhile, Mr. D’Souza demanded a payment of Rs. 10,000 sustenance allowance to the working class, including workers in the unorganised sector, autorickshaw and taxi drivers, during the lockdown. In a statement, he said instead of strengthening the healthcare sector, the government was busy in providing graveyards and cremation grounds. Since the government itself has imposed undeclared lockdown, it has the responsibility of taking care of the vulnerable sections of society, Mr. D’Souza said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/safeguard-the-interests-of-working-class-rai/article34435282.ece

29 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Lockdown brings Mysuru region to a halt||The two-week lockdown which kicked in from Tuesday was total with all non-essential services remaining shut, on Wednesday. The lockdown norms were complied with as the severity of the second wave of COVID-19 has shocked the public. Except for essential services such as pharmaceutical shops, business establishments were closed across the region. The KSRTC bus stand wore a deserted look while there were hardly any passengers at the railway station. The trains bound out of Mysuru too were empty and the occupancy rate negligible. The Bengaluru-bound Tipu Express and Chamundi Express had a few scores of passengers against their normal carrying capacity of nearly 1,200 passengers. Though the lockdown norms issued by the State government permitted the functioning of manufacturing units, the garment units were shut. Even among the manufacturing sectors, there were units that were dependent on industrial oxygen but the use of oxygen in industry is now been banned as they are being diverted to cope with the full-blown medical crisis. Suresh Kumar Jain, Secretary, Mysuru Industries Association, said the impact of the lockdown will be felt in the days ahead. About 20 to 25 per cent of the units are oxygen-dependent and they are ancillary offshoots and provide materials to the larger units. But since the oxygen-dependent units are shut all units in the chain link will feel the impact in due course, he added. There are also issues related to transportation as workers could not reach industries in time. There is a demand to introduce KSRTC buses to the industrial areas during the shift hours. A.S. Satish, President, Mysore Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said it is imperative that the industrial raw material supply chain is not choked. Hence the MCCI suggested that the raw material and stores suppliers be allowed to function between 6 a.m and 2 p.m. to enable the industry to function at the minimum operating level. He said in order to maintain the supply chain to retail shops , APMC also should be allowed to function during the same period daily so that scarcity of basic necessities was avoided. The MCCI also called for reconsidering the ban on textile units as the livelihood of a large number of workers depends on this sector. The lockdown was total in Mandya, Chamarajanagar and Kodagu also.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lockdown-brings-mysuru-region-to-a-halt/article34435409.ece

29 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Library foundation stone laying ceremony put off due to COVID-19||The foundation stone laying ceremony for a public library in Rajiv Nagar has been put off due to COVID-19. A library set up by 62-year-old Syed Ishaq in Rajiv Nagar was destroyed in a fire earlier this month and the government had planned to start construction of a full-fledged library at the same spot on World Book Day on April 23. The postponement of the function was following a decision taken by the State against holding any foundation stone laying ceremony or inaugural function, which attract a large number of people, for at least the next two months. An announcement in the regard had been made by Minister for Revenue R. Ashok. “We had to put off the function due to COVID-19. A fresh date has not yet been fixed”, said Manjunath, Deputy Director of Public Libraries, Mysuru.

In a memorandum submitted to the Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru, the MDJA said the journalist, who has been suffering from COVID-19, had been inhumanly chained to the hospital bed in Mathura since last Wednesday, denying him even the basic right of going to the toilet. “Being chained, the journalist is not even able to eat food.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||HC upholds enhancing minimum age for recruiting doctors to govt. service||The High Court of Karnataka has upheld enhancement of minimum age to 26 years from 21 years for recruiting doctors to posts of senior medical officers, specialists, and general duty medical officers in the Department of Health and Family Welfare. “There is reasonable classification and a rational nexus exists with the object sought to be achieved by amending the minimum age criteria from 21 to 26 and it is not violative of Article 14 or Article 16 of the Constitution of India,” the court held. A Division Bench comprising Justice Aravind Kumar and Pradeep Singh Yerur passed the order while dismissing the petitions filed by Vikas Gowda K.P and others who are working in government service on contract basis. The petitioners had questioned the constitutional validity of Directorate Health and Family Welfare Services (Recruitment of Senior Medical Officer/Specialists, General Duty Medical Officers and Dental Health Officers) (Special) (Amendment) Rules, 2020. The court said that enhancement of minimum age is based on the intelligible differentia of experience and rural service with the object to provide experienced medical service to the public. Pointing out that a candidate joining MBBS course would be around 25 years when completing MBBS course of four-and-a-half-years, and the internship and the compulsory rural service of one year each in Karnataka, the Bench said that fixing of 26 years of age for appointment cannot be termed as arbitrary in nature. Stating that it is the prerogative of the State government to fix age criteria for recruitment to a particular post and the courts cannot interfere, the Bench also said that one of the reason for enhancing minimum limit was to absorb doctors having rural work experience into government service.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-upholds-enhancing-minimum-age-for-recruiting-doctors-to-govt-service/article34435419.ece

More patients from neighbouring districts are being shifted to Mysuru out of fear which needs to go and everyone has to work together to remove panic about the contagion, said Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar. The Minister was in Hunsur on Wednesday to take stock of the COVID-19 situation in the taluk. Later, presiding over a meeting on the steps to be taken for combating the pandemic, he said not all patients need oxygenated beds but the people think otherwise and seek such beds for patients. The onus is on the officials to persuade the public on patients in need of such beds. The biggest priority of the officers has to be dispelling fears of COVID-19 by spreading information on the facilities available in case of an infection and the number of patients recovering from the disease and getting discharged. “This will build morale in the society.” Hunsur is the second (after K.R. Nagar) among the taluks where vaccination coverage is encouraging. “I don’t think there will be a rush for vaccines after May 1 since the government as well as the private hospitals will provide free vaccines to the persons above 18 years of age as announced by the State government,” he told the meeting. 100 ventilators Mr. Somashekar claimed that sufficient quantity of Remdesivir injections had been made available to the government hospitals and the private hospitals will soon be getting the drug with 998 injections on the way to Mysuru, which is also getting as many as 100 ventilators and 20 ‘Dura cylinders’ which are vacuum-insulated liquid gas cylinders for storing medical oxygen. Meanwhile, 100 oxygenated beds are being added for COVID-19 treatment with the renovated Mohandas Tulsidas Hospital in Lakshmipuram being converted into a COVID-19 Hospital in view of a surge in cases. The hospital is expected to become operational soon. The Minister, accompanied by MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajeev, inspected the hospital. and Nearly 50 per cent of the aid has come from the MUDA for readying the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dispel-fears-minister/article34435407.ece

Sudhakaran, MP, expressed concern over vacant positions in the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Crucial posts Mr. Sudhakaran said the commission had been functioning without a Chairperson, two members, and a Director General of Investigation. “Human rights violations in the country are on the rise, and non-appointment to higher positions in the commission may affect its ability to autonomously investigate crucial cases of human rights violations,” he said. He cited the case of journalist Siddique Kappan, who was reportedly chained to his hospital jail bed in Mathura while battling COVID-19 and even without access to toilet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fill-vacancies-in-nhrc-says-sudhakaran/article34435314.ece

The account was reportedly created on Wednesday morning, and an attempt was made to extort money from his friends by sending a request. Mr. Sharma said the person behind the act was from outside the State, and that the location had been identified. The officer added that a replica of his official account was made by using photographs, which were in public domain. Around 90 persons accepted the request sent through the account. But alert users informed informed the police, besides forwarding screenshots. “An investigation is on, and the case has been raised under the IT Act. Besides, a legal notice has been sent to Facebook. There were similar attempts in the recent past, and people should be alert while accepting requests,” the officer said. In a similar incident, a fake Facebook account of Kannur Regional Transport Officer Unnikrishnan Erambath was allegedly created and an attempt was made to extort money by seeking financial help from his friends. He lodged a complaint with the Kannur City Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bid-to-extort-money-through-fake-fb-account-of-police-officer/article34435306.ece

Mazhuvannoor recorded 88 new cases, Cheranalloor 87 and Mattancherry 85. Two health workers and one police officer have tested positive. The source of infection could not be determined in 79 cases. A total of 1,012 people tested negative on the day, and 85,124 people remain in quarantine. While 35,884 people are recovering at home, 1,427 are at private hospitals and 423 patients are admitted at government hospitals. At domiciliary care centres, 301 people are recovering, and 457 people are admitted at first and second-line treatment centres. At INHS Sanjivani, 74 patients are recovering. At hospitals and FLTCs, 211 patients were newly admitted on Wednesday, and 128 patients were discharged. While 855 beds are available at domiciliary care centres, 137 beds with oxygen supply are vacant at SLTCs. At ten government hospitals where COVID treatment is being provided, 142 out of 669 beds are available. A total of 57 private hospitals are currently admitting COVID patients. According to a release from the district administration, a total of 4,527 beds with oxygen supply were readied at both private and government facilities (539 at government facilities and 3,988 at private ones), while a total of 424 ICU beds were set aside for COVID treatment. Vaccination from Friday Ernakulam received 20,000 doses of Covishield on Wednesday, offering some respite from the acute shortage of doses that the district has been facing. Vaccination came to a halt on Wednesday since no doses were available. While stock will be distributed to centres on Thursday, vaccination is set to resume on Friday. There are 199 vaccination centres in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/daily-covid-19-case-count-surges-past-5000-in-district/article34435817.ece
29 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Ernakulam might require around 1,000 ICU beds, says surge plan||A COVID-19 surge action plan prepared by the District Surveillance Unit (DSU) suggests that Ernakulam would have to roughly double the number of ICU beds it has presently, to handle the possible surge in cases over the next 10 days. Based on the unit’s observations, around 1.5% to 2% of total cases at any point of time would need ICU admissions. The district might require around 800 to 1,000 ICU beds. The district now has 424 ICU beds set aside for COVID patients, and 317 of these are occupied, at both government and private facilities as of Wednesday morning. The plan flags transportation of oxygen, besides storage capacity at hospitals, as an issue. Sources said that although there is no shortage of oxygen, the demand is expected to grow further, and compatible tanks are necessary for transport, while storage tanks will be necessary at the destination facilities. The administration is attempting to improve production, transportation and storage. The production of medical oxygen is set to increase with BPCL being directed to ramp up production, and four plants coming up at government hospitals. Around 105 additional ICU beds in government facilities and 250 in private ones are being readied, according to officials in the surveillance unit. The super specialty block of the Ernakulam General Hospital is being taken over to augment treatment facilities. Panel formed Other issues that the surveillance unit raised are the admission of category A (mildly symptomatic) persons at private hospitals, and availability of staff at hospitals and laboratories. A committee has been formed comprising representatives from the private sector and government officials to ensure the optimum utilisation of beds, and COVID patient admissions at private hospitals are being tracked. The plan, based on data available till April 24, projects that around 40,000 cases can be expected in the next 10 days. Around 50% of these cases are likely to be symptomatic, and around 20% of the 40,000 cases might need hospitalisation, necessitating the availability of 8,000 hospital beds. COVID patients who require dialysis are likely to be treated at PVS Hospital and the Thripunithura Taluk Hospital, while COVID patients requiring gynaecological and surgical care will be admitted at the Government Medical College Hospital.  Testing capacity of the existing laboratories needs to be increased to avoid delays in getting results. Rapid antigen tests should be used for symptomatic patients and contacts in order to ensure quick isolation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ernakulam-might-require-around-1000-icu-beds-says-surge-plan/article34435815.ece
29 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fire breaks out in Electronics Street building||A major fire broke out in a three-storey building at the Electronics Street at Pallimukku right in the heart of the city engulfing the sky over with thick black fumes on Wednesday afternoon. The fire that broke out around 12.25 p.m. has reportedly inflicted damage running into lakhs, the estimate of which is expected to be made on Thursday. The fire broke out on the second floor of the building housing multiple makeshift godowns stocked mostly with mobile phone accessories and a showroom. A short circuit is suspected to have triggered the fire. Firefighters and tenders from six fire and rescue stations – Club Road, Gandhi Nagar, Thrikkakara, Thripunithura, Aluva, and Mattancherry – in addition to a unit from the Cochin Shipyard had to labour for nearly five hours before the fire could be completely doused and the situation was brought under control. A nearby lodge sustained partial damage in the fire but was spared largely owing to the timely intervention of firefighters. “We had a tough time dousing the fire as water could not be hosed in unhindered as space was separated into small rooms and the vents were sealed with fixed glass and grill. We had to break the glass to properly hose the water in. Also, the building was accessible to firetenders only on one side and firefighters had to climb to height on the other three sides to fight the fire and stop it from spreading to other floors and nearby buildings,” said a firefighter involved. Since among the stuff ablaze included plastic, it exuded thick black fumes making firefighting even harder. Though the fire was doused around 3.30 p.m. water still had to be poured to stop the smouldering. “Once the fire was brought under control, our fighters in firefighting suit entered the area to further hose water for another couple of hours,” said the firefighter. Regional Fire Officer K.K. Shiju and station officers from various stations were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/major-fire-breaks-out-in-electronics-street-building/article34435811.ece

Venugopal, who is also the Nodal Officer for Oxygen Monitoring in Kerala and Lakshadweep, has given a call to hospitals to clean up the oxygen cylinders prior to collection by the gas supplier. The authorities have also asked the institutions to ensure identification of externally contaminated cylinders with clear marking or labelling. The authorities also said that cylinders pick-up area should be located away from the patient wards and infection areas of a hospital. Dr. Venugopal said it was brought to the attention of Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) that medical oxygen cylinders brought to some of the filling plants in Kerala and Tamil Nadu were not disinfected properly and that workers in these plants were infected and if such things happen, it would be difficult to run the medical oxygen plant 24X7. District Medical Officers would have to advise all the hospitals to disinfect the medical oxygen cylinders at their end and send them to the filling plants. Kerala hospitals are supplied with the vital gas from institutions like the KMML, which is supplying six tonnes per day; BPCL, which is supplying 0.322 tonnes per day, and Cochin Shipyard Limited, which is supplying 5.45 tonnes per day. The total capacity now is around 204 tonnes per day with various other facilities, including the recently commissioned Palakkad plant. Ensuring supply PESO, a department under the Government of India, is responsible for monitoring and ensuring ample supply of medical oxygen in the country, he added. The State government nodal officers verify the need from each district and provide data to the PESO nodal officers. PESO, which regulates compressed gas supplies and plants, collect data from oxygen manufacturers and fillers and ensure that oxygen reaches the hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hospitals-asked-to-clean-up-oxygen-cylinders/article34435387.ece

Around 170 families, all of them depending on fishing as a their means of living, have been affected in the Edavanakkad area where sea incursion has been quite frequent now, said Edvanakkad panchayat vice-president V. K. Iqbal. It is not possible for these people to relocate as they depend mostly on fishing for making a living, he said. The heavy summer rain and the swelling sea earlier this month had been like a warning for the people living in the coastal area about the upcoming rainy season, when things are likely to get worse. The Vypeen-Munambam coastal road has been virtually covered in sand through most of its segments along the coast. The residents say that once water brought in by the high waves crossed the road, the entire area would get flooded because of the sand banks that prevent the water from flowing back into the sea. The most affected areas include ward number 1, Chanthangad, ward 9, Aniyil Kadappuram and ward 13 Pazhangad Kadappuram. These areas were frequently flooded, said Mr. Iqbal, who expressed the need for building breakwaters to prevent further deterioration of the coast. He said that Aniyil Kadappuram urgently needed building of breakwaters so that the people’s lives were not threatened, especially in the wake of the high waves. The problem had been severe of late and could be the result of climate changes, he said. The first spell of rain early this month was a cause for worry for Chellanam residents, who also experienced a spell of high waves during this week. With the work on erection of the geo-textile tube coming to a halt, the residents of the coastal village fear that the rainy season could bring more misery. The granite seawall along several vulnerable segments need immediate repair, said Jinson Veluthamannungal of Pachima Kochi Theera Samrakshana Samiti. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services had issued a warning of high waves between April 26 and April 28 along Kollam, Alappuzha, Kochi, Ponnani, Kozhikode, Kannur, and Kasargod regions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/residents-of-edavanakkad-chellanam-in-deep-waters/article34435809.ece
29 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||User data vulnerable in mobile apps: study||How safe are the countless mobile apps that a smartphone user so whimsically installs? The findings based on an analysis of 10,000 popular apps conducted last month by CloudSEK, a Bengaluru-based Artificial Intelligence-driven Digital Risk Management Enterprise, are not so reassuring. Search engine The analysis done with the help of BeVigil, a free security search engine tool developed for assessing threat perception of mobile apps, found that over 40 apps with a collective download of more than 100 million were highly vulnerable endangering their internal networks and data, thanks to hardcoded AWS (Amazon Web Services) keys. AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing system used by businesses and even governments worldwide, offers compute power, database storage and allows users to interact with their infrastructure via APIs (Application Programming Interface). “The API acts like a password for the app to access data stored on AWS. To put it simply, if AWS is your apartment, where you store critical data and files, the API key unlocks your front door. Multiple sources While API makes it easy for developers to build apps that communicate with multiple sources and efficiently manage data flowing to and from the apps, hardcoding API keys into apps is akin to locking your house but leaving the key in an envelope titled do not open,” said Rahul Sasi, founder, CloudSEK. These keys could be easily discovered by malicious hackers or competitors who could use it to compromise their data and networks. Recent high-profile hacks, such as the Imperva breach, have leveraged this misconfiguration to compromise the cloud infrastructure. AWS has a documentation for accessing resources with secured keys. Security practise The fundamental security practice is not to hardcode them anywhere. If inadvertently exposed, the AWS Access Key should be either revoked or deleted. “While public API keys, such as that of Facebook and LinkedIn, are intentionally made available for other apps to verify user identities, most apps are supposed to use private keys that need to be kept secure. However, in the breakneck pace at which new versions of apps are released, it is not uncommon for developers to overlook exposed API keys,” said Shahrukh Ahmad, chief Technical Officer, BeVigil. Despite having over eight million apps to choose from, users, app developers, and security researchers don’t have a mechanism to determine the security posture of mobile apps. User data This leads to the user data being breached and sold on underground forums to the highest bidder, he said. “We believe that a cost-effective tool like BeVigil would encourage app developers to vet their apps for identifying vulnerabilities and address them before their launch,” said Mr. Sasi. The scan reports generated by BeVigil are made available to the global CloudSEK community.  The findings are based on an analysis of 10,000 popular apps held last month||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/study-exposes-vulnerability-of-mobile-apps/article34435370.ece

The Local Self-Government Department has asked departments and agencies concerned to submit a progress report on the findings and recommendations of the committee submitted to the government in January. Polluted waterbodies The report termed the finding that nearly 36% of the waterbodies in the State has been polluted as ‘alarming’. Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram and Kasaragod were the districts having major backwater tourism sites. On the inference that houseboats were a major source of pollution, the committee had asked the Local Self-Government Department and the Pollution Control Board to carry out stringent checks in houseboats. The guidelines on classification of houseboats must include proper waste disposal as a key provision, it said. The department will have to update on the setting up of seven plants for scientific disposal of faecal sludge from the apartments located close to the backwaters in Kollam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Kannur under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) scheme. The local bodies concerned will have to find out the illegal outlets from the apartments into the waterbodies and take legal action against violators. Guidelines The Tourism Department has to come up with a unified set of guidelines for construction of resorts and homestays close to backwater sites as it was found that the department had no control over violations, if any, in the construction stage. The Suchitwa Mission will have to take the lead in ensuring that toilets located close to the backwaters have septic tanks as per norms. Local bodies and the board should initiate action against those dumping septage into waterbodies. They should provide or renew licence to resorts only after ensuring that the institutions had set up sewage treatment plants and waste disposal mechanisms as per rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/backwater-tourism-sites-blamed-for-pollution/article34435311.ece

M. Khalid, president of Kerala State Small Industries’ Association (KSSIA), has said that industrial operations had been exempted from the purview of the restrictions imposed by the State government to contain the spread of the pandemic. He said that the government step was a welcome one as the MSME sector accounted for a large segment of the employment generated in the State. He said that around 10 lakh workers were involved in the sector across the State and providing vaccination to those directly involved would go a long way in the smooth movement of production and related activities. Mr. Khalid said that despite the lockdown and severe restrictions being imposed on activities in several States across the country, there was no serious shortage of raw materials or major problems related to the movement of finished products. No flight of workers The restrictions in the movement of people and the possibility of what was previously perceived as a lockdown had not resulted so far in the flight of workers from other States. The availability of workers was normal and most industrial units were operational as in normal The industries association plans to submit a formal memorandum to the government on the issue of providing vaccination to the workforce in the sector on a priority basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/msme-sector-appeals-for-vaccination-of-employees/article34435305.ece

This easy cure is known to the health authorities but they will not tell us,” goes a WhatsApp post in a group. As the second wave of the pandemic rages, the social media has once again gone berserk with forwards of all hues ranging from the personal experiences of the infected to doomsday predictions and unverified and unscientific cures. Seized of the potential pandemonium that social media can unleash during an atmosphere surcharged with the fear of the pandemic, the police are combing the virtual world for scaremongering and mischievous posts. “From what we have seen so far, at least 80% of social media posts are narrations of health and medical professionals about the consequences of the pandemic and the personal experiences of the ones infected. With new mutants of the virus evolving about which little is known, there is also the challenge of not being able to conclusively verify or deny many accounts,” said ADGP Manoj Abraham, who is also the nodal officer of the Kerala Police Cyberdome. 20 cases registered The Cyberdome continues to comb the social media with tools that throw up the pandemic-related posts using the relevant search keys. Since the onset of the second wave, 20-odd cases have been registered against social media posts found serious and damaging, including posts passing off mass cremations from elsewhere as happening in Kerala. “We invoke IPC Section 153 (wantonly causing provocation with intent to cause riot) and relevant Sections of the IT Act. In the case of a more benign variant of posts mostly born out of ignorance, we ask them to take them down,” said Mr. Abraham. Special wing The Ernakulam Rural Police have formed a special wing to monitor the social media. “Last year, we registered around 25 cases. During the second wave, we haven’t yet come across any serious transgressions but mostly harmless ones. Wherever found necessary, we intervene and communicate with the social media group admins concerned and even social media platforms,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). The cyber police sources, who have infiltrated some WhatsApp groups, said that even forwards related to the pandemic had assumed political overtones. “For instance, the biggest back and forth going on in groups now is over the vaccine drive. Respective camp followers of the Central and State governments bombard groups with forwards putting the blame on each other for the disrupted vaccination drive,” an officer said.  We invoke IPC Section 153 and relevant Sections of the IT Act. Manoj Abraham ADGP||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/social-media-under-police-scanner/article34435312.ece

The study conducted in the Maneed panchayat in Ernakulam district through interviews with members of around 644 families just as the COVID-19 lockdown was being imposed in 2020, showed that the proportion of young women (aged 18-40 years) who are employed is less than half of the employed men. The numbers are 33% for women and 70% for men. The work participation rate for men is 100% in the 36-40 age group and 91% in the age group of 31-35 years. Thus, almost all the young men aged above 30 years are employed while only 45% of the women in the same age group are employed. Even in the 26-30 age group, 87% of the men are employed as against just 41% among women, said the study titled ‘Gender Analysis of Labour Market Outcomes’ led by Rakkee Thimothy, Anagha C.R., Swathy, Mohanan, Jayan K.M. and Bibin Thambi. While there is no much difference in work participation of men between Schedule Caste and forward communities, there is a significant difference in the female work participation between these two groups (27% for SC and 40% for general category). This implies that women belonging to the SC category are particularly disadvantaged in their access to employment. Service sector has emerged as the main employment provider. The sector accounts for the majority of the employment in the study village, partially due to its proximity to the Kochi city. While 79% of the employed women are in the service sector, only 49% of men work in the service sector. Nearly half of the women in the service sector are employed in education and health care sectors. On the other hand, 44% of the employed men are engaged in the secondary sector, which includes manufacturing and construction, as against just 18% of employed women. Just two per cent of men and one per cent of women are engaged in agriculture and allied sectors. It has also emerged that women unemployment is a pressing problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gender-difference-in-labour-market-stark/article34435371.ece

The investigation team probing the case had capped the days-long interrogation of the accused by arranging a session in the presence of his wife and her sister and husband on Wednesday in an effort to create some drama and flush out familial emotions and break him in the process. “But he was absolutely emotionless even as his wife and relatives ended up emotionally drained. It turns out that he wasn’t even emotionally connected to his wife. They now suspect that he had been plotting the entire thing for long and are connecting the dots about his actions and conversations in the lead-up. Police had also all along suspected that he had planned and plotted it all much in advance,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). The police had been questioning him from the very first day of his 10-day custody and even when he was taken across the borders to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Goa for evidence collection. The investigation team remains confident that the information that they have extracted so far could be adequate to seal the case. With regard to the mystery surrounding the presence of alcohol in the body of the 13-year-old that was found on Muttar river a day after she had gone missing, the police now suspect that the accused could have spiked her drink. “The victim was very fond of coca-cola and used to take it whenever she had snacks from outside. So, possibly, he could have spiked her drink before smothering her and then taking her in an unconscious state from their apartment. “Eyewitness accounts state that he was found carrying the girl on his shoulders. Besides, we had also found a bottle in his car,” said Mr. Nagaraju. The accused will be produced in court on Thursday when his police custody is set to end. The police will seek a further four days’ custody for extracting as much information as possible to tie up the loose ends.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sanu-mohan-unmoving-in-confrontational-meet-with-wife/article34435813.ece

A team of nine cops at the State Police Media Centre (SPMC) who were behind the 'hand-wash dance' is the brains this time as well. If the first video was in tune with the State government’s campaign 'Break the Chain,' the latest one is in line with the 'Crush the Wave' campaign launched as the second wave of the pandemic rages on.    #keralapolice #statepolicemediacentre #covid #coviddance #covid19 #police pic.twitter.com/Rb9RyV3Egv  Brainstorming “When the State government came up with the campaign to crush the second wave, we did a collective brainstorming on how to help the cause. We felt that youngsters below 30 should be targeted for better COVID-19 protocol and thus the concept was developed around the Tamil chart-buster ‘Enjoy Enjaami’ by singer Dhee and rapper Arivu. The song is a huge hit with that segment,” said V.P. Pramod Kumar, deputy director, SPMC. Wife of Hemanth R. Nair, one of the cops at SPMC who cranked the camera as well for the one-and-a-half-minute-long video, penned the lines along the tune of the number that has shades of African folk music. Two other teams were engaged for singing and recording the number and another for choreography. The dance was performed by nine cops, including five women basketball players, three from the control room and one from the State Industrial Security Force. The video essentially urges the public to crush the second wave of the pandemic by adopting a new lifestyle of wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing and to go for vaccination. Any slip-up could be potentially fatal, it warns. “It was developed and completed in three days and was uploaded on all four social media accounts of SPMC – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube – on Tuesday evening around 7 p.m,” said Mr. Kumar. Since then, it has attracted 17,000 likes, nearly 10,000 shares, and nearly 4 lakh views and counting on Facebook alone.

This was after the police noticed such a tendency within the rural limits. K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural), urged the public to avoid it at a time when infections were soaring. Those who had undergone tests should leave their homes only if the results returned negative, he said. Migrant workers have been asked to avoid crowding while waiting for someone to hire their labour, since the lack of physical distancing was potentially dangerous. Mr. Karthik urged people in need of their service to hire them from their places. Continuing the crackdown on COVID-19 protocol violations, the Ernakulam Rural Police on Wednesday registered 120 cases, arrested 30 and seized four vehicles. Besides, action was taken against 2,325 persons for not wearing masks and 2,010 for not maintaining physical distance. Motorist arrested The Aluva East police arrested a motorist on Wednesday for driving his car after removing the barrier demarcating a containment zone in the second ward of Choornikkara panchayat.

Of the fresh cases, as many as 2,909 persons including three health workers contracted the virus through local transmission. The test positivity rate for the day stood at 27.14%. Among the local bodies, Kottayam municipality continued to lead the tally with 396 cases, followed by Kanjirappally with 126 cases. Pambadi reported 82 cases while Ramapuram had 73 cases. With 4,285 recoveries, the district currently has 15,618 active cases while 51,810 are under surveillance. To ensure smooth functioning of the COVID first-line treatment centres in the local bodies, the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has allotted an advance fund of Rs. 1.22 crore to 34 local bodies in Kottayam. The fund stipulates allocation of Rs. 5 lakh each to the municipalities and block panchayats, while the gramapanchayats will get Rs. 3 lakh each. Accordingly, 24 panchayats will get a total of Rs. Rs. 72 lakh while the remaining amount will be allotted among the six municipalities and four block panchayats. The district currently has 774 micro-containment zones across the 74 local bodies. In view of the rising cases, the district administration and the Health department have embarked on a plan to augment the facilities for caseload management. As part of it, bed strength across the district will be increased by opening more COVID second-line treatment centres (SLTCs), first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) and Domiciliary Care Centers (DCCs). This will be in addition to raising the number of beds in two COVID hospitals—General Hospital, Kottayam and Govt. Medical College Hospital (GMCH) at Gandhinagar. Of the 177 oxygen-supported beds cumulatively in the GMCH and Kottayam GH, as many as 153 have already been filled with patients. Taking into account the increasing demand, 494 oxygen-supported beds have been arranged in five SLTCs, besides beds with ICU facility, invasive and non-invasive ventilators and HFNCs (High Flow Nasal Cannulas). As per the current plans, a total of 1,000 beds will be arranged in the SLTCs, 1,600 beds in FLTCs, and 200 beds in DCCs if the caseload rises up to 20,000.  2,909 persons, including three health workers, contract the virus through contact||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sharp-rise-in-kottayam-caseload/article34435379.ece

The varsity announced its plans to open the lab during the annual budget 2021-22 and also set apart two crore rupees for the purpose. The proposal has now received a major shot in the arm with the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) now granting an additional amount of Rs. 1.86 crore for the proposal. The amount was sanctioned on the basis of a project proposal submitted by a team of scientists led by the Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas and Pro-VC C.T. Aravinda Kumar. The project, according to officials, is line with a long-standing demand by the food processing sector in the region. Upon receiving the NABL accreditation, it will offer services including Nutritional Labelling, Food Quality Analysis, Mineral Analysis and Pesticide Residue Analysis, besides also ensuring the quality of food products for export.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mgu-to-open-food-testing-lab/article34435307.ece
29 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Police heighten vigil in Kozhikode||With Kozhikode district being on top of the chart in the number of COVID-19 cases being reported daily, the police have strengthened vigilance. Stringent action is being taken against those venturing out of homes unnecessarily, especially in critical containment zones. As many as 1,306 cases were reported in the district on Wednesday for violation of the COVID-19 protocol. Most cases were against those who did not wear masks properly, and around 1,200 people were slapped with fines. The remaining cases pertained to failure in maintaining physical distancing, crowding, and delay in closing shops. TPR goes up Meanwhile, the number of fresh cases in the district came down slightly on Wednesday, though the test positivity rate (TPR) went up. The district recorded 4,317 new cases, while the TPR stood at 27.17%. Among the new cases are six who came from abroad and 15 who returned from other States. The source is unknown in 106 cases, while 4,190 people contracted the infection through local transmission. At the same time, 1,487 people were cured of the disease on Wednesday. At present, there are 37,467 COVID-19 patients in Kozhikode. Collector’s order The District Collector has directed all local bodies to ensure that the COVID-19 protocol is strictly followed in every locality. It includes extra restrictions in containment zones, critical containment zones, and micro containment zones based on the number of cases being reported. It is necessary to follow the Health Department guidelines to stop the spread of the disease, the Collector said. He called upon religious and cultural leaders to ensure that the restrictions are strictly implemented. A 20-member voluntary group should be formed under every ward-level rapid response team. Those who have been in contact with patients should be isolated and kept under observation. If they cannot be home-quarantined, they shall be shifted to domiciliary care centres, the Collector said. Covin portal There have been complaints that the registration for vaccination through the Covin portal was not smooth. The available slots filled up very fast, and many found the process frustrating. The Health Department has come up with a list of centres where vaccines will be administered on Thursday. So far, 1,02,463 people have been administered two doses of the vaccine in the district. A total of 5,28,709 doses have been administered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-heighten-vigil-in-kozhikode/article34435319.ece
29 April 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Flight movement from Calicut airport hit||Flight movements from the Calicut International Airport are being regulated, with several nations, especially Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, effecting COVID-19 travel restrictions. The second wave of the pandemic has resulted in major disruption of flight operations since last week. Passengers from north Kerala are the worst hit after GCC nations like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Kuwait banned the entry of Indians. Only Qatar and Bahrain operate flights to Doha and Bahrain respectively. However, some flights based on bilateral agreements like air bubble are getting cancelled. Sources said airline companies were cancelling scheduled flights even in the air bubble category. Nevertheless, repatriation flights are flying down passengers from the UAE and Saudi Arabia, they added. Several international flights were abruptly cancelled in the last three days. At the same time, chartered flights continue to operate in some Gulf sectors, it is learnt. Meanwhile, domestic flights are being operated without restrictions from the Calicut airport. However, minor changes have impacted their schedules. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has already brought out its summer schedule for airports that is relevant till October 30. Also, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has prolonged the cap on home airfare. Previously, it was slated till April 30, but it has now been extended to May 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/flight-movements-from-calicut-airport-severely-hit/article34435317.ece
29 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Blood donation in full swing to prevent shortage||Anticipating a severe shortage of blood once the COVID-19 vaccination for those aged below 45 starts, various organisations in Kozhikode have volunteered to donate blood. Kerala Blood Donors’ Forum president Dr. Sribaiji M.K. said a crisis was unlikely if blood donation progresses in the present pace. Around a month ago, the Health Department had alerted the district administration about shortage of blood, especially after a fall in the number of people turning up at hospitals to donate blood following the spread of COVID-19. At the same time, blood bank officials have been making serious efforts to maximise donation by mobilising various organisations. Consequently, several student and youth organisations, community-based bodies, and political outfits have been organising camps over the last two weeks. Most donors are of the age group of 18 to 45. It is this group that will receive COVID-19 vaccines from May 1. Since those who receive the vaccine shall not donate blood within 28 days, a crisis was anticipated. “There has been a drop in the number of surgeries owing to the pandemic situation, whereas blood is required mainly for deliveries, the reason why we could manage with a meagre supply,” said Hashim Kadakkalakam, a member of the forum. Organisations such as Trauma Care, Angels, and Kudumbashree have recently had their members donate blood at the blood bank at Women and Children’s Hospital at Kottaparamba. “Even private hospital blood banks are getting fresh stock these days. There is demand for blood, and the public should make sure it is met,” Dr. Baiju said, adding that voluntary donation should become the norm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/blood-donation-in-full-swing-to-prevent-shortage/article34435321.ece
29 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Countdown begins for counting of votes||Both the CPI(M)-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF are keeping their fingers crossed as the countdown begins for counting of votes of the State Assembly elections on Sunday. Whatever be the outcome, it will certainly have transformative implications on leaders and the political parties they are leading. The re-election of the incumbent Left-led coalition regardless of its five-year conduct in office will strengthen the plausibility of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan becoming much more of a competent leader than V.S. Achuthanandan, who was at the helm during 2006-2011. Overmastering force Mr. Vijayan will be an overmastering force in the party just as he tactically vanquished his rivals on an equal footing to him in the run-up to the polls. Also, making him the second Chief Minister to enjoy a continuum of power after C. Achutha Menon, whose two terms extended from November 1969 to March 1977. In case of a defeat, Mr. Vijayan’s leadership within the party will be questioned, especially his style of functioning and impelling a norm to exclude two-time contestants, thereby denying tickets to five Ministers and benching over 30 of its sitting legislators. Then a strange turn of fate also awaits the tie-up between the Kerala Congress (M) and the Left alliance. Whichever way the electorate goes, the Congress will undoubtedly see a rejig of its organisational set-up. A win will possibly eclipse the ‘A’ group in the party that is now being led by ageing leaders, according to Congress sources. Calling the shots Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala along with AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal may call the shots within the party in the State. At the same time, the Congress will also be faced with feisty challengers, such as the IUML, within the coalition. In case of a reversal in the UDF’s electoral fortunes, it may also witness the exodus of its grass-roots workers and middle-rung activists to other parties, particularly the BJP. As for the BJP, the party has nothing to lose even if it fails to retain the lone Nemom constituency despite generating a lot of hullabaloo in the campaign. But it will be a setback for the State leadership. A reason is that the Central leadership knows that the vote share of the party will be intact or even rise in the Assembly election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/countdown-begins-for-counting-of-votes/article34435386.ece
29 April 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||The Koran is at her fingertips||Fathima Raihana is 11 years old, and she can memorise the Quran. Her achievement may not be unique among girls from across the world who memorise the Quran. But it is certainly a creditable feat in Kerala, as she is the youngest girl to memorise the Quran in the State. A student of Madin Academy in Malappuram, Fathima began memorising the Quran while she was in Standard 2. What attracted her to the scripture was its beauty of recitation. She used to listen keenly to her mother recite and teach the Quran when she was very small. Before she turned seven, Fathima had learned one of the 30 Juz of the Quran. She remembers the gift she got from Madin chairman Sayed Ibrahim Khaleel Bukhari when she learned one Juz by heart. “It was that award from Sayed Bukhari that inspired me and prodded me to memorise the entire Quran,” she said. When she became eight years old, Fathima memorised one third of the Quran. More than her eyes, she trusted and banked on her ears in her endeavour. “Rather than reading from the Quran, listening to the beautiful recitation from the Quran helped me memorise the verses,” she added. When COVID-19 wreaked havoc across the world, Fathima converted the hard times to her convenience by sharply focusing on her objective. “I made use of the lockdown to complete the 30 Juz,” she said. Hailing from Kunnamangalam in Kozhikode district, it was her passion for the Quran that brought her to Madin Academy. She joined Madin Q Land, the Quran institute for girls, and did it proud by being the youngest girl to memorise the holy book. She had attended the Shaikha Fatima Bin Mubarak International Holy Quran Competition held in Dubai two years ago. “On listening to the various styles of Quranic recitations at that competition, I took a pledge to complete memorising the Quran as soon as I could,” she said. According to Sayed Ibrahim Khaleel Bukhari, it was Fathima’s determination and persistence, apart from God’s grace, that helped her memorise the scripture at a young age. Owner of a beautiful voice, Fathima also dabbles in drawing and painting. Daughter of Zainuddin Nisami and V.P. Hajara, this Standard VI student aspires to become a doctor. Among those who congratulated her on her achievement were Indian Grand Mufti Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliar, Kerala Haj Committee chairman C. Mohammed Faizi, and former Haj Committee chairman A.K. Abdul Hameed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/youngster-with-the-quran-at-her-fingertips/article34435309.ece

29 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KU campus sees ‘green’ shoots of change||Despite having no consolidated system for waste collection, the Karyavattom campus of the University of Kerala has been witnessing localised efforts in moving towards green protocol of late. Following the footsteps of various study departments that managed to transform themselves into zero-waste institutions, hostels on the campus have also ventured into efforts to adopt sustainable practices such as source-level segregation of waste materials. The women researchers’ hostel, one of the five hostels on the campus, has successfully undertaken a plastic collection drive that has enabled its authorities to prevent plastic burning on its backyard. Through the ‘pilot project’, the hostel that has 129 inmates could collect over 1,500 plastic covers from the rooms as well as the hostel mess within a month. According to hostel secretary Vinumol Devassy, a research scholar, plastic covers were collected, washed and dried floor-wise. Sanitary workers later collected these on a weekly basis. A large number of medicine covers, brushes and plastic bottles were also collected separately. The waste items also comprised numerous hand sanitiser containers. ‘Green’ Vishu “Despite teething problems, the endeavour has made inmates conscious against littering irresponsibly. The washed and dried plastics, which otherwise would have been burnt, were packed and handed over to the plastic waste collection centre run by the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation in Kazhakuttom,” she said. The first signs of change were visible recently when the hosteliers opted for a ‘green’ Vishu by avoiding the use of plastic leaves and disposable glasses for the sadhya . The hosteliers have now recommended a centralised system to manage plastic wastes from the five university hostels that houses around 800 postgraduate students and researchers. A nodal officer was also vital for monitoring the mechanism and constantly evaluating its progress. The students also mooted a total ban on plastic burning on the Karyavattom campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ku-campus-sees-green-shoots-of-change/article34435913.ece

This is yet another new high for the State, and with the case graph still climbing, these figures may be overtaken in the coming days. The average test positivity rate (TPR) in the State, which was a little over 19% a week ago, has risen to 25.34%. The State’s active case pool now has 2,66,646 patients. However, just 8.5% of the diseased are ending up in hospitals during the second wave. A chunk of the COVID-19 cases in the State are mild and being isolated at home or institutions, providing some relief to the health system. The number of COVID patients currently being treated in hospitals in the State is 22,726, with 4,436 persons newly admitted on Wednesday. At present, a total of 5,28,407 persons have been put on home or institutional isolation. ICU admissions up ICU admissions, however, continue to rise and, as on Wednesday, the State has 1,528 critically ill patients who are being cared for in ICUs, while those requiring ventilator assistance has risen to 535. The cumulative case burden of the State ever since the pandemic began, now stands at 14,95,377 cases. With the State easing up on the discharge policy and letting people out of hospitals/institutions once their clinical symptoms subside, it has seen a surge in recoveries in the past two days.

29 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Vaccination likely to go full swing from today||COVID-19 vaccination is expected to go full swing on Thursday, even as the district is waiting for word on fresh vaccine supplies which would be required to sustain the vaccination programme. The district received 20,000 doses on Tuesday and this will be administered via 114 public health facilities. On Wednesday, 7,823 vaccine doses were administered in the district, which included 7,156 doses of Covishield and 667 doses of Covaxin. In all, 4,008 people received their second dose of Covishield, and 190 people, the second dose of Covaxin. A total of 2,472 people received their first Covishield jab, and 459, the Covaxin jab. As many as 694 front-line workers also received their second dose, which included 676 Covishield and 18 Covaxin doses. Vaccination was held smoothly in five sessions at the Jimmy George Stadium where the health officials had introduced strict time-slot management to manage the crowds, health officials said. Health officials are hoping to administer 15,000 doses, which would include around 500 doses of Covaxin, on Thursday. Of this, 2,000 Covishield doses will be supplied to the Jimmy George Indoor Stadium. The Covaxin doses will be issued through three facilities including the Fort Taluk Hospital and Coastal Specialty Hospital, Valiyathura. Private health facilities are unlikely to receive vaccine allocation from this supply. Meanwhile, health officials here are also waiting for word on fresh supplies to keep the vaccination moving forward. Not confirmed A senior health official said that a supply of one lakh doses is likely to arrive on Thursday, but this yet to be confirmed. “'We have not received any confirmation yet. But it is likely that supply will be for the four southern districts combined. And it is also not clear what the quota for the Thiruvananthapuram district will be,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccination-likely-to-go-full-swing-from-today/article34435923.ece

In an order issued on Monday, the LSGD has listed out the kind of projects that can be taken up under this. The setting up of care centres to isolate patients gets the first priority. This includes civil works, purchase of materials needed for the CFLTCs, secondary care centres and DCCCs, purchase of medicines, wages for those who are appointed on a temporary basis to these centres, provision for food and drinking water, cleaning expenses, and purchase of cleaning materials. Funds can also be spent on ward-level activities including awareness campaigns.  Another priority task is the disinfection of public spaces and institutions and purchase of the materials needed for this. The local bodies have to ensure facilities for COVID testing and vaccination at the health centres under its control. Sufficient numbers of ambulances also have to be ensured for the transport of patients for testing and treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lsgis-to-roll-out-annual-plan/article34435396.ece
29 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Vaccine for Milma staff sought||The Kerala Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma) has urged the State government to administer the COVID-19 vaccine on a priority basis to Milma employees across the State. Over 3,000 employees are engaged in the procurement and processing of milk, a high-risk, but essential service that ensures uninterrupted supply of milk to millions of households in the State, Milma said in a statement on Wednesday. Milma chairman P. A. Balan raised the demand in separate letters to Dairy Development Minister K. Raju and Health K. K. Shylaja. Mr. Balan urged them to make immediate arrangements for the vaccination of Milma employees working in the apex units and the three regional unions of the dairy cooperative major. Given the gravity of the situation, the regional unions of Milma are prepared to bear the expenses of the vaccination programme for its workforce, Milma said. Every day, the employees of Milma and its three regional unions procure over 14 lakh litres of milk from over 3,500 primary dairy co-operatives across the length and breadth of the State, Mr. Balan said. “'Right from the outbreak of the pandemic, they have been carrying out their duties facing high risk, without causing any disruption to the milk supply. Considering the importance of the task entrusted with Milma, the government had declared it as an essential service. Now that the second wave of the pandemic has hit hard, it is crucial to take urgent steps to organize the vaccination programme for the workers in this vital sector on a priority basis,” Mr. Balan said. Milma has also called for a decentralised vaccination mechanism for the employees. The staff, who are in the 18-58 age group, are located in as many as 20 units across the State. Many of them work in different shifts in facilities that function round-the-clock. The authorities should make arrangements for organising the vaccination programme in each unit of the co-operative network, the Milma chairman said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccine-for-milma-staff-sought/article34435924.ece

Kiran (30) was playing weekend cricket with friends at Thrikkannapuram, a leafy suburb in the outskirts of the city when a police drone buzzed him. The incident had occurred during the fag-end of the national lockdown last year. The drone swooped low, and the players dispersed, he says. Kiran says now the hum of the low-flying police drones is ubiquitous again in his neighbourhood after a hiatus of nearly six months. The pandemic has intensified, and with it, the whirring drones. Main target Additional Director General of Police Manoj Abraham tells The Hindu that the law enforcement's swarm of aerial vehicles has taken to the skies in the State to persuade citizens to adhere to the COVID-19 pandemic code. He says they are the department's "eye in the sky" during the worrying second wave. Mr. Abraham says the aim is not to identify or prosecute individuals but to remind citizens not to throng public spaces and remain indoors. The police have kitted out the drones with sirens, flashing lights and speakers (to broadcast orders). The machines have night-vision capability and can operate after dark. Force multiplier Another officer says the police primarily deployed drones over beaches, parks and far-flung neighbourhoods to scan for gatherings. "The drones serve more as reminders than remotely controlled robotic enforcers", he says. The drones are a force multiplier for police stations with challenging terrain to cover during the outbreak. The police also use them to monitor fish landing centres, harbours, inland waterways, lagoons and islets. Privacy factor Another senior officer says drones are unlikely to be an entrenched feature of policing like patrol vans. The pandemic had necessitated their return. The police are, however, mindful that incessant drone surveillance can raise questions about privacy and possibly trigger a public backlash. Law enforcement has reserved the use of drones for emergencies, adds the officer.

Prohibitory orders have been issued in Kalliyoor, Athiyannoor, Parassala and Madavoor panchayats as the test positivity rate has crossed 25%, District Collector Navjot Khosa said. In these panchayats, not more than five people may assemble for functions in places of worship and public places. The number should not exceed 25 for marriages and other public functions. Moreover, such events should be registered in advance on the COVID-19 Jagratha portal. Commercial establishments other than those selling provisions, fruits and vegetables and medical stores and petrol pumps should down shutters by 7.30 p.m. Dining will be allowed in restaurants till 7.30 p.m. Take-away and parcel services are allowed till 9 p.m. The COVID-19 guidelines should be strictly followed in workplaces, the Collector said. Inspections will be carried out in commercial establishments, and if violations are detected, they can be ordered to down shutters for two days or more, Ms. Khosa said. The district administration has already imposed restrictions by invoking Section 144 in the Neyyatinkara and Nedumangad municipalities, and the following 29 grama panchayats; Vembayam, Anadu, Pallikkal, Pullampara, Pothencode, Kanjiramkulam, Kulathur, Kottukal, Tholikode, Mangalapuram, Vellarada, Maranalloor, Chenkal, Pallichal, Malayinkeezhu, Vilavoorkal, Vellanad, Vakkom, Poovachal, Balaramapuram, Aruvikkara, Amboori, Karode, Perumkadavila, Kattakada, Andoorkonam, Kollayil, Uzhamalckal and Aryancode.

29 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSEB puts COVID-19 measures in place||With Kerala grappling with the second wave of COVID-19, the State’s power sector has introduced a slew of measures for guaranteeing 24x7 power supply without putting the lives of the employees at risk. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), which employs 33,000 people, has directed the staff to keep physical contact with the public to a minimum and strictly adhere to COVID-19 guidelines. Field offices have been advised to accept applications for general services such as new electricity connections via the online mode. They have also been told to regulate consumer footfall and encourage electricity consumers to pay their bills online.  Robust defence The KSEB, which has 1.3 crore consumers, is attempting to put up a robust defence against the virus as the bulk of its 33,000 staff—sub engineers, cashiers, overseers, linemen, meter readers and electricity workers—are people who come into contact with the public on a daily basis. As part of the precautionary measures, the State-run power utility has revived the electrical section ‘out-centres’/extended offices to cut down staff presence in the field offices and ensure prompt response to power outages. Under this decentralised system, a small group of KSEB staff, notably those tasked with repairs, will be stationed in temporary offices opened in schools, anganwadis or buildings owned by residents’ associations. Safe billing They need not report for duty at the main office every day. This will help to keep contact among the KSEB staff to a minimum, KSEB chairman and managing director N. S. Pillai says. “We had successfully experimented with the system during the initial outbreak last year. We have revived it given the surge in COVID-19 cases,” he says. If billing activities in the containment/micro containment zones are hit, the consumers can snap a photo of the reading in the meter and submit it. Bills will be prepared on the basis of this information, an April 22 notification issued by the KSEB says. In section offices with two cashiers, one cash counter will be open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kseb-puts-covid-19-measures-in-place/article34435914.ece

With students in these classes attending digital lessons for the whole year and no annual examinations to test them in the wake of COVID-19, the General Education Department felt the need to evaluate students on the learning outcomes of the First Bell digital classes and its follow-up activities. Besides continuous evaluation under which students are to be graded on participation in academic activities, unit reviews, products or write-ups prepared by them, and assignments completed, a year-end evaluation will also be conducted. Grades Grades will be awarded to students on the basis of the two evaluations. A promotion list is to be prepared on their basis and published by May 20. The tool used by the Department for the year-end evaluation is the learning excellence record. The records will be delivered to schools through the block resource centres of the Samagra Shiksha. Steps are also under way so that students can get the records from the schools. Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, Project Director A.P. Kuttykrishnan says the learning excellence record, prepared with academic support from the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), is on the lines of a book. For elementary school students with limited subjects, the record is not very elaborate. For high school students who have subjects ranging from Malayalam and English to Social Science and Mathematics, the record has nearly 200 pages with space provided for activity-oriented questions or writing notes on whatever has been taught to them this academic year. Students will not have to answer all questions in the record, only a certain number of them However, the record is more than an evaluation tool, says Mr. Kuttykrishnan. It will help teachers understand how effective the academic activities taken up in the past year were, identify the learning gaps, and find ways of addressing these through classes or any other support in the coming academic year, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/learning-records-to-be-used-to-evaluate-students/article34435915.ece

The State police detained him from Goa on suspicion of staging the attack to stoke voter sympathy. Mr. Varghese had caused a stir by alleging early on polling day that unknown persons had waylaid him and torched his car. The incident had occurred at Kannanelloor. However, the police reportedly found no corroborative evidence. When pressed about the case, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the police would unravel the mystery behind the fire-raising. The case had political ramifications. Mr. Varghese had pitted himself against Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma, the CPI(M) candidate in Kundara, allegedly in a fit of pique against the government. Mr. Varghese, who "headed" the US-based commercial fishing firm, EMCC International, had claimed to have struck an agreement with the government to build 400 deep-sea trawlers and seven motherships to harvest the State's marine wealth. His "revelation" during the election campaign threatened to dent the LDF's standing among traditional fisherfolk. Fishers are deemed a critical demographic in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/election-day-arson-attack-takes-new-turn/article34435394.ece

A private notified hospital has allegedly charged Rs. 4.50 lakh for 12 vials of Remdesivir injections for a man and his son. This injection is used to treat moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 and the price fixed by the government for each vial(100 mg) is a mere Rs. 2,500. The patient was aware that he was being cheated but that was not the time for him to argue with the hospital administration and risk the life of his son and that of his own. The COVID hospitals and wards, being out of bounds for family members and relatives, seem to be giving an added advantage to the such hospitals to carry on their clandestine activities. A private hospital in the city was caught by the authorities recently for trying to divert Remdesivir injections to the black market through its staff. The drug was written in the prescriptions, though it was not required for the patients concerned, and the injection vials were shifted out of the hospital for sale at high rates. This seems to be only the tip of the iceberg, with patients telling their near and dear ones of similar practices at some other hospitals. The relatives of patients are also against lodging complaints with the authorities as they fear that such a move could result in the patients not getting proper treatment.  ‘Stocks available’ The officials, however, say that adequate stocks of Remdesivir injections are available and being supplied to the private empanelled hospitals, depending on their requirement. To curb such malpractices, the State government has recently brought out a SOP (standard operation procedure) for procurement of Remdesivir through the office of drug controller. “On April 27, we received 2,695 vials of Remdesivir and 1,274 injections were distributed to 29 notified hospitals in the district, on the basis of allotment made by the District Medical and Health Officer, Visakhapatnam. The situation is being monitored on a daily basis. At present, there are 46 notified private hospitals, and if the district administration notifies some more hospitals, they can be supplied the injections,” K. Rajitha, Assistant Director, Drugs Control Administration, told The Hindu on Wednesday. “Visakhapatnam district has been allotted another 1,152 Remdesivir injections, which are expected to arrive by Wednesday night,” she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/private-hospitals-cashing-in-on-misery-of-patients-allege-kin/article34435997.ece
29 April 2021||Bengaluru/Belagavi,ANDHRA PRADESH||Row after Minister asks farmer to ‘die’||Food and Civil Supplies Minister Umesh Katti has landed in a controversy, with an audio of him asking a farmer to “die” going viral. The telephone conversation has Mr. Katti telling a farmer association member in Gadag that it is “better you die” when he asked the Minister if people “should live or die” with the government reducing the quantum of rice in the Public Distribution System. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has expressed regret about the episode and said that Mr. Katti should not have spoken in this manner as a Minister. He also promised to provide five kg of rice per month instead of three kg for people of Belagavi region.  Meanwhile, the Opposition demanded Mr. Katti’s resignation. KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar said Mr. Yediyurappa should sack the Minister from the Cabinet for showing insensitivity to people who are facing problems due to the pandemic and lockdown. A similar demand was made by JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy. Mr. Katti, on his part, said that he was “forced to say some unwanted words” as he was “provoked” by the young caller. He neither tendered an apology, nor expressed his regret over his remarks.  “A person claiming to be a farmers’ leader called me on Wednesday, and asked why the government was reducing the allotment of rice to poor families. I told him that we had reduced the quantity of rice to 2 kg from 5 kg, but had provided ragi instead. He asked what was being given in North Karnataka where people do not eat rice, and I said jowar will be given in the coming months. But he kept pestering me. The farmer asked should we die and I said it would be a better option. I had to say it as the caller pushed me to it,” Mr. Katti said, defending himself. “No one should die of starvation in the State. But then no one should speak like that, either,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/row-after-minister-asks-farmer-to-die/article34435066.ece
29 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Guntur police bust Remdesivir racket||Guntur Urban Police cracked a racket involving medical representatives and wholesale drug dealers who were selling Remdesivir in the black market, here on Wednesday. The State government had mandated that Remdesivir can be sold only at authorised hospitals, and had banned over-the-counter sales. However, some individuals and firms, hoping to exploit the demand for the drug, began to hoard it and sell it in the black market. “Following reports of rampant black marketing of the injection vials, the police began an investigation. Kothapet SHO Rajasekhara Reddy led a decoy operation, in which the police traced the chain of black marketers. A sting operation was conducted and the police managed to strike a deal with Ankamma Rao for getting six vials for Rs. 2.28 lakh. After Ankamma Rao was taken into custody, he revealed details about his operation. Police later arrested Ratna Raju, who confessed that he bought the injections from Nune Gurnadham for Rs. 26,000 a piece, and the latter admitted that he got it from a pharmacy shop at Guntur Kidney Care Centre, in which a sales personnel Krishnaveni was selling each injection for Rs. 20.000 a piece,” Superintendent of Police R.N. Ammireddy said. He said stringent action would be taken against those resorting to black marketing of Remdesivir.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/guntur-police-bust-remdesivir-racket/article34435991.ece

As on date, the positivity rate in district is 15.2 % as against 1.5 % in the month of March. According to District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) P. Suryanarayana, the positivity rate from urban and semi-urban areas of the district is around 18 %. The positivity rate in rural areas from Anakapalle to Payakaraopeta, is around 13%, he said.

In urban areas, it was around 2.5 %, he added. According to the Health Department officials, on a daily basis, around 4,500 tests are being conducted. Out of which 800 to 1,500 are testing positive. Among them, around 35% of people are said to be youth between 20 and 35 years of age. According to sources, the district also saw a few deaths of those in the age group of 25 to 40 years. Safety precautions “In the first wave, the youth were less affected compared to this second wave.

29 April 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Clubbed chargesheets soon in loan app fraud, say police||The Cyber Crime police of Hyderabad is all set to file clubbed chargesheets in the multi-crore alleged financial fraud involving app-based instant loan companies. The alleged fraud was perpetrated by a Chinese national and his associates based in Gurugram. Definite leads Speaking to The Hindu, an officer, who is in the know of developments, said that the investigation had come to an end and there were definite leads linking up the alleged role of the accused, which had far-reaching consequences. However, it appears the investigators were unable to trace the money trail involving the foreign nationals based in China, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. Asian countries At first instance, the police pursued the lead to link up the alleged recipients in the said foreign locations, but that did not take them to conclusive evidence, said the officers. “We know that the money was channelled to several Asian countries, but we are not sure whether the companies got investments from outside the country or not,” he said. Police had arrayed Zhu Wei alias Lambo from Jiangxi, China, and Nagaraju from Kurnool, as accused among the 22 others. Police filed 27 cases against 22 persons, including B.K. Kalappa (24), who was arrested on Wednesday. “The documentation work is on. The clubbed chargesheets (each consisting of three cases) will be filed in a fortnight at a local court, Nampally,” the officer said. During his police custody a few weeks ago, Zhu Wei disclosed that Yuan Yuan alias Jennifer, who is currently at large, had assigned him the task of operations in India and he knows nothing beyond this. He was picked up from Delhi airport while trying to flee the country in December and the police were forced to scout for interpreters as Zhu Wei claimed that he knew only Mandarin and spoke broken English. ‘Technical evidence’ “We have enough technical evidence to prove his and others’ role in the financial fraud, which claimed the life of at least seven persons in the State,” police said. The app-based instant loan companies were lending money at a high interest rate and harassing defaulters through coercive methods. In the last week of December, police roped in financial experts and data analysts to go into voluminous data pertaining to more than 1.50 crore loan transactions involving nearly Rs. 21,000 crore, apart from cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Cyberabad Cyber Crime police said that they would take time to complete the investigation into the alleged fraud and file chargesheets. “So far we have no clarity on the money route. The probe is still on,” an officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/clubbed-chargesheets-soon-in-loan-app-fraud-say-police/article34435071.ece
29 April 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Serpentine queues at COVID test centres, many turned away||At ten past 5 a.m. on Wednesday, Chintal resident Venkatesh reached State-run Nature Cure Hospital in Begumpet to get a COVID test done. He had to wait behind more than 100 people, only to get turned away at 8 a.m. This was the second time Mr. Venkatesh was turned away, as people made a queue before 4 a.m. to get the tokens, which start at 7.30 a.m. The COVID-19 tests start at 9 a.m. at two designated counters on the open grounds of Nature Cure Hospital, and since testing capacity is limited, many have to wait till afternoon to get their turn. “Unaware of the queue system, I reached the hospital at 9 a.m. on Tuesday and after learning about it, today I came at 5.10 a.m., but in vain. A friend of mine tested positive for the virus last week, and I wanted to get myself diagnosed for the safety of others and mine as well,” Mr. Venkatesh said. Like Venkatesh, hundreds of people are waiting in queues for up to 10 hours, as crowds increase and testing capacity remains the same. “We are entitled to collect the samples of only 100 people on a first-come-first-serve basis. Everyday hundreds of people form the line before 4 a.m. and most of them are turned away. We are helpless,” a staff at the COVID testing centre told The Hindu . However, on Wednesday, the hospital staff issued 120 tokens, she said. Similar is the situation at the Government Ayurvedic Hospital and Research Centre, Erragadda, where the testing capacity is 300, but almost 100 to 150 people are turned away everyday. The staff there maintain that by 7.30 a.m., they open the main gate and the security count and allow only 300 people inside, while the rest standing in the queue since dawn are turned away. By 8.20 a.m., the situation became tense as people began arguing with the security guard for not allowing them. “This has become a normal thing for me now. People who are not in the first 300, pick-up arguments as they stand in line for more than two or three hours. I have clear instructions to allow only a particular number,” a security guard said. “There were some 10 people before me, who came at 5.30 a.m. and got a chance. I was not allowed inside. Now, I cannot go to another centre as the situation is similar there and cannot afford private labs,” said Shekar, a daily wager from Borabanda. Outside the Urban Primary Health Centre on Road No. 7 of Banjara Hills, dozens of people formed a queue for their turn to get tested with a police constable monitoring the ‘lane discipline’. This is the scene at every government-run testing centre in the State capital. Private labs, on the other hand, are making people wait for two or three days since registration or stand in queues for hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/serpentine-queues-at-covid-test-centres-100s-turned-away/article34435785.ece

With the unprecedented spike, the municipal corporations of Tirupati and Chittoor, and municipalities of Srikalahasti, Puttur, Nagari, Punganur, Palamaner, Kuppam and Madanapalle have been witnessing partial lockdowns with voluntary participation of business groups, followed by night curfew. The virus spread, which was more felt in the urban areas has now reached rural areas too. Kuppam town, for the first time since March last year, witnessed eight cases on Wednesday, while Madanapalle mandal saw 251 cases. With this, uneasy situation prevailed in the villages along the Tamil Nadu and Karnataka borders. Public movement in the rural areas was also minimal, as people preferred to remain indoors unless for unavoidable errands. The police at Kanipakam, where the famous temple of Lord Varasiddi Vinayaka Swamy is located, said that after a meeting with the local traders and village elders, the business hours had been restricted from morning till afternoon. The number of devotees to the temple came down drastically owing to the pandemic’s aggressive prevalence in the neighboring States. Warned Meanwhile, Principal Senior Civil Judge (Madanapalle) Indira Priyadarshini has warned against obstructing the funeral of COVID patients. The official said it was unfortunate that reports of hostility to events were being reported from some areas in the district. As per the directions of the District Legal Services Authority, criminal cases under IPC Sections would be booked against obstruct such funerals. She appealed to the family members and relatives of COVID victims to immediately report to the local police and revenue officials in case of any resistance in performing the last rites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fear-grips-chittoor-as-daily-count-inches-close-to-2000/article34435859.ece

29 April 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Robbed and assaulted, woman jumps off train||A woman passenger suffered multiple fractures and head injuries on Wednesday as she reportedly jumped off a train in an attempt to flee from a man who first robbed her and then assaulted her in a largely deserted compartment of the Guruvayur-Punalur service. The victim, identified as Asha Murali, a regular commuter in her 30s, has been admitted to the neuro intensive care unit of a private hospital, where her condition was said to be stable. The assailant was identified as Babukuttan, a resident of Nooranad in Alappuzha district. The Government Railway Police and the Railway Protection Force along, with the local police, are on a hunt to nab him. The incident took place around 8.45 a.m. shortly after the victim, a clerk at the higher secondary regional office at Chengannur, boarded the D8 compartment of the train from the Mulanthuruthy station. Rahul, the victim's husband, said his wife was alone in the compartment when she boarded the train and the man got in from the neighbouring compartment just before the train left the station. “He closed the doors and then seated himself opposite her before snatching her mobile phone and chucking it out through the window. He then flashed a screwdriver and asked for her gold chain. She readily complied and even gave him her gold bangle.” Later, the assailant reportedly dragged her by the hair towards the washroom. It was then that she made a bid to escape through a partially opened door. She reportedly hung precariously for a while before falling off between the Mulanthuruthy and Piravom Road stations. “She was still conscious and gave my number to one of the people who rushed to her help,” said Mr. Rahul. It emerged that the assailant had a defective eye and shortly thereafter he was identified. The GRP has registered a case invoking relevant sections of IPC, including 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/robbed-and-assaulted-woman-jumps-off-train/article34435076.ece

29 April 2021||MYSURU,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tusker wins freedom, to be shifted from camp||Wild tusker Kusha, who escapade from Dubare elephant camp into the jungles to find companions had the Forest Department on tenterhooks for months, has won his freedom. His release from the camp was ordered by Forest Minister Aravind Limbavali on Wednesday after a prolonged discussion with the officials. Though captured from the wild near Chettahalli in Madikeri forest division five years ago and put in a Kraal in Dubare and tamed, it did not crush his spirit and he yearned for freedom. Tamed elephants are left free to forage in the vicinity of the camp and they invariably return. The elephants also move out for prolonged period during “musth” though they tend to return after a few weeks. But it was not the case with Kusha who went missing for almost an year, leaving camp managers tense. A search party was sent but to no avail and there were speculations that perhaps he had died or that he had crossed over to the other forest range beyond Nagarahole landscape. But, he was finally sighted in the wild in the company of other free ranging elephants. On confirming that it was Kusha, attempts were made to recapture him but the elephant resisted or invariably escaped each time. After repeated attempts, the tusker was captured with the help of four tamed elephants in March and herded back to Dubare. But not without Kusha putting up a stiff resistance. The story of his resistance and love for freedom reached animal rights activists, who called for his immediate release. A few days ago, Maneka Gandhi, MP, had called for Kusha’s release from the jungle camp. It was backed by other activists on the grounds that though captured, Kusha had escaped into the jungles and was living in the wild since a year without harming anyone. The Forest Department on its part had justified its recapture on the grounds that Kusha was originally brought to the camp five years ago to control human-elephant conflict and was not being ill-treated as alleged. The activists suggested that Kusha be radio-collared. In the meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Limbavalli approved of the suggestion and directed that Kusha be radio-collared and set free. The move was welcomed by conservationists too who had questioned the authorities for recapturing an elephant that had “settled well” in the wild, and had not harmed anyone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tusker-wins-freedom-to-be-shifted-from-camp/article34435069.ece

The number of active cases rapidly rose to a high of 17,345 as 2,605 persons contracted the infection in the last 24 hours ending 9 a.m. on Wednesday, according to a health bulletin released by the State government. Death toll The overall tally rose to over 1.49 lakh as 1,926 persons in SPSR Nellore district and 679 persons in Prakasam got infected during the period. The toll rose to 1,219 in the region with nine patients in SPSR Nellore district and three others Prakasam losing the battle against the disease. The usually-busy Bapuji market complex and Gandhi road in Ongole wore a deserted look as shops and other business establishments downed the shutters at 2 p.m. Parks and play grounds were closed down to prevent further spread. Recovery rate dips The number of new cases was higher by a whopping 2,100 in a single day as only 444 patients, including 166 in Prakasam district, recovered in the region in the past 24 hours. The recovery rate, which was about 99% last month, dipped to 88.8% on Wednesday. Long queues were seen in several session sites in the region as people thronged there to take the jab. Over 8,000 persons took the jab at the 94 session sites in Prakasam till late on Wednesday, according to reports received from session sites by the health officials here.

29 April 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tobacco growers in jitters as prices move southwards||Farmers in the traditional tobacco growing areas in Prakasam and Nellore districts are in a quandary in view of lacklustre market conditions for the second year in a row in the wake of the second wave of COVID-19 sweeping the region. It was a truncated marketing season for the farmers last year as the lockdown imposed to combat COVID-19 coincided with the auctions. As a result, Tobacco Board officials had a tough time arranging auctions in select auction platforms outside the containment zones. Now again, they are in trouble as the market price of various grades of tobacco moved southwards after starting at an encouraging price of Rs. 180 per kg during the auctions that had been delayed by about a month, especially in the Southern Light Soil (SLS) platforms. Exporters stay away “We have decided to bring only half the number of bales to the auction floors as domestic cigarette manufacturers ruled the roost and exporters kept away from the market on the pretext of lack of confirmed orders from overseas buyers,” lamented a group of farmers in Ongole II auction platform. “We will have no option but to stall the auctions completely if there is no improvement in the market conditions by first week of May,” said farmer leader V.V. Prasad. A section of the farmers was of the view that the auctions should not be boycotted at this stage as any lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of the virus would come in the way of marketing the produce, said former Tobacco Board member P. Bhadri Reddy. Market intervention Farmers have reduced by half the number of bales offered for sale to about 300 to 400 as a total boycott at this stage may go against their interests, going by the bitter experience last year. They wanted the Union Government to press into market the State Trading Corporation as domestic players drove down the prices for various grades of tobacco, taking advantage of the near absence of exporters in the market. The State government should ask the Markfed, which had for the first time entered the market to buy low-grade varieties last year, to follow suit, they said. Farmers are in an unenvious position as they could market only 16.02 million kg in the 11 auction platforms in the two districts out of the total estimated crop of 71 million kg. The growers in the Southern Black Soil (SBS) region sold 7.78 million kg, at an average price of Rs. 164.96 per kg, as on Wednesday, while their counterparts in the SLS region got an average price of Rs. 165.53 per kg for 8.24 million kg marketed till date, an auction report released by the Tobacco Board said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tobacco-growers-in-jitters-as-prices-move-southwards/article34435121.ece

29 April 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Students warn of stir to press for cancellation of exams||Andhra Pradesh Vidyarthi Joint Action Committee (APVJAC) State president Rayapatti Jagadeesh on Wednesday urged the State government to cancel the class X and Intermediate exams taking into view the rapid rise in coronavirus cases across the State. He told the media here that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy should take a cue from the Central Board of Secondary examinations(CBSE) which had already announced cancellation of class X examinations and decided to prepare the results on the basis of an objective criterion to be evolved by it. Students’ performance from class VI to IX should be taken to award grades for class X students, suggested its city general secretary P.Karthik. Exams at this time would put not only the lives of students at risk but also that of their parents and grandparents, its city convenor P.Murali pointed out. The State government should not lose sight of the fact that several States had cancelled the exams in the wake of the CBSE’s decision as coronavirus wrecked havoc, opined committee’s city organising secretary M. Nageswara Rao. Students would have no option but to agitate if the YSR Congress Party government was bent upon on conducting the exams as the opposition Telugu Desam Party backed the demand of students and their parents for cancellation of exams.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/students-warn-of-stir-to-press-for-cancellation-of-exams/article34435862.ece

Due to spurt in the COVID-19 cases, the demand for Remdesivir vials is on the raise. There are instances of a few mediators, medical distributors and hospital staff making money by selling the injections at a high price. “While the actual price of the vial is Rs. 3,000, the middlemen are selling it for Rs. 50,000 or more, depending upon the condition of the patient. There are instances of the attendants of patients purchasing the vial for Rs. 75,000,” says once such attendant at a private hospital. “Steps are being taken to check the illegal sale of Remdesivir injections in the market,” S. Ravi Shankar Narayan, Director General, Drug Control Administration (DCA), told The Hindu . “The DCA has started supply of Remdesivir vials to the COVID Hospitals as per requirement. The head of the hospital should submit a declaration in writing on the requirement every day and draw the stocks,” the DG said. “Special teams, in association with the Medical and Health and the Vigilance and Enforcement officials, have formed special teams across the State to check the black marketing of Remdesivir, and ensure supply of the vials to the needy patients in COVID hospitals,” Mr. Narayan said. “The teams will make surprise visits to the hospitals and inspect the in-patients details, indents submitted by the managements, and verify the usage of Remdesivir doses. The teams have already visited a few hospitals in the State,” he said. “The hospital management should ensure that the injections are given to the right patients and check misuse, or black marketing, of the injections, failing which action will be taken,” Mr. Narayan warned. The Union government had sanctioned 60,000 Remdesivir vials to Andhra Pradesh up to April 30. The DCA, in association with the line departments, was monitoring the supply and utilisation of the vials. We had acted on some complaints and booked the accused, Mr. Narayan said.

In such a case, the hospital concerned has either no permission to treat COVID-19 patients or is resorting to hoarding,” he said. The government had set up four oxygen generation plants, and five more would come up in Guntur, Anantapur, Vizianagaram and Nellore. “At present, over 400 tonnes of oxygen is being used per day. There are 4,700 patients at the COVID Care Centres, in which over 30,000 beds are available.

Chandrababu Naidu has asked the government to consider imposing a “limited lockdown” for a week or 10 days in the State so as to take up massive vaccination drive. The lockdown could be withdrawn once satisfactory results were obtained, Mr. Naidu said while addressing the media virtually on Wednesday. Stating that Andhra Pradesh had earned the dubious distinction of being the State that was worst-hit during the second wave of COVID-19, Mr. Naidu said, “The lives of people are in a jeopardy. The system has derailed. It is becoming difficult for people to find place at burial grounds to perform the last rites of those who succumbed to the virus.” “The government is not in a position to provide beds in hospitals, medical oxygen, ventilators and medicines to the patients. It is, however, bent on conducting the SSC and Intermediate examinations as per schedule,” Mr. Naidu said. The positivity rate in the State reached 25.8%, he added. “The neighbouring States are taking precautions to prevent the spread of virus from Andhra Pradesh. While Tamil Nadu is insisting on e-pass for entry into its territory, Odisha is closing its borders. This exposes the efficiency of the Andhra Pradesh government in tackling the situation,” Mr. Naidu observed. The government had issued several GOs in a hurry prior to the hearing of virus-related cases in the High Court, but failed to ensure their strict implementation, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/impose-limited-lockdown-to-take-up-vaccination-naidu/article34435874.ece

The government was providing motors free of cost to small and marginal farmers apart from digging borewells. About 1.50 lakh small and marginal farmers would benefit under the scheme, he said. The government would spend Rs. 5,715 crore for farmers’ benefit, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/speed-up-digging-of-borewells/article34435992.ece

29 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Wait gets longer for 18-plus citizens to book vaccine slots||Those aged between 18 and 45 years, and eager to book a slot for COVID-19 vaccination will have to wait. Telangana Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao on Wednesday said that the standard procedure regarding vaccination for that particular age group will be out in coming two days. When people register on Co-WIN website, the Health department will get an idea of the number of people keen to get the jab, said Mr Srinivasa Rao. With the pandemic raging on, eagerness among people to immunise themselves against the infectious disease has gone up. Until now, vaccination was open to only those aged 45 years or above. From May 1, anybody over the age of 18 years will be eligible for vaccination. A few days ago, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has ordered free vaccination for the population of the State, including migrant workers. However, for those in the 18-45 years age group, it will take some time as procedures regarding that are yet to be put in place. It was clarified that the State government will stop supplying the vaccines to private hospitals from May 1, based on Centre’s orders. Private hospitals have to procure vaccines on their own. Senior officials said that they will audit the vaccines currently available with the private hospitals, and how many people they have to immunise. Test if symptomatic Health department officials, who had earlier said that anyone suspecting to have contracted the infection to undergo testing, have asked people to get examined only if symptomatic so that government testing centres do not becotme breeding grounds of coronavirus. Dr Srinivasa Rao said a lot of people are getting examined out of anxiety, but they must understand that the possibility of infection rises when one waits at a testing centre along with other COVID suspects. “The tests are needed if you have symptoms such as fever, cough, cold, redness in eyes or a burning sensation, bodyaches, headaches, diarrhoea, loss or smell or taste. But some people are coming to test centres just out of panic and not maintaining precautions, even trying to cut the queue. This is leading to delay in tests for people who really need it,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/wait-gets-longer-for-18-plus-citizens-to-book-vaccine-slots/article34435768.ece

Srinivasa Rao said signs of downward trend of the cases is on the horizon. While 8,126 cases were recorded on Saturday, 10,122 were detected on Monday, and 8,061 on Tuesday. The dip in Tuesday’s caseload was possibly due to nearly 17,000 lesser tests performed than the previous day. Stating that the second wave in the State is stabilising a little, he said the next three to four weeks is important to bring the situation under control. He added that cases are not surging in Maharashtra, Delhi and other States over past few days, and a similar trend is being observed in Telangana. “It has not completely stabilised.

29 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Non-COVID patients also died at govt. hospitals: DME||After coming under severe criticism for alleged under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths, senior officials from the Health department gave a clarification on Wednesday. Director of Medical Education (DME) Dr. K. Ramesh Reddy said that along with COVID patients, non-COVID patients in critical condition too, are admitted at several such hospitals, and the deaths are a combined list of both types of patients. The DME said that regardless of the category, they are following sterilizing procedures, putting the dead in body bags and handing over to attendants who are scared despite being explained that their dear one did not have COVID. Doctors working at government hospitals have been claiming that the COVID-19 deaths are more than the numbers mentioned in the daily media bulletin. They provided information on the number of deaths at major government hospitals to make the point, which was published by multiple publications. Dr. Ramesh Reddy said that non-COVID patients too, are admitted in critical condition at Gandhi Hospital, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences, and Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, among others. “We analysed the cases and most died within 24 hours, some even within a few hours. And many more were brought dead. The patients did not die because of lack of treatment at the hospitals but because of disease progression. Regardless of the case, we follow sterilization protocols,” he said. Regarding oxygen availability, he said that since they had established 22 Liquid Oxygen Tanks at government hospitals, they are not facing issues with storage unlike other States. Once filled, the oxygen will be sufficient for 48 hours. Besides, bulk oxygen cylinders are provided to avoid any scarcity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/non-covid-patients-also-died-at-govt-hospitals-dme/article34435772.ece

Earlier, it used to be sold for nearly Rs. 800, but its price now hovers around the Rs. 2,000-mark at medical stores which only adds to the existing financial burden of people. The prices on online shopping sites range from Rs. 1,900 to Rs. 3,500. People suspected that a deliberate shortage is being created to jack up the prices. This is one of the important devices every COVID-19 patient is suggested to keep handy to measure oxygen saturation levels, a key parameter used by doctors to assess severity of the infectious disease. “As the cases started to increase, the price too increased gradually. It was hiked to Rs. 1,200, then to Rs. 1,500, and now it is being sold for Rs. 2,000. What’s more, it is not available at all medical stores.

29 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘With vaccines, we can even eliminate this pandemic’||ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) director R. Hemalatha has said that the latest data across the world has shown that vaccines taken in double dose spread over a period of few weeks is safe and efficacious in preventing severe infection even if one contracts COVID-19. “We can even eliminate this pandemic as vaccines have proven to be successful earlier, whether it was for small pox or polio. Two doses are required for a person as the first dose stimulates our immune system to generate neutralising antibodies — from seven days up to two/three or four weeks. The second dose makes it (immune response) stronger as the first one may not be potent enough to tackle the infection. Both are very important,” she asserted. The director was participating in a virtual meeting organised by the CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) ‘Campaign for COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and vaccination’ in Telugu moderated by principal scientist M. Chandrasekharam on Wednesday. IICT director S. Chandrashekar in his introductory remarks was confident of a larger population being inoculated as two more vaccines would be available by mid-May. Safety norms Even after double-dose vaccination, citizens need to observe COVID-appropriate behaviour because one is capable of spreading the virus to others. “There is a chance of mild infection even after double-dose vaccination and it is always better to take a COVID test if the symptoms are there, because the person is capable of infecting others though the chances are minimal. In one lakh persons, 40 may get infected, but they are likely to have a low viral dose and have been found to have no complications like pneumonia so they are 80-90% safe,” said Dr. Hemalatha. Menstruating women There is no sufficient evidence to show women are safer from COVID, yet they “seem to be recovering faster”. Menstruating women too can take the vaccine, but there is not much data on whether pregnant or lactating mothers can be given the doses, or even for children, because studies have been not been conducted for those categories. “It should be safe but we have no studies yet,” she said. The director advocated healthy diet of fruits, vegetables and pulses plus nuts along with lowering of cereals intake based on observation and clinical studies. Significantly, she asserted that the current surge in cases shows no difference in the way the virus is transmitting, in health complications or mortalities when compared to last year’s first wave. Atal Incubation Centre-CCMB chief executive officer N. Madhusudhana Rao said both vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) can effectively neutralise any variants prevailing in the country, including the double mutant. “Double mutant is prevalent up to 50% in Kerala and Maharashtra, but we do not have epidemiological or scientific evidence to say they are spreading more as the present surge could be due to a combination of super spreader events,” he said. “The virus does mutate but 99% are nothing to be alarmed about. The sooner we can control the spread, the faster we can halt the mutations or there is a chance of more potent strain, which could even make the vaccines ineffective too. As of now, we do not need to fear,” he maintained. IICT principal scientist S. Ramakrishna said 95% protection comes from wearing masks always when outside and even inside home if there is no proper ventilation or there is a sick person around.  Two doses are required for a person as the first dose stimulates our immune system to generate neutralising antibodies. R.

29 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High Court closes all petitions relating to LRS and BRS||Telangana High Court on Wednesday closed all petitions challenging two Government Orders (which facilitate regularisation of unapproved lay-outs and buildings constructed in violation of rules) as the Supreme Court is seized of the matter. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy passed this direction. The petitions included five PIL pleas. They sought suspension of GO 131 of Municipal Administration Department and GO 152 (Building Regularisation Scheme). The bench however extended the interim stay orders issued by it earlier in these petitions. The stay orders would be in force till the Supreme Court adjudicates the matter. “It is deemed appropriate that till the Supreme Court takes a decision in the SLP, the Telangana government will not take any coercive steps against all those persons who applied for regularisation of illegal and unauthorised lay-outs in the State,” the bench said. The parties can seek consequential relief by approaching the authorities till the Supreme Court takes a decision in the matter, the bench said. Many people moved Telangana High Court questioning GO 131 (issued on August 31, 2020) which had provisions to regularise illegal lay-outs and open plots. Similarly, petitions were also filed challenging the Building Regularisation Scheme (GO 152) announced by State government in 2016. The HC earlier issued stay orders in all these petitions. Meanwhile, a writ petition was filed in SC pertaining to illegal constructions and lay-outs in different parts of the country. The SC directed the petitioner to implead Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in that plea. The government counsel said in the HC that Telangana is yet to file its counter affidavit in the matter in SC. With the HC closing all the petitions, the issues pertaining to LRS and BRS are to be adjudicated by the SC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-closes-all-petitions-relating-to-lrs-brs/article34435794.ece
29 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘TRS govt. to be blamed for COVID spike’||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has claimed that the COVID-19 situation is alarming across the State and the government here is trying to shift the blame on the Central government to cover up its own “lackadaisical attitude”. “The TRS government has been underreporting deaths and cases despite many, from old to young, dying in droves due to lack of proper medicare in government facilities and unable to pay the high bills in the private hospitals. Has this government or Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao conducted a single review meeting on the COVID management? People have been left to fend for themselves like last year,” charged party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar at a press conference on Wednesday. The BJP had approached the State Election Commission (SEC) and Governor seeking postponement of local body polls but with the TRS wanting to win the elections at any cost, did not pay heed and it had no option but to fight it out. “We followed all COVID protocols and did not organise huge meetings like the Chief Minister’s which became a super spreader,” he maintained, brushing away questions about “political parties responsibility in controlling the virus spread”. Mr. Sanjay Kumar demanded that the government immediately implement the Centre’s ‘Ayushman Bharat’ medical insurance scheme to save people in need and questioned the delay after accepting to take it up three months ago. “What is the problem of KCR in implementing it. Even Arogyasri is not being implemented. Is this not playing politics over people’s lives so that the credit is denied to the Central government?” he wondered. The BJP leader pointed out that the government has been asserting it was ready to face any second wave but having done little to improve the health infrastructure, is now criticising the Centre for everything from oxygen, drugs and vaccines. “This government lacked advance planning and it wants Centre to supply everything why do we need it? What prevented having discussions with city based Bharat Biotec to seek sufficient vaccine supplies, why is TIMS Gachibowli and other places understaffed?,” he sought to know. Neither the Chief Minister nor his party leaders propagated the importance of getting vaccinated. “People also threw caution to the winds since KCR himself had dismissed the virus to be of no consequence and now, we are witnessing the current pathetic situation with patients running around for proper medicare,” he pointed out. The BJP president was also confident of the party candidates performing well in the municipal elections for Warangal, Siddipet and Khammam. He urged election authorities and the police to ensure peaceful polling ahead acting sternly against “criminals”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-government-to-be-blamed-for-covid-spike-says-sanjay/article34435796.ece

29 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘RT-PCR continues to be gold standard test’||The RT-PCR is an extremely sensitive test and continues to be the gold standard for detecting COVID. “The nasopharyngeal test is the best indicator, but depends on how the health worker takes the swab. The kits and equipment should be handled carefully as it amplifies many times. Error in any stage will makes positive cases into false negatives,” explained Atal Incubation Centre-CCMB CEO Dr. N. Madhusudhana Rao on Wednesday. From the beginning of the pandemic, the CCMB has trained many government healthcare personnel and others in conducting this test. “We are not sure whether everyone has the expertise to handle the swabs and also in using the equipment. It is taking two days for the samples to be collected and another two days for the results to come out during this second wave. We should also consider that from 100 samples, most labs are doing up to 500 samples now, and these heavy work loads are bound to be reflect on the personnel too,” he said. Therefore, it is up to the diagnostic labs to ensure ‘quality’ control at each stage of sample collection, check whether the kits are active and not expired and equipment handling is done by well trained hands. “While it is possible some variants of concern can escape the RT-PCR tests, we do not have sufficient numbers to indicate so based on the available data,” he said in the virtual meeting organised by CSIR-IICT. “The ICMR cleared dry swab tests could be a game changer,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rt-pcr-continues-to-be-gold-standard-test/article34435784.ece

29 April 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||‘Curb activities of medical mafia’||CPI (ML-New Democracy) State assistant secretary Potu Ranga Rao alleged that the “medical mafia” was resorting to black marketing of the anti-viral drug Remdesivir and minting money from hapless COVID-19 patients. In a statement, he blamed both the State and Central governments for what he termed as “unprecedented pandemic crisis” gripping the State and the nation as a whole. The pandemic situation has aggravated following the “Kumbh Mela” and the “election campaign jataras” involving massive gathering of people in blatant violation of the COVID-19 safety protocols, he charged. Making matters worse, the “medical mafia” is indulging in black-marketing of Remdesivir injections forcing the needy COVID-19 patients to shell out a whopping around Rs. 2.50 lakh for six vials of the high in demand anti-viral drug for the five-day course, many times more than the actual stipulated price, Mr Rao flayed. Anti-viral drugs "Many COVID-19 patients are running from pillar to post for the anti-viral drugs and oxygen-supported beds in hospitals exposing the fragile public healthcare facilities and the failure of the persons at the helm to deal with the public health crisis," he charged. He wanted the government to immediately curb the “medical mafia” activities to end the fleecing of hapless COVID-19 patients and make the anti-viral drugs and treatment facilities available to all the needy patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/curb-activities-of-medical-mafia/article34435805.ece

The election is very prestigious for Finance Minister T. Harish Rao who is representing Siddipet Assembly constituency. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on its part is making all out efforts to win considerable number of seats in the municipality. Out of the total 43 wards, it’s only the TRS which is contesting all the seats while the BJP has limited itself to 40 wards and Congress to 30 seats. This speaks volumes about the status of national parties at local level. Meanwhile, on a tip off, officials raided a premises on Road Number 2 of Aadarshanagar and seized 323 liquor bottles and 311 half bottles - all worth Rs. 1.38 lakh. According to Two Town SI Sriram, while one accused by the name Imran ran away leaving his motorcycle on the spot, one Hazi - who supplied liquor - was arrested by the police.

29 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Lodhi Road crematorium turns away bodies for want of space||By 1 p.m. on Wednesday employees at Lodhi Road crematorium began asking ambulances, lining up outside every few minutes, to try getting a slot elsewhere. “ Kuch khali nahi hain. Kahin aur jao [No slot is empty, go somewhere else]”, the ambulances were told. With the gates being manned under strict supervision from within the premises, staffers tried to assert that they had no options but to turn away the hearses. For relatives and friends of those who lost the battle against the COVID-19 to convince the crematorium staffers to at least let the ambulances enter the premises so that they can wait till a slot opened up, was another added battle. “You can go inside and check. If you get even an inch of space where you think the pyre can be lit, you take the body. There is nothing left inside – no space,” said a crematorium staffer to one such family. After about 15 minutes, the ambulance was permitted to enter the premises and had to wait behind a queue of ambulances before it could reach the ultimate spot. “We are running out of wood also. Where do people think the cremation can happen? To add to it, the heat is such that it is becoming impossible to light the pyre. We will most likely have to begin once it cools down. As it is, there is not enough wood left. We lost count of the number of pyres being lit these days. It is an endless process,” said the staffer, while taking a break from managing the groups of people arriving. South Delhi resident Ranjan Kumar had come to the crematorium after a family member passed away. “My sister-in-law, who was only 45-year-old, died. She was admitted in a hospital in Delhi Cantonment for the last five days. She was on oxygen support throughout the time and unfortunately, we could not save her. We got here in the morning and had to wait for about two hours before our turn came,” Mr. Kumar said. Strict instructions After about an hour later, another staffer arrived with strict instructions for those manning the gates. “I do not care who is arriving. No more bodies can be allowed inside right now,” he announced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/lodhi-road-crematorium-turns-away-bodies-for-want-of-space/article34435434.ece

These, the Mayor wrote, can also be used in unfortunate cases, where those who could not survive their battle with COVID can be transported to crematoria and burial grounds for their last rites. “North Delhi Municipal Corporation had a capacity of cremation of 230 persons till April 15 but within 10-12 days the total capacity has been increased to 570 persons. Three new cremation grounds have been developed besides increasing the capacity of existing ones,” he wrote. “Out of a total of 570, 304 wooden and 54 CNG pyres are fixed for COVID deaths and the rest are for non-COVID deaths. We are transforming ourselves as per the need of the hour,” the Mayor also wrote. The Mayor also demanded from the Delhi government directions to the Forest department to provide firewood for final rites, given the increasing number of funerals taking place in the national capital. “As you are aware, deaths due to COVID-19 are on the rise and to cremate the bodies in the traditional manner a large amount of wood is required,” he wrote. “This is to request you to direct the forest department to ensure steady supply of firewood to these crematoriums without fail,” he also wrote.

29 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Prices of medicines, PPE kits and oximeters hit the roof in city||Amid huge demand for medicines, PPE kits, oxygen cylinders and oximeters in the onslaught of the pandemic, medical stores are selling these aforementioned items at exorbitant rates. The shop owners, in turn, blamed people for hoarding that led to unavailability of medicines and devices in the market. The cost of best quality oximeter ranges between Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 2,500 but due to shortage, it is sold between Rs. 3,000 and 4,500. A digital thermometer is sold at twice or thrice the MRP. Deepu Kumar, a medical shop owner in East Delhi, said there is huge demand for anti-viral drugs as most infected persons are in home quarantine. “People are buying multi-vitamin and anti-viral drugs in bulk after going through unverified information being circulated on the social media. They are also buying oximeter without doctor’s recommendation. Due to these reasons, medical stores are getting limited supply of drugs,” said Mr. Kumar. A long queue of customers was seen outside a medical store in Vaishali Sector 4 of Ghaziabad. People said they don’t want to take last moment risk and want to stock medicines, oximeter, thermometer, PPE kits and hand gloves. In an emergency situation, a resident of Indirapuram even brought an oxygen cylinder for Rs. 20,000 from black market. Safe than sorry “Rumours circulating on the social media have pushed people into panic buying. Even if there is no requirement of medicines and other medical devices, people are hoarding it for emergency situation. Those who actually require it are running from pillar to post to get a single vial of Remdesivir or other medicines used in COVID-19 treatment,” said Joy Saha, a resident of Vaishali. Sales monitoring A medical shop owner in Central Delhi said that after the government started monitoring the sale of Remdesivir, people involved in black marketing started hoarding it. In some cases, a few have bought the injection at Rs. 1 lakh per vial. “Oximeters were in the market but there was huge demand and all of them were sold out. The unavailability is just because of gap in demand and supply. The situation will improve when fresh stock arrives in a few days. But I request people not to by duplicate oximeter as it will show inaccurate reading,” said Sonal Singh, a medical shop owner in Vaishali. In the last four days, police have arrested around ten people and recovered more than 120 vials of Remdesivir injection from their possession. The accused used to pose as distributors and relatives of patients to buy injections from medical stores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/prices-of-medicines-ppe-kits-and-oximeters-hit-the-roof-in-city/article34435431.ece
29 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||17 Delhi policemen succumb to virus despite one dose of vaccine||As many as 17 Delhi police personnel, who had received only the first vaccine shot, succumbed to COVID-19 during the second wave, till Wednesday, said a senior police officer. Senior police officers express fears of fatigue interfering with the immunity of even the fully inoculated lot, even as medical experts agree. The officer said that during the first wave of COVID-19, a total of 33 policemen died when there was no vaccine. And during the second wave, a total of 17 policemen have died so far. The vaccination process of around 82,000 Delhi police personnel, who are front-line workers, was completed, but several were waiting for their second dose and simultaneously performing duties on ground and were exposed to the threat of the virus. “Policemen are front-line workers and during the pandemic, they are providing all kinds of services to people. In many cases, policemen have cremated bodies when families refused to come forward, fearing infection. Policemen are distributing food packets and performing law and order duties to strictly implement curfew orders,” said the officer. He added that most of the policemen have got the second dose of vaccination, but have not completed two weeks before being exposed to the virus again. Doctors say that after vaccination, it takes about two weeks for a body to build immunity. When the process of second dose of vaccination of policemen was under way, the second wave hit the city and infected them. “At present, around 2,000 policemen have tested positive and undergoing treatment,” added the officer. Arun Gupta, the President of Delhi Medical Council, said that the both the vaccines available in the country have efficacy rate of 70%. Even after getting both the doses, 30% people will remain vulnerable. A body will develop immunity only after two weeks of receiving both the doses. Front-line workers, like policemen, doctors and others are working non-stop after being vaccinated. They cannot afford to take leave at this time. Single dose insignificant “People, who have received a single dose, are vulnerable and people with both the doses are vulnerable until they give their bodies two weeks to develop antibodies. Single dose is not significant,” said Mr Gupta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/17-delhi-policemen-succumb-to-covid-after-first-dose-of-vaccine/article34435432.ece
29 April 2021||New Delhi,||Opinions split on whether Delhi’s cases have peaked||Expert are divided on whether or not Delhi has reached its peak in terms of COVID-19 even as the city continues to be ravaged by the pandemic, with several people on the hunt for oxygen and beds. The positivity rate has been almost the same for the past one week. There was a sharp rise in positivity from 3.5% on April 1 to 36.2% on April 22. However, since then, it has stayed below it. Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital, said that Delhi has reached the peak. “We have reached the peak and cases will now go down. The positivity will fluctuate for a few days and then it will also decrease,” he said. On April 15, when the positivity and number of cases were rising, Dr. Kishore had told The Hindu that cases would peak in about 10 days. “Deaths will continue to be on the higher side for a week or 10 days and it will come down after that. This is because patients, who got the infection mostly 10-14 days ago, when there was a spike, are dying now,” he said. Giridhara R. Babu, Professor at Indian Institute of Public Health in Bengaluru, said: “Generally, a week is a good time to observe a trend. But in Delhi, the number of tests is currently low. So I would wait for another week to say if Delhi has reached a plateau. But there are chances that Delhi could have reached a peak now itself.”. Jayaprakash Muliyil, an epidemiologist and former principal of Christian Medical College, Vellore, said that current data of positive cases and positivity is not enough to arrive at any conclusion. “Classically, we count as cases only those with clinical symptoms. But for COVID, we are counting all people who test positive as cases, even if they are sub-clinical,” he said. “So, the data available is of all cases and from that it is difficult to say whether Delhi has peaked. We can say it has peaked when the clinical cases reduce, which will lead to a fall in hospital admission,” Dr. Muliyil said.  Chain of transmission Dr. Kishore added that in Delhi, about 70-75% of the population may have been infected by the virus till now. “This will break the chain of transmission and lead to a dip in cases. If the virus mutates, then we may see a spike again. Else the number will go down,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/virus-infection-may-have-reached-its-peak-in-delhi/article34435429.ece

West Tripura District Magistrate Shailesh Yadav conducted raids on two wedding ceremonies that went against curfew norms on Monday night. Video clips of the raid on ‘Golap Bagan’ and ‘Manikya Court’ — owned by the State’s royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarma and his sister – went viral on social media platforms. Both Opposition parties and the ruling BJP’s rebel MLAs lashed out at the State government and demanded action against the District Magistrate. The probe panel, comprising two Secretary-level IAS officers Kiran Gitte and Tanusree Debbarma, has been directed to submit the report as early as possible. Sources said Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar ordered the setting up of the panel after he met Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb to discuss the controversy. Five rebel MLAs of the ruling party hit out at the District Magistrate in a letter addressed to the Chief Secretary, where they said Mr. Yadav’s actions were insulting, outrageous and atrocious. They also alleged that Mr. Yadav had manhandled a police officer on duty. One of the signatory MLAs, Ashish Das, sat on a day-long dharna at the statue of Mahatma Gandhi here on Wednesday to demand action. Earlier, the leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Manik Sarkar condemned the ‘behaviour’ of the District Magistrate. However, Mr. Yadav defended his actions under Section 144 of the CrPC and denied that he overstepped his limits. He also denied having pushed or physically manhandled anyone at the gatherings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dm-action-tripura-govt-to-probe/article34435339.ece

29 April 2021||New Delhi,||HC appeals to citizens not to hoard oxygen cylinders||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday appealed to citizens not to hoard oxygen cylinders and medicines required for COVID-19 patients so as to avoid creating artificial scarcity and make them available to people in need. “The nation is facing an unprecedented crisis. It is at times like these that the people need to showcase our qualities and virtues,” a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said. “We appeal to the good sense of people to not resort to black marketing or hoarding of oxygen cylinders or medicines and to make them available to the needy. Hoarding of oxygen cylinder and medicines lead to an artificial scarcity,” the Bench said.  Field hospitals The High Court also asked the Delhi government to explore the possibility of getting assistance of the armed forces in setting up field hospitals. “We came across news reports of the incident that took place in Apollo Hospital yesterday [Tuesday] where the hospital staffers and doctors were assaulted by the relatives of a patient. Such kind of incidents are bound to demoralise the medical community which is serving tirelessly to save the lives of the people without any rest whatsoever,” the court remarked. “We hope that such incident are not repeated. The authorities and police should also me mindful of such kind of conduct and be vigilant,” it added. The court also noted the submission of senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, that there has been frantic SOS calls from hospitals and nursing homes for supply of oxygen but many a times it was found that the urgency expressed was not genuine. “We hope and expect that hospitals and nursing homes not raise such alarms as it may lead to strain on the system,” the court remarked. The court also directed the Delhi government to give an account of the COVID-19 test that are being done in all accredited lab in the Capital. The Bench also directed government to consider using the mohalla clinics for urgent medical consultation of patients who have tested COVID positive. The court also recorded a suggestion of using old DTC buses for transporting dead bodies instead of ambulances.

29 April 2021||New Delhi,||HC directs insurance firms to clear bills quickly||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said insurance companies cannot take 6-7 hours for approving bills of COVID-19 patients as it delays their discharge from hospitals and those in need for beds have to wait longer. Justice Prathiba M Singh said if the court comes to know of an insurance company or a third-party administrator (TPA) processing insurance claims taking 6-7 hours for clearing bills, contempt action would be taken against them. A few minutes after her order, a similar direction was passed by a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli which directed insurance companies and TPAs to ensure that time taken to grant approvals to bills was reduced to a reasonable amount as there were long queues of people outside hospitals waiting for beds during the massive surge in COVID-19 infections. Justice Singh said in her order that insurance companies or TPAs should not take more than 30-60 minutes to grant approval to the bills on receiving the request from hospitals and directed insurance regulator IRDAI to issue instructions in this regard. The Division Bench, in its order, said delay in discharging patients was leading to delay in admitting needy patients and was causing more suffering to them. The direction by the Division Bench came after it was informed by some hospitals and lawyers that delay in approvals by insurance companies and TPAs was resulting in delay in discharging patients and admitting new ones. The Bench was hearing several pleas with regard to lack of oxygen, medicines, beds and ventilators in the national capital and ramping up of testing. Justice Singh’s order came while hearing several individuals’ plea regarding non-availability of Remdesivir and beds for patients. In order to speed up the discharge process, Justice Singh issued a direction to hospitals to start the process of admission of new patients side by side with the discharge process, so that no bed remains vacant for long. During the day, Justice Singh ensured that beds were made available to all those petitioners whose pleas were listed before her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-directs-insurance-firms-to-clear-bills-quickly/article34435347.ece

This is a complete non-application of mind. Now people who do not have oxygen will not get Remdesivir either. It appears you want people to die,” Justice Prathiba M Singh said after the Central government submitted that under the protocol being followed now only patients on oxygen support were being given Remdesivir. The court also said it will consider later whether a medical committee should review if the protocols or guidelines for administering Remdesivir need any modification. “Don't change the protocol only to reduce the shortage. That is wrong. As a result, doctors are not able to prescribe Remdesivir,” the court said and added, “This is complete mismanagement.” On the allocation of the drug to Delhi, the Centre told the court that over 52,000 vials, out of the allocated amount of 72,000, were sent till April 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/it-appears-you-want-people-to-die-hc-tells-centre/article34435346.ece

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||India, Australia, Japan push for supply chain resilience||The Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) formally launched on Tuesday by the Trade Ministers of India, Japan and Australia brought a wary response from China, which has described the effort as ‘unrealistic’. Piyush Goyal, Minister for Commerce and Industry, launched the SCRI along with Dan Tehan, Australia’s Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, and Hiroshi Kajiyama, Japan’s Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry. The three sides agreed the pandemic “revealed supply chain vulnerabilities globally and in the region” and “noted the importance of risk management and continuity plans in order to avoid supply chain disruptions”. Some of the joint measures they are considering include supporting the enhanced utilisation of digital technology and trade and investment diversification, which is seen as being aimed at reducing their reliance on China. “The SCRI aims to create a virtuous cycle of enhancing supply chain resilience with a view to eventually attaining strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth in the region,” a statement said. China wary China’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday described the move as ‘unrealistic’. “The formation and development of global industrial and supply chains are determined by market forces and companies choices,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. “Artificial industrial ‘transfer’ is an unrealistic approach that goes against the economic laws and can neither solve domestic problems nor do anything good to the stability of the global industrial and supply chains, or to the stable recovery of the world economy.” Mr. Zhao said China hoped that amid the epidemic, “parties concerned will cherish the hard-won outcomes of international cooperation in the fight against the epidemic” and “act in ways conducive to enhancing mutual trust and cooperation, so as to jointly ensure the global industrial and supply chains stable and unimpeded”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-australia-japan-push-for-supply-chain-resilience/article34435003.ece
29 April 2021||COLOMBO,||China pushes defence ties with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka||China’s Minister of Defence Wei Fenghe, visiting Bangladesh and Sri Lanka this week, has called on countries in the neighbourhood to resist “powers from outside the region setting up military alliances in South Asia”. General Wei’s comments in Dhaka on Tuesday came amid a push back from Chinese officials on the India-U.S.-Australia-Japan Quad grouping, which some in Beijing have described as a quasi-military alliance. Colombo visit The Chinese Defence Minister and People’s Liberation Army General on Wednesday held talks with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in Sri Lanka, as he began a two-day visit following his trip to Bangladesh. Both sides had discussions that were “extremely fruitful”, said a statement issued by the Presidential Media Division. “He [Chinese Defence Minister] also said the relations between the two nations were further strengthened by this visit,” the statement said. The General’s visit comes six months after top Chinese foreign policy official Yang Jiechi was in Colombo in October 2020 for high-level discussions. China on Tuesday also convened a six-country South Asia dialogue on COVID-19 and economic cooperation with the Foreign Ministers of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The senior Chinese official’s visit to Sri Lanka coincides with mounting resistance in Sri Lanka to a Bill envisioning laws to govern the China-backed $1.4 billion Colombo Port City. The Supreme Court recently heard a case on the matter, following some 20 petitions by opposition parties and civil society organisations that challenged the Bill arguing that it “threatened” Sri Lanka’s sovereignty. The top court is expected to rule on the case soon. The visiting Chinese official is also scheduled to meet PM Mahinda Rajapaksa. Beijing has extended over $2 billion — in loans and a currency swap facility — to Colombo after the pandemic struck, to help the government cope with its economic strain. Prior to that Colombo owed Beijing over $ 5 billion in loan repayment. On Tuesday, General Wei held talks with Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid in Dhaka. A statement from China’s official Xinhua news agency quoted him as calling for the two militaries to “increase high-level visits, deepen cooperation in equipment technology, broaden exchanges in specialized fields and forge closer military relations.” “To jointly maintain regional peace and stability,” he said, “the two sides should make joint efforts against powers outside the region setting up military alliance in South Asia and practicing hegemonism.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-pushes-defence-ties-with-bangladesh-sri-lanka/article34434995.ece
29 April 2021||BRUSSELS,||EU lawmakers give nod to post-Brexit trade agreement||European Union leaders, their British counterparts and European businesses expressed hope on Wednesday that the final ratification of the post-Brexit trade deal will open a new, positive era of cooperation despite the many divisive topics remaining between the former partners. Lawmakers at the European Parliament voted 660-5 with 32 abstentions to endorse the free trade agreement. Voting took place on Tuesday but results were not announced until Wednesday morning. After EU lawmakers ratified the agreement ensuring that free trade continues between the two sides without tariffs and quotas, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the vote marked the “final step in a long journey, providing stability to our new relationship with the EU as vital partners, close allies and sovereign equals.”  Relations between the EU and the U.K. have been strained since a Brexit transition period ended on January 1. The two sides have argued so far this year over issues ranging from violations of the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, COVID-19 vaccine supplies to the full diplomatic recognition of the EU in Britain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eu-lawmakers-give-nod-to-post-brexit-trade-agreement/article34434991.ece

The Czech government this month accused Russian security services of being behind a deadly explosion at an arms depot in eastern Czech Republic in 2014. It expelled a number of Russian diplomats over the allegations, with Slovakia and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania following suit in solidarity. Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said that a total of four diplomats from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been declared “persona non grata” and must leave the country within seven days. It added that the Baltic states “continue to conduct hostile course towards our country, in this case hiding behind pseudo-solidarity with the indiscriminate actions of the Czech Republic towards Russia”. In a separate statement on Wednesday, the Ministry also announced the expulsion of three Slovak diplomats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-expels-seven-eu-envoys/article34434999.ece

Recalling “similar pestilences” faced by humankind in the past, Mr. Rajapaksa sought to assure the Indian PM that “humanity prevailed through perseverance” and that India would “thwart the current havoc of the pathogen”, under Mr. Modi’s “able leadership” and the “resolute support of dedicated professionals and experts.” “I am pleased to inform Your Excellency that the Buddhist clergy in Sri Lanka, following the example of their great teacher Gautama Buddha in Vaisala during a pestilence, plan to compassionately recite the ‘Rathana Sutra’, to invoke blessings on the people of India, thus demonstrating the close bond and affinity between our two countries,” Mr. Rajapaksa said in a letter dated April 28, 2021. President Rajapaksa expressed “deep gratitude” for India’s donation of 5 lakh doses of vaccines that, he said, enabled his government to launch the vaccination programme. Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih too expressed solidarity with India in a tweet that said: “Saddened and concerned for our neighbour India as they battle a new wave of Covid19. The Maldives expresses its solidarity with the people of India and is encouraged by the efforts undertaken by PM @narendramodi and Indian authorities to ease the situation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/gotabaya-solih-express-solidarity-with-india/article34434993.ece

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Gasping for air, gasping for answers||The struggle to breathe, or asphyxia, is the most terrifying human experience. Something one takes for granted, which we do more than a dozen times every minute, suddenly becomes an ordeal. I know how this feels having lived through tormenting bouts of asthma in my younger years and, more recently, when I found myself trapped under a raft in the freezing, raging, Zanskar river in Ladakh. The memories of gasping for air and the fear of dying are seared into my brain. Death typically comes as a relief from the terror, as multiple organ systems collapse due to the lack of oxygen, a colourless, odourless, tasteless gas which we are not even aware of until we cannot get enough of it. Oxygen. A word which should signify vitality and exuberance, but which in recent weeks has become synonymous with death and suffering. Who would have ever imagined that the India of 2021 which boasts sending rockets to the stars and manufactures oxygen on an industrial scale, would one day be unable to supply oxygen to save her own people. The trauma of asphyxia The word ‘trauma’ typically evokes extreme events such as rape, sexual abuse and war-related violence. This is not surprising given that the word gained currency as a medical condition in the aftermath of the Vietnam war when tens of thousands of soldiers from the United States returning from the brutal conflict exhibited a range of distressing symptoms, giving birth to the diagnosis of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). But the truth is that trauma can occur in many more diverse ways, and it is only now, with COVID-19 sweeping the world, that gasping for air has been recognised as a traumatic event. What ties these seemingly unconnected experiences together is that they all evoke the same intense emotions: a toxic brew of extreme fear and utter helplessness. These experiences, especially when sustained over hours or days, literally leave an imprint in the brain so that the hallmark features of PTSD symptoms such as nightmares, flashbacks and feeling on edge, recur at any time, sometimes triggered by a totally unrelated event which bear similarity to the trauma. A recent study from the United Kingdom (https://bit.ly/2SbDysD) of over 13,000 survivors of COVID-19 reported a strong correlation between the severity of the infection and subsequent PTSD. While just over 1% of the patients reported breathing problems or hospital admission, the prevalence of PTSD in the months which followed were staggering: 35% of the sickest, and 15% of even those who only needed home assistance. The most prominent symptoms were frightening intrusive images of being breathless or ventilated. Thus, for those who do survive these nightmarish moments on the edge of life, the ordeal is far from over. Even as we struggle to keep those gasping for air alive, we must simultaneously attend to the long-term mental health consequences of survivors, a task even more daunting in a country where trauma-related mental health problems are barely even acknowledged. A traumatised country But there is also another kind of trauma which is sweeping across India, as millions of stories of suffering, despair and death percolate into the consciousness of every person. There has been a feverish rise of anxiety and fear across the population, twinned with helplessness as the comfort of knowing that there is a government which they can rely on has evaporated. India has been engulfed, in a matter of a few weeks, into the world’s most serious humanitarian crisis, fuelled not just by a more infectious strain of the virus, but also a stunning level of arrogance, greed, incompetence and complacency. The terror reminds me of the weeks that followed the brutal lock-down imposed on the same population a year ago, without any warning or preparation. A year on, the horrors have returned to their lives, only this time for exactly the opposite reason: the state did nothing at all as tens of thousands, and then hundreds of thousands, of people were getting infected every day, watching millions congregate at religious festivals and election rallies, oblivious or uncaring about the inevitable cataclysm this would lead to. The concept of collective trauma has emerged only in recent times, in the aftermath of terrifying events which have affected entire populations, such as following the 9/11 attacks in New York or disasters such as the tsunami in 2004. These events were followed by a dramatic increase in symptoms of psychological distress, including the cardinal features of trauma, for months and years after the event itself had passed into history. And so we also must prepare the country for healing from this mass traumatic experience and we can draw upon lessons from other humanitarian crises to guide our actions. Most immediately, we must find a place to park our anger and rage, as justified as these reactions may be, and search for the compassion lurking beneath it, and support in any way we can the efforts of the thousands of civil society organisations to support those who are gasping for air, not forgetting the continuing support they will need after they can breathe again. The outpouring of community action we are witnessing is a soothing balm for the anxiety many are experiencing as they fear that the state seems to have collapsed. Healing through truth But, long-term recovery of the collective trauma will need resolution of the pent-up rage that is burning a hole in our souls. This will need the equivalent of the Truth and Reconciliation Commissions which have served to heal the collective traumas of events which affected entire populations, such as apartheid in South Africa. Such an independent Commission would document the facts behind the tragedy unfolding across India, hold individuals and institutions accountable, and offer a path towards restorative justice to heal a deeply wounded nation. Last week, when the Delhi High Court issued an order to the Central Government to ensure the supply of oxygen, I was puzzled by its statement that “As it stands, we all know this country is being run by God.” I will never know who was being referred to as God, but I am assuming it must be the spiritual being we pray to in our myriad places of worship. If so, then we must ensure that this is not the final judgment of the apocalypse that has befallen India. The people of this country are entitled to a full and honest account of what led more than a billion people into a catastrophe, if only to put at rest our troubled minds, restore the fractured trust between the people and the state, and be better prepared for the next pandemic.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Antimicrobial resistance: the silent threat||Since January 2020, there have been over three million deaths globally on account of COVID-19, starkly exposing the vulnerabilities of health systems to infectious diseases, even in the richest countries. The speed of COVID-19’s spread across international borders has underscored the need for cross-national cooperation around surveillance, monitoring and disease notification — the key activities that underpin our ability to minimise the impact of acute public health events and maintain global health security. As serious as the current health and economic crisis is, COVID-19 may just be the harbinger of future crises. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the phenomenon by which bacteria and fungi evolve and become resistant to presently available medical treatment, is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in July 2020, “AMR is a slow tsunami that threatens to undo a century of medical progress”. AMR is already responsible for up to 7,00,000 deaths a year. Unless urgent measures are taken to address this threat, we could soon face an unprecedented health and economic crisis of 10 million annual deaths and costs of up to $100 trillion by 2050. Diverse challenges AMR represents an existential threat to modern medicine. Without functional antimicrobials to treat bacterial and fungal infections, even the most common surgical procedures, as well as cancer chemotherapy, will become fraught with risk from untreatable infections. Neonatal and maternal mortality will increase. All these effects will be felt globally, but the scenario in the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) of Asia and Africa is even more serious. LMICs have significantly driven down mortality using cheap and easily available antimicrobials. In the absence of new therapies, health systems in these countries are at severe risk of being overrun by untreatable infectious diseases. The challenges are complex. Drug resistance in microbes emerges for several reasons. These include the misuse of antimicrobials in medicine, inappropriate use in agriculture, and contamination around pharmaceutical manufacturing sites where untreated waste releases large amounts of active antimicrobials into the environment. All of these drive the evolution of resistance in microbes. This is compounded by the serious challenge that no new classes of antibiotics have made it to the market in the last three decades, largely on account of inadequate incentives for their development and production. A recent report from the non-profit PEW Trusts found that over 95% of antibiotics in development today are from small companies, 75% of which have no products currently in the market. Major pharmaceutical companies have largely abandoned innovation in this space. Tackling these diverse challenges requires action in a range of areas – in addition to developing new antimicrobials, infection-control measures can reduce antibiotic use. A mix of incentives and sanctions would encourage appropriate clinical use. At the same time, it is critical to ensure that all those who need an antimicrobial have access to it; 5.7 million people worldwide die annually because they cannot access drugs for infections that are treatable. Further, to track the spread of resistance in microbes, surveillance measures to identify these organisms need to expand beyond hospitals and encompass livestock, wastewater and farm run-offs. Finally, since microbes will inevitably continue to evolve and become resistant even to new antimicrobials, we need sustained investments and global coordination to detect and combat new resistant strains on an ongoing basis. The way forward There is room, however, for cautious optimism. A multi-sectoral $1 billion AMR Action Fund was launched in 2020 to support the development of new antibiotics, and the U.K. is trialling a subscription-based model for paying for new antimicrobials towards ensuring their commercial viability. This means that the government will pay upfront for these new antimicrobials, thereby delinking the life-saving value of the drugs from the volume of sales and providing an incentive for their production in market conditions that do not do so. Other initiatives focused on the appropriate use of antibiotics include Peru’s efforts on patient education to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, Australian regulatory reforms to influence prescriber behaviour, and initiatives to increase the use of point-of-care diagnostics, such as the EU-supported VALUE-Dx programme. Beyond human use, Denmark’s reforms to prevent the use of antibiotics in livestock have not only led to a significant reduction in the prevalence of resistant microbes in animals, but also improved the efficiency of farming. Finally, given the critical role of manufacturing and environmental contamination in spreading AMR through pharmaceutical waste, there is a need to look into laws such as those recently proposed by India, one of the largest manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, to curb the amount of active antibiotics released in pharmaceutical waste. While the range of initiatives that seek to control the emergence and spread of AMR is welcome, there is a need to recognise the limitations of a siloed approach. Current initiatives largely target individual issues related to AMR (such as the absence of new antibiotics, inappropriate prescription and environmental contamination) and consequently, narrowly defined groups of stakeholders (providers, patients and pharmaceutical companies). Regulating clinician prescription of antimicrobials alone would do little in settings where patient demand is high and antimicrobials are freely available over-the-counter in practice, as is the case in many LMICs. Efforts to control prescription through provider incentives should be accompanied by efforts to educate consumers to reduce inappropriate demand, issue standard treatment guidelines that would empower providers to stand up to such demands, as well as provide point-of-care diagnostics to aid clinical decision-making. Policy alignment is also needed much beyond the health system. Solutions in clinical medicine must be integrated with improved surveillance of AMR in agriculture, animal health and the environment. This means that AMR must no longer be the remit solely of the health sector, but needs engagement from a wide range of stakeholders, representing agriculture, trade and the environment with solutions that balance their often-competing interests. Finally, successful policies in individual countries are no guarantee of global success. International alignment and coordination are paramount in both policymaking and its implementation. Indeed, recent papers have proposed using the Paris Agreement as a blueprint for developing a similar global approach to tackling AMR. With viral diseases such as COVID-19, outbreaks and pandemics may be harder to predict; however, given what we know about the “silent pandemic” that is AMR, there is no excuse for delaying action.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Temples are not fiefdoms of the state||In the article, “The last word on the state and temples” ( The Hindu , Editorial page, April 22, 2021), in the absence of any answer as to whom temples would be entrusted to — if the government were to cede its control — the writer enters the realm of imagination and divines an answer — “powerful private interests”. No doubt the problem of hierarchical division in Hindu society is prevalent. But the issue of government control of temples is distinct from the issue of throwing open Hindu religious institutions to all classes and sections of society. To confuse the two is constitutionally misleading. Separate pieces of legislation exist — the [Madras] Temple Entry Authorisation Act, 1947 — to address these issues. A myth A myth is trotted out to justify sovereign control of temples: that Hindu temples were supervised and managed by kings, who “habitually employed ministries to supervise temples and charitable bodies”. Like many myths the colonials perpetuated, this too must be disabused: there is not a shred of historical source to support this claim. On the contrary there are inscriptions, cast in stone, that attest that temples were managed wholly and entirely by local communities. Before turning to the solution, it would seem sensible to ask the question. State in religion Why is the community demanding that the government stay away from temples? Unbridled corruption; theft and destruction. If the gross mismanagement of financial resources and indisputable corruption by the state along with the loss and destruction of temple antiquities were not sufficient reasons for the government to relinquish its (mis)management, a mere glance at state legislations will reveal a deeper malady. The state has assumed the role of religious functionaries to determine who will be heads of Mutts and the authority to conduct poojas . For example, The Shri Jagannath Temple Act, 1954 entrusted the committee appointed by the state with the task of ensuring the performance of seva pooja . When the Act was questioned by the Raja of Puri before the Supreme Court, in Raja Birakishore vs The State Of Orissa , the Court made a revelation: the performance of a puja is in fact a secular act and, therefore, the state is justified in its regulation. The exercise of state regulation of secular aspects of religion was taken to extreme lengths when the Court ruled that the state, by appointing temple priests, was exercising a secular function ( Seshammal & Ors, Etc. Etc vs State Of Tamil Nadu ). Whatever style of secularism we subscribe to, surely the Indian state is not to tell the believer how he/she is to offer worship to the deity nor is it to tell the custodian of the deity how she will be appointed. Distinct aspects The writer of the article rightly points out that the Constituent Assembly framed the religious liberty clauses keeping in mind the historical prohibition of entry to certain classes and sections of Hindu society. Article 25(2) grants power to the State to enact law on two distinct aspects. Article 25(2)(a) empowers the state to regulate “economic, financial, political or other secular activities which may be associated with religious practice”. Article 25(2)(b) enables the state to enact law to prohibit the exclusion of ‘classes and sections’ of Hindu society to enter into Hindu temples of a public character and also make law for social welfare and reform. Thus, the control of secular aspects associated with religion and the power to throw open Hindu temples to all classes and sections of society are distinct. The control of secular aspects is not a measure of any social reform. Viewed from this standpoint, the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department is not a “tribune for social justice” as argued in the article nor has it ever guaranteed equal access to worship. Nowhere does the text of the Constitution permit the state to assume ownership of properties belonging to religious institutions and treat them as state largesse to be siphoned off. The only vestige of authority under the Constitution empowering the state to take over property of religious institutions is under Article 31A(b). Even then it is doubtful that this article covers property belonging to religious sects. The history of legislative practice of endowment laws reveals the state prerogative in ensuring regulation of only secular activities. As a matter of fact, the Shirur Mutt case, while upholding certain provisions of the 1951 Act, struck down a major portion of the Act characterising the provisions as a “disastrous invasion” of religious liberty. In 1959, the Legislature ‘cured’ the defects pointed out by the Supreme Court, by inserting verbatim the very provisions that the Supreme Court had stuck down in 1954. Applicable to charities The Waqf Act justification for the legitimacy of control of Hindu religious endowments is misleading. A reading of the Act reveals that it applies to charities and specifically excludes places of worship such as mosques. In fact the scheme of the Waqf Act supports the argument that the government should not regulate places of worship. The most fundamental criticism against the release of Hindu temples from government control to the society is two-fold. First, it is asked to whom will the temples be handed over to? Second, once restored to the community, will it not perpetuate class hierarchies? What is being asserted by the community is the right of representation in the affairs of the management of temples. This right of representation can be effectuated by the creation of boards representative of religious heads, priests and responsible members from the dharmik sampradaya. The logic is simple. Members who profess a particular dharmik sampradaya will have its due interest in mind. British legacy When the British government realised that a secular government should take no part in the management of religious institutions, it enacted the Religious Endowments Act (Act XX of 1863) repealing the pre-existing Bengal and Madras Regulations. Interestingly, in handing over the religious institutions to the society, it created committees in every district to exercise control over temples. Section 8 of the Act provided that the members of the committee to be appointed from persons professing the religion, for purposes of which the religious establishment was founded or maintained and in accordance with the general wishes of those who are interested in the maintenance of the institution. For this purpose the local government caused an election. In the spirit of equality of all religions, this scheme should be applicable to all religious institutions which would guarantee adequate community representation in the management of their places of worship.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Misinformed and misleading||The Health Ministry released its first COVID-19 management guidelines about a year ago. The initial treatment guidelines included hydroxychloroquine, which led to panic buying of the drug. Little was known in those initial months. In the last one year, multiple studies have proven the lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. While most practitioners have moved away from prescribing hydroxychloroquine, it still remains in the guidelines released by the Health Ministry on April 22. While formulating national-level guidelines, the most important factors are strength of evidence, pricing, cost-effectiveness and social relevance. These guidelines not only disregard evidence, but also show the unawareness of policymakers about the struggles of the common populace and the importance of the aforementioned factors. Disregarding lack of evidence While hydroxychloroquine is one example that stands the test of time in terms of disregarding evidence, there are several others. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) completed a trial on convalescent plasma (of 464 patients), which proved that plasma does not save the lives of those with COVID-19. This was bolstered by further evidence from the U.K. (more than 10,000 patients). The only benefit of convalescent plasma was shown in a small study from Argentina which demonstrated that plasma prevented progression to severe disease in mild cases when high-titre plasma was infused within three days of disease onset. This strict timeline of three days lends plasma little to no translational value in India as plasma titres are seldom available and are expensive. Plus, there is a lag of 2-5 days in RT-PCR results now. Yet, convalescent plasma is mentioned in the Ministry’s guidelines. Similarly, Ivermectin, a drug used against parasites, has been recommended in the guidelines. With no good clinical trials to support its use and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommending against its routine use, one wonders what led to its inclusion. While evidence was ignored, the importance of pricing and cost-effectiveness was also overlooked. Remdesivir, in shortage now, is being black-marketed across India, although it has no value in saving lives. The only marginal benefit it may have is in reducing the hospital stay, with a trade-off of increasing the cost of hospitalisation by the steep price of the drug in the black market. Last year, when hydroxychloroquine was touted as the wonder drug, it ran out of stocks in the market, precipitating a crisis for patients who needed it chronically. Similarly, this year, budesonide inhalers have been included as an option for mild patients based on results of two clinical trials. With more than 80% of COVID-19 patients having only mild symptoms, patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may run out of inhalers. Moreover, according to the PRINCIPLE trial, a trial only in pre-print, budesonide improves only self-reported symptoms in mildly sick patients. It does not yet translate into saving lives or reducing hospital admissions. The larger social relevance of budesonide is still in question. Policymakers should have waited for the final publication, worked with industry to scale-up production of budesonide, and bolstered supply chains till the final results came in, rather than hastily making recommendations that may trigger panic buying and a crisis for patients who actually need it. Missing from guidelines What is missing from the guidelines is the lack of guidance on drugs being used for COVID-19. Misused drugs include Azithromycin, Doxycycline, Favipiravir, Itolizumab and Coronil. These are not mentioned in the guidelines, but practitioners are busy prescribing them. This may cause more harm than good. Lastly, absence of any mention of monoclonal antibodies from Regeneron or Eli Lilly in the guidelines, the most efficacious antivirals in COVID-19 till date, is baffling. COVID-19 is an administrative nightmare. A stark difference in messaging on COVID-19 management compared to the messaging of the WHO or other trusted sources like the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, U.S. will only create confusion. With the available evidence, and keeping cost-effectiveness and the social relevance of the Indian health system in context, the focus of COVID-19 treatment guidelines should be on oxygen delivery, steroids and anti-coagulants. More treatment does not necessarily lead to better outcomes but will definitely lead to higher out-of-pocket expenditure and healthcare-related bankruptcies and debts. The guidelines should be re-written in cognisance of the current strains on the healthcare system.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Making social welfare universal||India is one of the largest welfare states in the world and yet, with COVID-19 striking in 2020, the state failed to provide for its most vulnerable citizens. The country witnessed multiple crises: mass inter- and intra-migration, food insecurity, and a crumbling health infrastructure. The extenuating circumstances of the pandemic has pushed an estimated 75 million people into poverty. The second wave has brought even the middle and upper-class citizens to their knees. Economic capital, in the absence of social capital, has proven to be insufficient in accessing healthcare facilities. Illness is universal, but healthcare is not. Absorbing shocks The country has over 500 direct benefit transfer schemes for which various Central, State, and Line departments are responsible. However, these schemes have not reached those in need. The pandemic has revealed that leveraging our existing schemes and providing universal social security is of utmost importance. This will help absorb the impact of external shocks on our vulnerable populations. An example of such a social protection scheme is the Poor Law System in Ireland. In the 19th century, Ireland, a country that was staggering under the weight of poverty and famine, introduced the Poor Law System to provide relief that was financed by local property taxes. These laws were notable for not only providing timely assistance but maintaining the dignity and respectability of the poor while doing so. They were not designed as hand-outs but as necessary responses to a time of economic crisis. Today, the social welfare system in Ireland has evolved into a four-fold apparatus that promises social insurance, social assistance, universal schemes, and extra benefits/supplements. A similar kind of social security system is not unimaginable in India. We have seen an example of a universal healthcare programme that India ran successfully — the Pulse Polio Universal Immunisation Programme. In 2014, India was declared polio-free. It took a dedicated effort over a number of years. However, it shows us what is possible. With the advancements in knowledge and technology, a universal coverage of social welfare is possible in a shorter time frame. Ease of application Existing schemes cover a wide variety of social protections. However, they are fractionalised across various departments and sub-schemes. This causes problems beginning with data collection to last-mile delivery. Having a universal system would improve the ease of application by consolidating the data of all eligible beneficiaries under one database. It can also reduce exclusion errors. The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) is one scheme that can be strengthened into universal social security. It already consolidates the public distribution system (PDS), the provision of gas cylinders, and wages for the MGNREGS. Generally, social assistance schemes are provided on the basis of an assessment of needs. Having a universal scheme would take away this access/exclusion barrier. For example, PDS can be linked to a universal identification card such as the Aadhaar or voter card, in the absence of a ration card. This would allow anyone who is in need of foodgrains to access these schemes. It would be especially useful for migrant populations. Making other schemes/welfare provisions like education, maternity benefits, disability benefits etc. also universal would ensure a better standard of living for the people. To ensure some of these issues are addressed, we need to map the State and Central schemes in a consolidated manner. This is to avoid duplication, inclusion and exclusion errors in welfare delivery. Alongside, a study to understand costs of welfare access for vulnerable groups can be conducted. This will help give a targeted way forward. The implementation of any of these ideas is only possible through a focus on data digitisation, data-driven decision-making and collaboration across government departments.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Shortage and wastage||In the days ahead, Indian adults below 45 will begin registering for a COVID vaccine that on paper will be available from May 1. Amid a crisis of vaccine supply, the Health Ministry had said that a little over one crore vaccines remain in stock with States. An additional 57 lakh would be made available to States over the weekend. The Centre has so far provided nearly 16 crore vaccine doses to States of which the total consumption including wastage is 14.8 crore doses. Maharashtra led the table of vaccines administered with 1.5 crore doses followed by Rajasthan (1.3 crore), Uttar Pradesh (1.25 crore) and Gujarat (1.23 crore). These were also the States that had so far received the maximum number of vaccines, again in that order. Among large States, Tamil Nadu reported a high percentage of vaccine wastage, nearly 8.83%. Only Lakshadweep had a higher 9.76%. Assam, Manipur and Haryana ranked after Tamil Nadu in percentage wastage of vaccines, at 7.7%, 7.4% and 5.72%. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Mizoram, Odisha were the States that had reported no wastage. That a certain number of vaccines will be wasted is built into the Centre’s planning process. In its operational guidelines on COVID-19 vaccination, the Wastage Multiplier Factor has been calculated at 1.11, assuming an allowable programmatic wastage of 10%. This number is factored into how many vials are allocated to States for supply of vaccine to each administrative unit. Wastage in unopened vials can occur due to reasons such as the vaccine reaching its destination after its expiry date; if it has been exposed to temperature outside its normal bounds; suspected contamination and poor vaccine administration practices. Data seem to suggest that six of the top States or Union Territories that are reporting the highest proportion of wastage are the northeastern States, Lakshadweep and Dadra and Nagar Haveli where the relative difficulty of transporting goods — especially those as fragile as vaccine vials — is known. There ought to be deeper analysis for why Tamil Nadu with above average medical infrastructure ends up wasting close to 9% of its vaccines even though it is within acceptable bounds. In the days ahead, there will be more vaccines and manufacturing facilities which could translate to shorter transportation distances and reduced wastage. With the exponential increase in vaccine demand expected in the next six months, there will also be challenges in administration and demand for skilled administrators who will be part of the management of logistics. These ancillary support staff too have to be developed by States along with planning for vaccine supply to enable a smooth, speedy rollout.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/shortage-and-wastage/article34434971.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Salutary steps||Amid criticism that it did not enforce steps to curb the spread of COVID-19 during the protracted campaign for Assembly elections in four States and one Union Territory with sufficient vigour, the Election Commission of India has now banned victory processions after the results are declared on May 2. It has also restricted to two the number of persons who can accompany the winning candidate to meet the Returning Officer and collect the election certificate. These are significant steps to prevent any escalation in the already alarming infection rate. Further, the ECI has come up with measures at counting centres, including a stipulation that agents cannot enter the counting hall without producing either a negative test report for COVID-19 or final vaccination reports. While such stringent norms are welcome, it is regrettable that the enforcement of earlier norms for COVID-appropriate behaviour by political parties, candidates and their supporters was often quite lax during the long campaign. The Madras High Court’s remark to the effect that ECI officials should bear a great responsibility for the horrific spike in infections, illness, hospitalisation and deaths will resonate with the public. While it was quite in order that the court voiced its displeasure with the ECI for failing to make all parties adhere to its norms, the suggestion by the Bench that ECI officials should bear sole responsibility for the situation was avoidable, bordering on the intemperate. However, the court’s caution that the counting process should not become a catalyst for a new surge has undoubtedly helped and led to new norms for counting day activities. As the election draws to a close, the time may have come for the ECI to reconsider its resort to multi-phase polling as a permanent practice. Granted, some States are prone to violence, but should it not reconsider the practice, taking into account the strides made in communications and logistics? Multi-phase voting has been defended for the last three decades as something necessary because of the time needed to move central forces to different parts of the country; security and sensitivity in select constituencies are also considerations. However, in the present round, the first three phases of the West Bengal elections were held alongside those of Assam, and polling in the three other States and Puducherry was completed on April 6. With only one State left, there was a good case for fulfilling logistical requirements within a week or so and getting the remaining polling work done in one or two phases by April 15. A prolonged campaign contributes to build-up of tension. Covering an entire State in as few phases as possible will help localise the potential for violence, prevent the spread of tension due to the virulence of the campaign, besides reducing the fatigue of forces deployed throughout the campaign, up to the day of counting. A shorter election may be a safer one too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/salutary-steps/article34434972.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||The theatre||The theatre, it will generally be admitted, is an institution with great potentialities for the advancement of Nationalism in a country. The Drama, in times of healthy literary progress, tends to truly reflect the varied aspects of national life — political, social, religious and cultural — and in the hands of patriotic playwrights and actors can well be utilised to present before the masses the ancient ideals of National greatness in a popular and impressive form. It provides ample scope for a happy synthesis of all the fine arts and makes an almost irresistible appeal alike to the literate and illiterate mind. Hence the necessity, especially in critical times of National renascence like the present, to pay proper attention to the development of the theatre and exploit it effectively for purposes of patriotic inspiration and National education among the people. The value of the theatre particularly in the education of children is, it is happy to note, gradually coming to be realised in modern times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-theatre/article34434981.ece

The External Affairs Ministry released three protest notes which have been handed over to the Pakistan High Commission here [New Delhi] listing several instances of Pakistani aggressive activities across the Indian border in constant violation of the ground rules governing the disposition of troop deployments on either side. These protest notes drew the Pakistan Government’s attention to specific instances of border violations by the Pakistan Army in the last few days with the deliberate intention of provoking a conflict. On the night oi April 26 the Pakistan Army came right up to the Indian border at Barnapara near Jalpaiguri and opened fire into Indian territory killing two Indian villagers. The next day there was a further Pakistani incursion in the Boira area north of Bongaon which resulted in the death of five Indians including a minor girl and injuries to three other persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/india-warns-pakistan/article34434982.ece
29 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Second wave hurting India’s recovery’||India’s ‘escalating’ second wave of COVID-19 infections poses serious downside risks to the economy and heightens the possibility of business disruptions in addition to ‘the substantial loss of life and significant humanitarian concerns’, S&P Global Ratings said on Wednesday. While S&P said it may revisit its 11% growth projection for this year, rating agency ICRA said that the rise in infections was dampening the economic recovery with several indicators losing momentum in April. ‘Permanent output loss’ “A drawn-out COVID-19 outbreak will impede India’s economic recovery,” S&P said in a statement. “This may prompt us to revise our base-case assumption of 11% growth over fiscal 2021/2022, particularly if the government is forced to reimpose broad containment measures. The country already faces a permanent loss of output versus its pre-pandemic path, suggesting a long-term production deficit equivalent to about 10% of GDP (gross domestic product),” the global rating agency warned. Stressing that the pace and scale of the post-crisis recovery would have important implications for India’s sovereign credit rating, S&P said that strong economic growth would be critical to sustain the government’s aggressive fiscal stance and stabilise its high debt stock relative to GDP. “The continuing resurgence in COVID-19 cases and proliferation of localised restrictions could dampen the pace of recovery for the Indian corporate sector,” ICRA said in a report titled ‘Indian economy – Vaccinated against COVID-19?’. With sentiment souring, there may be some loss of demand in the first half, particularly in contact-intensive sectors, said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA. The Indian rating agency also underlined that the actual pace of the vaccine roll-out to the wider adult population would impact sentiment and growth. “An earlier availability of vaccine imports, enabling a faster coverage of the vaccination drive, may offer a back-ended upside to the GDP growth in FY2022, after the disruption that may emerge in the near term,” it said. ‘Vaccines vs mutants’ Economist D.K. Srivastava cautioned that failure to rein in the surge in cases soon would worsen the adverse impact on the economy. “The longer the second wave lasts, the more severe would be the adverse impact on the economy ,” said Mr Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India. “There would be a race between the pace of COVID vaccination vis-à-vis the speed at which COVID-19 including its new mutants spread,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/second-wave-hurting-indias-recovery/article34434954.ece
29 April 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Limited sops make scrappage policy for vehicles unattractive’||Limited incentives and poor cost economics for trucks in the Vehicle Scrappage Policy, coupled with lack of addressable volumes for other segments is unlikely to drive freight transporters to replace their old vehicles with new ones, a report said on Wednesday. Though the scrappage volume of buses, PVs and two-wheelers is expected to be limited as well, the policy’s impact on new commercial vehicle (CV) sales could be sizeable, based on addressable volume, ratings agency Crisil Research said in its report. The policy proposes to de-register vehicles that fail fitness tests or are unable to renew registrations after 15-20 years of use. According to Crisil, many buses owned by state transport undertakings will have a life of more than 15 years. In comparison, buses operated for intercity, staff, school and tourist segments typically do not have a life beyond 15 years, and would thus be outside the ambit of the scrappage policy. As for passenger vehicles, renewal of registration fees is proposed to be increased from Rs. 600 to Rs. 5,000 (valid for five years) for PVs older than 15 years, which is a more than eightfold increase. The potential benefit from scrapping a 15-year-old, entry-level small car will be Rs. 70,000, whereas its resale value is around Rs. 95,000. That makes scrapping unattractive, Crisil said in the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/limited-sops-make-scrappage-policy-for-vehicles-unattractive/article34434966.ece

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Super Kings clinically disassemble Sunrisers, win five in a row||Well begun is half done. Sometimes it is more than that. Chennai Super Kings openers Ruturaj Gaikwad and Faf du Plessis powered their team to the top of the table with a calculated onslaught. The clinical CSK chased down Sunrisers Hyderabad’s 171 by seven wickets in the IPL clash at New Delhi’s Feroze Shah Kotla ground on Wednesday. Ruturaj, who made a delightful 75 of footwork and timing, and du Plessis (56), raised 129 in 13 overs on a good batting surface to snuff out Sunrisers’ challenge. Ruturaj got to his front foot for the silken drives and when the bowler pitched a little short, picked runs off his back foot with cuts and pulls. Footwork is Ruturaj’s ally. And he forces bowlers to alter length. The natural grace and rhythm in his batting is hard to miss. With exemplary hand-eye coordination, du Plessis struck the ball past cover and point, and then powered the ball through mid-off as Khaleel Ahmed and Siddarth Kaul came in for punishment. When left-arm spinner J. Suchith came on, he sashayed down for a six over long-on. Both opened up the field at will. Ruturaj, using the crease beautifully, pulled Rashid Khan nonchalantly. However, the skilful Rashid did consume Ruturaj with a quickish leg-spinner, had Moeen Ali taken in the deep and trapped du Plessis leg-before with a googly. It was not enough for SRH. Earlier, it was Kane Williamson, light on his feet and heavy with his strokes, who fired SRH to a combative score with a barrage of shots in the end. It was a captivating cameo (26 off 10) but he should have come in earlier. A six over cover point — the stroke encapsulated Williamson’s footwork, still head, balance and timing — off Shardul Thakur was the pick. And Kedar Jadhav ended the innings with a clubbed last ball six over square-leg off Sam Curran. The backbone of the Sunrisers innings, after David Warner chose to bat, was the 106-run second-wicket partnership between the left-right combination of a struggling Warner (57 off 55) and a relatively more enterprising Manish Pandey (61 off 46). Warner’s bat-speed is his strength. Although a muscular hitter of the ball, the southpaw is not without footwork. Yet this was a night when he could not find momentum save for the odd hefty blow. CSK bowled tight and fielded capably. The swift du Plessis conjured an electric moment when he dived at wide long-on after Pandey heaved Lungi Ngidi.

The 38-year-old, playing in his fourth Olympics, felt he is not under-prepared and on the contrary is in the best shape mentally going into the quadrennial event. “I don’t think we are under-prepared. As far as training and travel are concerned, it has not been ideal. But I feel I am in a much better situation than last year. In fact, I played well in the World Table Tennis Star Contender series last month in Doha, beating World No. 16 Patrick Franziska of Germany,” said Sharath in a virtual press meet facilitated by SAI (Sports Authority of India)-TOPS (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) on Wednesday. No dip “Manika [Batra] and Sathiyan too played quite well in Doha. I thought my level did not dip in the last one year. This could be my and the country’s best Olympics due to my understanding of my mind, body and the experiences that I’ve had over the years.” Praising TOPS for funding his training, travelling and other expenses, Sharath said, “things became a lot better once TOPS came into the fold. They have been very forthcoming and open to suggestions. We are able to concentrate on our training. The system has become more professional.”  The last couple of years, according to Sharath, have been very consistent. “I have been ranked around 40 in the world in the last two years. More than anything, my ranking has done the talking. The 2018 Commonwealth and the Asian Games medals have done us a world of good. “The 2018 Asian Games bronze medals in men’s team and mixed doubles (with Manika Batra) gave us the confidence that we can do well in the Olympics,” said the nine-time National champion, ranked 32 in the world. Not many options Acknowledging that this would not be the best of Olympics like earlier times when he saw Roger Federer, Kobe Bryant, Novak Djokovic from close quarters. “In a social way it is not going to be the best of Olympics. There will not be much festivities and celebration. We’ll have to adapt as we don’t have many options,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/this-could-be-indias-best-olympics/article34435151.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Pant’s instincts versus Morgan’s method||Rishabh Pant is an unpredictable captain. He shuffles his bowlers on instinct and that will hold the key when Delhi Capitals meets Kolkata Knight Riders at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Thursday. KKR looked a different outfit when it restricted a star-studded Punjab Kings to 123 for nine, but its batting department remains wobbly. Chasing a modest target, Eoin Morgan’s side was three down for 17 before the skipper upped the ante. Against DC, which is blessed with a variety of spin and pace options, KKR’s batsmen will continue to be tested. Uncapped pacer Avesh Khan has been DC’s best bowler, with 12 wickets in six outings. The addition of Ishant Sharma after R. Ashwin’s departure has augured well for the side. Finally blooming As for DC’s batting, Shimron Hetmyer is finally blooming in the IPL. The unbeaten 53 off 25 balls against Royal Challengers Bangalore will give him a lot of confidence before he faces the likes of Pat Cummins and Sunil Narine. Morgan’s decision to persist with Narine has reaped benefits for KKR. The experienced spin bowler has been among the wickets and remains a strong source of support for Varun Chakravarthy. Fast-bowlers Shivam Mavi and Prasidh Krishna have got their lengths and pace variations right, which has kept New Zealand quick Lockie Ferguson out of the mix. Rahul Tripathi has been the most consistent KKR batsman. Shubman Gill’s form is a cause for concern and the opener will be keen on a big score to silence the critics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pants-instincts-versus-morgans-method/article34435094.ece
29 April 2021||Madrid,||Dominant Chelsea seizes advantage against Real||With a dominant start and a milestone goal by Christian Pulisic, Chelsea showed its strength against Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals. Chelsea took control early in Tuesday’s first leg to hold the Spanish powerhouse to a 1-1 away draw, with Pulisic becoming the first U.S. international to score in the tournament’s last four. He also surpassed DaMarcus Beasley to become the top American scorer in Champions League history with five goals. A red-hot Karim Benzema equalised for a lacklustre Madrid squad on a rainy night at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium in the first Champions League match since the controversial Super League folded last week. The second leg is on May 5 in London. Chelsea got off to a fast start and had chances to add to its lead after Pulisic opened the scoring with a nice finish in the 14th minute off a high pass by Antonio Rudiger inside the area. Pulisic calmly got past goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois before hitting the net past the Madrid defenders trying to block his shot at the goal line. Real evened the match on Benzema’s volley from inside the area in the 29th, and there were few significant chances either way during the rest of the game. Benzema’s goal came a few minutes after he clipped the post with a long-range shot. The French striker controlled a loose ball with his head before turning and firing a volley into the top of the net for his 13th goal in his last 14 matches. It was Benzema’s 16th goal in his last 17 home games with Real.  The result (semifinal, first leg): Real Madrid 1 (Benzema 29) drew with Chelsea 1 (Pulisic 14).   0 - Real Madrid has faced Chelsea more often than any other side in all competitions without winning, failing in all three matches (D1 L2) 1 - Christian Pulisic is the first American player to score against Real in all competitions and in a UEFA Champions League semifinal 1 - Real registered just one shot on target versus Chelsea; since 2003-04, only versus Paris Saint-Germain (0) in September 2019 has it had fewer in the Champions League 5 - Thomas Tuchel is the only manager to face Los Blancos as many as five times without ever losing (W1 D4) 71 - Karim Benzema is now the joint-fourth top scorer in the competition’s history (along with Raul). Only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski have now scored more||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dominant-chelsea-seizes-advantage-against-real/article34435096.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Can RR extend recent supremacy over MI?||It has dominated the mighty Mumbai Indians over the last three seasons, winning five of their six meetings. But ahead of Thursday’s clash against the defending champion in Delhi, Rajasthan Royals will have it tough, as it looks to make the most of limited resources. As if losing Jofra Archer and Ben Stokes to injuries wasn’t a big blow, Liam Livingstone and Andrew Tye pulled out because of COVID-related issues. It leaves Sanju Samson’s side with only four overseas cricketers: Jos Buttler, David Miller, Chris Morris and Mustafizur Rahman. The RR team management will also have to ensure that the recent departures, coupled with the disturbing events outside the bubble, don’t end up demoralising the domestic cricketers. MI, after a five-day break, will be eager to bounce back from successive losses. In addition to improving its mid-table position, the squad will be keen to gift captain Rohit Sharma a victory on the eve of his 34th birthday. MI will be hoping that Hardik Pandya gets back into his groove. The hard-hitting batsman has been found wanting, with opposition bowlers successfully employing wide yorkers against him. Hardik’s inability to find a counter has played a part in MI managing only two wins in the first five games. MI has a reputation of shifting into a higher gear mid-season and it will hope that the new venue brings with it a change of fortunes.  MI, which had a five-day break, will be eager to bounce back from successive losses RR has only four overseas players: Buttler, Miller, Morris and Mustafizur||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/can-rr-extend-recent-supremacy-over-mi/article34435091.ece
29 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Harsha joins hands with Ramaraju||The 21-year-old Harsha Bharathakoti became a chess Grandmaster under the tutelage of well-known coach N.V.S. Ramaraju in 2019. And now, he has joined hands with him to don the role of a ‘guru’. Harsha and Raju thought the best way to stay in touch with the game in the present situation was to engage themselves in training talent across India, online. “It has been a pretty challenging first-time experience for me. I had to learn a few things from Raju Sir — who also trained the likes of GMs D. Harika and B. Pratyusha, Raja Rithvik, Rahul Srivastava — to become a decent coach,” said Harsha as the two inaugurated the Ramaraju Academy of Chess Education at Madhapur. Easier to be a player “It is easier to be a player than a coach but these are the kind of challenges which also make you a better player by way of coming up with some probing questions from young talent,” he added. Harsha rues missing an opportunity to compete in what would have been his last World juniors in 2020 and also couple of other majors including World Rapid and Blitz chess. “Coaching is one of the best ways to keep yourself in touch with the sport and no better way than sharing the platform with your own guru.” Harsha said he is working hard on reaching the ELO 2700-mark from the present 2509.   Ramaraju feels it is a challenge to motivate young talent, especially when you know there are no tournaments. “The response has been good even during these testing times. We conduct weekly tournaments and follow them up with critical analysis of the games to help improve the skills of the players.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/harsha-joins-hands-with-ramaraju/article34435752.ece
29 April 2021||Kolkata,||Asian meet moved from Delhi to Dubai||The Asian Boxing Confederation (ASBC) has moved the Asian boxing championships from New Delhi to Dubai due to the worsening pandemic situation in the country. The continental event, which was earlier postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak, will be co-hosted by the UAE Boxing Association and the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) from May 21 to June 1, which is one day more than the original schedule. The ASBC on Tuesday informed all member nations about the change. The prestigious event was scheduled to be held at the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex in New Delhi. However, with the newly-imposed international travel restrictions from many countries due to the prevailing pandemic situation, BFI and ASBC jointly took a decision to relocate the tournament, said a BFI release on Wednesday. “It’s unfortunate that we have to shift the venue out of India… but we are left with no options. “Boxers’ safety is most important. We are grateful to UAE for agreeing to co-host it on such a short notice,” said BFI president Ajay Singh. Amid speculation that the Indian team might fly out of the country a few weeks prior to the event to meet COVID protocols in the UAE, BFI secretary Himanta Kalita said the federation would act as per the need. “As of now there is no such plan. But it is 100 percent confirmed that the Indian team will participate in the event. “We will follow all necessary safety protocols,” Kalita told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/asian-meet-moved-from-delhi-to-dubai/article34435152.ece

The 23-year-old was part of the team which defeated Olympic champion Argentina twice in the FIH Pro League earlier this month. “One can practice a lot during training sessions, but a player’s actual ability can be judged only during matches and therefore I was delighted to play in a big tournament like the FIH Hockey Pro League,” said Shamsher in a release issued by Hockey India. Happy with show “To be among the best, we have to constantly test ourselves against the best and I was very happy with the way I performed in the FIH Hockey Pro League matches against Argentina.” “The matches certainly gave me a good idea about the level at which a hockey athlete plays in a big tournament. “The competition certainly gave me great exposure and I am sure the experience will help me become a much better player for India,” said Shamsher.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/argentina-experience-will-help-me-become-better-shamsher/article34435362.ece
29 April 2021||MUMBAI,||Raman reapplies for women’s coach job||W.V. Raman has reapplied for the India’s women’s team head coach job, while former India coaches Tushar Arothe and Ramesh Powar are also believed to have thrown their hat in the ring. “I have applied for the job,” Arothe told Sportstar . In 2018, Arothe had quit after having differences with some of the cricketers and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had named Ramesh Powar as the coach. However after the 2018 T20 World Cup, Powar was replaced by Raman. While Powar was not available for comment, it is understood that he sent his application to the BCCI before the deadline of April 26. Bhave in the fray Former national selector Surendra Bhave has also applied for the job, while BCCI sources indicated that Venkatesh Prasad may also be in contention. The former India pacer, however, denied the claims. “Before the pandemic, I did a U-19 Zonal camp and also did a tournament in Mysuru. I liked what I saw in the camp and I think I will be able to deliver. It is worth a try,” Bhave said. A couple of weeks ago, the BCCI had invited applications for the head coach’s role after Raman’s contract expired last October. The former India cricketer, however, was asked to continue till the recently concluded home series against South Africa. Raman has an impressive resume, and many in the fraternity believe that he should be given a longer rope.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/raman-reapplies-for-womens-coach-job/article34435675.ece
29 April 2021||Margao,||FC Goa seeks maiden ACL win against Al Wahda||Already out of reckoning for a knock-out berth, India’s FC Goa will seek its maiden win in the Asian Football Confederation Champions League (ACL) in its last Group E match against Al Wahda of the UAE here on Thursday. If the Goan team manages to win, it will become the first Indian club to achieve the feat in the tournament. The team conceded an 89th-minute goal to squander the chance on Monday when it played out a 1-1 draw with Al Rayyan of Qatar. With three points from five matches, FC Goa is not in contention of a round-of-16 berth from the group. Last season runners-up Persepolis FC and Al Wahda have 12 and 10 points from five matches. Al Wahda will come into Thursday's match on a confident note after its 1-0 win over in its last match on Monday. But FC Goa will also take confidence from the fact that it could have won the first leg match on April 17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fc-goa-seeks-maiden-acl-win-against-al-wahda/article34435402.ece

The relay teams were scheduled to take a 3 a.m. KLM flight to Amsterdam from Mumbai on Thursday but the Royal Dutch Airlines intimated that it would not allow them to board the flight after the Netherlands Government’s ban on passenger flights from India. “We are very disappointed at this moment. There are no direct flights between Indian airports and Warsaw, Poland. “This meant that despite the best efforts, the squad could not be rerouted on another airline,” Adille Sumariwalla, the president of the Athletics Federation of India, said on Wednesday. Alternatives “For the last 24 hours we have been consistently trying to find alternatives, we have used all the resources to sort this out, we have been constantly speaking to the organisers, the World Athletics, various consulates and airlines to reroute them. “Under the present scenario nobody has obliged.” Prominent names Muhammed Anas, Arokia Rajiv, Amoj Jacob, Nirmal Noah Tom, Hima Das and Dutee Chand were among the prominent athletes who were supposed to take part in the World Relays which are a qualifying event for the Tokyo Olympics and World Championships. The disappointment comes a couple of days after the AFI withdrew its women’s 4x400m relay team from the World Relays as a few of its leading runners — Anjali Devi, V.K. Vismaya and Jisna Mathew — were either injured, not fit or were not ready.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-to-miss-world-relays/article34435136.ece
29 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nepomniachtchi triumphs||Eventual champion World No. 4 Ian Nepomniachtchi and Anish Giri, the two front-runners of the Candidates chess tournament till Monday, lost their 14th and final round encounters on Tuesday as the competition came to end, 406 days after it started. Nepomniachtchi, assured of the title after Giri’s loss on Monday evening, surrendered rather tamely to the World No. 3 who signed off with three straight wins to make amends for an otherwise sub-par display in the 14-round contest. The Russian was in the lead when the event was halted last March after seven rounds. On resumption, he did not let go of his lead and eventually ensured the title with a round to spare.  On Tuesday, Giri lost to Russia’s Kirill Alekseenko. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave took the second spot after beating Wang Hao. Fabiano Caruana drew with Alexander Grischuk to share the third spot with Giri. Later, Wang Hao, 31, announced his retirement from professional chess.   14th round results:   Ding Liren (Chn) bt Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus); Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra) bt Wang Hao (Chn); Anish Giri (Ned) lost to Kirill Alekseenko (Rus); Fabiano Caruana (USA) drew with Alexander Grischuk (Rus).   Final standings: 1. Nepomniachtchi (8.5 points), 2. Vachier (8), 3-4. Giri, Caruana (7.5 each), 5-6. Ding, Grischuk (7 each), 7. Alekseenko (5.5), 8.

29 April 2021||TOKYO,||New ‘playbooks’ unveiled||The local organisers and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), on Wednesday, pushed ahead with plans to open the postponed Tokyo Olympics in just under three months, unveiling the latest set of rule books to show how the Games can be held during a pandemic. This version of the ‘Playbooks’ offers more details than the first edition in February, but much of the specific planning will remain in flux until the final update comes out in June. Though vaccines are now available, the strategy for the Olympics is geared around holding the Games in a “bubble” as if there were no vaccines. Organisers are not expected to announce until June if fans will be allowed into venues — and if so, how many. Fans from abroad have already been banned. The decision on venue capacity was promised to come to this month but has been pushed back. Daily testing Organisers are expected to announce daily testing for athletes, up from once every four days. They are also expected to drop a 14-day quarantine, allowing athletes to train upon arrival. Athletes will be required to stay in the Olympic Village, and venues and training areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/new-playbooks-unveiled/article34435140.ece

The charges related to the T10 League in the UAE in 2017 when Zoysa was a Sri Lanka bowling coach. Zoysa, who will turn 43 next month, played 30 Tests and 95 ODIs over a decade until 2007.

Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Mumbai and Saurashtra had sought permission to host their T20 leagues in early June before the monsoon sets in. Since this went against BCCI’s rule of not allowing any T20 league to start a fortnight before and after the IPL, the BCCI apex council discussed the issue. The BCCI interim chief executive, in a letter to the four associations, confirmed that the apex council had made an exception this year considering the shorter windows available due to the pandemic. “Owing to the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, the BCCI is giving a one-time permission to organise the tournament within the 15-day window after completion of IPL 2021,” Hemang Amin stated in the letter, accessed by The Hindu . “Accordingly, the BCCI is pleased to grant you the approval to organise the tournament for the year 2021.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bcci-nod-for-t20-leagues/article34435085.ece

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Taking one for the team||Public disquiet over IPL games continuing to be held whilst bodies pile up at crematoriums across the country has been growing louder on social media. Cricket diehards will not make that case, however; they call it “a distraction” amid the din. Nevertheless, it has been a strange season off the pitch, especially for the over two dozen sports good stores on Wallajah Road, which leads to the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chepauk. The road and the insides of these stores, much like the galleries at the stadium, are deserted these days. No demand Syed Shahbaz of Dhoni Sports, one of the prominent sporting good stores on Wallajah Road, says, “We did think at the start of this year that we would be able to cope when the IPL season started. But our calculations went wrong. Compared to 2019, I think we have only been able to do 10-20% of the numbers [of sales]. What’s worse is that even our foreign orders have gone down to nil since lockdown last year.” He adds: “Friday, Saturday and Sunday are usually the days when business is at its peak but the store is almost always empty now.” Last year, when the first national lockdown was enforced, there was a surge in demand for indoor games. Even though it meant sales of cricket bats and accessories of other outdoor sports went down, retailers like Syed were only too happy to meet the demand. “People used to buy carrom and chess boards like crazy and we were running out of stock constantly. This year, we have the stocks but there is no demand,” he says. For Mohammed T Vakharia, partner in Tamil Nadu Sports Emporium, another sporting goods store on Wallajah Road, the items that he has been selling of late are related to physical fitness: “Dumbbells, rods, plates, resistance bands,” he says, as row-upon-row of unsold cricket bats and other sports accessories deck the wall behind him. “We used to sell to Government agencies and educational institutes too. Even that has dried up now because nobody is holding corporate tournaments,” he says, adding that more than IPL, it is the lack of amateur sporting action that is hitting retailers like him hard. “The cricket fever actually picks up when an event like IPL or the World Cup concludes.” However, total lockdown on Sundays dents such hopes since it is on this day when most amateur cricketers in the city usually gather for a game or tournament. Still, people like Ajay S find a way to satiate their passion. “I have moved my matches to Saturdays now. Anyway, most people are still working from home, and so we are able to find time off [to play],” says Ajay. That is not however the case with Anandakrishnan S; it was only recently that he had formed a motley crew team of 30-somethings to play cricket tournaments on the weekend. The survival of this team — ironically named Survivors — is up in the air, he admits. “We had just started practising regularly and preparing for tournaments before the lockdown happened. Now if people can’t get together for another month or so, I fear all that effort will go to waste,” he says. In any case, he has a backup plan. “We can always play underarm cricket in my apartment parking lot. Every Sunday evening, a few of us gather to play, including my grandfather and uncle. When they relax Sunday lockdown restrictions, we can play again, and after everyone is vaccinated... we may all even be able to go back to normal,” he adds, hopefully.  Cheering from home Saravanan Hari is a well-known superfan among Chennai Super Kings supporters. The man who goes so far as to paint himself yellow for CSK games too is playing safe this year. In a video he posted to his Twitter account, he says: “Some seem to think that they may not catch the virus. I know what COVID-19 does to people. I managed to recover from it but it wasn’t easy. So, stay home and stay safe.” In another video, Saravanan can be found waving the yellow flag inside his home and showing support for his favourite IPL team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/taking-one-for-the-team/article34435606.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Order of survival||AD Singh, the man behind some of India’s most popular restaurant and gastropub chains, swears on the value of good waiters and floor staff. The self-professed “food snob” believes they are key to how enjoyable a dining space is. “At Monkey Bar, we don’t have longtime-favourites in our menu. We want our guests to try out new and different things every time, and the people who can guide them are our floor staff,” he says, adding that certain servers have proven so valuable that they are carted to different cities when new branches are set up. In this fresh wave of COVID-19 lockdowns, his staff is among his primary concerns. “We would not have survived the national lockdown without the support of our teams, landlords, vendors, investors and the agencies we work with. Once the lockdown stopped we tried to do our best for them in return. Hopefully, that has built up their confidence and comfort to support us again,” says Singh. Having said that, Singh also acknowledges that some advance notice of impending lockdowns would result in fewer problems. Downing shutters on two days’ notice is not easy: “With more time we can stop fresh purchases, exhaust our perishables, give our teams advance notice to plan their leaves,” he explains. As the founder of the Olive group that owns pubs, restaurants and cafes across Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Chennai and Goa, Singh is in a position to observe and explain how lockdowns and curfews can affect different kinds of dine-in businesses differently. For instance, “Late night restrictions make it more difficult for us where we have a good bar business or party business, as these both build up and run late. Our cafe The Grammar Room [in New Delhi] does 90% of its business all day, and so restricted timings don’t matter to it. OLLY, our Olive cafe in Cyberhub [Gurugram], does great lunch business and early evening, post-work business.” Saturdaynight out Singh’s words hold true across the board — restaurants thrive on being familiar haunts for gourmands; for families looking to escape the humdrum of domesticity; for harried professionals waiting to unwind. They cater to different crowds and function at different times of day, but the one thing they depend most on is bringing people to their venue. Once that stops, revenues are bound to plummet. “The Olive group is mainly focussed on the dine-in business and over 90% of our revenue currently comes from that,” says Singh. Riyaaz Amlani of Social also states that the majority of his revenue comes from people dining in instead of ordering, but admits that this chain is luckier than most. “A lot of restaurants that do not have deep pockets will probably have to liquidate over this round of lockdowns. For any good restaurant, about 15% of their business comes from delivery. That barely covers rentals, never mind other costs of operations,” he says over the phone. Costs include “rent, salaries, food procurement, licensing fees, utilities like electricity. Depending on where your restaurant is, rent alone could take up 15% to 20% of all your costs. Salary would be another 20% to 25%, and raw material anywhere between 15% and 35%,” explains Gauri Devidayal, owner of Mumbai-based The Table, over phone. She adds that with popular delivery apps, commissions (an app can take up to 35% or 40% of the money earned from an order, and charge higher for “discovery”) and deep discounts (remember that pizza you bought at half price last weekend?) make things more difficult. “It is impossible to profit at these prices,” she says. If their entire customer base paid at such deep discounts, restaurants would be unable to stay afloat. But now, with a fresh slew of lockdowns in place due to the new wave of COVID-19, Gauri sees direct delivery as the best among severely limited options: “There is nothing we can do about restaurants being closed, but at least within the delivery-only situation, it will help if diners can order directly. There are still shortfalls in direct ordering platforms and systems, but a little extra effort [from customers who want to help their favourite restaurants survive lockdown] can go a long way,” she says. Mindful alternatives To that end, alternative apps like Thrive and DotPe give restaurants more control over operations, put them in direct contact with consumers (DotPe links users to restaurants’ WhatsApp accounts), and charges fees that are either as low as 5% or kept safe from market fluctuations — meaning the fees a restaurant pays will not fluctuate depending on how many orders it gets. Being fairly new, these platforms are still dealing with operational hiccups. And, as Amlani points out, “You need to be an already discovered, established restaurant for people to seek you out directly or through other apps.” Yet, these alternatives must have done something right in the past year, because restaurants and users are flocking to them. DotPe alone boasts of over 10,000 restaurants so far. DotPe recently launched a video campaign #OrderDirect, urging people to use DotPe’s platform to order directly from local restaurants. Anurag Gupta, co-founder and COO of DotPe sent out a statement: “Many food aggregators are worsening the situation by introducing heavy commissions and guidelines that squeeze these businesses. This is why we want to encourage people to start ordering from them directly. This will also ensure that their staff can retain their means of living. In fact, if the deliveries for direct orders increase, the restaurant owners can employ more people and take control of their business.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/order-of-survival/article34435647.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||‘My Octopus Teacher’: Swati Thiyagarajan on the Netflix documentary’s Oscars win||When My Octopus Teacher debuted on Netflix, viewers were unsure what to make of it from the title. But then, the word-of-mouth began, and the small project quickly grew into one of the most popular documentaries of 2020. Tracing the tender, almost mentor-like relationship between a sea diver and a common octopus in South Africa, the 85-minute long film stars naturalist and documentary filmmaker Craig Foster, as he takes us through the wondrous tale in an underwater kelp forest. Foster’s wife, Swati Thiyagarajan, also a filmmaker, environmentalist and journalist, served as associate producer and production manager on the project. Originally from Chennai, Swati is renowned for her work as a conservationist, and is a core member of the Sea Change Project, which contributes to the long-term protection of South Africa’s marine environment. This week, My Octopus Teacher bagged the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature at the 93rd Academy Awards, (it also won the BAFTA earlier) and Swati’s contribution to the film has been hailed in India, as an important step towards encouraging documentary filmmakers in the country. Talking to us from South Africa where she currently resides (she virtually celebrated the Oscars win as she could not be in Los Angeles), Swati and her team are still waiting for the achievement to sink in. Excerpts from an interview: How did you conceptualise the idea for the documentary? Craig started to dive in the Great African Seaforest, at the southern tip of South Africa, everyday about 10 years ago, when he needed to recover from facing burnout at work. The place where he was most happy was always the ocean. So in the process of doing that, he really immersed himself in the Seaforest ecosystem, and learnt how to track underwater, when he met his “octopus teacher”. Then began the extraordinary year of being able to observe her life. There was no plan at the time to make a film. The ecosystem slowly revitalised and gave him back energy, and he started filming again really from an exploration study point of view. It was Craig’s authentic, experienced story we wanted to tell; we didn’t design it around how a global audience might react. That there was this unbelievable response that was staggering. What was your role as the associate producer and production manager?  As Craig is my partner, and I am involved in conservation and wildlife myself, he would share with me stories from his diving experiences everyday, and discuss the footage and photographs. Our executive producer, Ellen Windemuth, is an old friend of Craig’s, and had earlier made a film called The Great Dance with him. She too advised on the story and then we came up with a rough outline for the documentary. Did you expect the win at the Oscars?  It was still a tremendous surprise because our fellow nominees were superb films, and every documentary had the right to win. So it was hard to just believe we would succeed. When they first announced the nominees, and we saw our clip up there, and then they announced the winner… we were so excited. It’s still sinking in! Your win has created a lot of cheer in India as someone representing the country at the Oscars…  It is lovely if it has created cheer. I reside in South Africa now, but most of my life was lived in India. Right now, I am so absolutely heartbroken at the completely awful situation in the country with COVID-19. The pandemic at large is because of our exploitation of Nature. It is most certainly my experiences in India that shaped me, my ideas and thoughts... that is the part of India I brought with me to this film.  Your take on the support given to documentaries in India, and whether a win like this could be used for the better?  We have some of the absolute best filmmakers in India in the documentary field. The work is outstanding, so it is disheartening to see not much support for documentary films in the country. I don’t know if a win like this could make a difference, but the audiences have changed today. This is exciting because it gives everyone the opportunity to think out-of-the-box, reset things, and create funding for documentaries.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||A star is born||Ashwin Kumar Lakshmikanthan left his hometown Coimbatore for Kodambakkam, once the hub of Tamil cinema and a microcosm for film aspirants, with big city dreams in his eyes. He had a crippling sense of fear when he reached his first audition, having neither experience nor influential people in his phonebook. He played a small part alongside actor Arya, who played a guest role in Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam in 2014. The scene was eventually trimmed; but it gave Ashwin confidence. Perhaps he could make it in the industry after all. Then, he was called for an audition for Mani Ratnam’s OK Kanmani (2015). Ashwin had always looked up to three filmmakers: AR Murugadoss, Mani Ratnam and Gautham Menon, so the offer to be part of a Madras Talkies production [Ratnam’s banner] was the icing on the cake. Only, it was not. When he arrived for the audition, the set was packed with over 70 well-groomed models, both male and female, also jostling for space to register their presence on screen. It was only then that it dawned on Ashwin that the dream — of becoming an actor — was one he shared with hundreds. He did not make an impression with Mani Ratnam, despite a photo opportunity and a blink-and-miss role as a background artiste in OK Kanmani . Last year, Ashwin acted in the short-film Kadhal Ondru Kanden for which he received praise on social media. It got him the attention he longed for, and a well-known filmmaker was ready to cast him, but only as a supporting actor. “At the end of the day, I realised I cannot make it on my own even if I have the talent. I kept thinking ‘What more should I prove to this industry? How much more should I sacrifice?’,” says Ashwin, over phone, a week after the finale of Cook with Comali , the reality television show that finally put him on the map. Edited excerpts: What is your headspace like now, post Cook with Comali ? It was initially hard to adjust to the routine. I went off social media and isolated myself. Then, a week later, I slowly got back to my senses and started accepting things.  Was it a transformative experience?  I didn’t change much, as a person. What you saw on TV is who I am in real life. Having said that, it takes time for me to open up. The camera never used to linger on me because they always thought I was this quiet, shy person. And I couldn’t break that perception. Even on Cook with Comali , I took my own time to warm up. But there were people like Rakshan, Sivaangi, Pugazh and Sharath who made me feel inclusive. They showed a positive vibe and the show’s format itself is light-hearted. Being an ‘outsider’ to films, was there a sense of insecurity?  It wasn’t smooth sailing for sure. If not for my friend who motivated me and took care of my expenses, I would have given up long time back. It’s frustrating when people randomly call you for auditions with a callous attitude. Sometimes, they won’t even tell you whether you got the part! I waited nearly a year for this one film, but only later did I come to know through a friend that shooting was already underway with a different actor. Maybe, Cook with Comali happened at the right time... True. Which is why when I got this offer, I felt it was all about food and maybe it’s best if I don’t take part. They [showrunners] told me that I can manage with the basics. I made sure that I didn’t miss out on this opportunity to prove my salt, and put my heart into it. I was doing a web series which I cancelled to concentrate on the show. I thought I shouldn’t look like a dummy on TV and improvised a lot. It paid off.  You were featured in the song ‘Kutty Pattas’ which went viral. Now you are acting with fellow comali Pugazh in a Tamil film. Is your talent finally being recognised?  Cook with Comali was a rebirth of sorts for me. I have faced a lot of insults, rejections and have been pushed to the bottom but I didn’t give up. I was hoping for that one chance. Wherever I went, the producer said they wanted fame and the director wanted money. I had neither. Now I have the “fame” they were looking for. I don’t want to sound demotivating, but want to insist upon this for aspirants like me: be prepared.  I have faced a lot of insults, rejections and have been pushed to the bottom but I didn’t give up. All I was hoping for was for that one chance Ashwin Kumar Lakshmikanthan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-star-is-born/article34435598.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||A locked-down army||“Everyone is looking for ways to help,” says Deepthi Tanikella, a Chennai-based entrepreneur who has been providing home cooked meals to isolating, COVID-positive people in her neighbourhood for the past month. “I came across an Instagram post by Harshini Sridhar, asking if anyone would be willing to cook for patients. I cook for my family everyday, all I needed to do was make some more,” she recalls. Providing those fatigued by COVID-19 the comfort of a home-cooked meal was a chance Deepthi could not refuse: she is now part of a group of 12 people, spread across Virugambakkam, Alwarpet, ECR and other parts of the city, dispatching meals to patients who live in the area. They are not alone; small groups of eager helpers have mushroomed across the country, following a similar modus operandi — reaching out to COVID patients isolating at home, listing them out by area, confirming meal requirements and assigning each household to a volunteer cook. Some are small individual efforts, some are more organised groups like the Chennai-based ‘major-roof-4419’ portal on Glide, which helps patients search for food providers by PIN Code. Volunteers commit to a meal or two each — either on a day-to-day basis or for weeks at a stretch, depending on what the patient needs. They cook at home, pack it in disposable boxes and send it over at mealtimes, fresh from their kitchens. But a will to help is not enough. Deepthi stresses on the need to be organised: “Stock up on aluminium foil containers or other disposables; you can’t ask a COVID-positive home to return utensils after every meal. Keep the food simple and include lots of protein if you can. Be clear about what time of day you can commit to. Your phone number will be shared, so be sure that you don’t mind,” she says. Delivery personnel who ferry this food also deserve to know that they are being sent to a COVID-19 positive home, so that they can take precautions to protect themselves. In Kochi, Reshma Johnson plays it safe by coordinating with the same delivery boy, who keeps it contact-less. The one-woman army started Reshma’s Kitchen over a year ago, and has been providing vegetarian meals to families affected with COVID-19 in and around Kakkanad since. Currently, she is providing food to 10 families in quarantine. Often, those receiving food also receive a dose of comfort. Deepthi, for instance, has formed a special bond with an elderly man who lives away from his children. He eagerly awaits the handwritten notes she adds. She says, “he calls me another daughter”. The grocery runners Contact-less delivery is something to be kept in mind across tasks. In Hyderabad, volunteer grocery shopper Ajay Roy asks people to leave their car windows rolled down. He drops their groceries in the car, and they pick it up once he leaves. It is not just COVID patients who need help with chores, but also the old and vulnerable. Rikit Shahi, for instance, says he is happy to pick up even just a single pack of juice for a neighbour, if he knows they are vulnerable and need it. He is offering his services to those who live in and around his locality, Khairatabad. Rikit began helping via a post on Twitter, offering to procure daily necessities for people, including medicines. Rikit says, “I double mask, use a sanitiser and maintain distance. A lot of people call with their daily requests, most of them are elderly people.” Ajay, who runs a homemade food business, began this just to make sure his elderly customers get their daily needs without hassle. He is helping families in quarantine with medicines and food, mostly in and around Sainikpuri and Yapral. He says, “Most of the families have been my customers who trusted my business and supported me. Now it is my time to support them and help them recover.” Some are going a step ahead, entering homes of recently recovered COVID-19 patients to make sure affected families have a clean, comfortable environment. Over the past week, volunteers on Twitter have offered to tidy up rooms and water plants — fatigue being a major component, those isolating at home are grateful for the extra help. Fur support This time last year, when 24-year-old Ranjani Ramakrishnan decided to open her doors in Chennai for abandoned pets in collaboration with an animal shelter, little did she know she would greet a new furry friend every day. “I had so many animals coming and going at home,” she recalls fondly. This time too, Ranjani is doing the same, albeit in Bengaluru where she works. “Pet parents find it difficult to take care of them or feed them when they are COVID-19 positive,” she says. As a result, many pets (especially vulnerable ones) might feel neglected and anxious leading to behavioural changes. Like Ranjani, individuals across the country are now offering to board pets. “When I put up the post, a lot of people wanted to borrow the idea and do the same,” Ranjini continues. Some volunteers specify requirements, to make it easier to handle the stay. Bengaluru-based Shagun Ohri wrote that she can only take in pets who get along with other cats and dogs. It is imperative to chat with the pet parent and know about the animal’s likes, dislikes and food habits before taking them in, says Ranjani. Linda Alexander of Pet Paws, Chennai, a home boarding facility, is currently housing about 20 pets from isolating families. For individuals who wish to foster pets, Linda has a few pointers: “A bath is absolutely necessary. The leash or collar should also be cleaned well.” She adds that fosters should also ask about the pet’s vaccination chart. Then adds, “They have to be taken for walks regularly. Find out two things: whether they are human friendly and pet friendly. If they are not human-friendly, it will be difficult to feed them.” When a request arrives, Linda’s crew drives to the house donning a PPE suit and wielding sanitisers, and picks up the pet. Once the pet arrives, he/she is given a thorough bath — collars, leash et al — to avoid any possible transmission. Though there is no certified data stating that COVID-19 spreads through dogs or cats, sometimes people do show reluctance to take them in. Pet Paws has been seeing a steady increase in the number of boarding requests ever since the pandemic began. It takes a village Raising a child is no mean feat, especially if said child is bereft of the stimulus of peers and playrooms. Which is why clinical psychologist Dr PA Mary Anitha, who distributes food and beverages to them through her network of volunteers in Kochi, has now turned her attention to children with special needs. Anitha started the Centre For Empowerment and Enrichment in Kochi, for the care of people with disabilities in 2007 and has been in social service ever since. This time, Anitha is concentrating on COVID-19 affected families that have persons with disabilities in the house. She has a database of such families and is in constant touch with them, enquiring about their situation and needs. She also provides them with online counselling. “Children with special needs are especially vulnerable,” she says. Since last February, she has overseen care of high-risk children, with 88 volunteers whom she has trained. Other needs need less medical know-how and more empathy. For instance, friends, neighbours and even strangers are offering up a day or two of their daily schedules to help children out with their homework, guide them through assignments, or just brainstorm concepts, as virtual step-ins for that all-important classroom back and forth many have been missing out on. Guiding voices The demand for counselling and emotional support is flooding in, not hospitals, but also from people sitting at home, beleaguered by the constant threat of the pandemic, and scale of tragedy unfolding. “We have not seen such an unprecedented flood of calls for COVID-19 related queries since last April. We are getting nearly 100 calls a day,” says Chandan Achary, co-founder of Vizag Volunteers, a Visakhapatnam-based NGO. What started as a WhatsApp group with his corporate circle friends and NGOs last year, has now swelled into a social movement. The group has 600 volunteers today, bringing together a gamut of information — from hospital bed availability to plasma donation — on vizagvolunteers.org. The volunteers have also managed to build a community that provides not just medical support but also mental strength to those in home quarantine through telecounselling. Comforting anxious COVID patients through telecounselling is one of the key areas they are addressing. while attending to a flood of calls enquiring about hospital beds that the organisation realised many patients were rushing to hospitals in a full-blown panic. “If the patient can be under home quarantine, we counsel them periodically through calls and guide them through the process,” says Chandan. Groups like Vizag Volunteers are operating in many cities, and some across cities and states. Pooling in the spare hours and resources of data crunchers, fact checkers and just people who can spare the time to call and get updates from clinics, they are always in need of another helping hand, perhaps yours.  With inputs from    Meghna Majumdar , Gowri S , Prabalika M Borah , Nivedita Ganguly  and Priyadershini S    Over the past week, volunteers on Twitter have offered to tidy up rooms and water plants.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Bravery beats competence’||On Mira Nair’s watchlist tonight is a 1973 Mani Kaul film, Duvidha . Locked in, in Delhi, which has been brought to its knees by the COVID pandemic, the director of A Suitable Boy and The Namesake has turned to movies of the experimental kind. As a voting member of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and a part of the Indian jury, the filmmaker has been extensively watching others’ work in order to select 10 artistes from India to be mentored under BAFTA’s Breakthrough India initiative. Over a video call, she says, “The longer I live, the more I realise that creative energy is not limitless. And therefore, I try to do things that give me energy.” Things like going over the work of 30 applicants to BAFTA Breakthrough India to “narrow down original voices that can get lost in our country of many, especially in an industry like ours where it is all about who you know,” she adds. Breakthrough India is supported by Netflix and aims to select talented people in the film, games and television worlds to take part in a year-long mentoring and guidance programme. The nominees will receive global networking opportunities, free access to BAFTA events and screenings for 12 months, and full voting BAFTA membership. Mira and her fellow jurors, including ambassador AR Rahman, director Shonali Bose, cinematographer Santosh Sivan and producer Siddharth Roy Kapur among others, sat down for three hours to choose the nominees. “The first thing I said was that ‘I am looking for bravery, originality and a distinct voice, not competence, not imitation’.” Can you speak your truth? In Mira’s books, bravery beats competence. “A lot of people can do a good imitation of art, but few have a way of capturing the world which is unique. It is how you choose to tell the story and from what point of view that defines bravery for me. That was something I saw in this lot [the nominees], they were experimental.” Bravery to Mira, is in the intent: “the importance of speaking your truth”, and in the craft: “finding new forms to tell a story”, and in not being afraid to be different — “even when no one understands what you are doing.” Through her own journey into filmmaking, which started off with documentaries such as India Cabaret — an exploration of female strippers in then Bombay, Children of a Desired Sex ,  on the abortion of female foetuses, and The Laughing Club of India — Mira’s icons have been Richard Leacock and DA Pennebaker. “They were the pioneers of the Cinéma vérité movement and to this day, remain the barometers of truth for me,” she says. She brings up Chris Marker’s La Jetée , a science fiction-ette about post-apocalyptic experiments on humans made entirely using black and white stills. “It told me so many things about how to evoke poetry, violence and surrealism without a big budget, relying on just art and its power.” Amrita and Awadh While movies like these are what she falls back to, Mira has also been trying to keep up with Netflix, Amazon and other OTT platforms. Her first digital release was last year’s A Suitable Boy , an adaptation of Vikram Seth’s 1993 novel set in a newly independent India. It was when she was in Awadh, shooting A Suitable Boy , that she got her next project. She will be adapting the 2020 Pulitzer finalist, The Jungle Prince of Delhi , a story published by The New York Times on a family living in a decrepit lodge in Delhi, claiming to be Awadh royalty. It will be co-produced by Sister Pictures, who bankrolled the hit series Chernobyl . “Of course I was interested in the story; the whole world sent it to me when it came out. I was talking to the producers to help them and advise them about the place, and they said you must direct it,” she says. Meanwhile, Mira is also working on a feature film on Amrita Sher-Gil, the Hungarian-Indian painter regarded as one of the country’s greatest modern artists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bravery-beats-competence/article34435599.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||The engineer who makes art with sound||Sai Shravanam is playing an aalaap from his recent musical project ‘Rivers of India’ at his state-of-the-art recording studio Resound India in Adyar, a place he calls “my temple”. He toggles between computer monitors and a giant recording console to play two tracks — one original and the other he has worked on — and points out the musical difference. “I wanted this portion of the track to be ethereal and the voice to be God-like. Sound engineering is incredibly important to bring the best out of a musician,” he says. And he should know; Sai is the man behind the rich sound of several leading musicians in films and classical music universe. Recently, he received the Kalaimamani award from the Tamil Nadu Government, becoming the first sound recordist to do so. His recent works include the viral hit ‘Enjoy Enjaami’ and tracks from Dhanush’s Karnan , but Sai is pumped at the response for ‘Rivers of India’. “The song is a tribute to precious water resources in the country and stresses on the need to protect them,” he says. Conceived by Kanniks Kannikeswaran, ‘Rivers of India’ not only features a never-before-seen collaboration between Bombay Jayashri, Kaushiki Chakraborty, Rishith Desikan and Amrit Ramnath, but also has a chorus section by the global IIT alumni. “He [Kanniks] has worked hard for spreading Indian choral music in the US; he called me about this project for IIT-Madras.” The duo realised that there was not a single song that carries the names of all the major rivers in India, and decided to weave them into a song. “Projects like these give me immense happiness as it helps me explore my thirst as a musician and producer. Rivers are something that several generations witness; so we roped in two mother-son duos (Bombay Jayashri and Amrit, and Kaushiki Chakraborty and Rishith Desikan),” he adds. A different beat Sai believes sound is precious and that he has earned the sobriquet ‘the man with the golden ear’ because he does not distinguish between genres. “The day I see music as different things, such as classical, films and others, I will be finished. Sound and music are my greatest inspiration irrespective of who the artiste is.” His own musicality too plays a big role when he is mixing and mastering songs. “I am not a technician who changes plug-ins. I end up involving myself a lot with the work,” says Sai, who is also a tabla player and performs regularly for AR Rahman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-engineer-who-makes-art-with-sound/article34435601.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||The Joker has a message for you||The minute he heard the word ‘Comali’, actor Sendrayan thought of all the memorable on-screen clowns he has seen. “I remembered English film Joker , Bhagyaraj sir in Rudhra and Kamal Haasan in Apoorva Sagodharargal .” But when it came to the day of shoot, he forgot them all. “I posed as myself,” he says. Sendrayan, a familiar face among Tamil movie buffs, is thrilled about his latest photoshoot featuring him as a clown. The photoshoot features not only the actor and a bunch of props, but also a public awareness message about the need to be safe during the second wave of COVID-19. The photos are the brainchild of city photographer L Ramachandran, who, along with his team comprising creative director Vidya Balaji, costume designer Sukumar and make-up artist Ilangeshwari, set on a task: to make Sendrayan look unique. “We scouted to get some costumes and props,” recalls Ramachandran, who recently worked with actor Vijay Sethupathi for a photoshoot. In a bid to acknowledge the second wave of COVID-19, the team incorporated elements that would convey a safety message to viewers. “We are trying to say: the situation is bad outside, so do not be a clown and try to venture out unnecessarily,” he adds. That big step Sendrayan hails from Bodinayakkanur in Theni, and came to Chennai armed with a manjapai (a yellow bag used to store personal belongings) and lots of tinseltown dreams. “I remember the day I got down at the bus stand at Parry’s Corner wondering how I would make ends meet in such a big city,” he recalls. Since then, Sendrayan did many odd jobs before landing up at director’s offices and working in various capacities. “I was a production helper for some time and then became a make-up assistant,” he recalls. Stepping in front of the camera was a big step for Sendrayan whose first prominent outing was in Dhanush-starrer Polladhavan (2007). Since then, he has played a character artiste in many Tamil films, his most recent being Karthi-starrer Sulthan . His participation in TV reality show Bigg Boss Tamil a couple of years ago gave him a shot at fame; Sendrayan believes that his latest ‘Comali’ photoshoot too will do something similar. The 38-year-old is currently in talks for half a dozen Tamil projects, one in Malayalam and Telugu, and will feature in TV dance show Jodi Number 1 as well.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Gruel for the fasting soul||A fortnight into Ramzan, the Islamic month of fasting, cooks and caterers have been busy preparing nonbu kanji , a nutritious slow-cooked gruel made from rice and other grains across southern India. The gruel is an integral part of the fast-breaking meal ( iftar ) among South Indian Muslims. While last year’s lockdown saw a complete closure of Ramzan activities in mosques, this year, many institutions in Tamil Nadu have opted to resume serving nonbu kanji while following hygiene and social distancing protocols. Using roughly the same spices as biryani, nonbu kanji is a meal in itself. Raw rice ( basmati or jeeraga samba ) is cooked to a mushy consistency in a flavourful broth of mutton or vegetables, and then tempered with thinly-sliced fried onions. Recipes vary according to region, and availability of ingredients. “As the nonbu kanji is perhaps the only proper food that many poor fasting Muslims can afford to have during Ramzan, we try and reach out to as many needy people as possible,” says Mohamed Yusuf, secretary of the Masjid Javeed mosque, which functions under the auspices of the Anna Nagar Islamic Centre in Chennai. The mosque employs four cooks, who have cleared the COVID-19 test and who wear gloves and masks before they begin the mammoth task of preparing kanji from at least 40 kilos of rice per day. Social distancing norms are being followed, with separate entry and exit points to keep the entire process as hygienic as possible, he adds. Close to a thousand people from areas in and around Anna Nagar avail the nonbu kanji serving. In Madurai’s Masjid-ut-Taqwa mosque, mass caterer Syed Ibrahim and his mother have been up since 5am, cooking kanji withjeeraga sambarice using his father’s recipe; he starts with the broth rather than sautéing the basic ingredients in oil to keep the dish lighter on the stomach. The kanji is built up in layers, with rice, lentils, fenugreek, coconut shavings, coriander and mint leaves added to the glutinous mix. On some days, minced mutton is added for a non-vegetarian twist. “After the kanji is ready here, I go off to Sempatti (55 kilometres from Madurai) to make the same dish at a mosque there,” says Ibrahim, adding, “It’s not just about the food, but also a kind of social service, because countless people are going to eat what we cook.” At Tiruchi’s Periya Pallivasal (Big Mosque) on Tennur High Road, nonbu kanji is served post noon. “This year, we are making kanji from 65 kilos of rice which will feed around 1,200 people,” says mosque trustee Maulvi M Zahir Hussain Ilhami. Zahir adds that though most mass caterers ensure that the entire cauldron of nonbu kanji is distributed before 8pm, they “prefer to serve it fresh every day, to keep it as nutritious as possible.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/gruel-for-the-fasting-soul/article34435648.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Order of survival||AD Singh, the man behind some of India’s most popular restaurant and gastropub chains, swears on the value of good waiters and floor staff. The self-professed “food snob” believes they are key to how enjoyable a dining space is. “At Monkey Bar, we don’t have longtime-favourites in our menu. We want our guests to try out new and different things every time, and the people who can guide them are our floor staff,” he says, adding that certain servers have proven so valuable that they are carted to different cities when new branches are set up. In this fresh wave of COVID-19 lockdowns, his staff is among his primary concerns. “We would not have survived the national lockdown without the support of our teams, landlords, vendors, investors and the agencies we work with. Once the lockdown stopped we tried to do our best for them in return. Hopefully, that has built up their confidence and comfort to support us again,” says Singh. Having said that, Singh also acknowledges that some advance notice of impending lockdowns would result in fewer problems. Downing shutters on two days’ notice is not easy: “With more time we can stop fresh purchases, exhaust our perishables, give our teams advance notice to plan their leaves,” he explains. As the founder of the Olive group that owns pubs, restaurants and cafes across Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Chennai and Goa, Singh is in a position to observe and explain how lockdowns and curfews can affect different kinds of dine-in businesses differently. For instance, “Late night restrictions make it more difficult for us where we have a good bar business or party business, as these both build up and run late. Our cafe The Grammar Room [in New Delhi] does 90% of its business all day, and so restricted timings don’t matter to it. OLLY, our Olive cafe in Cyberhub [Gurugram], does great lunch business and early evening, post-work business.” Saturdaynight out Singh’s words hold true across the board — restaurants thrive on being familiar haunts for gourmands; for families looking to escape the humdrum of domesticity; for harried professionals waiting to unwind. They cater to different crowds and function at different times of day, but the one thing they depend most on is bringing people to their venue. Once that stops, revenues are bound to plummet. “The Olive group is mainly focussed on the dine-in business and over 90% of our revenue currently comes from that,” says Singh. Riyaaz Amlani of Social also states that the majority of his revenue comes from people dining in instead of ordering, but admits that this chain is luckier than most. “A lot of restaurants that do not have deep pockets will probably have to liquidate over this round of lockdowns. For any good restaurant, about 15% of their business comes from delivery. That barely covers rentals, never mind other costs of operations,” he says over the phone. Costs include “rent, salaries, food procurement, licensing fees, utilities like electricity. Depending on where your restaurant is, rent alone could take up 15% to 20% of all your costs. Salary would be another 20% to 25%, and raw material anywhere between 15% and 35%,” explains Gauri Devidayal, owner of Mumbai-based The Table, over phone. She adds that with popular delivery apps, commissions (an app can take up to 35% or 40% of the money earned from an order, and charge higher for “discovery”) and deep discounts (remember that pizza you bought at half price last weekend?) make things more difficult. “It is impossible to profit at these prices,” she says. If their entire customer base paid at such deep discounts, restaurants would be unable to stay afloat. But now, with a fresh slew of lockdowns in place due to the new wave of COVID-19, Gauri sees direct delivery as the best among severely limited options: “There is nothing we can do about restaurants being closed, but at least within the delivery-only situation, it will help if diners can order directly. There are still shortfalls in direct ordering platforms and systems, but a little extra effort [from customers who want to help their favourite restaurants survive lockdown] can go a long way,” she says. Mindful alternatives To that end, alternative apps like Thrive and DotPe give restaurants more control over operations, put them in direct contact with consumers (DotPe links users to restaurants’ WhatsApp accounts), and charges fees that are either as low as 5% or kept safe from market fluctuations — meaning the fees a restaurant pays will not fluctuate depending on how many orders it gets. Being fairly new, these platforms are still dealing with operational hiccups. And, as Amlani points out, “You need to be an already discovered, established restaurant for people to seek you out directly or through other apps.” Yet, these alternatives must have done something right in the past year, because restaurants and users are flocking to them. DotPe alone boasts of over 10,000 restaurants so far. DotPe recently launched a video campaign #OrderDirect, urging people to use DotPe’s platform to order directly from local restaurants. Anurag Gupta, co-founder and COO of DotPe sent out a statement: “Many food aggregators are worsening the situation by introducing heavy commissions and guidelines that squeeze these businesses. This is why we want to encourage people to start ordering from them directly. This will also ensure that their staff can retain their means of living. In fact, if the deliveries for direct orders increase, the restaurant owners can employ more people and take control of their business.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/order-of-survival/article34435440.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||A locked-down army||“Everyone is looking for ways to help,” says Deepthi Tanikella, a Chennai-based entrepreneur who has been providing home cooked meals to isolating, COVID-positive people in her neighbourhood for the past month. “I came across an Instagram post by Harshini Sridhar, asking if anyone would be willing to cook for patients. I cook for my family everyday, all I needed to do was make some more,” she recalls. Providing those fatigued by COVID-19 the comfort of a home-cooked meal was a chance Deepthi could not refuse: she is now part of a group of 12 people, spread across Virugambakkam, Alwarpet, ECR and other parts of Chennai, dispatching meals to patients who live in the area. They are not alone; small groups of eager helpers have mushroomed across the country, following a similar modus operandi — reaching out to COVID patients isolating at home, listing them out by area, confirming meal requirements and assigning each household to a volunteer cook. Some are small individual efforts, some are more organised groups like the Chennai-based ‘major-roof-4419’ portal on Glide, which helps patients search for food providers by PIN Code. Volunteers commit to a meal or two each — either on a day-to-day basis or for weeks at a stretch, depending on what the patient needs. They cook at home, pack it in disposable boxes and send it over at mealtimes, fresh from their kitchens. But a will to help is not enough. Deepthi stresses on the need to be organised: “Stock up on aluminium foil containers or other disposables; you can’t ask a COVID-positive home to return utensils after every meal. Keep the food simple and include lots of protein if you can. Be clear about what time of day you can commit to. Your phone number will be shared, so be sure that you don’t mind,” she says. Delivery personnel who ferry this food also deserve to know that they are being sent to a COVID-19 positive home, so that they can take precautions to protect themselves. In Kochi, Reshma Johnson plays it safe by coordinating with the same delivery boy, who keeps it contact-less. The one-woman army started Reshma’s Kitchen over a year ago, and has been providing vegetarian meals to families affected with COVID-19 in and around Kakkanad, Kochi, since. Currently, she is providing food to 10 families in quarantine. Often, those receiving food also receive a dose of comfort. Deepthi, for instance, has formed a special bond with an elderly man who lives away from his children. He eagerly awaits the handwritten notes she adds. She says, “He calls me another daughter”. The grocery runners Contact-less delivery is something to be kept in mind across tasks. In Hyderabad, volunteer grocery shopper Ajay Roy asks people to leave their car windows rolled down. He drops their groceries in the car, and they pick it up once he leaves. It is not just COVID patients who need help with chores, but also the old and vulnerable. Rikit Shahi, for instance, says he is happy to pick up even just a single pack of juice for a neighbour, if he knows they are vulnerable and need it. He is offering his services to those who live in and around his locality, Khairatabad. Rikit began helping via a post on Twitter, offering to procure daily necessities for people, including medicines. Rikit says, “I double mask, use a sanitiser and maintain distance. A lot of people call with their daily requests, most of them are elderly people.” Ajay, who runs a homemade food business, began this just to make sure his elderly customers get their daily needs without hassle. He is helping families in quarantine with medicines and food, mostly in and around Sainikpuri and Yapral. He says, “Most of the families have been my customers who trusted my business and supported me. Now it is my time to support them and help them recover.” Some are going a step ahead, entering homes of recently recovered COVID-19 patients to make sure affected families have a clean, comfortable environment. Over the past week, volunteers on Twitter have offered to tidy up rooms and water plants — fatigue being a major component, those isolating at home are grateful for the extra help. Fur support This time last year, when 24-year-old Ranjani Ramakrishnan decided to open her doors in Chennai for abandoned pets in collaboration with an animal shelter, little did she know she would greet a new furry friend every day. “I had so many animals coming and going at home,” she recalls fondly. This time too, Ranjani is doing the same, albeit in Bengaluru where she works. “Pet parents find it difficult to take care of them or feed them when they are COVID-19 positive,” she says. As a result, many pets (especially vulnerable ones) might feel neglected and anxious leading to behavioural changes. Like Ranjani, individuals across the country are now offering to board pets. “When I put up the post, a lot of people wanted to borrow the idea and do the same,” Ranjini continues. Some volunteers specify requirements, to make it easier to handle the stay. Bengaluru-based Shagun Ohri wrote that she can only take in pets who get along with other cats and dogs. It is imperative to chat with the pet parent and know about the animal’s likes, dislikes and food habits before taking them in, says Ranjani. Linda Alexander of Pet Paws, Chennai, a home boarding facility, is currently housing about 20 pets from isolating families. For individuals who wish to foster pets, Linda has a few pointers: “A bath is absolutely necessary. The leash or collar should also be cleaned well.” She adds that fosters should also ask about the pet’s vaccination chart. Then adds, “They have to be taken for walks regularly. Find out two things: whether they are human friendly and pet friendly. If they are not human-friendly, it will be difficult to feed them.” When a request arrives, Linda’s crew drives to the house donning a PPE suit and wielding sanitisers, and picks up the pet. Once the pet arrives, he/she is given a thorough bath — collars, leash et al — to avoid any possible transmission. Though there is no certified data stating that COVID-19 spreads through dogs or cats, sometimes people do show reluctance to take them in. Pet Paws has been seeing a steady increase in the number of boarding requests ever since the pandemic began. It takes a village Raising a child is no mean feat, especially if said child is bereft of the stimulus of peers and playrooms. Which is why clinical psychologist Dr PA Mary Anitha, who distributes food and beverages to them through her network of volunteers in Kochi, has now turned her attention to children with special needs. Anitha started the Centre For Empowerment and Enrichment in Kochi, for the care of people with disabilities in 2007 and has been in social service ever since. This time, Anitha is concentrating on COVID-19 affected families that have persons with disabilities in the house. She has a database of such families and is in constant touch with them, enquiring about their situation and needs. She also provides them with online counselling. “Children with special needs are especially vulnerable,” she says. Since last February, she has overseen care of high-risk children, with 88 volunteers whom she has trained. Other needs need less medical know-how and more empathy. For instance, friends, neighbours and even strangers are offering up a day or two of their daily schedules to help children out with their homework, guide them through assignments, or just brainstorm concepts, as virtual step-ins for that all-important classroom back and forth many have been missing out on. Guiding voices The demand for counselling and emotional support is flooding in, not hospitals, but also from people sitting at home, beleaguered by the constant threat of the pandemic, and scale of tragedy unfolding. “We have not seen such an unprecedented flood of calls for COVID-19 related queries since last April. We are getting nearly 100 calls a day,” says Chandan Achary, co-founder of Vizag Volunteers, an NGO in Visakhapatnam. What started as a WhatsApp group with his corporate circle friends and NGOs last year, has now swelled into a social movement. The group has 600 volunteers today, bringing together a gamut of information — from hospital bed availability to plasma donation — on vizagvolunteers.org. The volunteers have also managed to build a community that provides not just medical support but also mental strength to those in home quarantine through telecounselling. Comforting anxious COVID patients through telecounselling is one of the key areas they are addressing. while attending to a flood of calls enquiring about hospital beds that the organisation realised many patients were rushing to hospitals in a full-blown panic. “If the patient can be under home quarantine, we counsel them periodically through calls and guide them through the process,” says Chandan. Groups like Vizag Volunteers are operating in many cities, and some across cities and states. Pooling in the spare hours and resources of data crunchers, fact checkers and just people who can spare the time to call and get updates from clinics, they are always in need of another helping hand, perhaps yours.

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||A star is born||Ashwin Kumar Lakshmikanthan left his hometown Coimbatore for Kodambakkam, once the hub of Tamil cinema and a microcosm for film aspirants, with big city dreams in his eyes. He had a crippling sense of fear when he reached his first audition, having neither experience nor influential people in his phonebook. He played a small part alongside actor Arya, who played a guest role in Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam in 2014. The scene was eventually trimmed; but it gave Ashwin confidence. Perhaps he could make it in the industry after all. Then, he was called for an audition for Mani Ratnam’s OK Kanmani (2015). Ashwin had always looked up to three filmmakers: AR Murugadoss, Mani Ratnam and Gautham Menon, so the offer to be part of a Madras Talkies production [Ratnam’s banner] was the icing on the cake. Only, it was not. When he arrived for the audition, the set was packed with over 70 well-groomed models, both male and female, also jostling for space to register their presence on screen. It was only then that it dawned on Ashwin that the dream — of becoming an actor — was one he shared with hundreds. He did not make an impression with Mani Ratnam, despite a photo opportunity and a blink-and-miss role as a background artiste in OK Kanmani . Last year, Ashwin acted in the short-film Kadhal Ondru Kanden for which he received praise on social media. It got him the attention he longed for, and a well-known filmmaker was ready to cast him, but only as a supporting actor. “At the end of the day, I realised I cannot make it on my own even if I have the talent. I kept thinking ‘What more should I prove to this industry? How much more should I sacrifice?’,” says Ashwin, over phone, a week after the finale of Cook with Comali , the reality television show that finally put him on the map. Edited excerpts: What is your headspace like now, post Cook with Comali ? It was initially hard to adjust to the routine. I went off social media and isolated myself. Then, a week later, I slowly got back to my senses and started accepting things.  Was it a transformative experience?  I didn’t change much, as a person. What you saw on TV is who I am in real life. Having said that, it takes time for me to open up. The camera never used to linger on me because they always thought I was this quiet, shy person. And I couldn’t break that perception. Even on Cook with Comali , I took my own time to warm up. But there were people like Rakshan, Sivaangi, Pugazh and Sharath who made me feel inclusive. They showed a positive vibe and the show’s format itself is light-hearted. Being an ‘outsider’ to films, was there a sense of insecurity?  It wasn’t smooth sailing for sure. If not for my friend who motivated me and took care of my expenses, I would have given up long time back. It’s frustrating when people randomly call you for auditions with a callous attitude. Sometimes, they won’t even tell you whether you got the part! I waited nearly a year for this one film, but only later did I come to know through a friend that shooting was already underway with a different actor. Maybe, Cook with Comali happened at the right time... True. Which is why when I got this offer, I felt it was all about food and maybe it’s best if I don’t take part. They [showrunners] told me that I can manage with the basics. I made sure that I didn’t miss out on this opportunity to prove my salt, and put my heart into it. I was doing a web series which I cancelled to concentrate on the show. I thought I shouldn’t look like a dummy on TV and improvised a lot. It paid off.  You were featured in the song ‘Kutty Pattas’ which went viral. Now you are acting with fellow comali Pugazh in a Tamil film. Is your talent finally being recognised?  Cook with Comali was a rebirth of sorts for me. I have faced a lot of insults, rejections and have been pushed to the bottom but I didn’t give up. I was hoping for that one chance. Wherever I went, the producer said they wanted fame and the director wanted money. I had neither. Now I have the “fame” they were looking for. I don’t want to sound demotivating, but want to insist upon this for aspirants like me: be prepared.  I have faced a lot of insults, rejections and have been pushed to the bottom but I didn’t give up. All I was hoping for was for that one chance Ashwin Kumar Lakshmikanthan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-star-is-born/article34435327.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Bravery beats competence’||On Mira Nair’s watchlist tonight is a 1973 Mani Kaul film, Duvidha . Locked in, in Delhi, which has been brought to its knees by the COVID pandemic, the director of A Suitable Boy and The Namesake has turned to movies of the experimental kind. As a voting member of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and a part of the Indian jury, the filmmaker has been extensively watching others’ work in order to select 10 artistes from India to be mentored under BAFTA’s Breakthrough India initiative. Over a video call, she says, “The longer I live, the more I realise that creative energy is not limitless. And therefore, I try to do things that give me energy.” Things like going over the work of 30 applicants to BAFTA Breakthrough India to “narrow down original voices that can get lost in our country of many, especially in an industry like ours where it is all about who you know,” she adds. Breakthrough India is supported by Netflix and aims to select talented people in the film, games and television worlds to take part in a year-long mentoring and guidance programme. The nominees will receive global networking opportunities, free access to BAFTA events and screenings for 12 months, and full voting BAFTA membership. Mira and her fellow jurors, including ambassador AR Rahman, director Shonali Bose, cinematographer Santosh Sivan and producer Siddharth Roy Kapur among others, sat down for three hours to choose the nominees. “The first thing I said was that ‘I am looking for bravery, originality and a distinct voice, not competence, not imitation’.” Can you speak your truth? In Mira’s books, bravery beats competence. “A lot of people can do a good imitation of art, but few have a way of capturing the world which is unique. It is how you choose to tell the story and from what point of view that defines bravery for me. That was something I saw in this lot [the nominees], they were experimental.” Bravery to Mira, is in the intent: “the importance of speaking your truth”, and in the craft: “finding new forms to tell a story”, and in not being afraid to be different — “even when no one understands what you are doing.” Through her own journey into filmmaking, which started off with documentaries such as India Cabaret — an exploration of female strippers in then Bombay, Children of a Desired Sex ,  on the abortion of female foetuses, and The Laughing Club of India — Mira’s icons have been Richard Leacock and DA Pennebaker. “They were the pioneers of the Cinéma vérité movement and to this day, remain the barometers of truth for me,” she says. She brings up Chris Marker’s La Jetée , a science fiction-ette about post-apocalyptic experiments on humans made entirely using black and white stills. “It told me so many things about how to evoke poetry, violence and surrealism without a big budget, relying on just art and its power.” Amrita and Awadh While movies like these are what she falls back to, Mira has also been trying to keep up with Netflix, Amazon and other OTT platforms. Her first digital release was last year’s A Suitable Boy , an adaptation of Vikram Seth’s 1993 novel set in a newly independent India. It was when she was in Awadh, shooting A Suitable Boy , that she got her next project. She will be adapting the 2020 Pulitzer finalist, The Jungle Prince of Delhi , a story published by The New York Times on a family living in a decrepit lodge in Delhi, claiming to be Awadh royalty. It will be co-produced by Sister Pictures, who bankrolled the hit series Chernobyl . “Of course I was interested in the story; the whole world sent it to me when it came out. I was talking to the producers to help them and advise them about the place, and they said you must direct it,” she says. Meanwhile, Mira is also working on a feature film on Amrita Sher-Gil, the Hungarian-Indian painter regarded as one of the country’s greatest modern artists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bravery-beats-competence/article34435330.ece

29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Buried in his books||Decorated Hindi writer Manzoor Ahtesham signed off on a well-spent life in a hospital around midnight in Bhopal on Sunday last. When he breathed his last, he was in the company of a doctor and some paramedical staff as he was a COVID-19 patient and family members were not allowed. He is survived by the families of two daughters and that of younger brother Aijaz Ghafoor, a well-known interior designer in Bhopal. Manzoor had recently lost his wife and elder brother to COVID-19. Born in April 1948, Manzoor belonged to one of the middle class families of Afghan lineage in picturesque Bhopal. He was handsome, very polite, unassuming, and friendly. A gentleman to the core, Manzoor had a sensitive heart, a sharp mind, and frugal lifestyle. For more than seven years that I spent in Bhopal as Resident Editor of Hindustan Times from 2000, and even later during numerous visits to the city, I found people had only good things to say about him. His parents wanted him to do engineering. He took admission, tried for a few years, but gave up, as his interest was in literature. When his brother Aijaz started a furniture showroom in late 70s, he requested Manzoor to help him out by being there. Aijaz fondly says, “Many visitors to the showroom would tell me that Manzoor Bhai was not to be seen, though he used to be around, sitting in one corner surrounded by books.” Over my 35 years in journalism, I have interacted with numerous writers and public figures, but none can match Manzoor’s depth of understanding of world literature. There is hardly any classical or contemporary writer of repute in English, Hindi, and Urdu literature whom Manzoor had not read. “Our younger generation has stopped reading books,” he would often lament. During one of the several evenings that I spent with him discussing poetry, novels, plays, and world affairs, he talked very fondly of Orhan Pamuk’s writings. It was in July or August of 2006 that he had told me he expected Pamuk to win the Nobel Prize in Literature that year. A couple of months later in October, Pamuk did get the Nobel. Bhopal’s topography – an abundance of greenery, large water bodies, and generally pleasant weather through the year - also helped Manzoor’s literary sensibilities to flourish. I remember him telling me once that the name of his highly awarded novel Sukha Bargad (A Dying Banyan), came from Dela Wadi, a forest area near Bhopal having several banyan trees. The novel tells the story of a middle-class Muslim family’s struggle to come to terms with the transformation of Indian society after partition, particularly worsening Hindu-Muslim relations. Some institutions, such as Bharat Bhawan, a premier multi-arts autonomous complex and museum, and theatre and literary personalities such as BV Karanth, Habib Tanvir, and Shani Gulsher Ahmed helped Manzoor hone his literary skills. His interest in theatre helped him get the role of a professor in Merchant Ivory Production’s film In Custody ( Muhafiz in Urdu) in 1993.   In 2007, New York magazine cited Dastan-e Lapata, (The Tale of the Missing Man) as one of “the world's best untranslated novels.” The book, which raises important questions about Muslim identity, was translated into English in 2018 by Jason Grunebaum and Ulrike Stark of the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago. It has received the Global Humanities Translation Prize. Manzoor was a recipient of several awards such as Shikhar Samman, Bharatiya Bhasha Parishad Puruskar, Vir Singh Deo Award, and several others. The government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award, in 2003. However, writer and poet Rajesh Joshi was recently quoted in a Hindi newspaper saying that Manzoor had wanted to exchange his Padma Shri with his Sahitya Akademi award which Rajesh had got at about the same time. Manzoor Ahtesham’s first published short story in 1973 was Ramzaan Mein Maut ( Death in Ramzaan ). Ironically, we lost him during this time of fasting and prayer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/buried-in-his-books/article34435447.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Gruel for the fasting soul||A fortnight into Ramzan, the Islamic month of fasting, cooks and caterers have been busy preparing nonbu kanji , a nutritious slow-cooked gruel made from rice and other grains across southern India. The gruel is an integral part of the fast-breaking meal ( iftar ) among South Indian Muslims. While last year’s lockdown saw a complete closure of Ramzan activities in mosques, this year, many institutions in Tamil Nadu have opted to resume serving nonbu kanji while following hygiene and social distancing protocols. Using roughly the same spices as biryani, nonbu kanji is a meal in itself. Raw rice ( basmati or jeeraga samba ) is cooked to a mushy consistency in a flavourful broth of mutton or vegetables, and then tempered with thinly-sliced fried onions. Recipes vary according to region, and availability of ingredients. “As the nonbu kanji is perhaps the only proper food that many poor fasting Muslims can afford to have during Ramzan, we try and reach out to as many needy people as possible,” says Mohamed Yusuf, secretary of the Masjid Javeed mosque, which functions under the auspices of the Anna Nagar Islamic Centre in Chennai. The mosque employs four cooks, who have cleared the COVID-19 test and who wear gloves and masks before they begin the mammoth task of preparing kanji from at least 40 kilos of rice per day. Social distancing norms are being followed, with separate entry and exit points to keep the entire process as hygienic as possible, he adds. Close to a thousand people from areas in and around Anna Nagar avail the nonbu kanji serving. In Madurai’s Masjid-ut-Taqwa mosque, mass caterer Syed Ibrahim and his mother have been up since 5am, cooking kanji withjeeraga sambarice using his father’s recipe; he starts with the broth rather than sautéing the basic ingredients in oil to keep the dish lighter on the stomach. The kanji is built up in layers, with rice, lentils, fenugreek, coconut shavings, coriander and mint leaves added to the glutinous mix. On some days, minced mutton is added for a non-vegetarian twist. “After the kanji is ready here, I go off to Sempatti (55 kilometres from Madurai) to make the same dish at a mosque there,” says Ibrahim, adding, “It’s not just about the food, but also a kind of social service, because countless people are going to eat what we cook.” At Tiruchi’s Periya Pallivasal (Big Mosque) on Tennur High Road, nonbu kanji is served post noon. “This year, we are making kanji from 65 kilos of rice which will feed around 1,200 people,” says mosque trustee Maulvi M Zahir Hussain Ilhami. Zahir adds that though most mass caterers ensure that the entire cauldron of nonbu kanji is distributed before 8pm, they “prefer to serve it fresh every day, to keep it as nutritious as possible.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/gruel-for-the-fasting-soul/article34435442.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||The engineer who makes art with sound||Sai Shravanam is playing an aalaap from his recent musical project ‘Rivers of India’ at his state-of-the-art recording studio Resound India in Adyar, a place he calls “my temple”. He toggles between computer monitors and a giant recording console to play two tracks — one original and the other he has worked on — and points out the musical difference. “I wanted this portion of the track to be ethereal and the voice to be God-like. Sound engineering is incredibly important to bring the best out of a musician,” he says. And he should know; Sai is the man behind the rich sound of several leading musicians in films and classical music universe. Recently, he received the Kalaimamani award from the Tamil Nadu Government, becoming the first sound recordist to do so. His recent works include the viral hit ‘Enjoy Enjaami’ and tracks from Dhanush’s Karnan , but Sai is pumped at the response for ‘Rivers of India’. “The song is a tribute to precious water resources in the country and stresses on the need to protect them,” he says. Conceived by Kanniks Kannikeswaran, ‘Rivers of India’ not only features a never-before-seen collaboration between Bombay Jayashri, Kaushiki Chakraborty, Rishith Desikan and Amrit Ramnath, but also has a chorus section by the global IIT alumni.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-engineer-who-makes-art-with-sound/article34435331.ece
29 April 2021||April 29 2021 00:00 IST,||‘My Octopus Teacher’: Swati Thiyagarajan on the Netflix documentary’s Oscars win||When My Octopus Teacher debuted on Netflix, viewers were unsure what to make of it from the title. But then, the word-of-mouth began, and the small project quickly grew into one of the most popular documentaries of 2020. Tracing the tender, almost mentor-like relationship between a sea diver and a common octopus in South Africa, the 85-minute long film stars naturalist and documentary filmmaker Craig Foster, as he takes us through the wondrous tale in an underwater kelp forest. Foster’s wife, Swati Thiyagarajan, also a filmmaker, environmentalist and journalist, served as associate producer and production manager on the project. Originally from Chennai, Swati is renowned for her work as a conservationist, and is a core member of the Sea Change Project, which contributes to the long-term protection of South Africa’s marine environment. This week, My Octopus Teacher bagged the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature at the 93rd Academy Awards, (it also won the BAFTA earlier) and Swati’s contribution to the film has been hailed in India, as an important step towards encouraging documentary filmmakers in the country. Talking to us from South Africa where she currently resides (she virtually celebrated the Oscars win as she could not be in Los Angeles), Swati and her team are still waiting for the achievement to sink in. Excerpts from an interview: How did you conceptualise the idea for the documentary? Craig started to dive in the Great African Seaforest, at the southern tip of South Africa, everyday about 10 years ago, when he needed to recover from facing burnout at work. The place where he was most happy was always the ocean. So in the process of doing that, he really immersed himself in the Seaforest ecosystem, and learnt how to track underwater, when he met his “octopus teacher”. Then began the extraordinary year of being able to observe her life. There was no plan at the time to make a film. The ecosystem slowly revitalised and gave him back energy, and he started filming again really from an exploration study point of view. It was Craig’s authentic, experienced story we wanted to tell; we didn’t design it around how a global audience might react. That there was this unbelievable response that was staggering. What was your role as the associate producer and production manager?  As Craig is my partner, and I am involved in conservation and wildlife myself, he would share with me stories from his diving experiences everyday, and discuss the footage and photographs. Our executive producer, Ellen Windemuth, is an old friend of Craig’s, and had earlier made a film called The Great Dance with him. She too advised on the story and then we came up with a rough outline for the documentary. Did you expect the win at the Oscars?  It was still a tremendous surprise because our fellow nominees were superb films, and every documentary had the right to win. So it was hard to just believe we would succeed. When they first announced the nominees, and we saw our clip up there, and then they announced the winner… we were so excited. It’s still sinking in! Your win has created a lot of cheer in India as someone representing the country at the Oscars…  It is lovely if it has created cheer. I reside in South Africa now, but most of my life was lived in India. Right now, I am so absolutely heartbroken at the completely awful situation in the country with COVID-19. The pandemic is because of our exploitation of Nature. It is most certainly my experiences in India that shaped me, my ideas and thoughts... that is the part of India I brought with me to this film. Your take on the support given to documentaries in India, and whether a win like this could be used for the better?  We have some of the absolute best filmmakers in India in the documentary field. The work is outstanding, so it is disheartening to see not much support for documentary films in the country. I don’t know if a win like this could make a difference, but the audiences have changed today. This is exciting because it gives everyone the opportunity to think out-of-the-box, reset things, and create funding for documentaries.

29 April 2021||GURUGRAM,||Smaller Gurugram hospitals, nursing homes feel suffocated||“We need oxygen cylinders every 15-30 minutes depending on the condition of the patient. We cannot have proper sleep at night, because we need to arrange cylinders. It is not the job of the doctor, but we do it because we are answerable,” said Renu Yadav who is running Aarvy Hospital here. Though top hospitals in Gurugram have been grappling with shortage of liquid oxygen supply with sudden surge in COVID-19 cases, the smaller hospitals and nursing homes, with fewer patients too, are equally impacted. “Everybody is having the same problem. The situation is the same everywhere. The oxygen condition is very bad. It is beyond imagination. It has, in fact, worsened over the past three-four days,” said Dr. Yadav. She has 47 COVID-19 patients at her hospital. Dr. Yadav said that they had written several emails and also tried to reach out to Chief Minister Manohar Lal, but nothing happened. Crisis averted She recalled how the hospital was on the verge of completely running out of liquid oxygen on Tuesday morning but they somehow managed to get five cylinders. “The administration is willing to help, however, there is not enough oxygen,” said Dr. Yadav. She said that they have now made the patients sign a declaration that hospital would not be held responsible in case of any eventuality due to short supply of oxygen. The district administration on Wednesday said that the hospitals and nursing homes located in Gurugram and registered on the government’s web portal as COVID hospitals would only be entitled to get cylinders filled through oxygen-refilling stations registered with Gurugram. Allocated quota The administration said that hospitals from outside the district sent their vehicles to refilling stations in Gurugram creating undue pressure on allocated quota of the district and they would “in no circumstance” be allowed access to refilling stations. It also made it clear that hospitals registered with the district need to update their data on availability of beds by 5 p.m. everyday, else the administration might consider discontinuation of or limiting their oxygen supply. Gurugam has an allocated quota of 35 MT of liquid medical oxygen.  The administration is willing to help, however, there is not enough oxygen Dr. Renu Yadav Aarvy Hospital||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/smaller-gurugram-hospitals-nursing-homes-feel-suffocated/article34435131.ece

Mr. Kejriwal, the government stated, deliberated on the plan to increase the number of oxygen beds in the coming days along with strengthening the home isolation system in the city. “We are noticing that this new strain of COVID-19 is quite dangerous and often leads to respiratory and breathing issues. It has become very important to provide beds to every patient who needs oxygen. We have to expedite the process to add more ICU and oxygen beds in the coming weeks,” he said. The Chief Minister also reviewed the home isolation system and directed that it be further strengthened and that every patient who is recovering from COVID under home isolation receive regular calls from Delhi government doctors. “We have to monitor the daily condition of every patient recovering from COVID-19 in home isolation,” he said. Over the last few days, the Delhi government has been working towards increasing the count of ICU & oxygen beds across Delhi on a war footing. According to the government, 1,200 oxygen beds will be added by May 10, of which 500 oxygen beds’ facility will be established at Ramlila Maidan opposite Lok Nayak Hospital and 500 oxygen beds will be added in GTB Hospital while 200 ICU beds will be added in Radha Soami Satsang Beas Covid Care Centre.

29 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi Cong. demands President’s Rule in Capital||The Delhi Congress on Wednesday demanded imposition of President’s Rule in the National Capital Territory of Delhi, saying that the government had completely failed to discharge its constitutional duties during the COVID-19 pandemic. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar in a letter to the President said that for the past several days, due to inadequacies in the hospital system and of oxygen availability, people were left to die. ‘Govt. has failed’ “The functioning of the State government in the management of this health disaster has been completely irresponsible and negligent. The Delhi government spent crores of rupees on its false propaganda and publicity but there was no preparation to deal with the pandemic,” Mr. Kumar said. He added that people are forced to die on the roads while oxygen gas and medicines are being sold in the black market. “The present scenario proves that the Aam Aadmi Party’s government has completely failed in discharging its constitutional duties towards its residents and has deviated from its duties.” Mr. Kumar said. No concrete steps The Delhi Congress said that the State government has not taken any concrete steps over the past one year and ignored the warnings issued by medical scientists across the country and abroad about the pandemic.
