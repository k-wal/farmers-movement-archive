10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccinations go down as States face shortage||Amid the surging second wave of COVID-19 infections across the country, the States are grappling with a vaccine shortage, with several running vaccination centres below capacity and demanding that the Centre give them stocks to last at least seven days. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday tweeted that 13.5 crore doses were available, of which 9.5 crore had been administered until Friday. The remaining 4 crore were either in the “pipeline” or in stock. With India administering 30-40 lakh doses daily, this suggests that existing stocks would be available for 10-13 days, though there is considerable variation within the States in the number of doses being made available. The Co-Win portal discloses real-time information on the doses administered by the States, but does not clarify on their existing stocks. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interaction with the Chief Ministers on Thursday, several of them — cutting across political affiliations — had said they would not have stocks beyond three or four days. For the past three days, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and Cabinet Ministers have been sending SOS to the Centre to replenish vaccine stocks. In a note to the Centre on Friday, Odisha’s Chief Secretary said the State, while prepared to inoculate more than 3 lakh daily, had to shut down two-thirds of its vaccination centres because of “lack of supply” and that several districts were in “stock-out” situation and unable to continue the vaccination programme. Odisha has been vaccinating nearly 1.5 lakh to 2.5 lakh persons daily since March 31, but has registered a sharp dip since April 6, when numbers plummeted to as low as 83,000. A presentation made to the Prime Minister’s Office on Thursday, however, had a slide that said the States have four to eight days of vaccine doses “at any given moment”. This allocation is done by the Centre based on the “production, supply chain and inventory”. Fresh supplies are given every third or fourth day or seventh or eighth, according to the presentation. Six crore doses of Covishield produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and one crore doses of Covaxin by Bharat Biotech are available every month. However, SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawala has said that of the 6.5 crore-odd monthly supply, some portion is farmed out for exports to meet contractual obligations — the exact break-up being unclear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccinations-go-down-as-states-face-shortage/article34286469.ece
10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||People are free to choose religion: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday said people are free to choose their religion, even as it lashed out at a “very, very harmful kind” of “public interest” petition claiming there is mass religious conversion happening “by hook or by crook” across the country. Instead, a Bench, led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, said people have a right under the Constitution to profess, practise and propagate religion. “Why should a person above 18 years not choose his religion? What kind of a writ petition is this? We will impose heavy costs on you... Withdraw it or argue and risk the consequences,” Justice Nariman told petitioner-advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay. Justice Nariman reminded Mr. Upadhyay of the fundamental right under Article 25 of the Constitution to freely profess, practise and propagate religion, subject to public order, morality and health. “Why do you think there is the word ‘propagate’?” Justice Nariman asked the petitioner. Religious conversion is being done through a “carrot-and-stick” approach, Mr. Uapdhyay had claimed in his petition. Justice Nariman said every person is the final judge of his/her choice of religion or who their life partner should be. Courts cannot sit in judgment of a person’s choice of religion or life partner. Religious faith is a part of the fundamental right to privacy. Justice Nariman reminded Mr. Upadhyay of the Constitution Bench judgment which upheld inviolability of the right to privacy, equating it with the rights to life, of dignity and liberty. Mr. Upadhyay’s petition was dismissed as withdrawn. His pleas to approach the Law Commission or the High Court with the petition was not expressly allowed by the Bench.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/people-are-free-to-choose-religion-sc/article34286462.ece
10 April 2021||Pune,||Uddhav calls all-party meeting to review situation||Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Friday refuted Union Minister Prakash Javadekar’s claim that the State had “wasted’ more than five lakh doses of vaccine. In an interview to a television channel, Mr. Tope warned that the State was facing a lockdown if the situation did not improve. “The wastage quoted is actually national average. The State’s wastage is less than half the national percentage,” he said. On Thursday, Mr. Javadekar had said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra should not play politics over vaccination. He added that Maharashtra had used only 90,53,523 of the 10,619,190 vaccines supplied till date. Rejecting Mr. Javadekar’s claims, Mr. Tope said the State had received far less from the Centre and that smaller States with lesser population had got much more. “While we have been promised an additional 17.43 lakh doses, these are not sufficient and we urge the Centre to give us our stated demand of 40 lakh doses a week,” Mr. Tope said, observing that Maharashtra had more than 60% of India’s active cases. Ponting to the acute shortage in Mumbai city, the Minister said 70 of the 120 public and private vaccination centres were forced to shut down as they had run out of vaccine stocks. Expressing concern about Maharashtra’s steadily deteriorating situation, Mr. Tope said the State was moving in the direction of a lockdown. “While I am not in favour of imposing one, there is no alternative when the health infrastructure is overwhelmed by the soaring case surge,” he said adding that across the world a 15-day to three-week lockdown period had achieved the best results in breaking the virus chain. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has called an all-party meeting in Mumbai on Saturday to review the situation. A discussion on whether or not to impose lockdown is on the cards, sources said. On Friday several vaccination centers in Mumbai, Pune and Nashik exhausted their stock. The situation was serious in Mumbai where an estimated 70 of the 120-odd centres shut down due to non-availability of vaccine. Long queues of irate citizens, many of whom included daily labourers, transport personnel and domestic helps, were seen waiting in the sun outside the centres only to be greeted with out-of-stock notices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/uddhav-calls-all-party-meeting-to-review-situation/article34287213.ece
10 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||State takes steps to handle second COVID-19 wave||Alarmed at the swift pace of disease transmission in the second wave of COVID-19 in the State, the Health Department is moving quickly to increase the surge capacity in all its secondary and tertiary care hospitals, re-mobilise human resources, and augment ICU/ventilator facilities in medical colleges so that people with serious disease can be managed properly. Health Minister K.K. Shylaja, who convened a meeting of senior health officials on Friday, said the State was launching a two-pronged strategy to crush the curve by intensifying containment and preventive measures to reduce the pace of disease transmission on one hand, while aggressively increasing the pace of vaccination on the other. The department estimates that as a significant proportion of the State’s COVID-19 mortality has been in the 45 plus age group, increasing the pace of vaccination is the sure-shot way of keeping the case fatality down. Mass vaccination campaigns are being planned across the State in the next three weeks and the department appealed to the public to come forward to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Ms.Shylaja said the Centre had been requested to make more vaccine supplies available to the State. She added that COVID first-line treatment centres would be readied once again as required, while the State would continue the policy of home care for patients who did not have serious disease. The State was looking at a situation wherein many hospitals may have to be converted back to COVID hospitals as was done during the first wave of COVID. The focus has also shifted to the ‘back to basics’ campaign, wherein the compliance of the public with essential pandemic protocols such as masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene will be the key to reducing the pace of disease transmission.  CM, Chandy stable Meanwhile, the condition of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who was admitted to Kozhikode Medical College Hospital on Thursday after testing positive for COVID-19, remains stable and satisfactory, according to a medical bulletin. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, hospitalised in the capital after testing positive for the infection, is also doing well, reports said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-takes-steps-to-handle-second-covid-19-wave/article34286658.ece
10 April 2021||Belagavi,||Over 3 lakh works to be taken up under Jal Shakti in State||The State government will take up over three lakh water conservation works under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan, a Centrally-aided scheme, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Minister K.S. Eshwarappa said in Hubballi on Friday. He said that Rs. 4,310 crore would be spent on these works in the next 100 days. He was speaking at the State-level launch of the scheme in a private hotel. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Jal Shakti Mission under the theme “Catch the Rain, Where it Falls, When it Falls” in a bid to conserve rainwater through a participatory approach. Several programmes have been planned to conserve rainwater and use it when needed, he added. Karnataka will strive to secure the first place in the country in the effective implementation of the Abhiyan. Removing silt and rejuvenation of lakes and other water bodies, construction of multi-arch check-dams, farm ponds, soak pits, afforestation activities and other programmes would be taken up, he added. MGNREGA was benefiting a large number of people, he said. Impressed by this, the Centre had allocated additional funds of Rs. 800 crore to the State, he said. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi said that the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) aimed at providing drinking water facility for 18.5 crore houses by 2024. A sum of Rs. 3.6 lakh crore had been earmarked for the project. Mr. Joshi said that the daily wage of MGNREGA workers was increased to Rs. 299 on April 1 this year. The Jal Dhara project is being implemented in Dharwad district at a cost of Rs. 334 crore under Jal Jeevan Mission. Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar said that water scarcity was a grave issue and had to be addressed immediately. Everyday, around 65 crore people in the country suffer from water scarcity. By 2050, water scarcity is expected to affect a large section of the country’s population. People should join hands with the government to protect water sources, he said. RDPR Principal Secretary L.K. Atheeq, Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI) Director Rajendra Poddar and others also spoke. The Ministers gave away awards to 112 officials and employees of the RDPR Department.

10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||India protests U.S. naval exercise||India said on Friday it has protested the U.S. decision to conduct a patrol in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the western Indian Ocean, rejecting the U.S.’s claim that its domestic maritime law was in violation of international law. In a rare and unusual public statement, the U.S. Navy announced that its ship, USS John Paul Jones, had carried out Freedom of Navigation Operation (FONOP) in the Indian EEZ, adding that its operations had “challenged” what the U.S. called India’s “excessive maritime claims”. “ USS John Paul Jones asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law,” the U.S. Navy’s 7th fleet said in a statement on April 7. “India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law.” This FONOP upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims, the statement said. “We conduct routine and regular FONOPs, as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-protests-us-naval-exercise/article34287127.ece
10 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Night shift employees must reach place of work before 10 p.m.||The State government on Friday issued guidelines on “corona curfew” in seven district centres, including Bengaluru and Mysuru, between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. from April 10 to 20. The order allowed operation of medical and emergency services during the night curfew. It allowed operation of factories, companies and establishment working in night shift. However, employees should reach their place of work before 10 p.m. and should leave the workplace only after 5 a.m. next day. The order issued by Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar said that curfew would be imposed in urban areas of Bengaluru, Mysuru, Bidar, Kalaburagi, Mangaluru, Udupi-Manipal and Tumkuru cities. These cities are witnessing a surge in COVID-19 cases in the last few days. The order permitted patients to visit hospitals for emergent treatment, accompanied by caretakers. It allowed movement of vehicles used for essential services, transport of goods, including empty vehicles, home delivery and e-commerce. People arriving or leaving railway station, bus stand and airports are allowed to travel to their places of stay or railway station, bus stand and airport. They must produce their tickets as proof of their travel, the order said. Following the order, Bengaluru City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant also issued an order stating that prohibitory orders would remain in force in all parts of Bengaluru city between 10 pm and 5 pm from April 10 to 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/night-shift-staff-to-reach-work-place-before-10-pm/article34286610.ece
10 April 2021||CHENNAI,||High Court stays appointment of former Chief Secretary to NGT||The Madras High Court on Friday stayed the operation of an order passed by the Centre on December 12, 2020, appointing former Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary Girija Vaidyanathan as an Expert Member of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The interim stay was granted after it was reported to the court that she had planned to take charge on April 19. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy wrote that public interest litigant R. Sundarrajan of the environmental NGO Poovulagin Nanbargal, represented by counsel M. Radhakrishnan, had “ prima facie made out a strong case that the third respondent [Ms. Vaidyanathan] does not meet the eligibility criteria for being appointed as an Expert Member of the NGT”. The judges said the former Chief Secretary did not appear to have five years of experience in dealing with environmental matters either in the Central government or in a State government or in any national or State institution, as stipulated under Section 5(2)(b) of the NGT Act, 2010. The first Division Bench pointed out that the Act lists the qualifications required to be appointed as the Chairperson, Judicial Member as well as Expert Member of NGT. According to the law, the Expert Member must have had administrative experience of 15 years, including five years in dealing with environmental matters in the Central or State government or in a reputed national or State institution. There was no dispute that Ms. Vaidyanathan had 15 years of administrative experience. However, her experience in environment matters appeared to be doubtful, the judges said. They pointed out that even in her counter-affidavit, she had claimed to have served as Environment and Forest Secretary between December 2001 and August 2002 and as chairperson of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board between November 2003 and May 2005. “It is evident that the third respondent has more than three-and-a-half years’ experience in dealing with environmental matters... It is possible that the third respondent may have dealt with environmental matters in course of the various other departments that she headed or was attached with, but it is necessary for her to indicate the same for the court to be satisfied that the statutory eligibility criterion in such regard is met by her,” the Bench observed. More importantly, information with respect to her having dealt with environmental matters while heading other departments must have been available with the selection panel which chose her. Though the Act had not specifically defined the expression, ‘environmental matters’, the judges agreed with Mr. Radhakrishnan that the court could take its cue from Section 5(2(a) wherein practical experience in pollution control, hazardous substance management, environment impact assessment, climate change management, biological diversity management and forest conservation had been listed as qualifications for appointment as an Expert Member.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/appointment-of-former-tn-chief-secretary-to-ngt-stayed/article34286524.ece
10 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Story of a heritage house, illustrious occupants||An almost 100-year-old house in Guwahati facing an iconic field has yielded 29 Assamese films, eight actors, four movie directors, three singers, two composers, two Ranji Trophy-playing cricketers, a footballer and a politician. This house and its illustrious occupants are being chronicled in a feature-length documentary planned for release in 2022 when the expansive Assam-type structure enters its 100th year of existence. Pond filled up A young Assamese group from central Guwahati’s Uzan Bazar area had in the early 1900s filled up a pond to establish Latasil Field. It helped the nationalists kill two birds with one stone – ensure space for the locals to pursue sports and send a message to the British who had barred the locals from playing on the Judges’ Field to the west, beyond the Gauhati High Court. On the eastern side of Latasil Field stands the House of Baruas, constructed in 1923 with a mix of materials sourced locally as well as imported from the U.K. The story of the house is being told through ‘Baruar Xongxar’ (Barua’s Family), an Assamese documentary. “The Baruas are the only family in Assam, and perhaps in India, that has produced so many noted personalities in fields as diverse as cinema, music, sports and politics. The idea behind the film is to audio-visually document the family’s contributions to these fields and present it before the world,” the film’s director Utpal Borpujari said. Apt tribute The first schedule of the shooting of the film has been completed, and the second and final schedule will be done around May-June. “Launching the film when the House of Baruas enters its 100th year will be an apt tribute to the family,” Nayan Prasad, one of a quartet of producers said. The House of Baruas was constructed by engineer Chandranath Barua of Bihdiya village near Guwahati. The house became associated with arts and culture in 1955 when family member Nip Barua directed the film Smitir Parax (‘Touch of Memory’). He was a footballer, flautist and painter besides being a filmmaker. The house has been home to some of Assam’s most famous personalities such as filmmaker-actor-musician Brajen Barua, singer-turned-composer Ramen Barua, filmmaker Dibon Barua, cricketer turned singer Dipen Barua, cricketer-pilot-entrepreneur-politician Girin Barua and radio broadcaster Niren Barua. Girin Barua, who captained the Assam cricket team in the Ranji Trophy, had been a leader of the anti-foreigners Assam Agitation of 1979-85 and had formed the now-defunct Asom Jatiyatabadi Dal. Some of the Assamese blockbuster films that the Barua family produced included Dr. Bezbarua , Ajoli Nabow , Toramai and Kokadeuta Nati aru Hati . Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had played the nati (grandson) commandeering the hati (elephant) in the film.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/story-of-a-heritage-house-illustrious-occupants/article34286688.ece
10 April 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi govt. plans several curbs as COVID cases cross 8.5K mark||With daily COVID-19 cases continuing to the rise in the city, the Delhi government is planning to intensify restrictions and reduce the number of people who can attend weddings to 50 and funerals to 20, sources said. There is also a proposal to ban all other social gatherings. Delhi reported 8,521 fresh infections on Friday, the second highest single-day surge since the beginning of the pandemic. A total of 8,593 cases were recorded on November 11 last year. “The government is also planning to reduce the occupancy in buses and cinema halls to 50% of the total capacity. A proposal on these matters has been initiated and is under consideration,” a government official said. Currently, 100 people can attend gatherings, including marriages, in closed spaces, and 200 people in open spaces. There are also no capacity restrictions in cinema halls and buses. “The decision was taken after a high-level meeting, but it is yet to be approved,” the official said. The proposals will have to be approved by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. An order will be issued once the L-G gives his nod. The government is yet to officially comment on the development. Last year, the Delhi government had capped social gatherings at 50 and there were occupancy restrictions in buses and cinema halls, but those were lifted as cases gradually reduced. Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital, said the reintroduction of stricter curbs would be a step in the right direction. “People in general have become casual and they are not listening to doctors. We need some restrictions on mobility and gatherings.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-govt-plans-several-curbs-as-covid-cases-cross-85k-mark/article34286830.ece

According to a bulletin issued by the Public Health Department on Friday, a record number of 1,01,986 samples were collected and tested for the infection. The number of daily tests has gone past one-lakh mark for the first time. Sharp increase in the tests comes a day after High Court’s directions to the State government to ramp up COVID screening tests, particularly the RT-PCR tests. After participating in a video-conference addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the District Collectors and other district-level officers concerned to launch a special vaccination drive and also increase testing, particularly RT-PCR in all the districts. The number of active COVID cases in the State stood at 15,472 as at 8 pm on Thursday including 9,674 staying in home and institutional isolation and the remaining 5,798 admitted in various private and government hospitals. Hyderabad and its surroundings continue to add a lion’s share of the daily COVID cases being reported with 402 fresh cases reported from the GHMC area on Thursday followed by 208 from Medchal-Malkajgiri and 162 from Rangareddy districts.

10 April 2021||Ghaziabad,||3 given rabies vaccine instead of COVID-19 jab||Three elderly women, in an unexpected turn of events, were administered rabies vaccine when they went to get the COVID-19 jab in Kandhla area of Shamli in western Uttar Pradesh on Thursday. A pharmacist was suspended and a show-cause notice issued to the medical superintendent of the community health centre on Friday after the District Magistrate ordered an inquiry. According to local sources, the incident came to light when one of the women felt side effects such as dizziness and nausea after being inoculated. When she approached a private doctor, she showed him the slip handed over to her at the health centre. The slip mentioned her being given the rabies vaccine. In a video, one of the women, identified as Anarkali, could be heard saying that she went to get vaccinated against COVID-19 but the officials vaccinated her against dog bite instead: “I started feeling giddiness. The suspicion was confirmed when we asked if we need to submit copies of our Aadhaar cards. The official on duty said Aadhaar card is not needed for rabies vaccination.” Confirming the incident, Shamli District Magistrate Jasjeet Kaur said, “The affected women are in their late 60s and early 70s. Instead of approaching the special section created for the COVID vaccine, they stood in line at the general OPD and said ‘ Tika laga do ’ [Get us vaccinated].”  The inquiry report submitted by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) and Additional Chief Medical Officer on Thursday evening established that the pharmacist was at fault and hence he has been suspended, said Ms. Kaur. “On Thursdays, the rabies vaccine is administered. Out of ignorance, the women stood in that line. The pharmacist should have been careful. He didn’t follow the SOP,” she added. Sanjay Agarwal, Chief Medical Officer, Shamli, said there was no adverse effect of the rabies vaccine and the women recorded their statement before the SDM.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/3-given-rabies-vaccine-instead-of-covid-19-jab/article34286827.ece

The transportation of the electronic voting machine, the control unit and the VVPAT was in violation of norms and a report had been sent to the Election Commission, which will take a final decision on re-polling, he said. Two EVMs, one control unit and one VVPAT were carried on the bike, of which the VVPAT alone was used during the polling, Mr. Sahoo told mediapersons. The VVPAT machine had developed a glitch, he said. Nonetheless, due to violation of norms (in carrying it) a report had been sent to the Election Commission. The incident took place soon after polling was over on April 6, and it evoked strong reactions from DMK and Congress workers. Based on the preliminary findings of the District Election Officer, the two EVMs were not used for polling, and strict action would be taken for any violation of norms, Mr. Sahoo said. In Velachery, the Congress had fielded J.M.H. Hassan Moulana, as part of the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance. The AIADMK had fielded M.K. Ashok. For Makkal Needhi Maiyam (MNM), Santosh Babu, who quit the Indian Administrative Service, was the candidate. Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam had fielded M.

10 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘Civilian was released in exchange for commando’||A civilian was released in exchange for the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) commando Rakeshwar Singh Minhas, who was abducted by the Maoists after an encounter on April 3 at Tarrem in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma, a senior government official said. The civilian, identified as Kunjam Sukka, was released hours before the commando was handed over on Thursday to social activists and a group of journalists who had gone to the Sukma-Bijapur border to secure his release, the official said. However, when asked, Bastar Range Inspector-General of Police Sundarraj P. told The Hindu that no civilian had been arrested or taken into custody after the encounter. Mr. Sundarraj added, “Many villagers were asked to help the security forces in retrieving the bodies and put the injured in choppers. They came on their own and stayed at the Tarrem camp. It is possible that one of the villagers returned on his own.” Another official, however, said a person was apprehended after the encounter but no charges were pressed against him. “On many occasions it happens that after an encounter the Maoists desert their positions and are detained by the security forces. In this case no formal charge was invoked,” the official said. D.M. Awasthi, Chattisgarh Director-General of Police could not be reached for comment. Ganesh Mishra, a Bijapur-based journalist who left with a group of facilitators on April 8 to secure the commando’s release, said that no civilian had accompanied them. “The Maoist leader who released the commando told me that he was being freed without any condition,” Mr. Mishra said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/civilian-was-released-in-exchange-for-commando/article34286470.ece

In a rare and unusual public statement, the U.S. Navy announced that its ship the USS John Paul Jones had carried out Freedom of Navigation Operation (FONOP) in the Indian EEZ, adding that its operations had “challenged” what the U.S. called India’s “excessive maritime claims”. “ USS John Paul Jones asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law,” the U.S. Navy’s 7th fleet said in a statement on April 7. “India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law.” This FONOP upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims, the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-protests-against-us-naval-exercise-in-exclusive-economic-zone/article34286832.ece

A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi took note of the fact that action was taken against those responsible for the damage of government buses and dismissed the petition filed in 2018 by A.M. Sundaravel of Tirunelveli. There was nothing on record to show that PMK leader S. Ramadoss was responsible for the revenue loss, the court said. A total of 73 buses were damaged across the State. Commuters were put to hardship and many of them sustained injuries, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/plea-to-recover-damages-from-pmk-dismissed/article34286558.ece

FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements,” it added. Raising an important issue, former Navy Chief Adm Arun Prakash on Twitter said FONOPs by U.S. Navy ships, “ineffective as they may be,” in South China Sea (SCS), are meant to “convey a message to China that the putative EEZ” around the artificial SCS islands is an “excessive maritime claim.” “But what is the 7th Fleet message for India?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-protests-against-us-naval-exercise/article34286460.ece

10 April 2021||Bhangar,||Crucible of ISF, Bhangar reflects experiment in Muslim politics||Two of the three hawkers selling hard-boiled sweets and iced water tubes at the Indian Secular Front (ISF) rally at the Bhojerhat football ground in Bhangar on the last day of campaigning had decided on their choice for MLA — the Samyukta Morcha candidate, Naushad Siddique. But their colleague remained undecided. A beneficiary of the Trinamool Congress’s welfare schemes for his daughters, he said, “I got Rs. 50,000 for my daughter under Kanyashree [a scheme of financial aid for girls who have studied till Class XII] and Rupashree [for a girl child’s marriage] but we were denied Amphan relief.” Naushad Siddique, ISF chairman, is the brother of the peer of Furfura Sharif, Abbas Siddique. As the crowd at the rally swelled to hear Abbas Siddique, a few others explained, “It is not that Didi [Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee] has not worked, but those under her are all corrupt.” Almost an hour before the Siddique brothers took the stage, CPI(M) State committee member Tushar Ghosh arrived shouting “Inquilab Zindabad” and “Bhaijaan Zindabad”. The crowd was largely young. In fact, some people seemed too young to cast their vote but they held aloft sticks with the white, blue and green ISF flag and the red CPI(M) flags tied together. At the Bhojerhat meeting, Abbas Siddique delivered a fiery speech. “She [Ms. Banerjee] is calling me a shaitan (devil). Am I in politics to become an MP or a Minister?” he said rhetorically. Minutes later, he asked the crowd who brought the BJP to West Bengal, showing an old photograph of Ms. Banerjee with former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at a meeting. It was Naushad Siddique who was instrumental in sealing the ISF’s alliance with the Left and Congress for this Assembly election. To a question on the Trinamool’s allegation that the ISF will end up helping the BJP, Naushad Siddique said, “The Trinamool leadership can say whatever it wants, but you can see the response to the ISF here. We are against both the Trinamool and the BJP.” If elected, he said, the ISF, which has fielded candidates in 28 seats, will seek a bigger role for the party. It is from Bhangar  that Abbas Siddiqui began his political foray, making a pitch for power through his popular religious jalsas (gatherings) that continued right through the lockdown. “Bhangar is the crucible from where the ISF experiment began,” said a villager at Padmapukur. Bhangar has a predominantly Muslim population and the ISF’s spirited entry has put the Trinamool, which is battling inner party squabbles, on the backfoot. In 2016, Abdur Razzak Mollah (former Land Reforms Minister in the Left Front regime) won the seat by a margin of 18,000-odd votes on Trinamool ticket. However, the Trinamool dropped the 75-year-old veteran this time, opting for Rezaul Karim, also a former CPI(M) member who had contested the Lok Sabha election from Birbhum in 2019. Dr. Karim was preferred over Trinamool strongman Arabul Islam, which has sparked a party feud. Just a few days earlier, while campaigning for Dr. Karim, Mr. Islam made his discontent public. “We will ensure the victory of our candidate, even if he is from Pakistan. The previous elected representative did not visit the constituency for five years after getting elected,” he said. The BJP’s Soumi Hati has campaigned only in the Hindu pockets for the April 10 vote, and the ISF has stayed away from them, further polarising the electorate, villagers pointed out. On whether a split in the Muslim vote would help the BJP, villagers at Kamarhait and Machi Bhanga said, “Not in this constituency. But a divide in the Muslim vote here will go against the Trinamool.” Land movement Bhangar, a rural and poor belt on the fringes of Kolkata’s rich suburbs of Rajarhat and New Town, was in the news over a land movement that began in 2013 when the State government acquired 13 acres from villagers for a power grid project. From 2014, the stir against the land acquisition led to tension in the area. Things came to a head on January 17, 2017 when villagers blocked roads with uprooted trees and clashed with the police. Two protesters were shot dead, but the police denied opening fire, putting the blame on “outsiders”. The State government reached an agreement with the villagers in August 2018, said Alik Chakraborty of the CPI(ML) Red Star, one of the leaders of the movement. The CPI(ML) Red Star has fielded Mirza Hasan, a face of the land movement. He admitted that the ISF has a hold over the villagers, who tend to listen to the peerzada (religious leader). “Bhangar is a case study of communal politics now,” said Mr. Chakraborty. “The deep polarisation that is happening here will find an echo in other constituencies,” he added.. The Trinamool, which came to power in 2011 in the State riding on the land movements of Nandigram and Singur, found itself on the wrong side of the people in Bhangar. When villagers protested against heavy-handed tactics on the ground, the government moved to make amends, promising not to acquire any land by force. The villagers hailed the “people’s victory” but three years on, Bhangar is being asked to choose between the Furfura cleric, who holds considerable influence over the region, and the Trinamool, which claimed it had nurtured the constituency with its welfare schemes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/crucible-of-isf-bhangar-reflects-experiment-in-muslim-politics/article34286355.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nod required for exercises: India||The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement on Friday that the Government of India’s stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is that the Convention “does not authorise other States to carry out in the EEZ and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state”. The MEA was responding to a statement by the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet on April 7 that its ship the USS John Paul Jones had carried out Freedom of Navigation Operation (FONOP) in the Indian EEZ in the western Indian Ocean. The statement said: “India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law.” Continuously monitored Stating that the USS John Paul Jones was “continuously monitored” transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits, the MEA added, “We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of U.S.A through diplomatic channels.” As per the annual FONOP reports released by the U.S. Department of Defence for each fiscal year, the U.S. has been regularly conducting FONOPs in Indian EEZ. The U.S. similarly carries out FONOPs against several other countries including its allies and partners. From 2007 onwards till 2017, the U.S. carried out multiple FONOPs every year challenging “excessive” Indian maritime claims. A South Block official, on condition of anonymity, said it is only when it is “military manoeuvres” in our EEZ that we need nations to seek our permission and not if you are simply transiting through. And, the term military manoeuvres is not defined anywhere, the official added. A second official, also on condition of anonymity, said it was the statement issued on the FONOP which was surprising more than the FONOP itself. Commenting on the development, former Navy chief Adm. Arun Prakash tweeted: “While India ratified UNCLOS in 1995, the U.S. has failed to do it so far. For the 7th Fleet to carry out FoNOPs missions in Indian EEZ in violation of our domestic law is bad enough. But publicising it? USN please switch on IFF (Identification, friend or foe)!” Raising an important issue, Adm. Prakash said FONOPs by U.S. Navy ships, “ineffective as they may be,” in South China Sea (SCS), are meant to “convey a message to China that the putative EEZ” around the artificial SCS islands is an “excessive maritime claim.” “But what is the 7th Fleet message for India?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nod-required-for-exercises-india/article34286379.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||India, China hold talks again||The 11th round of the Corps Commander talks are under way between India and China to work out an agreement for the second phase of disengagement in Eastern Ladakh. Talks were still on at the time of going to print. The talks began around 10.30 a.m. at Chushul in Eastern Ladakh, a defence source said. The focus of the talks is disengagement from the patrolling points (PP) at Gogra and Hot Springs. In February, the two sides completed the first phase of disengagement on the north and the south banks of Pangong Tso based on a written agreement. The 10th round was held within 48 hours after the process was completed where both sides agreed to push for a mutually acceptable solution of the remaining issues in a “steady and orderly” manner to jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas. Pangong Tso has been the major issue since the standoff began last May after the Chinese troops made ingress into Indian territory at several locations in Eastern Ladakh. With Pangong Tso having been resolved, the focus now is to work out a phased disengagement plan for the other friction areas. They include Gogra, Hot Springs, Depsang and Demchok. After this, the de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) would be taken up to pull back the thousands of troops deployed by both sides.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-hold-talks-again/article34286401.ece
10 April 2021||Chennai,||Over 1.4 lakh new cases reported||India’s daily COVID-19 case count surpassed the 1.4 lakh mark on Friday with 1,44,797 infections reported as of 11.30 p.m., the highest single-day spike recorded since the outbreak last year. As many as 773 deaths were also recorded on the day. The figures do not include cases and deaths from Ladakh. The data are sourced from covid19india.org, an independent aggregator of daily COVID-19 figures. The country has so far reported a total of 1,32,02,751 cases and 1,68,467 deaths. Maharashtra reported 58,993 infections (accounting for nearly 41% of the new cases) on Friday, followed by Chhattisgarh with 11,447 cases and Uttar Pradesh with 9,587 new infections. Maharashtra also recorded the highest number of deaths (301) on Friday. Chhattisgarh followed with 91 deaths, Punjab with 56, and Karnataka with 46. The country recorded 77,193 recoveries on the day, taking the total to 1,19,87,934. The number of samples tested continued to rise steadily, crossing the 13-lakh mark on Thursday. As many as 13,64,205 tests were conducted on the day, taking the cumulative samples tested to 25,40,41,584. Maharashtra (15% of new tests), Uttar Pradesh (13%) and Gujarat (8%) led the list in terms of the absolute number of new tests conducted on Thursday. However, in terms of tests conducted relative to the population size, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand were the front-runners. Over 9.43 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in India as of 7 a.m. on Friday. About 41% of the doses were given to those aged 60 and above. However, wide disparities exist among States when it comes to vaccination coverage for senior citizens. As of Thursday, less than 15% of that age group received a dose in Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Telangana and Assam, while over 50% of the 60-year-olds in Rajasthan, Sikkim and Tripura were administered a shot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-13-lakh-new-cases-reported/article34286419.ece
10 April 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata alleges plot to kill her||The campaign for the West Bengal Assembly polls is getting shriller with every passing day. On Friday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee alleged that there could be plot to “assassinate her”. Addressing a public meeting at Memari in Bardhaman, Ms. Banerjee said, “Amit Shah, how much money you have... You are spending crores... From where have you got so much money? Now that I have said this, I know there could be a plot to assassinate me. They have injured my leg, so now there could be a plot to assassinate me. But I don’t care. As long as I am alive, I will keep talking about issues.” The Chief Minister’s remarks come soon after the Election Commission of India issued two notices to her — one in connection with remarks by her against any division of minority votes and the other regarding her remarks asking woman to gherao Central security forces deputed on election duty in West Bengal. Speaking at another public meeting, Ms. Banerjee hit out at the Election Commission saying she will continue speaking about the interference of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) till it stops working for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “I will continue speaking about the interference of the CPRF till it stops working for the BJP. Once it does that, I will salute the force. I do not care anything about your (ECI’s) show cause letters,” she said addressing a rally at Jamalpur. Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders including Home Minister Amit Shah and party president J.P. Nadda targeted the Trinamool Congress chairperson during their rallies. “In my entire political career, I have never seen a Chief Minister or party chief use the words that Mamata Banerjee is using against Central forces. Why is she trying to create anarchy?” Mr. Shah said, addressing journalists in Kolkata. The Home Minister said that during the polls, the forces are not under the control of the Home Ministry but the Election Commission of India. Mr. Shah raised the issue of infiltration and said that the people of Kolkata are concerned about the issue. He also said Ms. Banerjee’s appeal for minority unity during voting shows that minority votes are drifting away from the Trinamool Congress. The Home Minister held a door-to-door campaign in Bhawanipore in the heart of the city, a constituency that Ms. Banerjee had represented in 2011 and 2016. Mr. Shah participated in a road show in Jagatdal in North 24 Parganas while Mr. Nadda was present at a road show in Bardhaman.

10 April 2021||Kolkata,||‘Those who believe in democracy support the Samyukta Morcha’||The Samyukta Morcha is providing a real alternative to the people of West Bengal against the competitive communalism of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress, says West Bengal Pradesh Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury , who has played a crucial role in forging the alliance of the Congress, the Left and the Indian Secular Front. The Congress is contesting 92 seats. Edited excerpts from an interview:  We are almost midway through the polls in West Bengal. How is this election turning out to be? We have never witnessed an Assembly election in West Bengal where the Bharatiya Janata Party has tried to create a divide in the electorate through its communal propaganda in such a blatant manner. On the other side of the political spectrum is the Trinamool Congress under which the people of the State have suffered for so many years. It is interesting to see the Trinamool Congress, which has stifled democracy in the State, telling the people that it is fighting for restoration of democracy. Democracy and secularism are an integral part of the culture of West Bengal, and we represent that force. Those who believe in democracy and want to protect the State from communal aggression have joined us, the Samyukta Morcha. This force that was kept away from the mainstream media narrative has not only been able to make its mark but is also getting the support of the people. The people are responding to the campaign of the Samyukta Morcha and the biggest example was our rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds. It is a high-pitched campaign with both Trinamool and BJP pulling out all the stops... Again, this is an extraordinary election if we look at the manner in which the Prime Minister and Home Minister are coming to West Bengal. Both the Home Minister and Prime Minister are very busy individuals, but they are coming to West Bengal regularly, almost addressing street corner meetings. Bengal polls are their biggest agenda and we all saw how 22 jawans lost their lives fighting Maoists in Chhattisgarh. Other than that, both the BJP and Trinamool are involved in mudslinging and the real issues relating to polls have been forgotten. You say the Trinamool has stifled democracy in West Bengal. What do you mean by this? Anyone who has lived in West Bengal knows about it. For a specific example, the panchayat polls of 2018 is a clear instance when the ruling party did not allow the Opposition to file nominations. In almost 20,000 seats at the three-tier panchayat level, the Trinamool Congress did not allow candidates of the Opposition to contest. On the day of the panchayat polls, 80 to 100 people lost their lives. If the BJP wants to ensure there is a Congress-mukt Bharat, the Trinamool Congress wants an Opposition-free West Bengal — both parties have the same objective. That is why we say that the Trinamool and BJP are two faces of the same coin. The issue of defections has become an important talking point in this election. What do you think? Defections were never a part of the politics in West Bengal till 2011. It is the Trinamool Congress that started the politics of defection right from its bid to assume power by trying to poach MLAs of the Opposition parties. Even in 2016, when 44 of our MLAs won the polls, the Trinamool Congress started engineering defections. More than 20 of these MLAs have joined the Trinamool Congress — either lured by favour or coerced by fear of the use of the State machinery. Such defections were carried out at the micro-level in civic bodies and the Opposition lost control over them. Now when the BJP is engineering defections in the Trinamool Congress, poaching ministers and other key leaders and MLAs from the party, all I will way say is that the Trinamool is being paid back in the same coin. The Congress has forged alliances with the Left parties in the past, but it did not yield the desired outcome. What makes you hopeful this time? The earlier alliances were half-baked and half-hearted. Even in 2016, the difference of votes was only 30 lakh. This means that had we got just 46 votes more in every polling booth, we would have won. This time we have been able to forge an alliance based on discussions which were started much before the polls. We are campaigning on the basis of a common minimum plan. Along with Left parties we have also accommodated the Indian Secular Front. Our message to the electorate is clear: people should vote against divisive and other forces that are a threat to democratic and secular values, which are the bedrock of the culture of West Bengal. The people are intelligent enough to make a distinction.  Our message to the electorate is vote against divisive forces that are a threat to the values that are the bedrock of the culture of West Bengal||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/those-who-believe-in-democracy-support-the-samyukta-morcha/article34286362.ece
10 April 2021||CHENNAI,||M.S. Swaminathan felicitated for work towards TB eradication||Eminent agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan was felicitated on Friday for his contribution towards eradication of tuberculosis. REACH, a Chennai-based non-profit organisation working towards eradicating TB for over two decades, organised a virtual event at which Professor Swaminathan, who was its founding chair, was felicitated. Since the organisation’s inception in 1998, he has instilled the need for a more holistic approach to TB by engaging communities and the private sector, a press release said. Speaking at the event, Professor Swaminathan pointed out the three steps to tackle an issue as crucial as TB — the first was to identify the problem, then to understand the nature of the issue and third, to mobilise and organise people to work together towards the common goal of TB elimination. N. Ram, Director, The Hindu Publishing Group, and former Editor-in-Chief of the The Hindu , said, “The two most interesting aspects about Professor Swaminathan’s approach to issues, be it hunger or a disease like TB, are that he thinks big — he wants to eliminate hunger, eliminate tuberculosis, and in order to implement the vision, he works out the steps, policies and programmes in an evidence-based framework.” Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist, World Health Organisation, said that TB elimination needed more than a biomedical approach; nutrition, gender and livelihood issues also need to be addressed. “There is a lot that remains to be done to achieve TB elimination, and we are further set back due to COVID-19. We have to learn from the COVID-19 response, particularly in terms of new technologies and adapting to the situation. I hope those learnings will be taken up for TB as well.” Nalini Krishnan, Secretary and former Director of REACH, said that it was Professor Swaminathan’s vision of having an organisation which would act as an intermediary between the healthcare system and people seeking care that led to the birth of REACH. Sudha Ravi and S. Sivamurugan, founding members of REACH, felicitated Professor Swaminathan on the occasion. P.R. Narayanan, former Director, Tuberculosis Research Centre (now National Institute of Research in Tuberculosis), and Ramya Ananthakrishnan, Director of REACH, were present, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ms-swaminathan-felicitated-for-work-towards-tb-eradication/article34286376.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sushen Gupta not involved: counsel||Counsel of arms dealer Sushen Gupta has termed the series of reports in the French media of kickbacks in the 2016 €7.87 billion Rafale deal between India and France as “false, baseless and mischievous”. Counsel of Mr. Gupta, who is said to have received the kickbacks, said the reports seemed to be “motivated” and Mr. Gupta or his companies were “not involved” in any manner in the Rafale deal. “It is preposterous to suggest that a private individual could have influenced a government to government transaction for the acquisition of 36 Rafale jets,” counsel said in a statement. “Sushen Gupta has never obtained or shared any classified government documents.” Stating that Mr. Gupta is not and has never been a commercial agent in relation to defence deals, whether of Dassault or of any other entity, the statement said, “All transactions of Indian Avitronics are legitimate contracts and duly disclosed to concerned authorities.” Mr. Gupta does not have any companies or bank accounts outside India and has never had any offshore dealings with Dassault, Thales or Safran as alleged, counsel said, while also stating that there have been no financial transactions whatsoever of Mr. Gupta or his companies with ‘IDS’, Interdev or Interstellar. “Sushen Gupta has always fully cooperated with all investigative agencies.” In a three-part investigative series, Mediapart revealed how Mr. Gupta obtained crucial documents on the Indian negotiating team involved in the Rafale deal and supplied them to Dassault Aviation. It also said that Dassault paid €1 million to Defsys Solutions, one of the Gupta family’s Indian companies, for the production of 50 replica models of the Rafale jet but French authorities were not shown any proof that they were actually made. In addition, the reports also stated citing documents Dassault and its French industrial partner Thales paid Mr. Gupta several million euros in secret commissions to offshore accounts and shell companies, using inflated invoices for software consulting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sushen-gupta-not-involved-counsel/article34286386.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Live-streaming of court proceedings soon: SC judge||Supreme Court judge and chairperson of its e-committee, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, on Friday said live-streaming of court proceedings was on the brink of becoming a reality. The judge was speaking at the inauguration of a new website for judgments and e-filing. Justice Chandrachud used the occasion to clear the air on whether or not virtual courts had actually replaced physical courts. The judge said the idea behind virtual court system was not to replace physical courts, but, instead, to show the “flexibility” of the Indian judicial system to ensure that access to justice was not denied even during the hardest of times. Justice Chandrachud emphasised that the judiciary’s shift to virtual courts was primarily to protect the health and lives of judges, lawyers, court staff and litigants. “The idea is to show the flexibility of the Indian Judicial system. Not for a moment do we want to replace the physical hearing. But we are conscious of the need to protect the public health of our lawyers, litigants who come to our country or across the country,” Justice Chandrachud said. “We don’t put the burden of obtaining access to justice on citizens and lawyers. We take that burden and responsibility on ourselves,” Justice Chandrachud said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/live-streaming-of-court-proceedings-soon-sc-judge/article34286395.ece
10 April 2021||Srinagar,||Seven terrorists killed in J&K||Seven militants, including terror outfit Ansar Ghazwatul Hind’s chief Imtiaz Ahmad Shah, were gunned down by security forces in two encounters in Shopian and Pulwama districts of Jammu and Kashmir, the police said on Friday. “Five terrorists have been killed in a Shopian operation, while two others were killed in the encounter at Nowbugh in Tral area of Pulwama district,” a police officer said. Earlier, the Kashmir Zone Police had said that efforts were being made to get two militants hiding inside a mosque in Shopian after an overnight encounter to surrender. “Brother of holed up terrorist and local imamsahab sent inside mosque to persuade the terrorists to come out and surrender. Efforts are on to save the mosque,” the police had said in a tweet. They had also tweeted about the Ansar Ghazwatul Hind (AGuH) chief being trapped inside the mosque. The encounter in Shopian town broke out on Thursday evening and giving an update about the operation on the same day, the police had said that three militants had been killed and four security forces personnel injured. Inspector-General of Police, Kashmir Zone, Vijay Kumar told reporters that AGuH chief Imtiaz Shah, who was active since 2019, was actually killed in the gunbattle at Tral in Pulwama district. “While laying a cordon in Shopian, two militants managed to escape after hurling a grenade.” He said acting on inputs that the militants had moved towards orchards in the Tral area, another operation was launched in Nowbug and the two ultras were killed. One of the slain militants was identified as Imtiaz Shah, Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/seven-terrorists-killed-in-jk-encounters/article34286389.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘No plan to curtail train services’||Trying to allay fears amid the second wave of COVID-19, the Indian Railways on Friday said it did not plan to stop train services and would continue running them as per demand. “There is no plan to curtail or stop train services. We will run as many services as required. There is no cause for alarm. We can run trains immediately on demand if there is any rush. This rush is normal during the summer season and we have already announced trains to clear the rush,” Railway Board Chairman and CEO Suneet Sharma said. Presently, the Indian Railways is running 1,402 special services on an average per day, in addition to 5,381 suburban services and 830 passenger train services. Mr. Sharma said additional trains would be run during April and May to clear rush — in Central Railway 58 trains and Western Railway 60 trains. These trains are for destinations having high demand such as Gorakhpur, Patna, Darbhanga, Varanasi, Guwahati, Barauni, Prayagraj, Bokaro, Ranchi and Lucknow. The clarification comes amid fears over stopping of passenger train operations as India is seeing over a lakh new daily cases — similar to what was done in March 2020. He also clarified that there was no overcrowding at stations as mentioned in some of the reports and videos doing the rounds on social media. “There is no shortage of trains. I assure everyone that trains will be provided on demand,” Mr. Sharma said, while also ruling out the need for a COVID-negative test certificate to travel by train.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-plan-to-curtail-train-services/article34286394.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||ECI notice to Mamata for comments on Central forces||The Election Commission of India on Thursday issued notice to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her “highly objectionable” statements about Central forces posted in the State for the ongoing Assembly election. Among the statements cited by the ECI in its notice was her appeal to women voters to “gherao” Central forces if they caused disturbance to voting. The ECI said it found Ms. Banerjee's statements to be in violation of the model code of conduct as well as Sections 186 (voluntarily obstructing public servant from discharging public functions), 189 (threat of injury to public servant) and 505 (making a statement with intent to incite any class or community of persons to commit an offence against any other class or community) of the Indian Penal Code. It gave the Trinamool Congress chief time till 11 a.m. on Saturday to reply. The ECI notice said a delegation of Trinamool leaders had alleged during the Commission’s visit to West Bengal in February 21 that Border Security Force personnel were intimidating villagers living along the border to vote for a particular party. SpThe ECI said the delegation was asked to give empirical evidence of the allegation, but it did not do so. Citing statements by Ms. Banerjee, the notice said: “...prima facie, completely false, provocative and intemperate statements made by Ms. Mamata Banerjee to berate and vilify Central Paramilitary Forces during the electoral process, are causing extreme demoralisation amongst the ranks and file of these forces… .”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/eci-notice-to-mamata-for-comments-on-central-forces/article34286403.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccines aimed at curbing severe COVID-19, say experts||COVID-19 vaccines are not infection-preventing but disease-modifier vaccines, said Samiran Panda, member of the government’s National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC). Dr. Panda was speaking to The Hindu on apprehensions about using a vaccine that isn’t 100% effective in disease prevention. He said both the vaccines now available in India now will prevent the asymptomatic stage from moving into symptomatic stage and from symptomatic stage to developing severe disease where one requires intensive care. The vaccines also help in reducing the number of deaths significantly, he noted. “Scientifically, it is proven that the efficacy of both the vaccines available in India is more than 70-80% . The World Health Organisation recommends that any vaccine with a 50% efficacy will be useful in a pandemic time. So, people should not be hesitant about taking the vaccine,” said Director General of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Shekhar Mande. Dr. Mande further explained that there have been odd cases of people developing COVID after vaccination. “There could be two explanations for this. One that these could be people who fall into those 20-30% groups who don’t get protection through a vaccine and second, these people develop an infection but the intensity of the infection remains lower. We have seen a significant reduction in hospitalisation and mortality among vaccinated people,” he said. Indian Medical Association member Rajeev Jayadevan said, “Currently, we do not have published evidence on the duration of protection these vaccines offer. However the lack of published papers about duration of protection of vaccines is not to be interpreted as that vaccine protection is short.” An effective vaccine lowers the chance of getting the disease if the person encounters the virus and all the currently authorised vaccines are highly efficacious at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death, said Rajiv Dasgupta, member, government’s National Adverse Effects Following Immunization Committee. He added that based on the real-world experience, the vaccine is effective for at least six months. “At this point the duration of full protection is unknown but booster doses are likely to be necessary; it is still not clear though whether it’ll be an annual vaccination like the flu shots,” he said. N.K Arora, head of the operations research group of the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Task Force for COVID-19 noted that “vaccine coupled with COVID appropriate behavior is the way forward.” Warning that not getting vaccinated puts people at a disadvantage in the future, Director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology Rakesh Mishra, said right now the available vaccines work on the variants of COVID, “but if we don’t get ahead of the virus, mutations will continue and we may arrive at a stage that the mutations no longer respond to the available vaccines”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccines-aimed-at-curbing-severe-covid-19-say-experts/article34286408.ece
10 April 2021||GUWAHATI / JAIPUR,||Mahajot plays it safe, moves candidates to Jaipur||Nearly 20 candidates of the Mahajot , the Congress-led alliance of Opposition parties in Assam, were shifted to a luxury hotel near Jaipur on Friday amid fears of horse-trading by the Bharatiya Janata Party before the announcement of results of the tightly contested State Assembly election on May 2. The candidates included those from the Badruddin Ajmal-led All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and the Left parties. The Congress candidates were likely to join them shortly. There were speculation that the AIUDF candidates could be taken to Dubai, where Mr. Ajmal’s family has business interests. The candidates arrived in Jaipur by a chartered flight and were driven straight to the hotel, where the Congress MLAs from Rajasthan were also sequestered in July last year during the crisis in the State’s ruling party. One of the candidates from Assam, seeking anonymity, said Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had made arrangements for their stay at the hotel. An AIUDF spokesperson said Mr. Ajmal was not accompanying the team and was in Mumbai. “Our candidates may visit Ajmer Sharief during their stay in Rajasthan. They will be provided with separate mobile phones so that others cannot contact them,” he said. The Assam unit of the Congress has also given indications that some of their “vulnerable” candidates too could be flown out of the State. The 11 candidates of the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) are also expected to leave Assam soon. Their chief Hagrama Mohilary has summoned them to an undisclosed location in western Assam’s Kokrajhar. The BPF had fielded 12 candidates but one of them, contesting the Tamulpur Assembly seat, joined the BJP six days ahead of the final phase of polling on April 6. The AIUDF and the BPF are two main constituents of the Congress-led Mahajot, or grand alliance, of 10 parties. “Yes, they have all left Assam. The party will soon take a decision whether or not they will remain in Rajasthan till the announcement of the results on May 2,” AIUDF leader Aminul Islam told The Hindu . Tight finish indication Congress chief whip in the Rajasthan Assembly Mahesh Joshi and MLA Rafiq Khan, who were looking after the arrangements, were given the responsibility to ensure that the Assam election contestants were not approached by unknown persons during their stay. The departure of the AIUDF candidates and the summoning of the BPF candidates to Kokrajhar has indicated that the 2021 Assembly election result could be tighter than expected. The BJP-led Mitrajot (group of friends) has been claiming it would win at least 100 of the 126 Assembly seats. The Opposition Mahajot has also made a similar claim. But the internal surveys of most of the parties have pointed to a hung House where the two alliances could be close to the simple majority mark of 65 seats. The “precaution” taken by the AIUDF is apparently based on the Manipur experience for parties opposed to the BJP. The Congress had won 28 of the 60 Manipur seats, while the BJP won 22 in the 2017 election, but the latter weaned away some Congress MLAs to form the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mahajot-plays-it-safe-moves-candidates-to-jaipur/article34286393.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cong. MPs question court order on Gyanvapi mosque||Congress leader and senior lawyer Abhishek Singhvi on Friday pointed out that the Places of Worship Act, 1991, prohibited inquiry into religious places such as Kashi and Mathura, after a Varanasi court ordered an ASI enquiry at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi Mosque premises. Competence questioned His party colleague and Lok Sabha member Manish Tewari also questioned if a civil court judge was competent to give such a direction against a law upheld by a Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court. He claimed that it was astonishing for the judge to pass interim orders as it could only be done so after the Act was struck down. “The 1991 Act specifically includes #Kashi & #mathura places of worship 2bar inquiry into such places, its astonishing how civil judge cld pass the interim direction for #ASI inquiry, unless #1991act repealed or struck down!!” tweeted Mr. Singhvi. The civil court order directing ASI to ascertain whether a temple existed at the spot of the Gyanvapi mosque violates the existing law, the CPI(M) Polit Bureau said. In a statement, the Polit Bureau pointed out that the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act enjoins the maintenance of status quo in all such religious places of worship. “The higher judiciary should immediately intervene to nullify the lower court order,” the Polit Bureau said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-mps-question-court-order-on-gyanvapi-mosque/article34287041.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Why did Centre allow huge export of vaccines, asks Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi if the decision to export COVID-19 vaccine was an ‘oversight’ or an effort to garner publicity at the cost of Indian citizens. In a letter dated April 8 but released by the Congress on Friday, Mr. Gandhi asked for an immediate moratorium on exports as he claimed “the country is facing vaccine starvation” and asked the government to open up vaccination to everyone who needs it. He said the government should double the Rs. 35,000 crore allocation for the vaccination programme. Offering several suggestions to move towards universal vaccination, the former Congress chief said he was proud that his party built a framework in the past 70 years that has made India a vaccine hub of the world. He said there is “no clear reason” why the government allowed large scale export of over 6 crore doses. “Was the export of vaccines also an ‘oversight’, like many other decisions of this government, or an effort to garner publicity at the cost of our own citizens?” asked Mr. Gandhi, adding that India lost the first mover advantage despite scientists and researchers working overtime to offer a solution. “The State governments are repeatedly highlighting vaccine shortages only to receive intemperate statements by the Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare targeting Opposition-ruled States, undercutting cooperative federalism which you too have stressed as essential,” he said. “At our current vaccination rate, it would take years to inoculate 75% of the population,” he said. To scale up vaccination efforts, Mr. Gandhi suggested the government provide necessary resources to vaccine suppliers to increase manufacturing capacity, fast track approval of other vaccines as per norms and guidelines and open up vaccination to everyone who needs it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-did-centre-allow-huge-export-of-vaccines-asks-rahul/article34286406.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Law Minister hits back at Cong. leader||Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of lobbying for pharma companies after the latter wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on vaccine shortages and seeking fast track approvals for other vaccine candidates. Mr. Prasad’s response to the Congress leader’s letter came in a series of tweets. “After failing as a part-time politician, has Rahul Gandhi switched to full time lobbying? First he lobbied for fighter plane companies by trying to derail India’s acquisition programme. Now he is lobbying for pharma companies by asking for arbitrary approvals for foreign vaccines,” he tweeted. “Fighting a pandemic is not a one trick game. Apart from vaccination, there needs to be adequate focus on testing, tracing and treating. Rahul Gandhi’s problem is that he doesn’t understand all this and his ignorance is compounded by his arrogance,” the Minister added. Referring to charges of vaccine shortages, Mr. Prasad said “Congress-ruled States” had a problem with “basic commitment towards health care”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/law-minister-hits-back-at-cong-leader/article34286410.ece

Dealing with an application for EUA, the committee meeting earlier this month called for “data pertaining to all immunogenicity parameters, including GMT titres for virus neutralising antibody and SARSCOV-2 glycoprotein specific antibodies at day 42 as per protocol.” Unblinded data of all serious adverse events and RTPCR positive cases along with causality analysis reported, till date, for further examination were aspects on which it wanted more information. According to minutes of the April 1 meeting, made public on Friday, the committee also sought correlation of immunogenicity data, including cell-based response between phase II and phase III trials as well as comparative analysis of phase III immunogenicity data generated on Indian and Russian studies at various time points. From indication, dosage, schedule, contra-indications, warning, precautions and storage conditions, it sought information on the SmPC (summary of product characteristics) besides information on the package insert and factsheet. Submission of lot to lot consistency data with regard to the clinical trial outcomes was also something the expert panel recommended to Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-seeks-more-data-on-sputnik-v/article34286420.ece

10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers to block expressway today||Protesting farm unions under the banner of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha plan to block the Western Peripheral Expressway surrounding Delhi from 8 a.m. on Saturday to 8 a.m. on Sunday. They will be joined by a contingent of youth from Punjab led by gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, who is wanted by the Delhi Police in connection with the violence in the capital on Republic Day. The 24-hour blockade of the road, also known as the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal or KMP Expressway, is intended to be “a warning to the government”, said the SKM in an official statement. At their meeting on Thursday, SKM leaders also decided that they would “give the government time till May 9” to accede to their demands, before going forward with their proposed march to Parliament, according to a leader present in the meeting. “Anyway, nothing will happen till [election results are declared on] May 2. Plus many farmers will be busy with wheat harvesting till May 10. So we will take action after that,” he said. About 25,000 vehicles are expected to be affected by the blockade, which was advanced by three hours from the originally planned starting time of 11 am on Saturday. Farmers plan to hold dharnas at the entry points to the expressway, as well as at the toll plazas on the route. They advised commuters to avoid the road, but said those stranded on the Expressway would be provided food and water. Mr. Sidhana, who is also known as Lakhbir Singh, had absconded after the Delhi Police named him as an accused party in the events of January 26 and put a Rs. 1 lakh reward on his head. However, he has been seen addressing events in his native Bathinda, and in videos posted on social media. On Friday, he resurfaced, heading to Delhi from Sangrur in Punjab in a convoy of vehicles. In a video posted on the SKM’s official Facebook page, he urged his followers to join him in the blockade of the Expressway. “We have to go peacefully. We have to close down the KMP,” he said. Speaking from an open vehicle, he told local journalists that the government registered false cases to weaken the agitation. “If the government wants to arrest me, I am not running away. But the main thing is that this agitation has to succeed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-expressway-blockade-today/article34286397.ece

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Vaccinations go down as States face shortage||The SII’s original plan was to provide at least 10 crore doses to India a month from May. But this faced a setback after a fire broke out at one of its facilities in January. The PMO presentation also revealed that other vaccine candidates — from Johnson and Johnson, Zydus Cadilla, Novavax and a nasal spray-based vaccine from Bharat Biotech — would “at the earliest” be available after July. The Russian Sputnik V, to be supplied by Dr. Reddy’s, is likely to be available from May or June. Across States Reports of vaccine shortage have come in from across the country. Pointing out that the present stock in the State would run out in two days, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has sought an immediate supply of 30 lakh vaccines. He said the fresh supply would help maintain the vaccination momentum built up earlier by the State and ensure inoculation of all eligible beneficiaries at the earliest. Barely a week after Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy launched a mass vaccination drive in several ward/village secretariats, Andhra Pradesh is staring at a severe shortage, with only 1.38 lakh Covaxin doses and 3.06 lakh Covishield doses available as on April 6. State Minister for Health and Family Planning Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas told reporters that about 2 lakh doses of vaccines would arrive by Saturday. On average, the State has been administering 1 lakh doses per day. For past three days, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and Cabinet ministers have been sending SOS to the Centre to replenish vaccines as the State was running out of the stocks. Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the State would need at least 40 lakh doses per week and as of Thursday afternoon, had only around 12 lakh doses left. For most of this week, the State has averaged between 3.5-4 lakh vaccinations every day. The issue of vaccine supplies has turned sharply political with Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan lambasting Maharashtra on Wednesday and to a lesser degree Punjab and Delhi, of mismanaging the vaccine roll-out exercise. The non-NDA ruled States have on the other hand accused the Centre of allotting more vaccines to the BJP-led states.

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Centre steps in to roll back fertilizer prices||He added that it was not a government decision as fertiliser prices are decontrolled.  The Centre’s intervention marked the second major reversal on economic policy effected amidst the ongoing Assembly elections in West Bengal, following the recent decision to suspend rate cuts announced on small savings instruments for the April to June quarter. “In the present time, fertiliser production companies had raised the prices of various fertilisers like DAP and NPK. But the government held a high-level meeting with these companies and it has been decided at the meeting that the fertiliser prices will not be raised presently. The farmers will continue to get the fertilisers as existed earlier,” Mr Mandaviya said in a video message released in Hindi and Gujarati. On Thursday, the country’s largest fertiliser producer IFFCO revised rates for a 50 kilogram bag of Di-Ammonium Phosphate or DAP to Rs. 1,900 from Rs. 1,200, effective April 1, and other companies followed suit. Prices of other complex fertilisers were raised by 46% to 51.9%. Mr Awasthi had said on Thursday that the new prices are only tentative as international raw material costs have not been finalised. He had also said abundant stocks of fertilisers were available at old rates and the new prices were necessary for printing fresh bags being dispatched from its plants. “The material with new rates is not for sale to anyone,” he had pointed out in response to criticism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-scrambles-to-roll-back-fertilizer-prices/article34286390.ece

They came on their own and stayed at the Tarrem camp. It is possible that one of the villagers returned on his own.” Another official, however, said a person was apprehended after the encounter but no charges were pressed against him. “On many occasions it happens that after an encounter the Maoists desert their positions and are detained by the security forces. In this case no formal charge was invoked,” the official said. D.M. Awasthi, Chattisgarh Director-General of Police, could not be reached for comment. Ganesh Mishra, a Bijapur-based journalist who left with a group of facilitators on April 8 to secure the commando’s release, said that no civilian had accompanied them. “The Maoist leader who released the commando told me that he was being freed without any condition,” Mr. Mishra said. In 2012, five Maoists were released by the Odisha government to facilitate the release of an abducted MLA Jhina Hikaka. On April 6, the banned CPI-Maoist’s Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee official spokesperson Vikalp released a statement demanding that the government appoint a mediator to seek the release of the abducted commando. The Maoists said four PLGA cadres were killed in the encounter, and they were identified as Odi Sanni, Padam Lakhma, Kowasi Badru and Nupa Suresh, all residents of south Bastar. Sanni’s body was recovered by security forces on April 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/civilian-was-released-in-exchange-for-commando/article34286391.ece

10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cong. reiterates demand for probe into Rafale deal||The Congress, citing French portal Mediapart’s investigation on the Rafale fighter aircraft deal, on Friday asked the Narendra Modi government to explain “who removed the anti-corruption clause from the deal, who received kickbacks and how did a middleman have access to sensitive Defence Ministry documents”. The party alleged that the state exchequer incurred a loss of Rs. 21,075 crore in the deal and demanded an independent probe into the matter. Taking a dig at Mr. Modi, who during his pariksha pe charcha (discussion over exams) had told students that he liked to tackle difficult issues first, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Dear students, PM said answer questions without fear & nervousness. Please ask him to do the same: 1. Who took money in the #Rafale corruption scandal? 2. Who deleted the anti-corruption clauses in the contract? 3. Who gave middlemen access to key Defence Ministry documents?” Several other party leaders such as Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Shashi Tharoor and Pawan Bansal either retweeted or tweeted similar content on the Rafale. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala held a press conference to reiterate the party’s demand for an independent probe into the matter. “How can a private individual and middleman be so powerful as to influence the decisions of the Modi government in India’s biggest defence deal? Does it not require a thorough independent investigation?” Mr. Surjewala said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-reiterates-demand-for-probe-into-rafale-deal/article34286374.ece

10 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Mask compliance decreases in Greater Chennai Corporation||Mask compliance, one of the crucial COVID-19 appropriate behaviours, has decreased in the Greater Chennai Corporation. A survey found that nearly 79% of the people in slums and 73% in non-slums did not wear a mask or wore it incorrectly outdoors, while compliance had dropped in the malls. Observing outdoor mask compliance in Chennai as part of Round 3 of the Chennai Mask Survey, the surveyors found that only 21% of the people in slums and 27% in non-slums wore them appropriately. The survey, conducted by the Greater Chennai Corporation and the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR-NIE) from March 20 to 26, found that 56% of the people in slums and 53% in non-slums did not wear a mask outdoors. A total of 23% in slums and 20% in non-slums wore a mask either below the nose and mouth outdoors. Outdoor areas Compliance with the appropriate mask use decreased in the outdoor areas of all three regions of Chennai, in both slum and non-slum areas. It also found that indoor mask compliance remained the same in slum areas, while it increased in non-slum areas from 10% to 16%. However, the survey, in which 150 individuals were observed in each of the nine malls of Chennai, found that compliance dropped from 57% in December 2020 to 51% now. This round of the survey observed a total of 3,200 individuals outdoors and 1,280 individuals indoors on 64 selected streets. Outdoor public places were streets in residential or commercial areas and bus stations, while indoor public places included settings that were open to the public and did not have any entry restrictions, such as grocery shops, vegetable shops, pharmacies, religious places and apparel stores. The first-round was conducted in October 2020 when compliance was put at 28% in the slums and 36% in non-slums. This was followed by the second-round in December 2020, when the compliance was almost similar. Given the slow rise in cases in Chennai in the latter half of March 2021, a third-round was conducted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mask-compliance-decreases-in-greater-chennai-corporation/article34287090.ece

The increase should be seen along with the increase in the number of women electors in 2016 and 2021. While there were 4.3 lakh more women electors than men in 2016, the number increased to 10.15 lakh more women in 2021. According to the revised number released on Friday, the overall turnout in 2021 increased just a notch to 72.81% from the earlier figure of 72.78%. Although women voters were significantly higher in absolute numbers, the percentage of turnout among women (72.55%) was marginally lower this time than men (73.09%). This is a reversal in trend as the 2011 and 2016 elections witnessed for the first time a marginally higher turnout percentage for women than men. In absolute numbers, women outnumbered men in 162 constituencies. The widest gap was in Tirupattur in Sivaganga district, where 17,395 more women voted than men. This was followed by Tiruvadanai in Ramanathapuram district, where the difference was 16,031. The widest gap on the other end of the spectrum — where men outnumbered women — was at Omalur in Salem district. A total of 11,373 more men voted here. As shown in the maps accompanying this article, the trend of men outnumbering women among those voted was observed more in the western and northern regions in the 2016 and 2021 Assembly elections. An observable difference, however, was that women were bridging this gap in many of the constituencies in these regions in 2021.  An analysis of the constituencies won by the alliances led by the AIADMK and the DMK in the 2016 Assembly election, however, showed that it was difficult to determine if women markedly preferred one party to the other. Both alliances had won from constituencies that fell under both ends of the spectrum in terms of the difference in the number of men and women.  The overall turnout in 2021 increased just a notch to 72.81% from the earlier figure of 72.78%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/57-lakh-more-women-voted-than-men-in-2021/article34286529.ece

10 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Schools struggle to make time for revision||With under a month to go for the Class 12 exams, State Board schools are struggling to find time for revision sessions and tests for students. Students of Class 12 came back to campus in January after schools remained shut for 12 months owing to the COVID-19 lockdown. On Wednesday, students returned to several schools after a five-day break after institutions stayed shut from Friday to Tuesday. Following the Assembly election on Tuesday, several schools that were used as polling booths were disinfected and sanitised. Concepts taught “Even though we had online classes when schools remained shut, many schools have spent a considerable amount of time since January, when physical classes began, to teach students several concepts. Since learning is still going on, most schools will definitely will not find time to help students revise,” said R. Visalakshi, president, Tamil Nadu Private Schools’ Association. “During any other academic year, students would have had multiple tests, and teachers would have held special classes though the year to prepare them for the boards,” she added. Practical exams for Class 12 students are scheduled to be held from April 16 to 23, and board exams are set to begin from the first week of May. The number of COVID-19 cases are on the rise in the State, and this has added to the concerns of students and parents as well. “While we are trying our best to hold revision tests for the completed portions and seek out students who need extra help, teachers are facing a few attitudinal challenges from students. Since they came back to school after a long gap, some of them are yet to grasp the seriousness of the exams and are struggling to keep up regular preparations for them,” said A. Ramu, State president, Directly Recruited Post-Graduate Teachers’ Federation. In a few districts, government schools have managed to conduct one round of revision exams for a part of the completed syllabus. “Any other revision that we plan can be done only after the practicals. We need at least five days before the practicals to prepare the students since they hardly had any time in school laboratories this academic year,” said a science teacher from Dindigul. Despite a reduction in syllabus, he said the remaining portions were vast for teachers to finish quickly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-struggle-to-make-time-for-revision/article34287324.ece

Historian V. Sriram recalls a photograph where the Prince was seated at the back of the open car along with the former President R. Venkataraman during his visit in 1961. The royal couple had attended lunch at Chettinad House then. Condoling the death of Prince Philip on Friday, the Prince of Arcot, Nawab Mohammed Abdul Ali, recalled his meeting with the Queen and Prince Philip.

10 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Holding opportunity by the scruff of its neck||Dhamodharan Muniyan’s recent achievement may not sound like the crowning glory of his career and life, but that is only if you don’t know his story. He just completed his Ph.D. viva voce in the Department of Anthropology of the University of Madras, based on his thesis ‘Education and learning outcome among children in rural, tribal areas’. He dropped out when he was in Class 10; he returned to formal schooling after seeing children around him, he says. He was born to agricultural labourers of Kachirayapalayam in Kallakurichi. His father had big dreams for Muniyan, though as a child he worked alongside his father in the field or installed electrical posts along the rail track in Kerala. When he failed in Class 10, he ran away from home and worked in brick kilns in Kerala. “I worked there for two years and when I saw children going to school and my classmates continuing their education, I returned home.” It took him four attempts to complete the Class 10 examination and with his mother’s support, he managed to persevere and complete Class 12. But before he could join college, she died after sustaining an injury while grazing cattle. Teaching children A year later, through a friend he managed to get admission to B.Sc. Botany at New College, Chennai. He and his friends found accommodation at Taramani. It was here he came across volunteers of the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras teaching slum children. He was noticed by Balaji Sampath, who runs a non-governmental organisation AID India. Mr. Balaji encouraged him to teach other children. And that is how Mr. Dhamodharan went from being a drop-out to a teacher, a path that took him as far as a Ph.D. A survey of children in the slum behind the Ripon Buildings led him to consider doing Ph.D., he says. Finding a solution “We found that children came up with different answers to simple addition sums. Two out of 10 knew the operation. Children were afraid when they were given long sentences to read in Tamil. I started observing why the children dropped out,” he says. To understand if there was a pattern, he studied children in the Javadhu Hills and the Kalrayan Hills. In his thesis, he came up with a solution to the problem. “Our research found that 90% of the parents in these areas do not even know what their children are studying. Children are not measuring up to the level of their peers. Since many children are not good at reading, they lose confidence and drop out... We taught teachers to identify the skills the children had learnt and take them forward from there,” he says.  I worked in brick kilns in Kerala for two years and when I saw children going to school and my classmates continuing their education, I returned home Dhamodharan Muniyan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/holding-opportunity-by-the-scruff-of-its-neck/article34286533.ece
10 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Film industry upset at 50% limit on seating||The Tamil Nadu government’s decision to restrict the occupancy at theatres to 50% to curb the spread of COVID-19 has frustrated the stakeholders of the film industry. The restriction was announced a day before the release of the Dhanush-starrer Karnan , which is directed by Mari Selvaraj, on Friday. The film has already received critical acclaim. Actor Kangana Ranaut’s Thalaivi , to be released on April 23, has been postponed. Producers and exhibitors feel the industry has become a “soft target”, especially after political parties mobilised large crowds for election rallies without worrying about precautions. Tiruppur Subramanian, president, Tamil Nadu Multiplex and Theatre Owners Association, is upset at the decision, like many others in the industry. “The government and the media seem to believe that COVID-19 spreads only at cinema theatres and not on trains, buses and aircraft, and at political rallies. In fact, at a theatre, people just sit with their mask and do not interact much, unlike in a textile showroom or a jewellery shop,” he says. With the government imposing more restrictions, the theatre owners will not be in a position to continue paying their staff, he points out. G. Dhananjayan, producer and vice-president, Tamil Film Active Producers Association, calls the restrictions opportunistic, given how all parties flouted precautions during the election rallies. “It affects everybody, and films have to be postponed. Films like MGR Magan and Thalaivi were planned for release... It is damaging the industry,” he says. “The fear among people should go. Audience will come to theatres only when big films release and big films will release only when people are coming back to theatres without fear. It is inter-connected. The industry will suffer if this chain breaks. It is unfair that the film industry has become a soft target.” Producer S.R. Prabhu, whose film Sulthan starring Karthi is playing in theatres, says the decision will affect the film’s revenue. “We did take the COVID-19 scenario into account and released it. It is bad for a film that is a good family entertainer. It is a film made for the summer holidays. The film did collect well, but it should have done more.” The Tamil film industry has suffered for long in the past year. “We have to respect the decision to protect the safety of the people. But the industry has been severely affected by the lockdown. We have not received any assistance in the form of interest or tax rebate. The State government still levies 8% in local body tax on every ticket. We expect something from the government to help us out,” Mr. Prabhu says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/film-industry-upset-at-50-limit-on-seating/article34286543.ece

The police received a message that a man was found dead in Laxmipuram on Thursday night. His body bore wounds. After registering a case of suspicious death, the police investigated and identified the victim as M. Anbalagan, 52, of Laxmipuram. On scrutiny of CCTV footage, the police found that two men reached the spot on a bike and one of them attacked Anbalagan indiscriminately. Using the registration number of the bike, the police traced the suspect Krishnamurthy, 38, of Laxmipuram. He was arrested and remanded in judicial custody. On Thursday night, Anbalagan and Krishnamurthy were having drinks at a Tasmac bar nearby. Krishnamurthy snatched the boiled egg ordered by the former. Anbalagan hit him in the face with a sharp key. Krishnamurthy went out and returned with a friend on a bike.

Official sources said the consultant had submitted a detailed project report (DPR) for the construction of the 10 km-long corridor, which was likely to cost around Rs. 135 crore per kilometre. “We will review the DPR and submit it to our headquarters for approval. Most probably, it will come to a tender stage by the end of the year,” an official said. The corridor will run via Puzhal, Red Hills, Thandal Kazhani and land just before the toll plaza. “We are opting for an elevated corridor since that will enable us to considerably reduce land requirement. The present four-lane road in the urban stretch will serve as a service lane for local traffic,” another official said. S. Murthi, a resident of Madhavaram, said the traffic movement on the road, especially during rush hours was very slow. “Vehicles almost crawl on the road at times. The vehicular traffic is quite heavy on the stretch and the service lane is used as parking space by local shops and other establishments, which means we cannot use the service lane even if there is an emergency,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-tada-elevated-corridor-tender-to-be-floated-by-the-year-end/article34287256.ece

Traders said the decision would hit their livelihoods and also farmers who depend on the market to sell their produce. About 1,800 shops allotted below 300 sq ft of space were classified as semi-wholesale and retail shops. There were 650 semi-wholesale shops exclusively for fruits. S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association, said the semi-wholesalers were the last segment to reopen shops after relaxations in the lockdown. They were yet to stabilise their trade, and the decision would deal a blow to them. Wholesalers have decided to hold meetings to address the issues arising out of the new restrictions. Semi-wholesalers demanded that 50% of the shops be allowed to function on a rotation basis. S.S. Muthukumar, president, Koyambedu Market Semi-Wholesalers Welfare Association, said the decision was taken without consulting the traders. “Closing the shops will lead to an increase in prices of vegetables and fruits. We had suggested shops to be allowed to function on alternate days. We had suggested dedicated spaces be provided in Adyar, Broadway, Koyambedu and Madhavaram for semi-wholesalers to operate during the pandemic,” he said. Traders have decided to continue the protest till a solution is found.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traders-protest-in-koyambedu/article34286513.ece

10 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Handloom weavers demand separate health insurance for self, family||Handloom weavers have sought a separate health insurance cover for them and their family members, a scheme that was available a few years ago. According to Mu. Varadarajan, general secretary of Erode District Handloom Weavers Association, the scheme that was implemented earlier allowed the weavers and their family members to visit clinics with which the Handloom Department had tie-ups. They were given identity cards and were able to get treatment free of cost for cold, fever, etc., which did not require hospitalisation. However, the scheme was modified and ceilings were introduced. Scheme dropped “We had spoken to the officials seeking removal of the ceilings. But, the scheme was dropped completely. I learnt through Right to Information Act that the weavers can avail of the Chief Minister insurance cover. But, it is only for serious illness and not for normal fever or cold.” According to a handloom weaver at Sankagiri, the weavers expected an announcement in this regard in the election manifestos but were disappointed. There is no specific health insurance scheme now for weavers. Mr. Varadarajan added that another scheme (saving and insurance scheme) for handloom weavers had also been suspended. About 8 % of the wages that the weavers received was deducted and along with government contribution, it went into a group insurance scheme. When a weaver retired, he or she got the contributory premium and bonus. This scheme was stopped six or seven months ago. This affected the savings opportunity for weavers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/handloom-weavers-demand-separate-health-insurance-for-self-family/article34286590.ece
10 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Spike in cases may not lead to a surge in demand for PPEs’||The spike in COVID-19 cases may not lead to a surge in demand for personal protection equipment (PPEs) again, though manufacturers are getting fresh enquiries. According to A. Sakthivel, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, manufacturers are receiving enquiries again. But it may not lead to a huge demand as seen last year. Raja M. Shanmugham, president of the Tiruppur Exporters’ Association, said there are a few manufacturers who continue to make PPEs and masks. However, there will not be a major shift to PPE production as the demand will not be high. Garment manufacturers are likely to continue making regular products. “Last year, when the COVID-19 cases went up, there was fear and a huge demand for PPEs and masks. This year, the fear is not there. Further, use of PPEs is also not much. Hence, there will not be a major jump in demand,” he said. The Southern India Textile Research Association, a recognised laboratory to test PPEs and masks, continues to receive a steady stream of samples to test for different standards, but there is no rush for products as before. Chairman of Indian Technical Textile Association K.S. Sundararaman said there is no mandate by the government now on the use of PPEs. Hence, the demand is not likely to be high. “So, there is no demand-supply crunch. There is enough capacity in the country to meet the current demand,” he said. Further, not all hospitals are keen on buying laminated PPEs. The focus now is more on the use of masks and sanitisers, and there is adequate capacity for manufacturing gloves, sanitisers, and masks. Even for masks, many wear cloth masks and there are no specific standards that are compulsory, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spike-in-cases-may-not-lead-to-a-surge-in-demand-for-ppes/article34286537.ece

10 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. collects Rs. 115.59 crore in property tax||For the 2020-21 financial year, when people were indoors because of the COVID-19 lockdown and election work took over towards the year-end, the Coimbatore Corporation had managed to collect 91% of the property tax demand. Sources in the Corporation said of the Rs. 171.25 crore to be collected, the Corporation had collected Rs. 115.59 crore. In the year before the last financial year (2019-2020) too the civic body had registered a similar tax collection percentage – 91. As in 2019-20 FY, last year too, more assessees in the 20 wards in North Zone had paid the tax than their counterparts in the other four zones – 97%. In 2019-20, 95% tax payers had paid their taxes.  The lowest tax payment was in South Zone, both last year and the year before that as the collection percentage stood at 87% and 88% respectively. Last financial year, the Corporation had also managed to improve property tax arrear collection – both in percentage and absolute terms as well. The Corporation collected 38% property tax arrears which worked out to Rs. 17.39 crore. The Corporation sources said in the first half of the last financial year, the collection was poor because people mostly stayed indoors. It was only after the governments began easing restrictions that people began paying taxes. To facilitate tax collection, the Corporation had established temporary centres and also deployed vehicles with computers and internet connection for people to pay right in their locality. In addition to that the Corporation sent its bill collectors to those establishments where property tax were due. Armed with card swiping machines, those bill collectors returned with good returns in that people paid up then and there, the sources said. While taking such initiatives, the Corporation was well aware that it needed to collect as much tax as possible by February as its staff would get busy once the Election Commission of India announced elections. The 2020-21 financial year also saw the Corporation forego Rs. 3.60 crore as a result of the two month rent waiver that the government had given to establishments set up in Corporation buildings to help the owners overcome COVID-19 induced financial hardship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-collects-rs-11559-crore-in-property-tax/article34287114.ece

A large number of folk artistes from Manaparai, Karur and Dindigul districts, led by the association State joint general secretary Durai Santosh, submitted a memorandum to the District Collector. In their submission, they said that since last year (March), when the pandemic surfaced, the lockdown had severely affected their livelihood. The relief given by the State government was paltry and could not make our both ends meet. Thankfully, a few NGOs provided essential commodities with which the families survived. At a time, when the government had relaxed the COVID-19 guidelines for many establishments, banning festivals at temples had directly hit the livelihood of the folk artistes across the State, he claimed. “If the folk artistes were booked to perform in a temple festival they would get a substantial amount as fees. Now that the festivals cannot be held, the income has been curtailed,” he said. They also threatened to stage demonstrations and intensify their agitations if the government did not heed to what they called was their just demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ban-on-temple-festivals-folk-artistes-demand-rs-10000-as-monthly-relief/article34286563.ece

Vijayalakshmi here on Friday. Presiding over a review meeting on the measures taken by the health and municipal administration officials, she said that as per the guidelines and SOP laid out by the State government, the public have to adhere to them. Any violation or negligence would cause hardships for both the official machinery and the people, she said and added that imposing fines or sealing shops/establishments was only in public interest. Kodaikanal, which has been experiencing excellent weather over the last one week, with a steady breeze and dip in the temperature during evenings, did not see much crowd. Except for local tourists, people from other States have not made a beeline for the hill station as they were unsure about the restrictions placed by the government. Health department officials said on Thursday, that six fresh cases of COVID-19 were reported and following that officials held discussions on Friday on the methods to contain the virus spread. A hotelier said that problem arose due to the floating population. Three days ago, a family of eight from Rameswaram had come here and stayed in a lodge. Later, they tested positive and were immediately packed off to their homes, he claimed. A municipal official in Kodaikanal said that local residents and shopkeepers have been sensitized to wearing face masks. Resorts have also been told to testing the body temperature of guests on arrival through thermal scanners. A staff at the Silver Cascade Falls check post said that vehicles with other State registration were permitted only after COVID-19 screening. “We are following the SOP strictly,” he asserted. The NGOs in the hill station however, said that they would be happy if the official machinery imposed curfew for about 15 days every year so that the pollution levels in the hill station would be kept under reasonable measures. Meanwhile, a member of the Hotel and Tourist Cab Operators Association here said that till Friday, the room reservations made in resorts/hotels have not been cancelled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pleasant-weather-in-kodaikanal-but-tourist-footfall-is-low/article34286564.ece

10 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Shopkeepers are hit by Chithirai fete restriction||This is the time of the year when Pudhu Mandapam used to be bustling with activity for the Chithirai festival. However, this year too has turned out to be disastrous for the dressmakers and shopkeepers of Pudhu Mandapam. With the imposition of new restrictions to contain the spread of rising COVID-19 cases, the district administration has announced that no crowds of devotees would be allowed to gather for this year's Chithirai festival. This will be the second consecutive year that the public gathering will not be allowed during the Chithirai festival. Collector T. Anbalagan told The Hindu that the Government Order had mentioned that the temple festivals are banned from April 10. "Hence, this year's Chithirai festival will be similar to last year and hence crowds will not be allowed to gather for the festival," he said. A source from the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department said that Meenakshi Thirukalyanam will be telecast live to the public like last year. However, this announcement will affect the livelihoods of the dressmakers and shopkeepers of Pudhu Mandapam, said president of Pudhu Mandapam Traders and Tailors Association G. Muthupandi. Usually, the dressmakers work on bright, colourful garments to make dresses for devotees who take up different roles during the festival. This includes salladam (trousers), kachai (cloth tied around the waist) and urma (head gear). Usually, the dressmakers start working on these garments at least three months before the festival as it requires detailed work, said L.R.T. Sanjayan, a tailor. "But, the dresses that have been stitched this year will not be sold due to the restriction," he added. This will deeply affect the livelihoods of the dressmakers as they make decent profits only during the festival season, said N. Ramachandran, another tailor. "Last year the tailors faced severe financial constraints as the crowds were not allowed to gather for the festival. We never thought that the same scenario will continue this year too," he said. Shopkeepers who sell packages containing thaali threads, turmeric and kungumam during the festival, will also be affected. "The government must provide assistance to dressmakers and shopkeepers," said Mr. Muthupandi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shopkeepers-are-hit-by-chithirai-fete-restriction/article34287192.ece

10 April 2021||MANGALURU,TAMIL NADU||Mangalore varsity suspends professor||The Syndicate of Mangalore University on Friday resolved to keep M. Jayashankar, a professor in microbiology, who had told police that he had given Rs. 17.5 lakh to a middleman to get appointed as the vice-chancellor of Raichur University, under suspension pending inquiry by a retired district judge. In an unanimous resolution passed after much deliberations on the issue at its special meeting, the highest decision making body of the university also authorised the university’s competent authority (Registrar) to initiate an internal inquiry to be completed in six months and issue the order of suspension.

The Syndicate examined the case in detail and considered Mr. Jayashankar’s conduct and corrupt means before deciding to initiate the internal inquiry, the resolution said. Mr. Jayashankar in his complaint to Kankanady Town Police on March 27 said that he had given Rs. 16 lakh in cash, Rs. 1.5 lakh by cheque and also three blank cheques in return for the post of the vice-chancellor of Raichur University to Prasad Attavar on September 20, 2020. He also named Vivek, Gopalakrishna, Bharath and Manju as the other accused, the Syndicate noted referring to the copy of the FIR. The Kankanady Police arrested Prasad Attavar, who has now obtained bail. Meanwhile, the Anti Corruption Bureau was examining taking up a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act against Mr. Jayashankar.

10 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||Loka Ayukta finds Kerala Minister guilty of favouritism||The Kerala Lok Ayukta has found Minister for Higher Education and Minority Welfare K.T. Jaleel guilty of “abuse of power, favouritism, nepotism and violation of oath of office”. It ruled Dr. Jaleel had lost the moral right to continue in the council of Ministers. The Lok Ayukta has conveyed its finding to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the competent authority, for appropriate action. The judicial watchdog’s damning finding has prompted the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to demand Dr. Jaleel’s resignation. The Minister has said the High Court had dismissed the charge earlier. Lok Ayukta Cyriac Joseph and Upa Lok Ayukta Harun-Ul-Rashid found the Minister had attempted to appoint his second cousin to the post of General Manager, Kerala State Commission for Minority Welfare (KSCMW). The Minister had specified that a person with “BTech and PGDBA” need apply for the post. The panel found Dr. Jaleel had stacked the decks in favour of his second cousin. The government did not publish the vacancy or invite applications from other candidates for the post. The Lok Ayukta found the KSCMW had not proposed creating a general manager’s position in the first place. The forum said the Minister’s action amounted to an abuse of his official position to favour his relative. “It is immaterial that the relative did not turn up for the interview,” the forum said. The Lok Ayukta said Dr. Jaleel had displayed a “lack of integrity” in his capacity as a Minister. He had violated the oath of office. Dr. Jaleel had forsaken his vow to discharge his duties “without fear or favour, affection or ill will”. The Lok Ayukta said Dr. Jaleel should not continue as a member of the Council of Ministers. The panel has sent a report to the Chief Minister seeking Dr. Jaleel’s removal from the post under Section 12 (3) of the Kerala Lok Ayukta Act, 1999. Resignation sought Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala asked Mr. Vijayan to show Dr. Jaleel the door. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said Dr. Jaleel was symbolic of the inherent corruption in the Left Democratic Front. BJP State president K. Surendran urged Mr. Vijayan to expel the Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/loka-ayukta-finds-kerala-minister-guilty-of-favouritism/article34286432.ece

10 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Now, more and more people opt for vaccine||Public response to the COVID-19 vaccination programme has improved in Tiruchi amidst an increase in the number of positive cases in the district. The number of people visiting vaccination centres has increased since April 1 when it was opened for all over the age of 45. The district administration had permitted Mini Clinics, primary healthcare centres to administer the jab. At the Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, nearly 600 to 700 people receive the shot daily, while across the district, at least 4000 people are inoculated every day. "We need to continue to go to work to sustain ourselves and our families. With rise in cases, we must do everything we can to protect ourselves,’ M. Saindhavi, who had taken a shot on Friday said. A meeting has been scheduled with officials of the Labour Department and various representatives of industries and factories across the district to vaccinate their employees. ‘We plan to conduct camps within their campus,’ a senior health official said. While there was a depletion in the stock of vaccines, especially Covaxin, the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and the state Health Department was working towards replenishing it, an official said. Meanwhile, following instructions given by Collector S. Divyadharshini, infrastructure to treat COVID patients is being readied. Two COVID-19 care centres - one at the Bharathidasan University, Khajamalai campus, with a 200-bed capacity, and one at the Government Engineering College, Sethurapatti, with 600 beds have been arranged. ‘All necessary arrangements have been made and on Friday, around 13 patients were admitted to the facility at Khajamalai,’ S. Ram Ganesh, Deputy Director of Health Services, said. Mr. Ganesh said severely sick patients and those over the age of 50 would be admitted to the Tiruchi MGMGH while stable patients who require some monitoring would be admitted to the Khajamalai campus. Patients who are asymptomatic and less than 40-years-old would be admitted at Sethurapatti. ‘We have been instructed not to approve home quarantine for patients unless absolutely necessary. It is possible for the viral infection to spread at home as the slightest slip-up may occur,’ he said. Meanwhile, eight medical teams, consisting of healthcare workers trained to lift nasal swabs have been deputed from the DPH to the Tiruchi City Corporation to increase testing as more cases are being recorded within city limits. ‘A total of 11 teams, including the three already working with the civic body will conduct tests in the district. Fever camps in all Primary Healthcare Centres will continue,’ he said. Thanjavur Localities where three or more persons test positive for COVID-19 will be declared as containment zones, says Collector, M.Govinda Rao. Disclosing this after inspecting the measures initiated to check the spreading of novel coronavirus at Pattukottai on Friday, he said not less than 2500 persons were being tested for COVID-19 infection per day. In case anyone tests positive their contacts were traced immediately and such persons were being screened for the symptoms. Necessary arrangements have been put in place by the civic bodies to mitigate the problems faced by the residents in containment zones. Meanwhile, the number of persons opting to take the vaccination has seen an upward trend in the urban localities. While a steady flow of persons volunteering to take the shot is recorded at the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital, people have started going to the government hospitals/the designated urban primary health centres such as in Kumbakonam Municipality. As of April 9, around 70,000 persons have taken the vaccine shot in the district, he said. Pudukottai Collector P. Uma Maheswari on Friday called upon officials of government departments to work in a coordinated manner to check the spread of COVID-19 and implement the multiple restrictions announced by the State government. Presiding over a meeting on COVID-19 prevention measures, she said necessary advice had been given to industrial units, commercial complexes and private firms to ensure screening of their staff and public using thermal scanners and make sure that they wore masks. Hotels should screen the public entering their premises using thermal scanners and ensure that they wore masks. She said functioning of retail shops within the wholesale vegetable and fruit market premises would be prohibited from April 10.

10 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Retail traders of Gandhi Market to be shifted||With the State government banning retail sale in major wholesale markets in the State from Saturday in the wake of the second wave of COVID 19, retail traders of Gandhi Market in the city will be shifted temporarily to the G.Corner railway ground near Golden Rock from Sunday. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting convened by District Collector S.Divyadarshini with traders representatives of the Gandhi Market on Friday evening. Confirming the move, Ms.Divyadarshini said that the retail traders would be allowed to function at the Gandhi Market, adhering to COVID 19 safety protocol, for a day on Saturday, until arrangements are in place at the G.Corner grounds. In principle approval has been obtained from the Railways for using its ground at G.Corner for the purpose. Last year, almost the entire the market had functioned temporarily out of the G.Corner grounds for some months after the market was closed in the wake of the imposition of the lockdown in March end. The traders were initially asked to operate from the service lanes of the Tiruchi-Chennai Bypass Road for sometime before being shifted to the G.Corner grounds. Earlier, in the day traders representatives had two rounds of talks with senior officials of the Tiruchi Corporation when they pleaded against the ban on retail trade at the market. While the Assistant Commissioner of Ariyamangalam zone held a meeting with the traders in the morning, a delegation of the traders met the Corporation Commissioner S.Sivasubramanian later in the day to press their demand. The traders sought time and suggested regulating the trading hours the Corporation officials told the traders that they had no option but to enforce the government order and any representation in this regard has to be made only to the government. The retail traders were told that they will be allowed to set shop temporarily at the Uzhavar Sandhai grounds at Thennur and along the Race Course Road near the Anna Stadium in the city. However the traders representatives expressed stiff opposition to the move. “No one will come to purchase vegetable to far away Anna Stadium,” said M.K. Kamalakannan, president, Gandhi Market Vyabarigal Munnetra Sangam. Following the stalemate, the Collector chaired a meeting later in the evening. Traders contended that they were just recovering from the heavy economic losses as the Gandhi market remained closed for more than six months last year following imposition of lockdown in the wake of the pandemic and an interim directive of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court against reopening it. The court, which had issued the interim directive on a public interest litigation, subsequently lifted it paving the reopening of the market in November. It has asked all stakeholders to file their response so that a final decision can be taken in this regard. The next hearing in the case is expected next week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/retail-traders-of-gandhi-market-to-be-shifted/article34286519.ece

Hunt is also on to nab a teenage girl who was involved in the incident. Police sources said the 18-year-old boy from an intermediate caste residing in a village near Panagudi was in love with a girl from Scheduled Caste community from the same area. They both were students at the Government Higher Secondary School in Panagudi. When the girl developed relationship with another youth, the boy told her that he would show their photos to her mother in a bid to marry her. Upset over this, the girl did not speak to him for a few weeks. Against this backdrop, the girl reportedly contacted him over phone on Thursday (April 8) and wanted to renew their relationship. She also told the boy to bring Rs. 25,000 to a place in Tirunelveli to meet her. Believing the girl’s words, the boy told his elder brother Sudarmani about it and the brothers came to Tirunelveli with Rs. 1,000. When she was not in the predetermined place in Tirunelveli, the boy contacted her again and she asked him to come to Bethania near Kalakkad.

10 April 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Woman, relative torch her husband alive in car||The Tiruppur District Police on Friday arrested a woman and her relative on charges of burning her husband alive inside a car near Perumanallur. According to police, Rangaraj (62), a powerloom owner from Perundurai in Erode district, was discharged from a private hospital in Coimbatore on Thursday. He suffered an accident on March 15 and was unable to walk. His wife Jothimani (55) and relative Raja (41) put him in the car and the three headed for Perundurai on Thursday evening. Raja, who drove the vehicle, stopped it at Valasupalayam near Perumanallur around 11 p.m. He and Jothimani got out of the car, poured petrol on it and set it ablaze, burning Rangaraj alive inside the car. The two then reported this to Perumanallur police on Friday morning as a death caused by an accidental fire. Superintendent of Police Disha Mittal said that, however, the police got “crucial CCTV footages” during their investigation. “We got the footage where he [Raja] was attempting to purchase petrol [at a fuel station],” she told The Hindu . Upon interrogation with the evidence, the accused confessed to the murder, Ms. Mittal said. According to preliminary investigations, the deceased had loans to the tune of Rs. 1.5 crore and that the murder was done in fear of being unable to repay these loans, police sources said. Investigations also revealed that the deceased had taken insurance policies in the name of Jothimani worth around Rs. 3.5 crore. Further investigations are on to establish the motive behind the murder, according to the sources. The police seized Rs. 50,000 cash from the accused, which Jothimani allegedly paid Raja to carry out the murder. She allegedly assured that Rs. 50,000 more would be paid after the murder, police sources said. The Perumanallur police registered a case against Jothimani and Raja under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 302 (Punishment for murder).

Subbarayan here on Friday. Speaking to mediapersons in Tiruppur, he questioned the need to appoint the new V-C before the elected government took charge in the State. “The people have voted and the results are now in the ballot box. The Governor appointing the new V-C in a hasty manner knowing that there would be a change in government is a violation,” he said. The DMK front will have a “satisfactory” victory in all the eight Assembly constituencies of Tiruppur district, Mr. Subbarayan said. On the yarn price hike, Mr. Subbarayan said he has not received a reply from the Ministry of Textiles for the letter he wrote on April 6 demanding steps “on a war footing” to prevent the rise in yarn prices. “This historic yarn price hike is forcing many [garment] industries to shut down,” Mr. Subbarayan alleged. The Central government must allow the seven textile mills operated by the National Textile Corporation in the State to produce hosiery yarn for the garment industries in Tiruppur, Mr. Subbarayan suggested, adding that he would likely meet Union Minister of Textiles Smriti Irani after April 10 to discuss measures for reduction of yarn prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/appointment-of-tanuvas-v-c-undemocratic-subbarayan/article34287115.ece

10 April 2021||Basavakalyan,KARNATAKA||Caste calculations dominate the narrative in Basaveshwara’s land||As mercury rises, things are heating up on the political front too in the byelection-bound Basavakalyan. Taking the election as a question of prestige, the Congress and the BJP have fielded their top leaders to camp and campaign for their candidates, while the JD(S) too is a contender here. In an attempt to ride on the sympathy wave, the Congress has fielded Mala B. Narayana Rao, wife of the late B. Narayana Rao whose death necessitated the byelection. The BJP has surprised the party ranks by fielding an “outsider” — Sharanu Salagar, a Kalaburagi-based party worker — over 16 local aspirants. Of the three bypoll-bound constituencies, the JD(S) has fielded a candidate only here, Sayed Yasrub Ali Quadri, amid allegations that it is an attempt to divide the Congress votes. Mallikarjun Khuba, a two-time MLA from the segment who was among the frontline contenders for the BJP ticket, has jumped into the arena as an Independent. There are eight more candidates, including Abdul Razzak Baba Chowdhary from All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Ankush Mahadev from the Shiv Sena, Farzana Begum from the Akhil Bharatiya Muslim League (Secular). The fight, however, appears to be between the Congress and the BJP. Lingayat push Though termed as an “outsider”, Mr. Salagar, a Lingayat leader, has an advantage of the support of his community which is the biggest group with an estimated 55,000 voters. Some of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s moves — laying the foundation stone for the new Anubhava Mantapa, a Rs. 600-crore project, and the formation of the Karnataka Veerashaiva Lingayat Development Board with and an allocation of Rs. 500 crore — are aimed at mobilising Lingayat votes. Apart from sympathy factor, the Congress has its own caste equations. Ms. Narayana Rao, who hails from the Koli community, expects a major share in the estimated 20,000 votes that her community has. The former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s campaign would help here mobilise Kuruba votes which are around 20,000, the party believes. The Congress is also focussing on its traditional support base of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes with an estimated 45,000 voters, besides about 50,000 Muslim votes. However, Muslim votes may split between the Congress, the AIMIM and the JD(S), which would benefit the BJP. Eyeing Maratha vote The constituency also has around 40,000 Maratha votes and the formation of the Maratha Development Corporation by the Yediyurappa government was a well-thought move to attract them. Interestingly, former MLA M.G. Mule, a Maratha leader who had filed papers as a Nationalist Congress Party candidate, eventually withdrew, persuaded by the BJP. A section of Maratha leaders who felt “betrayed” protested against Mr. Mule and declared that they would vote against the party. Meanwhile senior politician P.G.R. Sindhia, a Maratha leader, is also in Congress now. These developments may result in the split of community votes. Mr. Khuba’s revolt after he was denied the BJP ticket had initially appeared to be a damaging factor for the BJP. However, the rebellion has lost the initial vigour as party workers returned to support the BJP’s official candidate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/caste-calculations-dominate-the-narrative-in-basaveshwaras-land/article34286640.ece
10 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘BJP has zero faith in Yatnal’||The Bharatiya Janata Party has “zero faith” in disgruntled senior leader and MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who has been going hammer and tongs against Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, party national general secretary and State in charge Arun Singh said on Friday and added that he was as good as removed from the party. Mr. Singh, who was in Belagavi to take part in the campaign for the byelection to the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat, told presspersons that Mr. Yatnal would be removed from the BJP after the party disciplinary committee, which is looking into the objectionable statements made by him, submits its report. He asserted that the BJP does not tolerate indiscipline at any level. “The BJP is a disciplined and democratic party. We have a committee that looks into such issues. That person’s response has been received by the committee. Once it submits the report, we will remove him,” Mr. Singh said. ‘Minor issue’ Mr. Singh claimed it was a “minor issue” for the party. “We have not removed him till now. Why is that so? Please think about it. There could be a strategy behind it, isn’t it?” he asked, withoutgoing into details.  ‘KSE issue resolved’ Mr. Singh also maintained that the episode of senior leader and RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa complaining to the Governor against interference in his departmental administration by the Chief Minister had been resolved. He argued that it was not a political issue. “I feel, however, that Mr. Eshwarappa should not have gone to the Raj Bhavan,” Mr. Singh reiterated. Mr. Singh also sought to put an end to speculation about a possible leadership change in the State. “There will not be a change in leadership in Karnataka. Mr. Yediyurappa will continue as Chief Minister till the completion of his term,” he said. Charge against Satish Mr. Singh said the BJP’s victory in the Belagavi byelection was assured, while accusing the Congress nominee, Satish Jarkiholi, of engaging in “anti-Hindu” activities. “He has been continually insulting Indian culture and Hindu culture. He has been speaking against our great tradition and heritage,” Mr. Singh claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-has-zero-faith-in-yatnal/article34286635.ece
10 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Yatnal dares BJP to expel him||Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, BJP MLA, on Friday dared the high command to expel him from the party for his criticism of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and his family. “They gave me a notice two months ago. That itself was uncalled for. Let them remove me from the party. Let us see how they do it,” he said. This was in response to statement by Arun Singh, BJP general secretary, that the party had issued a notice to Mr. Yatnal, which was “as good as his expulsion”. ‘Singh alone can’t act’ “They issued a notice to me 60 days ago. No action has followed till now. What will they do now? Anyway, Mr. Singh alone cannot take any action,” Mr. Yatnal told reporters at Bailhongal on Friday. “The BJP high command should take action against the corrupt practices and nepotism of Mr. Yediyurappa. They should not take action against someone like me who speaks the truth,” he said. He went on to strongly talk against Mr. Singh’s stand. “He is not working as the party general secretary. He is working as the general secretary of Mr. Yediyurappa and his son B.Y. Vijayendra,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yatnal-dares-bjp-to-expel-him/article34286638.ece
10 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two engineering colleges accused of blocking seats||The Admission Overseeing Committee (AOC) has accused the BMS Educational Trust, which runs two engineering colleges in the city, of blocking seats and selling them at exorbitant prices. The Committee, earlier this week, issued a show cause notice to the BMS Educational Trust, which runs BMS College of Engineering (BMSCE) and BMS Institute of Technology and Management (BMSIT), asking them why they should not recommend to the State government to take over the admission process. It also asked the Trust to explain why it should not recommend that the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) withdraw its recognition of the two colleges. It has sought a response from the college management within 10 days This action comes in the wake of the Committee receiving complaints from several students and parents. Complainants claimed that the colleges were asking students who had not scored good ranks in either CET or COMED-K to cough up a few lakhs if they wanted a seat. Students alleged that, as a result of this ‘seat blocking’, meritorious students were denied an opportunity to get admission in these two colleges. The AOC pointed out that in the last few years, a large number of seats allotted to students under the COMED-K quota and by the KEA had not been claimed, which is an indication of seat blocking. The committee has noted that many of these seats were filled as management quota seats. This was done without the colleges informing the authorities concerned. In a letter, the Committee said that records of COMED-K state that of 277 students allotted seats in BMSCE for the 2020-21 academic year, 152 had not joined the college. Out of 180 students allotted to BMSIT for the same academic year, 79 had not joined the college. “These seats have been filled up by the management by collecting capitation fees without conducting an entrance test and centralised counselling,” the Committee stated in the letter. B.V. Ravishankar, principal of B.M.S. College of Engineering, said that they had surrendered the seats to the KEA once candidates backed out. He stated that the college is yet to receive the notice from the Committee. Mohan Babu G.N., principal, BMS Institute of Technology and Management, denied seat blocking and said that the Committee could inspect the college if needed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-engineering-colleges-accused-of-blocking-seats/article34287071.ece
10 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Water in most lakes is unfit for drinking’||A report on the quality of water in 106 lakes in Bengaluru Urban and Rural districts published by non-government organisation ActionAid India found that the water in none of the lakes sampled was fit for drinking or bathing. ActionAid consolidated and analysed lake sample collection findings by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) for a 24-month period between January 2019 and December 2020. The data was consolidated on the basis of Water Quality Index (WQI) under different classes. Most of the lakes fell either in Class ‘D’ category, which is fit for propagation of wildlife and fisheries, and others in ‘E’ category, where the water can only be used for irrigation and industrial cooling purposes. Classification of lakes Of the 1,684 samples collected by KSPCB over the last year from lakes, 1,191 samples fell under ‘D’ category, and 489 in the ‘E’ category. The lakes were further classified as satisfactory (S) or unsatisfactory, according to the WQI. Here, too, the findings were discouraging: only 0.24% of the samples were marked S. Within ‘D’ class, a total of 24 lakes were found to be ‘better performing’. “As per the National Restoration Goals (Ponds, Lakes and Rivers), if a water sample from a particular lake falls in the same class six out of eight times (75%) it is tested, then it considered as a consistently performing lake,” said Raghavendra B. Pachhapur, ActionAid Association, India Programme Manager. The top five lakes under the category of better performers were Devarakere Tank, Annaiappa Tank, Lalbagh Tank, Yediyur Lake and Kempambudhi Lake. Twelve lakes fell under the category of worst performers, including Shivapura Tank and Karihobanahalli Lake in Peenya, Gangondanahalli Lake and Chikkabanavara Lake in Dasarahalli, and Viswaneedam Lake. Quality of data Incidentally, in February this year, CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) had submitted a report to the High Court showing that of the 210 lakes it had surveyed, at least 14 in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) limits were of ‘excellent’ quality and could be used for drinking. One of the lakes listed was Puttenahalli. However, data from KSPCB as collated by ActionAid, showed that samples fell in the ‘D’ category when tested 14 times last year, and in the ‘E’ category 6 times. Samples were not collected from Puttenahalli in March, April, May and June 2019. Lake valley systems The ActionAid report also analysed data from lake systems: Koramangala - Challaghatta valley with 84 lakes; Hebbal - Nagavara valley, which has 55 lakes; Vrishabhavati valley system that covers up to 37 lakes and Arkavati with 15 lakes. The Koramangala-Challaghatta system had the best performance, with only 16% of the samples in the ‘E’ category. “The Arkavati valley was observed to be the worst as 53% of the collected water samples were identified as D and 47% under E,” stated the study.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/water-in-most-lakes-is-unfit-for-drinking/article34287060.ece
10 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||RCB anthem riles local fans||For the second consecutive season, IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) faced the ire of Kannadigas upon the release of their team anthem. Fans were upset that the song contains only a smattering of Kannada while the majority of the lyrics is in Hindi. The video is identical to the one used last year, save for a few scenes which feature new players. The Bengaluru franchise had received similar criticism last year as well. Many Twitter users expressed their disappointment with hashtags #StopHindiImposition and #ServeInMyLanguage. Another user, ‘@archie2992’, posted, “This is ridiculous, @RCBTweets. Other than for 2 lines in Kannada, this anthem is in Hindi and English primarily. There is something called regional pride, one that your management has heavily neglected and almost damaged over the years. This is not okay.” Catering to fans Some fans defended the use of Hindi in the team song given that RCB is led by superstar cricketer Virat Kohli, who commands a following worldwide. RCB’s approach to building a strong local fan base is in contrast to most other IPL sides, which compose anthems in their regional languages. RCB is owned by United Spirits Limited (USL), a subsidiary of British multinational Diageo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rcb-anthem-riles-local-fans/article34287063.ece
10 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mixed response to night curfew timings||A day after the imposition of “night corona curfew” between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. from April 10 to April 20 in seven urban centres across the State, experts said measures should have been tougher and curfew hours should have begun from 8 p.m. However, they said that although it was symbolic rather than one that met any practical purpose, night curfew could be seen as a COVID-19 control measure that “sends out a strong message” to the people. “It would have been better if it was between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. as people are in the habit of meeting for dinner and partying after work. Usually they finish work between 7 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. and then hang out with friends in pubs and restaurants where there is a potential for spread of the infection,” said V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka. Dr. Ravi, who is also a member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) said now people might hang out for a little longer under the pretext that the curfew would begin at 10 p.m. “The purpose of night curfew should be to minimise such meetings and reduce the speed of transmission,” he said. “We are underestimating the severity of the second wave. We need more tough measures now. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar has convened a meeting of COVID-19 experts on Saturday and I will raise this concern at the meeting,” he said. Dr. Ravi had earlier his week told The Hindu that the State government should consider weekend lockdown and night curfew as in Maharashtra, especially this long festival weekend. Sudarshan Ballal, chairman of Manipal Hospitals and member of the State’s COVID-19 Expert Committee, said night curfew was essential as people did not seem to understand the gravity of the current situation. “The second wave is predicted to be more severe than the first one and this is clearly evident going by the rate of spread in the last three weeks. Although symbolic, the night curfew will certainly make a difference during the weekend when people tend to party. I believe it will prevent significant level of transmission during the weekend,” he said. On the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. timings, he said it was ideal as people who worked till late needed time to get back home. “Most work till 7-7.30 p.m. and even beyond that. Commuting from the workplace to their residences takes time in the city’s traffic,” he added. Last option However, TAC member Giridhar R. Babu, who heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India in Bengaluru, argued that curfews and lockdowns should be the last option and should not be used unless we implement other alternatives. “Weekend lockdown and night curfew have a limited role in reducing the speed of transmission. However, it will create a sense of responsibility among people that if they do not listen, the government will be forced to impose drastic measures,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mixed-response-to-night-curfew-timings/article34287067.ece
10 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Labour Dept. prohibits bus strike; employees remain unmoved||The government’s tough stand on road transport corporation (RTC) employees has had little effect on the ongoing indefinite bus strike, which looks set to enter the fourth day. The Labour Department on Friday prohibited the strike with “immediate effect” under Section 10 (3) of Industrial Dispute Act, 1947. In an order, it stated that the Labour Commissioner had submitted a report noting that employees representing the Karnataka State Road Transport Employees League resorted to the strike even after negotiations with the managements of the RTCs had begun. The department has also referred the industrial dispute case to a Labour court. However, R. Chandrashekar, president of the league, dismissed the order as a “routine process”. He told The Hindu that the indefinite strike would go on. “We have decided to continue our protests till our demands are met. On Saturday, our leaders will hold a meeting at Belagavi to decide on the future course of action.” Meanwhile, the State government has warned oftaking strict action against those creating problems for employees reporting back to duty. Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who also holds Transport portfolio, said protection would be given to those employees who were not participating in the strike. More buses on roads RTCs claimed that they were able to operate more buses on Friday when compared with the previous days. On Thursday, the corporations managed to run 456 buses. On Friday, operations crossed over 885 buses. The KSRTC is also planning to use the services of candidates who had appeared for driver and driver-cum-conductor recruitment process and secured over 40 marks but could not get a job in the corporation. On Friday, South Western Railway decided to increase the frequency of trains operated between KSR Bengaluru and Mysuru . The MEMU trains (numbers 06255/06256 and 06257/06258) will be operated on all days as against six days in a week earlier. The decision has been taken in the wake of the bus strike and Ugadi festivities. CM’s appeal Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa once again appealed to employees to return to work. During this difficult time of the pandemic, the State government had spent Rs. 2,300 crore to pay the salaries of the staff and they should realise that, he said while addressing the media on Friday. He reiterated that a pay revision on a par with the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations was not possible. “I am requesting road transport employees with folded hands to report back to duty and stop being stubborn,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/labour-dept-prohibits-bus-strike-employees-remain-unmoved/article34286648.ece
10 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||6,000 beds to be made available in the next 10 days||With health experts warning that the next 10 days will be crucial, the BBMP is working towards increasing vaccination, ramping up testing and ensuring that there are enough beds in government and private health care facilities. BBMP Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that, over the next 10 days, around 6,000 beds will be available for treatment of COVID-19 patients in government-run and private health care facilities. The civic chief met Tushar Girinath, nodal officer for monitoring the Apthamitra helpline, K.V. Thrilok Chandra, Commissioner, Department of Health and Family Welfare, and other senior officials on Friday to chart out a plan. The Central Hospital Bed Allocation team, comprising IAS and IPS officials, will conduct inspections to ensure private facilities have reserved 50% of the total beds for COVID-19 patients. Private healthcare facilities will be required to display the number of beds available under government and private quota for the benefit of the public. Mr. Gupta said that the occupancy rate in the two operational COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs), one at Haj Bhavan and another at HAL, had increased to around 70%. Zonal commissioners have been directed to identify locations for setting up two or three smaller CCCs of around 50-bed capacity in each zone. CCCs can also be established in hotels, if necessary, he added. With the State government directing the BBMP to increase testing up to 1 lakh per day, additional teams will be deployed at primary health centres. While each PHC has around three teams, it would be increased to eight in a phased manner, he said. With regard to the night curfew that has been imposed by the government, the civic chief urged citizens to adhere to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, not move around in groups and avoid crowded places. Any violation would be dealt with stringently and establishments would be closed down, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/6000-beds-to-be-made-available-in-the-next-10-days/article34287069.ece
10 April 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Farmers warn of a struggle if hike in fertilizer price is not withdrawn||The sharp increase in the price of fertilizers has ruffled the feathers of farmers’ leaders who have warned of a struggle against the Centre if the price hike is not rolled back. Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers’ Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar took exception to the abrupt increase in the price of fertilizers. He accused the Centre of yielding to the lobby by the manufacturing companies to hike the price. “The BJP government at the Centre had promised farmers of directly transferring the fertilizer subsidy to their bank accounts. While such a promise is yet to be implemented, the government has increased the price of fertilizers,” Mr. Shanthakumar said. He described the sharp increase in the price as “anti-democratic”. The farmers are also upset at the State government over not sticking to the commitment of supplying six hours of the three-phase power supply for their irrigation pump-sets. “As against the commitment of supplying six hours of three-phase supply, farmers are actually getting less than three hours a day,” he alleged. In several areas, the three-phase supply was being given during night, making it difficult for farmers to make arrangements for irrigating their standing crops, he said. He warned that farmers would stage a protest by locking up the offices of Escoms if the hours of supply of three-phase power was not increased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-warn-of-a-struggle-if-hike-in-fertilizer-price-is-not-withdrawn/article34286643.ece
10 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Hospitality sector fears another round of job loss||The government’s decision to impose curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in the light of a spike in COVID-19 cases has not gone down well with the hotel industry, especially as restaurants, pubs, and other eateries are operating at 50% occupancy. The main concern is the welfare of employees. According to Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels’ Association president P.C. Rao, last year, following the lockdown, over 1.25 lakh employees in the sector reportedly lost their jobs. Over the past few weeks, the industry has been urging the government to consider those employed in the hotel industry as frontline workers and cover them in the vaccination drive. Chandrashekhar Hebbar, president of the Karnataka Pradesh Hotels and Restaurants’ Association, said the government’s decision will hurt bars, restaurants and pubs more than other categories in the hotel industry. “We are ready to adhere to the new rules. However, the employees of various establishments will be able to leave only by 11 p.m. The government should ensure that these employees are not harassed,” he said. Hoteliers also questioned the rationale behind the decision and claimed it was “unscientific”. Mr. Rao claimed the move will impact many eateries, hotels, bars, pubs and restaurants, not to mention travellers to the city. Govindraj Hegde, secretary, Federation of Wine Merchants’ Association, Karnataka, said, “We have to cooperate with the government since it is for just 10 days.” Karunakar Hegde, association vice president, said the peak business hours for many bars, pubs and restaurants were from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. “This will have a huge impact on business. We will have to stop admitting patrons from 8.30 p.m. – 9 p.m. if we have to close down operations at 10 p.m.,” he claimed. Manu Chandra, who heads the Bengaluru chapter of National Restaurant Association of India, hoped the government would give some consideration for food deliveries and employees of various establishments. “As it is, given the situation following the outbreak of the pandemic last year, many establishments are on the brink of shutting down. We only hope that this doesn’t lead to another wave of unemployment in the industry,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hospitality-sector-fears-another-round-of-job-loss/article34287073.ece
10 April 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Reduction in subsidy to be blamed: Siddaramaiah||Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah has condemned the hike in fertilizer price from April 1 by pointing out that the increase is to the tune of about 60%. In a press release, he said the cost of DAP had been increased by Rs. 1,400 a quintal while that of NPK had been hiked by Rs. 1,250 a quintal. He sought to debunk the Centre’s argument that the hike was owing to an increase in price in global market. He maintained that the actual reason for the increase in fertilizer price was owing to reduction in subsidy in the Central Budget. “The Centre has reduced fertilizer subsidy by about 40%, amounting to Rs. 54,417 crore,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/reduction-in-subsidy-to-be-blamed-siddaramaiah/article34286642.ece

10 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Penalty||Police have announced that they will start penalising owners of two-wheelers for not installing rear-view mirrors and not using indicators while changing lanes and taking deviations. The fine for each offence is Rs. 500. Most of the accidents in the city involve two-wheelers. Police officials hope that the fine will serve as a deterrent to motorists. “A study of the accidents involving two-wheelers and the casualties caused in the city has revealed three major causes — not using rear-view mirror, indicator, and not wearing helmet,” said B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner, Traffic, Bengaluru, in a statement on Friday. While the traffic police strictly enforce the helmet rule, they haven’t enforced the use of a rear-view mirror and indicators. “We need to bring about a behavioural change among two-wheeler riders in the city. Looking at rear-view mirrors can avoid a lot of accidents. People, especially two-wheeler riders, are not used to correctly using indicators while taking deviations and changing lanes. An analysis of several accidents shows that a sudden deviation takes the motorist behind by surprise and gives no time to react, causing accidents,” said Mr. Gowda. Enforcing rear-view mirrors and the proper use of indicators are key to avoiding accidents on the city’s roads. “On busy arterial roads, motorists follow lane discipline and we have signals to regulate the traffic. Most accidents are reported on the smaller roads, especially in the mornings when traffic is less and signals are yet to kick in. In these scenarios, both rear-view mirrors and indicators play a key role,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/penalty/article34286631.ece

10 April 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||A solo march against farm laws||Nagaraj Kalkutagar, a 39-year-old former techie, has begun a 6,000-km-long march to Delhi to protest against the controversial farm laws. An activist against corruption, atrocities on women, and illegal mining for the last five years, Mr. Kalkutagar plans to reach the national capital by July-end by walk. As he reached Hassan on Thursday evening, he had completed 1,230 km of his journey, covering 13 districts. Representatives of many pro-farmer organisations welcomed him. Plunge into politics Mr. Kalkutagar, who hails from an agricultural family of Bagalkot, has M.Sc. and M.Tech. degrees and has worked for tech companies as a geospatial engineer. The turn of events in 2012 following the Nirbhaya gang rape case in Delhi and corruption cases against the UPA government prompted him to join India Against Corruption (IAC) movement and later the Aam Aadmi Party. He worked as Bagalkot district convener of the AAP and also contested for the Bagalkot Assembly seat in 2018. “During my days in Bagalkot, I was involved in struggles against illegal sand extraction and led many protests. I did grama vastavya (village stay) in 25 villages of the district in 2016–17 to understand the problems of the farming community.There I understood the importance of minimum support price and other issues,” he said. He has been in touch with psephologist-turned politician Yogendra Yadav. Recently, he took part in the activities of the Karnataka Rashtra Samithi, a political party led by Ravikrishna Reddy. Mr. Kalkutagar wanted to join the farm protest in a different way. “Instead of straightaway going to Delhi, I decided to communicate with people along the route. Hence I started the padayatra — Delhi Chalo,” he said. Mr. Kalkutagar began the march at Male Mahadeshwara Hills in Chamarajanagar district on February 11. He has a backpack with two pair of clothes and other essentials, besides a couple of books. With a bottle of water in his hand, he walks. He uses his tab to look for directions. His wife and children are staying put in Bengaluru. “By and large my journey has been on foot so far. Sometimes, I had to travel short distances by vehicles as per the advice of the local police. While I was walking near Udupi, the police insisted I take a bus, suggesting that crossing forest areas would be risky,” he said. He enjoys discussing minimum support price and other issues at least with 50 people a day. “Many days I have met more than 100 people. Some people argue with me and some get convinced and extend support. A few have offered me financial help to support my journey,” he said. Along the route, many strangers have helped him stay at their places and offered him food. He would like to end his march mid-way if the Union government agrees to the farmers’ demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-solo-march-against-farm-laws/article34286637.ece
10 April 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||DC directive to private hospitals||Hassan Deputy Commissioner R. Girish has instructed private hospitals and nursing homes to reserve 50% of beds for COVID-19 patients, as the number of cases is on the rise. He held a meeting with representatives of the Indian Medical Association, private hospitals and nursing homes in Hassan on Friday. In the first phase of the pandemic, the DC said, the district administration did not receive a good response from the private health firms. “There is a chance of 300 fresh cases reporting a day in the next 15 days. If the private hospitals do not join hands with the administration to combat the pandemic, the administration would take strict action”, he warned. IMA’s Hassan chapter president Ramesh said the government should provide security for the staff in private hospitals, and provide insurance to families of two private doctors who died of COVID-19 in Hassan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dc-directive-to-private-hospitals/article34286742.ece
10 April 2021||Hassan/Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Many pay through their nose for train journey||An old man was in shock as the lady at the ticket counter in Hassan railway station on Friday morning said the ticket to Arsikere would cost him Rs. 300. The passenger wondered, “Why Rs. 300 for a 40-km journey?” The lady at the counter responded, “As you have not booked the ticket in advance, you will have to pay an excess Rs. 250, besides the actual travel fare.” Rajamma, 72, a resident of Hassan, had to attend the funeral of a relative in Shivamogga. She paid Rs. 350 to travel by Mysuru–Talaguppa Express, as against the actual price of Rs. 100. With no public transport owing to the KSRTC employees’ strike, hundreds of passengers are forced to travel by train paying excess amount. Those who could not book tickets in advance are paying the heavy price. The Ministry of Railways stopped issuing tickets across counters at stations following the COVID-19 pandemic. Passengers are encouraged to book in advance online. The staff issue a handwritten excess fare ticket, in which the excess fare is mentioned. “Even private buses are not charging this amount. With no alternative, we are forced to pay more,” said another old man who purchased two tickets to Shivamogga by paying Rs. 700. A staff member at the station, when enquired by The Hindu , said excess fare is collected from those who buy ticket at the counter. “The excess fare is same as the fine collected for travelling without a ticket,” the staff member added. Many passengers demanded the Railways stop collecting the excess fare. “We have to depend on trains as KSRTC employees are on strike. The Ministry of Railways should understand the difficulties and charge only the actual fare,” demanded B. Manjunath, a resident of Hassan. ‘As per guidelines’ The Railways, however, said the excess fare collection was as per the guidelines of the Railway Board. The Senior Divisional Commercial Manager of Mysuru Division of South Western Railway, Manjunath, told The Hindu that tickets with regular fares would be issued across the counter till half an hour before the arrival of a particular train at the station if berths/seats were available. Those walking into the station after this cut-off period would have to be treated as those travelling without ticket and be charged for ticket-less travel along with regular fare, Mr. Manjunath said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-pay-through-their-nose-for-train-journey/article34286645.ece
10 April 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||The land of socio-political revolution ready for another poll battle||Today’s Basavakalyan in Bidar district, which was historically called Kalyani (Kalyana) and had served as the royal capital of Kalyani Chalukyas and Kalachuris, has had a special place in the history of India for its intense socio-political activities in the 12th Century that later came to be known as Vachana Kranti or Kalyana Kranti, a mass movement led by Basaveshwara and other Sharanas against caste-based oppression and gender-based discrimination. It was in this process of establishing an egalitarian society that the Sharanas had formed and operated Anubhava Mantapa, with Allamaprabhu as its president, in Kalyana, which is often said to be the first democratic Parliament of the world, where the leaders of the movement discussed socio-political issues and chalked out their course of action. Apart from Chalukyas and Kalachuris, Kalyani was later ruled by Yadavas of Devagiri, Kakatiyas, Delhi Sultanate, Bahmani Sultanate, Barid Shahis of Bidar, Adil Shahis of Bijapur and the Mughals. When India was up in arms for her freedom in the first half of the 20th Century, the area was under the Nizam of Hyderabad. Later, in Independent India, Kalyani was renamed as Basavakalyan in memory of Basaveshwara, the Prime Minister of Kalachuri King Bijjala and the leader of the revolutionary Sharanas of the 12th Century. When the first General Elections were declared in 1952 after the transfer of power from the British to India in 1947, Kalyani was not yet constituted as an independent Assembly constituency. It was in the next General Elections held in 1957 that it became an independent constituency retaining its name as Kalyani. Unlike in most of the constituencies in the country that the Congress had, by virtue of its role in India’s freedom movement and resultant popularity, held its supremacy for a considerable period in the post-Independent era, Basavakalyan showed a mixed dominance of different political forces including Independent candidates. Of the 14 elections held in the constituency, only five were won by candidates from the grand old party — Annapurnabai in the first two elections held in 1957 and 1962, Baburao Anandrao in 1972, Bapurao Hulasoorkar in 1978 and B. Narayan Rao in 2018. The constituency had largely remained a stronghold of the Janata Parivar as its candidates won seven elections — Basavraj Patil Attur in 1983, 1985, 1989 and 1994, M.G. Mule in 1999 and Mallikarjun Khuba in 2004 and 2013. The BJP has won the constituency only once in 2008 when Basavaraj Patil Attur contested the elections as its candidate. Interestingly, Independent candidates emerged as winners (S. Sanganabasappa) and runners-up (B. Ananda Rao) in the 1967 elections pushing the Congress to the third position.  It has a special place in the history of India for its intense socio-political activity in the 12th century  This mass movement came to be known as the Vachana Kranti or Kalyana Kranti  Basaveshwara, the Prime Minister of the Kalachuri King Bijjala, and the other Sharanas fought against caste-based oppression and gender-based discrimination||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/the-land-of-socio-political-revolution-ready-for-another-poll-battle/article34286613.ece
10 April 2021||KALABURAGI/ BASAVAKALYAN,KARNATAKA||Election panel urged to have a robust system to check distribution of money||Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee State president D.K. Shivakumar has said that the BJP candidate in Maski constituency [Pratapgouda Patil] and his followers have been trying to win voters by distributing money. He has urged the Election Commission to disqualify the candidate. “The candidate should be disqualified and arrested immediately,” he said. He was speaking to media persons at Kalaburagi Airport on Friday before participating in the by-election campaign in the Basavakalyan constituency. The KPCC leader sought disqualification of the BJP candidate and demanded his immediate arrest. He urged the Election Commission to have a robust and functional machinery to halt the distribution of money and to ensure free and fair elections. Mr. Shivakumar said that the Raichur Deputy Commissioner and the Superintendent of Police were acting as agents of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The distribution of money by BJP cadre is going on right under the nose of the Deputy Commissioner and the Superintendent of Police. “People are turning up in large numbers to attend public meetings and rallies being organised by the Congress, We are getting good response. People have made up their mind to teach a lesson to the BJP,” Mr. Shivakumar said. In Harkud village in Basavakalyan, Mr. Shivakumar said that the BJP has lured Congress and Janata Dal(S) MLAs by offering Rs. 40 crore to Rs. 50 crore during Operation Kamala. The BJP leaders even tried and failed in their attempt to lure Congress MLA late B. Narayan Rao. He reiterated that the people of the constituency are well aware of the development works taken up by the Late Narayan Rao. The late leader played an important role in the development of Basavakalyan taluk, he said. Accusing the BJP of fielding an outsider in Basavakalyan, Mr. Shivakumar said that fielding candidates in such a way is against democracy as such candidates do not have much to do with local people. The leader termed the BJP’s promise of constructing New Anubhava Mantapa in Basavakalyan in Bidar district as an election gimmick. The Yediyurappa-led government has not released a single rupee for the proposed project so far, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/election-panel-urged-to-have-a-robust-system-to-check-distribution-of-money/article34286615.ece
10 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Academy plans Vishwa Beary Sammelan in Dubai in Nov.||Karnataka Beary Sahitya Academy will organise Vishwa Beary Sammelan in Dubai in this November, according to chairman of the academy Rahim Uchil. Beary is an ethnic Muslim community, concentrated largely in coastal Karnataka and parts of North Kerala, from the Chandragiri in Kerala to Barkuru in Udupi, with its own distinct traditions and language. According to the academy, over 20 lakh people speak Beary all over the world. Mr. Uchil said that in addition to West Asian countries, the Beary-speaking people are spread out in large numbers in Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Canada, the U.S. and London in the U.K. The sammelan is being organised to establishing an identity for Beary at the global level. A 75-member reception committee which will comprise representatives from different parts of the world will be formed to ensure that the sammelan is a success, he said. There will be felicitations to achievers, literary sessions, cultural programmes and competitions during the sammelan. The meet will also focus on the need for more and more people from the Beary community to get higher education, Mr. Uchil said and added that it will not be organised as a religious convention. Till recently, Beary was dependent on Kannada script and Arabic numerals. Following six months of work by an expert committee, the academy released an independent Beary script and numerals last year. The language has 13 vowels, 33 consonants and nine numerals. Apart from Beary script and numerals, the academy has named 12 months in Beary — Surumada (January) and Cheremada (February), while days have names for example, Nyarase (Sunday) and Tingalase (Monday). Months have been named mostly based on climatic conditions and normal activities that are on at the time. For example, as May will be very hot, it has been named Chudumada  and April has been named Nalmada  as this particular month will see many activities in society. He said that the academy has taken up a proposal for introducing Beary as the third optional language in schools from Class VI. At present, it has been planned to use Kannada script and Arabic numerals in the proposed textbooks. But the academy will also introduce Beary script and numerals to students then. As per a preliminary survey, 3,750 students in Dakshina Kannada have evinced interest in opting for Beary as the third optional language.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/academy-plans-vishwa-beary-sammelan-in-dubai-in-nov/article34287198.ece
10 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Reintroduction of DEMU as an express train termed retrograde||The decision to reintroduce the Madgaon-Mangaluru-Madgaon DEMU Passenger train as an Express Special by Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. has disappointed the travelling public who said that the conversion into an express train was retrograde. While running as a passenger train, the train was halting at 28 stations excluding the originating and destination stations thereby serving almost all stations en route . When it was made an express train, halts at 10 stations were eliminated thereby depriving passengers in those stations affordable commuting options, regretted rail activist Gopalakrishna Bhat from Mangaluru. The eliminated halts include Bali and Loliem in Goa, Harwad and Chitrapura in Uttara Kannada, Shiroor, Bijur, Innanje, Padubidri and Nandikoor in Udupi and Thokur in Dakshina Kannada districts. While elimination of halts should have reduced the travel time, there was no change in the travel time either, Mr. Bhat said. The conversion of the passenger train into an express, Mr. Bhat said, would force passengers to pay additional fare without there being any benefits of speedy travel. Making it a fully reserved train would further discourage passengers who could not pre-book tickets on the train, he said. Uttara Kannada Railway Seva Samithi Secretary Rajeev Gaonkar too said that conversion of the train into express would burden the common man. He said that the DEMU was an economical service and it could not have been converted into an express. There was no saving in the running time also. Inappropriate schedule Mr. Bhat said that he had represented to the Konkan Railway and the Southern Railway even before the lockdown to start the DEMU service from Mangaluru towards Madgaon at around 12.30 p.m. as its departure schedule, 2.45 p.m., was not convenient for passengers. He pointed out that two express trains, Mangaluru Junction-Mumbai CSMT and Mangaluru Central-Mumbai LTT, leave between 1.50 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. towards Karwar. Having one more train at 2.45 p.m. was of no use and the train would run empty. Mr. Bhat saw some design through all these measures in ensuring that the DEMU loses patronage leading to its cancellation thereby depriving passengers of coastal Karnataka services of a commuter train. The Railways should operate trains for the benefit of passengers and at the same time, earn revenues too. The proposal to run the DEMU as an express defeats both these purposes, he said and urged both the Konkan Railway and the Southern Railway to suitably modify the service.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/reintroduction-of-demu-as-an-express-train-termed-retrograde/article34287208.ece

10 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Certificate courses in folk dances||In an effort to revive the fading Beary folk dances, Karnataka Beary Sahitya Academy will in association with St. Aloysius College offer certificate courses in Duff, Kolkali, Oppane Pat and Kaicott Patt forms of dances. A training programme as part of the courses will be launched at the college here on Saturday, according to chairman of the academy Rahim Uchil. Mr. Uchil said that the participants will be offered 30 hours of training in each form of the four dances. In all, 60 candidates, a majority of whom are non-Bearys and who are women, have registered for the courses. Training will be offered in batches. Each batch will comprise 12 candidates. Once they completed their courses, a joint certificate will be issued. He said that except Duff dance, Kolkali, Oppane Pat and Kaicott Patt forms have disappeared in Karnataka. Citing an example, he said that if there is a need for Oppane Pat dance, a troupe will have to be hired from Kerala. Some troupes from Kerala charge up to Rs. 1 lakh per performance. Alva’s Education Foundation in Moodbidri managing Alva’s College has trained some students in the Beary folk dances and those students have given performances at Alva’s Virasat and Nudisiri events. The 60 participants will be trained based on their interest in the dance forms. The objective is to groom performers and nurture the fading art forms. Mr. Uchil said that on a request from the academy, Mangalore University has agreed to offer certificate and diploma courses in Beary art forms from the academic year 2021-22. It has formed a committee to prepare syllabi. The academy has provided the university a list of 19 resource persons to help the university in preparing the sylllabi.

10 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Big increase in COVID-19 cases||Case fatality and positivity rate are surging with Mysuru reporting this year’s biggest increase in infections on Friday. The active cases rose to 1,682 with 283 cases reported on Friday besides five deaths, the highest this year. The mounting case fatality rate has become a cause for concern.

The police had been empowered to slap hefty fines on the violators in a bid to discourage them from flouting the rules and complying with the COVID-19 Appropriate Behavior. The crackdown against people for not wearing masks in public places and maintaining social distance has been largely focused in the city centre – business hubs, markets and so on - and the police are expected to expand its drive in the residential areas as well if the situation warranted. Several cases had been booked under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and also under the IPC sections, with teams patrolling the city keeping a close watch on the violators. Even shopkeepers and traders who allowed violation of norms on their premises had been booked and slapped fines to serve as a deterrent.

10 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Mysuru division of SWR to resume additional train services||The Mysuru division of the South Western Railways will resume services of a few important trains that will cover different sections of the division connecting Mysuru with different districts of the State. The services of these trains will resume between April 10 and 14 and they will run till further orders. These include three daily unreserved trains from Mysuru to Arsikere, Talaguppa and Belagavi, for which tickets will be issued across counters. Divisional railway manager Rahul Agarwal said on Friday that they have taken into cognisance the situation brought about due to the suspension of bus services by KSRTC since the last few days and have introduced additional services. Mr. Agarwal said passenger patronisation of trains has steadily increased over the last few months and as on date, about 100 pairs of trains were running over the Mysuru division including 32 pairs of trains that originate from the division connecting different States. However, the authorities are still wary about the normal resumption of all services included in the railway timetable in view of the surge in COVID-19 cases. But, based on the demand pattern and approval from the headquarters, unreserved trains are also being introduced ubject to strict adherence of COVID-19 norms of the State and Central governments, including wearing of masks, using sanitisers etc. on board trains and at railway stations. The occupancy rates of long-distance express trains too was encouraging at about 60% to 70% and was increasing. However, the passenger services for short-distance routes were not yet fully restored, according to Mr. Agarwal. He said despite the pandemic, the Mysuru division loaded 6.914 million tonnes of freight till the end of March 2021. This surpassed the previous second-highest loading which was 6.624 million tonnes achieved in 2012-13, by 4.4%. However, compared to the loading of the previous year, it was less by 15% due to the pandemic. But with the concerted efforts of the marketing team of the Business Development Unit, the performance gap compared to the previous year which was 75% in April 2020, was bridged and reduced to 15% by March 2021, said Mr. Agarwal. The total revenue earned was Rs. 532.16 crore as against Rs. 844.75 crore in the previous year. The revenue from the passenger segment was Rs. 55.45 crore as against Rs. 278.09 crore in the previous year. With regard to track development, Mr. Agarwal said the Mysuru division had completed the doubling of track from Tolahunse to Devaragudda section (40.27 km) on the Bengaluru-Hubballi main line. Similarly, 57.63 km was electrified in Rayadurga-Chitradurga. In addition, speed of trains had been increased from 100 kmph to 110 kmph on the mainline between Birur-Chikjajur section and from 60 kmph to 90 to 100 kmph on the branchlines of Amaravati-Kottur and Kadur-Chikkamagalur, said Mr. Agarwal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-division-of-swr-to-resume-additional-train-services/article34286622.ece
10 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||‘Innovation will drive the future’||A wave of innovation will sweep the world powered by big data and everything will be driven by automation, artificial intelligence and micro innovation. A lot of old jobs will go up in smoke and new ones of which nothing is known at present, will emerge. This was stated by K.K. Aggarwal, Chairman, National Board of Accreditation, here on Friday. He was speaking at the 3rd annual convocation of the JSS Science and Technology University in which 1,363 students were eligible to receive various degrees including 873 students who completed their BE apart from 214 (M.Tech), 67 (MCA), 26 (MSc) and 183 students who qualified to receive their MBA degrees. Prof. Aggarwal said micro-innovation will be the new norm and the emerging trends will change the landscape of life and business. He said American writer Alvin Toffler spoke of 3 waves that included the agrarian economy, the industrial revolution and the information age. “We are stepping into the fourth which is the giant storm of innovation.” Organisations in the next few years will have employees who are scattered across the physical locations but are connected by computers, smart phones and other devices via the internet. The future of the work is going to be collaborative effort and the work will shift to smaller clusters. Citing a study by Capgemini Research Institute, Prof.Agarwal said emotional intelligence will be among the ‘’must have’’ skills in the next few years and said that there will be a demand for it which will grow six-fold in response to the growth of artificial intelligence and automation. Indian executives also believe that the demand for emotional intelligence skills will increase 8.3 fold in the next 3 to 5 years. Siddaramaiah, Acting Vice-Chancellor, said the courses are demand driven at JSS STU and 1,528 students have already enrolled for various programmes in 2020-21 alone. The PhD enrolment has increased to 250. The varsity has also introduced a couple of new PG and short-term certificate programmes focusing on the industrial and business demands. He said the varsity has also received QS-I Gauge’s Gold rating underlining the quality of education imparted by it. Twelve students received gold medals for their performance in the BE programme, 13 students from MTech courses, 1 from MCA and MSc (Chemistry) and 3 from MBA. Endowment medals were also awarded on the occasion. Shivaratri Deshikendra Swamiji, Chancellor of the varsity, C.G. Betsurmath, Executive Secretary, JSS Mahavidyapeetha, and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/innovation-will-drive-the-future/article34286744.ece
10 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Vaccination coverage on the upswing||Mysuru district is leading in the State after Bengaluru in terms of vaccination coverage. The coverage, especially in the last few days, rose markedly with eligible persons thronging the immunisation sites for the jabs. As on Friday, over 3 lakh had been vaccinated, and the highest number of immunised were persons above 60 years. With the State planning to hold ‘Vaccination Utsav’ or ‘Lasike Utsava’ from April 11, the authorities in Mysuru are gearing up for the task and hoping to motivate the targeted populations to volunteer for the jabs. Even among the category of persons aged above 60 years and 45 years and above, Mysuru district stands second after Bengaluru in vaccination coverage. As on Friday, a total of 1,58,669 persons above 60 years had been vaccinated while 84,265 people above 45 years of age had received the vaccine. The district administration had set the target of vaccinating at least 20,000 people daily, supplying adequate stocks of vaccine doses. As many as 260 vaccination sites have been functioning since last Monday, to meet the target. On Friday alone, 31423 persons were vaccinated. The highest number of shots received was in T. Narsipur taluk at 4,335. In Mysuru city, 3,445 persons got the shots on Friday. Private hospitals The rise in coverage is also being attributed to the expansion of vaccination sites with more number of private hospitals and nursing homes joining the ‘Mission Vaccination’, helping the district administration in the battle, providing space in their premises for carrying out free vaccination. Nearly 30 hospitals associated with ‘MAHAN’ were handling vaccination tasks since the past few days. A senior health official said, “One of the reasons for many eligible persons volunteering for the jabs in the recent days after a lukewarm response initially is the spurt in cases here. The COVID-19 spike is driving them to protect themselves by getting the vaccine doses, thereby expanding the coverage.” The health authorities are working out the logistics for carrying out the ‘vaccination utsav’ from April 11 to 14. It has to be seen whether the sites of vaccination would go up further for giving the shots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccination-coverage-on-the-upswing/article34286747.ece

10 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Notice to Srirampura GP over sale of cigarettes||During a drive against violations of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003, the Mysuru District Tobacco Control cell chanced upon a shop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products in front of a reputed college in Srirampura, on the outskirts of Mysuru. Though the cell routinely books and penalises shops for selling cigarettes and other tobacco products within 100 metres of educational institutions, this shop, found violating Section 6B of COTPA in front of the college on Wednesday, belonged to Srirampura Gram Panchayat, which had given the shop on rent. The Tobacco Control Cell, while warning the shopkeeper against selling cigarettes and other tobacco products in the area, has issued a notice to the Panchayat Development Officer (PDO) of Srirampura Gram Panchayat. The cell levied penalties on 34 other shops and premises on the day for violating provisions of COTPA and collected a fine of Rs. 3,900 on Wednesday. According to representatives of the cell, the State government, with a view of enforcing COTPA, had appointed the deputy secretaries of all zilla panchayats as nodal officers while giving all the PDOs a target of booking at least 20 cases of COTPA violation in a month. Among other things, COTPA deals with smoking in public places, sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products within a radius of 100 metres of educational institutions, the sale of cigarettes to minors, advertisements promoting cigarettes and other tobacco products, and other rules related to labelling and packaging. However, the Mysuru District Tobacco Control Cell noted huge laxity in the implementation of the Government Order on booking COTPA cases by PDOs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/notice-to-srirampura-gp-over-sale-of-cigarettes/article34286626.ece

These units are mainly into garbage segregation and recycling, smelting and dyeing. They allegedly dump waste in the river and also set some of it on fire on its banks. This not only adds to the pollution, but is a health hazard for residents of the two villages, said locals.    The Hindu had reported one such fire on March 24. “Even on Friday morning, hours before the meeting, there was a large fire along the river bank, mostly garbage set on fire,” said Rakesh Kumar, resident of a nearby gated community. “They bring solid waste (which is mostly plastic and e-waste) from the city and burn or dump the rejected waste in the river after segregation. This happens almost four times a week and typically in the cover of the darkness between 7 p.m. and 2 a.m. Constant inhaling of this smoke has been causing severe lung-related diseases and burning of the eyes,” claimed residents in a statement issued on Friday. They alleged that untreated chemical waste is being dumped in the river, leaving an unbearable stench, all night. “This contaminates local aquifers feeding the local population. Farmers downstream use the contaminated water to produce vegetables, which find their way back to our plates,” the statement said. Residents have been running from pillar to post for over two years with their problems. “We have approached the Lokayukta, police and even the National Green Tribunal. Till date, we have been able to shut down only one unit,” Mr. Kumar said. Asha Raju, president, Kumbalgodu Grama Panchayat, said eviction notices have been served to all erring units and she would visit the spot on April 17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/eviction-notices-to-units-polluting-river/article34287057.ece

It is for expert bodies like the University Grants Commission to arrive at such a finding, said the Karnataka High Court. A division bench comprising Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty made these observations while allowing an appeal filed by the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) challenging a September 2020 verdict of a single judge bench. The single bench had directed the BWSSB to consider the applications filed by the petitioner – Ambarish Kumar S. – and other candidates possessing BE degree for the posts of Assistants/Clerks. The single bench had said that BE is ‘equivalent to a degree in science’ when the qualification prescribed for the posts was ‘a decree in Arts/Commerce/Science from a recognised university along with a one-year course in computer basics’. However, the division bench, citing judgments of the apex court, said that the employer is entitled to prescribe the qualifications as a condition of eligibility, and there is no part of the role or function of judicial review to expand upon the ambit of the prescribed qualifications. The equivalence of a qualification and whether a particular qualification should or should not be regarded as equivalent is not a matter which can be determined in exercise of the power of judicial review but is a matter for the State as the recruiting authority, the division bench said while setting aside the single judge bench’s order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/courts-are-not-experts-on-degrees-says-hc/article34287055.ece

Ranjith Kumar, told The Hindu . 64 islents ‘Kuruvadweep,’ a string of 64 islets spread over 1.47 sq km, is situated near Pakkom in the estuary of the Mananthavady River and the Panamaram river, the tributaries of the Kabani, and has a unique biodiversity-rich ecosystem with a collection of rare flora and fauna, Mr. Ranjith Kumar said. As the islets are a repository of unique plants and micro-organisms, the entry of visitors has been permitted to only 20 hectares of one of the islets. The islets are a safe haven for thousands of migratory birds and butterflies. River crossing on bamboo raft is another attraction of the destination and two new bamboo rafts have been constructed for the purpose, T. Sasikumar, Range Forest Officer of Chethalayath Forest Range, said. There are two ticket counters functioning at Pakkom and Palvelichom for tourists and ferry services are available at both the counters. The Pakkom counter is under the Forest Department and the other is being managed by the Kuruva DMC. The destination would be open from 9.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. An entry fee of Rs. 98 would be charged for an adult and Rs. 55 for a student, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kuruva-islands-open-for-tourists-today/article34286671.ece

Sudhakaran said Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) should be imposed in the killing of Mansoor, a Muslim Youth League activist, at Peringathur recently. Otherwise, Mr. Sudhakaran told media, the Congress would move court. He said the police not imposing UAPA was an indication of bias. There was no hope of getting justice from the police. Criminal negligence by the police had helped many leaders go scot-free in the T.P. Chandrasekharan case, he said. “Except for two, everyone in the 15-member team investigating the Mansoor case are CPI(M) supporters,” he said. Mr. Sudhakaran demanded that an investigation should be carried out by an impartial IPS officer, which would help bring out the ‘conspiracy behind the murder.’ Despite identifying 10 of the accused, no one had been arrested so far. The only arrested person was caught by the local people. He said there was a conspiracy behind the murder. One hour before the murder, a threatening message was posted on social media. Mr. Sudhakaran said Panoli Valsan, a CPI(M) district secretariat member had hatched the conspiracy. He also suspected the role of Akash Thillankeri, an accused in the murder of YC worker Shuhaib, in Mansoor murder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/impose-uapa-k-sudhakaran/article34286726.ece

10 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||SWTD ferry crew getting used to new catamaran vessels||One of the two catamaran ferries that were withdrawn from service soon after their launch here in February has commenced service on the Ernakulam-Vypeen-Fort Kochi route. The modern ferry was put to trial runs and kept in standby to be put in operation in case any of the five old vessels in service was withdrawn. They were withdrawn for installing fans, grab handles, and a few other additions, in accordance with suggestions made by people’s representatives and others to improve the quality of service and to reduce heat within. Crew members who are familiar with single-hull ferries also had to get acclimatised with double-hull vessels, which have an engine extra and can commute at almost double the speed of the existing ferries, State Water Transport Department (SWTD) officials said. The fit and finish and ride quality of the fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) catamaran vessels are far superior to those of the erstwhile steel boats. At Rs. 1.90 crore a piece, they also command over double the price tag of single-hull, single-engine ferries that operate in the region. Kannan V.M., a syrank who drove the vessel, spoke of how it commuted at an average speed of over seven knots (one knot is 1.80 km) per hour, as compared to less than five knots speed of older ferries, for reasons including availability of twin engines and better design. “Fuel and oil levels, speed, depth of waterbody, angle at which a boat commutes, and a whole lot of other features can be gauged from half-a-dozen display panels that adorn the driver cabin. Leakage in any of the compartments of the hull too can be gauged from the displays,” he said. The robust vessel also has sliding doors on the side, unlike doors with hinges which impinge on space available for entry and exit. Keeping the emergency door in the front open lets in extra air into the passenger cabin. The five wide windshield glasses considerably improve the operator’s view of the front and both sides. This is crucial, especially when the vessel is berthing at jetties, said the vessel’s driver Ansar P.K. The SWTD has placed orders with Praga Marine, a boat builder at Aroor, which built the first pair, for five more catamaran ferries for operation in Ernakulam. They are expected to roll out one vessel every 45 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/swtd-ferry-crew-getting-used-to-new-catamaran-vessels/article34287179.ece
10 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Vaccination to be ramped up in district||The district administration will ramp up both vaccination and testing to deal with the spike in COVID-19 cases. Daily testing will be increased to 12,000 samples, while the administration has set the vaccination target at around 30,000 doses daily. Testing will be intensified among people arriving from abroad and from other States. The decision was taken at a meeting of health officials with District Collector S. Suhas to evaluate the COVID-19 situation in Ernakulam. Health officials are anticipating a surge in the coming weeks. The district has already started witnessing a spike, not just in cases, but also in the number of ICU admissions in the past one week. In an online briefing, the Collector said that test positivity rate (TPR) had risen from 5.5% on Thursday to 7.2% on Friday. “In the past two weeks, the TPR and active cases have grown in a manner that is worrisome. A two-pronged strategy of increasing testing and vaccination will be followed,” he said. The spread of infection is clearly visible in Thrikkakara, where the situation is nearly out of control, Mr. Suhas said. There are 173 active cases in Thrikkakara. A worrisome fact is that 2.24 persons per 1,000 people are infected with COVID in the area, which is the highest figure in the district. This is followed by the Kochi Corporation area, which has 0.92 cases per 1,000 people, and 698 active cases. The Kalamassery Municipality comes third, he said. With regard to vaccination, the Varapuzha model (where nearly all senior citizens have been vaccinated) will be replicated in other local bodies. Eligible persons will be identified in each ward for vaccination. Vaccination camps will be held at workplaces with more than 50 employees. The district has a population of around 11 lakh people over 45 years and of them, around 3 lakh have taken the shot. While most people had remained asymptomatic earlier, the number of symptomatic cases is now on the rise, with 54.6% patients now showing symptoms. The ICU occupancy for COVID-19 is 33.6% (84 out of 250 ICU beds are occupied), while 25 out of 149 ventilators are in use. “If the number of cases grows at this rate, next week we could see an average of 700 to 800 cases daily. COVID protocol must be followed. Otherwise, the situation will worsen, and ICUs and ventilators could overflow,” Mr. Suhas said. The 100-bed COVID facility at the Aluva District Hospital will begin functioning fully next week. “We will inform local bodies that they will have to be prepared to restart first- and second-line treatment centres,” said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. Thrikkakara Municipal Chairperson Ajita Thankappan said a meeting of councillors, ASHA workers, and Kudumbashree members was held on Friday to discuss the situation. Surveillance will be increased in the area, and two additional vaccination camps will begin functioning from Monday onwards, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccination-to-be-ramped-up-in-district/article34287189.ece

Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) is carrying out renovation work on the Greater Cochin Development Authority-owned Marine Drive stretch that extends from near the first Goshree bridge on the northern end to the southern end of the walkway that abuts Subhash Bose Park. The walkway from High Court Junction up to the Goshree bridge has been fully renovated, and tiles laid around 10 years ago by the GCDA replaced with new ones. “Altogether, we have completed over 70% of works, and the rest will be completed by April-end,” official sources said. CSML has, in the meantime, requested the Kochi Corporation to provide a link with the waterfront walkway of Subhash Bose Park and beyond up to Rajendra Maidan, so that visitors to the Marine Drive can walk all the way up to DH Ground on the southern side and up to Mangalavanam on the northern side. This is part of the initiative to link green corridors located in the city’s western end, it is learnt. Stench, littering The three iconic bridges on the walkway — those resembling kettuvallom, rainbow, and Chinese fishing net — are popular photo shoot locales. Even as the renovation of the walkway is getting over, the GCDA and other government agencies have done little to clean the backwaters off the Marine Drive. The unbearable stench emanating from them and the market canal has been a matter of grave concern for the past few decades. The Kochi Corporation is under fire for not cleaning the walkway, despite heaps of garbage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/efforts-on-to-link-green-spaces-to-walkways/article34287183.ece
10 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Fissures in Cong. in Thripunithura out in the open||Fissures within the Congress in Thripunithura that had rumbled below the surface for long have come out in the open. The United Democratic Front (UDF) Assembly constituency committee that met on Thursday for post-election stocktaking unanimously passed a resolution demanding the ouster of Congress ‘I’ faction leader A.B. Sabu on disciplinary grounds. The meeting, attended among others by UDF candidate from Thripunithura K. Babu, accused Mr. Sabu of having sabotaged the UDF’s prospects during the campaign. “He held two press conferences, the latest just two days before the election, painting Mr. Babu as corrupt and declaring the contest to be between the BJP and the LDF. We even have voice clips of his phone calls campaigning against us. We will move the resolution before the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), which will issue notice to him,” said Babu Antony, chairman, UDF Thripunithura Assembly constituency committee. KPCC working president K.V. Thomas, however, said that he was not aware of the developments. Mr. Sabu, on his part, has countered the move accusing Mr. Babu of helping the LDF State leadership raise the spectre of vote trade between the BJP and the Congress by publicly staking claim to BJP votes. “That led to the consolidation of minority votes further damaging the prospects of the UDF. If anything, action should be taken against the UDF candidate,” said Mr. Sabu who is about to move an official complaint before the KPCC against Mr. Babu. When Mr. Babu’s candidature looked imminent, Mr. Sabu had publicly stated that the candidate being considered was corrupt and hence incompatible with the guidelines of the KPCC and the All India Congress Committee (AICC). Aspirant Congress sources said that Mr. Sabu had been aspiring to contest from Thripunithura for long but had failed to break through Mr. Babu’s vice-like grip on local party machinery, which rose in revolt for him, forcing the party to field him. “The fact is that he [Sabu] might still have been denied even if Mr. Babu was not to contest, as former Mayor Soumini Jain was the front runner in such an event. Though he owes his allegiance to the ‘I’ faction, no senior leader is out there to fight his battle,” party insider sources said. It fleetingly appeared that Mr. Sabu might eventually get the opportunity when ahead of the 2016 Assembly election, then KPCC chief V.M. Sudheeran had said that tainted persons should not contest. But eventually, Mr. Babu prevailed though he lost the election. Poster campaign The rumblings in the Congress emerged just hours after the BJP had to clarify that the poster campaign against its municipal committee member in Thripunithura and a former Congressman Muraleedharan S.J. for allegedly being in cahoots with his former party during the campaign was baseless.  He [A.B. Sabu] held two press conferences painting Mr. Babu as corrupt and declaring the contest to be between the BJP and the LDF.

10 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||CB registering FIR created an unprecedented crisis: ED||The State Crime Branch, according to Enforcement Directorate (ED), has created an unprecedented crisis by booking an FIR against the official of the ED. The ED has raised serious allegations against the Crime Branch in a rejoinder filed before the Kerala High Court in the case filed by the ED Deputy Director P. Radhakrishnan seeking to quash the FIR registered against him. Referring to a reported complaint of Sandeep Nair, an accused in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, that the ED had forced him to name several prominent persons in the case, the agency said the petition to the Ernakulam District and Sessions Judge was leaked to the media and circulated through some WhatsApp groups with ulterior motives. Banking on the media reports, one person mailed a complaint to the State Police Chief, which was forwarded to the ADGP (Crimes). The ADGP in turn ordered the registration of FIR against the investigation officer of the gold smuggling case. The registration of FIR was an abuse of the process of law. It was a vexatious attempt to interfere with the statutory functions of the ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the agency submitted. The FIR was registered to interfere with the administration of justice. The State Crime Branch was trying to intimidate the officers of ED and conduct investigation against the evidence collected by the ED in the gold smuggling case. The Crime Branch was attempting to mislead the investigation by fabricating evidence, the agency submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cb-registering-fir-created-an-unprecedented-crisis-ed/article34286724.ece

10 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||After online onslaught, a dance challenge||Who would have thought that the effervescent and peppy number Rasputin by acclaimed Europe-based pop band Boney M would hold centrestage oceans apart here in the tiny State of Kerala, 41 years after it first had music lovers hooked. The less-than-a-minute-long dance by two students of the Thrissur Medical College — Janaki Omkumar and Naveen Razak — performed for fun to the tune of the global hit number from the 1978-album “Nightflight to Venus” has done just that. The jig that had since gone viral on social media has brought the youngsters both bouquets and brickbats, fanning communal and political passions. Lawyer’s post The controversy over the performance hogged media limelight after a lawyer made a Facebook post drawing attention to the religious background of the girl and the boy who hail from two different communities. This has sparked an impassioned debate on social media for and against the youngsters who have fended off the alleged communal barbs hurled at them. Now, in a show of solidarity with the youngsters, the Students Federation of India (SFI) unit of the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) has come up with an online dance challenge. In an obvious dig at the lawyer who had allegedly made the post, the event has been titled “Entho Panthikedundu” (something is fishy). “The event is to express our solidarity with the youngsters and fight the communal and fascist forces that are attacking them,” said Abhinav Krishna, SFI unit committee member. The organisers have invited dance entries less than a minute long, both solo and duo, performed to the same Rasputin number. Entries till April 14 Entries will be accepted till April 14, and the winners will be announced two days later. “We have already started getting entries and will upload them on the Instagram handle of the SFI Cusat unit. We are trying to reach out to both the youngsters and get them to announce the winners,” said Mr. Krishna. The most liked performance on social media will be awarded so as the best performers to be adjudged by a jury. Initially, a single cash award of Rs. 1,500 was announced though the possibility of enhancing the cash prize is being explored now that sponsors have come forward appreciating the spirit of the event (@sficusat). Not to be left behind, the medical students network of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also announced ‘The Rasputin Challenge’, an Instagram-based short dance video competition in solidarity with the young medical students. Entries have already been invited, and the most-liked video from among those uploaded to the Instagram handle will be awarded with cash award (ima_msn_kerala).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-dance-challenge-against-social-media-onslaught/article34287180.ece

In an additional statement filed before the court, the EC said the Ministry of Law and Justice felt that if the elections were held as per the original schedule, it “may not reflect the will of the people”. The Ministry’s view was communicated on March 3, the eve of the issuance of the notification for the election. It felt that if the Rajya Sabha election was held on April 12, 2021 the popular will that was recorded in the ballot box following the Assembly election held on April 6 may not be reflected, it submitted. The EC filed the additional statement in the petitions filed by the Secretary of the Kerala Legislative Assembly and S. Sharma, MLA, challenging its decision to postpone the election. A senior advocate, an expert in constitutional and electoral laws, advised the commission that it would be “constitutionally just and proper that the new Assembly, whose elections are being held and the polling would conclude on 6 April 2021, which is before the expiry of the term of three members of Rajya Sabha from the State of Kerala, should constitute the electoral college for filling the three vacancies”, it submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rs-polls-put-off-on-centres-advice-ec/article34286722.ece

Since the declaration of the Assembly elections, such faceless profiles on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have been on overdrive spreading political animosity, fake news, and insulting comments. Apart from malicious content, gory pictures and distorted videos are doing the rounds upsetting social harmony. Social media managers of various youth organisations claim that even mass reporting of such unhealthy accounts happen only in very few cases as people are not really concerned of its impact without severe punishment. “Though the northern Kerala region Cyberdome in the city is equipped to track creators of such profiles, the absence of genuine petitions, where complainants can produce digital evidence, is affecting the whole worth of the service,” says a senior civil police officer who worked with the hi-tech crime inquiry cell. According to sources with the cyber cell, tracking the creator of fake profiles who usually make use of virtual private network is a time-consuming affair and is mostly done in serious cases. Many a time, admins of popular social media networks do not cooperate with the inquiry in cases that do not involve national security, women’s safety and children’s well being. “Many petitions are awaiting action which dissuade the public from filing fresh petitions.

10 April 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||No trust in probe officers, says IUML||The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has expressed distrust in the police officers investigating the murder of Youth League activist Mansoor at Koothuparamba on the polling day. IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty said here on Friday that they would not trust in the investigating team that owed allegiance to and takes orders from the CPI(M). “We want an impartial investigation at least by an officer of the IPS rank who has not submitted their credentials to any party, particularly the CPI(M),” Mr. Kunhalikutty said. He said that a UDF team led by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala would visit Koothuparamba on Saturday. “We will take a proper decision about our future course of action after meeting in Kannur on Saturday,” Mr. Kunhalikutty said. The IUML leader said that Mansoor’s was not a mere political killing. “It was done with careful planning and with clear ill motive. There was conspiracy behind the killing ,” Mr. Kunhalikutty said. He said the IUML and the UDF would go any extent to ensure that the victim and his bereaved family get justice. “It was high time that the CPI(M) stopped its killing spree. Mansoor’s is the latest in the CPI(M)’s barbaric murders. It looks like the CPI(M) is not going to end its killing culture. The people of Kerala should give a serious thought about it,” he said. “The ruling party does not give any value to human lives.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-trust-in-probe-officers-says-iuml/article34286734.ece

Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Trilok Kothari said on Friday that there was no crowding of passengers either on trains or at railway stations. Mr. Kothari said about 90% of the train services were reintroduced as special services. He said 138 train services were reintroduced in Palakkad division. “All of them are running as express or mail special with reserved accommodation to ensure adequate social distancing,” he said. Thermal scanning He said that Palakkad division was considering reintroduction of thermal scanning of passengers as part of a new drive to control the spread of COVID-19. Mr. Kothari said Railways continued to insist that all passengers wear masks during train travel. Railways have stopped issuing platform tickets to prevent crowding at stations. ‘Sanitised regularly’ Mr. Kothari said all railway stations, coaches, circulating areas at the stations and workplaces were being sanitised regularly. He said the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination was given to the Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel. “We are giving priority to the division’s frontline staff in vaccination,” he said. Additional Divisional Railway Manager C.T. Sakkeer Hussain and Senior Divisional Commercial Manager Jerin G.

The Rural police have launched a man-hunt for the perpetrators on the basis of a complaint submitted by Maharashtra native Sampath at the Mangalapuram police station. According to the complaint, Sampath and his driver Arun came under attack near the Technocity around 8.15 p.m. The incident occurred when they were on their way to deliver the gold ornaments from a jewellery outlet in Neyyattinkara to another in Attingal. Chilli powder hurled Their car was purportedly blocked by the gang, allegedly numbering around 10 people, who had intercepted them in two cars. After breaking the car wind-shield, the gang allegedly hurled chilli powder on them before slashing Sampath’s hand with a machete and stealing his gold. Arun, who was attacked, was dragged into a car and later abandoned near a temple some kilometres away, the complaint said. While the complainant also alleged that his relative, Lakshmana, was missing since the incident, the police was yet to ascertain the veracity of the claim. While both Sampath and Arun were questioned late into the night, the car has been taken into custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/armed-gang-attack-rob-jewellery-shop-owner/article34287280.ece
10 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Neyyar water project: KWA floats new tender||The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) has floated a fresh tender for constructing a water treatment plant (WTP) at Neyyar for the 120 million litres a day (mld) water supply project, an initiative that has been hounded by delays. The KWA had issued orders on March 30 scrapping the initial contract for the Rs. 60 crore project awarded to a city-based firm. In its attempt to revive the Neyyar project, the State-run water utility is hoping to make up for lost time. ''When the initial contract was awarded in 2019, the condition was that the WTP should be completed in 18 months. This time, work will be carried out day and night in three shifts so that the plant will be ready in 12 months,'' a senior KWA official said. The water supply project envisages supply of 100 mld to the city areas and 20 mld to four adjoining panchayats. If the initial plan had worked, the plant would have been commissioned in March this year. However, the COVID-19 outbreak last year, the consequent lockdown and ownership disputes over the land identified for the WTP threw a spanner in the KWA schedule. The inordinate delay prompted the contractor to seek a renegotiation of prices, but the KWA declined, ultimately leading to the cancellation of the contract. Dispute over site The contract involves the construction of a WTP that employs plate settler technology (lamella clarifier), a floating water intake structure, raw water pumping main, a submerged centrifugal pump set, an electrical substation building and installation of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The WTP will come up on a different site in the same neighbourhood as disputes over the original one remain unresolved. New bids Soon, bids will also be invited anew for the construction of a water transmission main from Neyyar to the ground-level storage reservoir at PTP Nagar, a distance of 23.8 km, KWA officials said. This work constitutes the second integral component of the project. The KWA had cancelled the contract awarded to an Erode-based company on the grounds that the latter failed to execute the agreement with KWA.  If the initial plan had worked, the water treatment plant would have been commissioned in March this year||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/neyyar-water-project-kwa-floats-new-tender/article34287287.ece
10 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||5,063 new cases of COVID-19 in State||Kerala’s COVID-19 case graph is climbing relentlessly, adding over 700 new cases on a daily basis. Though the second wave was expected to be rising in the State by April last week, two weeks after the heat and dust of the Assembly polls, it certainly looks like the graph is already on an upswing. While the State Health administration has expressed its confidence that intensive containment and preventive measures and an aggressive vaccination drive in the next three weeks can reduce the pace of disease transmission, it is certainly a race against time and one in which the virus has the upper hand, public health experts said. Much faster The fact that the test positivity rate in the State, which was hovering between 5-6% since the past three days, has shot up to 8.01% on Friday, indicates that the pace of disease transmission is much faster and intense in the second wave. On Friday, the State reported 5,063 new cases of COVID-19, when 63,240 samples were tested in the past 24 hours. The active case pool of the State is growing rapidly and now has 36,185 patients. There were 2,475 recoveries reported. Hospital admissions are also rising at an alarming pace, adding close to 200 patients on a daily basis. The addition of 22 new deaths took the State’s cumulative COVID toll till date to 4,750 deaths. Palakkad and Kollam reported four deaths each, Ernakulam and Kannur three each, Alappuzha, Thrissur and Kozhikode two each, while one death each was reported from Wayanad and Kasaragod. The number of critically ill COVID patients in the State who are currently being treated in ICUs in various hospitals in the State is 551 on Friday. Among districts, Kozhikode reported the maximum number of new cases with 715 cases, Ernakulam 607, Kannur 478, Thiruvananthapuram 422, Kottayam 417, Thrissur 414, Malappuram 359, Kollam 260, Pathanamthitta 259, Palakkad 252, Kasaragod 247, Idukki 246, Alappuzha 235 and Wayanad 152 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/5063-new-cases-of-covid-19-in-state/article34286731.ece
10 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||New genus of freshwater crab discovered in Ghats||Researchers have come across a new genus of freshwater crab with two new species from the Western Ghats region in Idukki district. The genus has been named Rajathelphusa after Rajakumari, the place where the specimens were spotted. The discovery has been published in the latest issue of Zoological Studies by Smrithy Raj and A. Biju Kumar of the Department of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries, University of Kerala, and Prof. Peter Ng, head, Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, National University of Singapore, an authority on crabs. The two new species in the genus have been christened Rajathelphusa ala and Rajathelphusa muni . With their discovery, the number of freshwater crab species found in the Kerala part of the Western Ghats has risen to 39 and endemic species to 20, Prof. Biju Kumar, who heads the Department of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries, explained. ‘Ala’ alludes to the rock shelters used by the tribal people in the region, while ‘muni’ is Malayalam for hermit. Near rivers Both crab species — they are small enough to fit in the hand of an adult human — live in burrows near rivers. Rajathelphusa is endemic to Idukki, the researchers said.  Rajathelphusa ala is distinguished by a dark brown carapace with light brown chelipeds — the appendage with the claw — and ambulatory legs. Rajathelphusa muni has a reddish-brown carapace with yellowish-brown chelipeds and ambulatory legs. “The monsoonal climate of India is particularly suitable for terrestrial forest crabs such as Rajathelphusa , which need to keep their gills moist at all times. Their high carapaces allow them to have larger gill chambers that contain more water to help them respire, even during the dry season,” Prof Ng was quoted in a statement. Fifty-nine species of freshwater crabs in the family Gecarcinucidae have been reported from the Western Ghats. They, however, remain poorly studied as many parts of the Ghats have not been surveyed for freshwater crabs, Prof. Biju Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-genus-of-freshwater-crab-found-in-ghats/article34286664.ece

The Museum police have registered two cases against a field promoter and a senior clerk of the department on charges of siphoning off lakhs of money meant for beneficiaries into their personal accounts. The accused have been identified as senior clerk U.R. Rahul and field promoter Sangeetha. Comes to light by chance According to the Museum Circle Inspector, the investigation, which is still in a preliminary stage, has revealed fund embezzlement in the period from the second half of 2020 onwards. The fraudulent activity came to light by chance when the parent of a potential beneficiary, who was denied the funds, found out later that the money was collected using the child’s records but diverted into the field promoter’s account. Police said that when the parent submitted the application for funds to construct a study room for the first child, it was denied by the SC promoter. When the parent came back after some months to submit a similar application for the second child, it was revealed that funds were collected in the first application.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/funds-embezzlement-unearthed-in-sc-dept/article34287281.ece

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Horror genre freshened up by science||With almost all the possible horror themes that could scare people nearing exhaustion, it is left to scriptwriters and filmmakers to mine fresh ideas that could give the chills to the viewers. Those who keep an eye around themselves, absorbing in all the changes, could still come up with something that feels contemporary and that could make people think, suspending disbelief, that this could happen to them too. In Chathur Mukham , smartphones and even selfies become sources of horror, helping it connect immediately to a large section of the audience. Convincing But merely making these ubiquitous things part of the narrative would not be enough. It needs to be backed by scenarios that are convincing and a plot that is organic, both of which are achieved by the filmmaker duo of Ranjeet Kamala Sankar and Salil V., and the scriptwriter duo of Abhayakumar K. and Anil Kurian. Thejaswini (Manju Warrier) is a social media addict, who keeps updating images from her daily life constantly online. After she loses her smartphone, she decides to buy a new one from an online store. Mysterious events begin to take place after the phone arrives. Along with her friend Antony (Sunny Wayne), with whom she is running a struggling CCTV camera business, she seeks the help of Clement (Alencier), a science enthusiast who is sceptical of anything that does not have a rational explanation. The gist of the plot or even the trailer might give one an impression of a run-of-the-mill horror movie, yet the makers have stored quite a few surprises within, peppered at regular intervals. There is often an attempt to provide a scientific explanation for the happenings on the screen, with some of the characters even poking fun or dismissing the traditional Malayalam horror movie ingredients of black magic and exorcism. Yet, the script does not fully dismiss the supernatural elements, which are very much part of the plot, but coated with a thin veneer of scientific reasoning. Some of these horror elements might appear over-the-top, but these are treated in a much more controlled manner. The relationships Thejaswini is not portrayed as a damsel in distress, but as someone who leads the fight from the front. The strained relationship with her brother, and how the mysterious events make her have a relook at it forms an interesting, but under-explored tangent. The script also treats her friendship with Antony in a mature manner, refusing to fall for the compulsion to turn it into a relationship.  Chathur Mukham might score lower on the scare-quotient part, but it makes up for the same with the novelty and believability of some of the plot points. Considering its branding as a ‘techno-horror’, it lives up almost fully to the ‘techno’ part of it, and partly to the ‘horror’ part of it, a fact which the faint-hearted might be thankful for. S.R.

Both the districts are left with stocks enough for just two days. ‘Private hospitals deactivated’ “More than 50% of the private hospitals, which were authorised to handle the vaccination programme, have been deactivated in the last four days as the stock of Covaxin ran dry, and the stock of Covishield is enough to last two days,” District Medical and Health Officer Y. Kameswara Prasad has said. The district has so far immunised 2.50 lakh frontline workers and citizen above 45 years. “Several private hospitals have been turning away people who are approaching them either for the first dose or the second dose of the vaccine. About 25 out of 46 private hospitals enlisted for the purpose have been deactivated,” says the DMHO. “All those who have taken the first dose of Covishield are being advised to take the second jab only after 42 days instead of 28 days earlier. As per the advise of the ICMR, the second shot can be taken between the 42nd day and 56th day,” says Dr. Prasad. In Anantapur district, there are 13,000 doses of vaccine available with the DMHO office, while another tranche of 15,000 doses is arriving by Friday night, he says. On Friday, Anantapur MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy took the jab at the Government General Hospital in Anantapur, and hoped that sufficient stocks would be sent by the Central Government to meet the rising demand. Kurnool District Immunisation Officer said they had been vaccinating between 10,000 and 15,000 persons a day since April 1, and that the district was left with just two days of supplies. The district too is expecting fresh stocks by Friday night via Kadapa. The district has so far vaccinated 2,62,523 persons (till April 8). District Medical and Health Officer Rama Giddaiah said that 30 out of 54 private hospitals had been deactivated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/acute-shortage-of-doses-hits-anantapur-kurnool-districts/article34287235.ece

Last year, the highest single day spike was 5,121 cases on October 8. On March 1, Bengaluru reported 210 cases. Karnataka reported a record 7,955 new cases and 46 deaths. A day after “night corona curfew” was imposed between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. from April 10 to April 20 in seven urban centres, experts said measures should have been tougher and curfew hours begun from 8 p.m.  Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) member Giridhar R. Babu argued that curfews and lockdowns should be the last option. “Weekend lockdown and night curfew have a limited role in reducing the speed of transmission. However, it will create a sense of responsibility among people,” he said. The test positivity rate for the day stood at 5.88%. Also, 1,35,163 tests were conducted in 24 hours, including 1,27,933 RT-PCR tests. Karnataka has vaccinated 55,09,096 people. On Friday, 1,12,653 senior citizens and 1,60,306 above 45 years took the jab, while 13,356 and 3,625 persons in these categories respectively took the second dose. Kerala’s health authorities were confident of containment and aggressive prevention bringing down cases, but the TPR, hovering between 5-6% for the past three days, shot up to 8.01% on Friday. On Friday, the State reported 5,063 new cases from 63,240 samples. Hospital admissions were rising, adding close to 200 patients on a daily basis. Twenty-two more deaths were recorded.

10 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chittoor runs out of vaccines as cases shoot up||The alarming rise in the COVID-19 cases in what is considered the second wave, coupled with the stock of vaccines running dry, is unnerving the people and officials as well in Chittoor district. On Friday, the number of new infections was 496 in the district, the highest in the State and also the highest since September last. While half of the new cases were reported from the limits of the Tirupati Municipal Corporation and its surrounding areas, the rapid rise in their number in the eastern mandals – from Satyavedu to Nagari – was a cause for concern. The temple town of Srikalahasti, which had taken the brunt during April-July last, reported 12 cases on the day. The spike in cases was seen in 56 out of 66 mandals in the district. In this backdrop, the eligible people (those above 45 years with comorbidities and senior citizens), who till a month ago had been reluctant to get themselves vaccinated, were increasingly coming forward to take the shot fearing that the vaccine stock would soon exhaust. Meanwhile, a senior officer in the District Medical and Health Office confirmed that the entire stock of vaccines ran dry on Friday. In spite of the District Collector’s insistence on expediting the vaccination drive on the one hand and tackling the new cases and tracing the primary and secondary contacts on the other, things have not been moving as expected, allegedly due to lack of coordination among the COVID task force teams in various municipalities and mandal headquarters. The field staff of the Medical and Health wing have reportedly expressed their difficulty in handling the new cases. “Several senior citizens who had missed the vaccination when the election campaign was at its peak are descending on the vaccination centres now. But, they are forced to return without taking the jab,” according to a medical officer in the Madanapalle division. Meanwhile, District Collector Hari Narayanan inspected the district headquarters hospital here and instructed the officials to take steps to create facilities for the COVID-19 patients. “All the staff should work in coordination as there is a need to build confidence among the people that we are well prepared to tackle the pandemic,” the Collector said. Later, in a teleconference with the district and mandal-level officials, he reviewed the arrangements for the special vaccination drive scheduled from April 11 to 14. ‘Stock has arrived’ Meanwhile, COVID Vaccination Drive special officer M. Sireesha told The Hindu that a stock of 20,000 doses of vaccine had arrived in Chittoor district on Friday evening. “There is nothing to worry. We are going to get additional stocks soon,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chittoor-runs-out-of-vaccines-as-cases-shoot-up/article34287238.ece
10 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||State struggles to cope with severe shortage of vaccines||Barely a week after Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy launched the mass vaccination drive in ward/village secretariats, the State is staring at a severe shortage of vaccines. According to data, there were only 1.38 lakh Covaxin doses and 3.06 lakh Covishield as on April 6, leading to fresh concerns about their availability. While Mr. Jagan had already flagged the concerns at a high-level meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Minister for Health Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas told reporters that about 2 lakh doses of vaccines would arrive by Saturday and another set of doses in the week to come. Dubious distinction Andhra Pradesh is among the highly infected States with a positivity ratio of 5.98, behind Kerala (8.46) and Maharashtra (15.10), but the concerns about the vaccine shortage amid a spurt in the number of cases is alarming. According to data gleaned from CoWIN portal (April 6), the vaccine coverage was 26.70 lakh for Covishield and 6 lakh for Covaxin. The supply was 28.30 lakh for Covishield and 7.07 lakh for Covaxin, while the wastage was 5.66% for Covishield and 15.08% for Covaxin. Fresh concerns of vaccine shortage at the time of second dose vaccination is fuelling anxiety. While 28.17 lakh beneficiaries have been vaccinated with first dose, just 4.52 lakh beneficiaries have taken the second dose. Chittoor leads in administering the first dose to 2.82 lakh people, followed by East Godavari (2.79 lakh doses), while Vizianagaram is the least to vaccinate 1.19 lakh. But the real concern is the low rate of coverage for the most vulnerable group of those above 60 years. Out of the target of vaccinating 51.02 lakh people, just 11.71 lakh senior citizens received the first dose, while 18,333 people have been given the second dose. The vaccine coverage is just about 22% in the category. The vaccine coverage in the next vulnerable group (45 to 60 years) is not encouraging either. Of the target of vaccinating 82.05 lakh people, just 7.83 lakh people have been given the first dose, while 9,027 people got the second dose, and the vaccine coverage is just about 9%. The vaccine coverage of frontline workers on the other hand is encouraging with 58.63%. In Vijayawada Many hospitals in Vijayawada are reporting shortage of vaccine since the last few days even as the number of positive cases is steadily rising. A couple of private hospitals said the vaccine might not be available till April 15 and replenishments were awaited. People in need of vaccination are being turned away for the time being.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-struggles-to-cope-with-situation/article34286465.ece
10 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||COVID casts shadow on tobacco auctions||The talk of an imminent second wave of COVID-19 has cast its shadow on the auctions of the Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco. Major industry players have been shying away from the auctions that have begun on a sedate note in the second week of March. As of April 6, 2021, tobacco weighing 8.26 million kg was marketed in the three regions of the Northern Light Soil (0.91 million kg), Southern Black Soil (3.55 million kg) and Southern Light Soil (3.81 million kg). It was worse during the corresponding period in 2020, when about 4 million kg had been marketed before auctions were called off due to the lockdown. The targeted quantity to be marketed for 2021 is 115 million kg. What is worrying the farmers is the recalcitrant attitude of the major players, who are reluctant to take part in the auctions citing lack of good quality, uncertainty in exports and manufacturing activity. If the trend continues, millions of farmers producing the low and medium grades of tobacco and ancillary workers will be the worst-affected. In 2020, the Government of Andhra Pradesh had bailed out the farmers by pressing the AP Markfed to buy the low and medium grade varieties. But, is it necessary for the government to intervene in the tobacco auctions time and again, while the major players, who sit on huge reserves, continue to turn a deaf ear to the pleas of the farmers? This is a question that is in the minds of the farmer associations and organisations working for the welfare of the farmers. ‘FDI needed’ “What is urgently needed is Foreign Direct Investment in tobacco trade and industry. I cant understand why the Union Government is sitting on the recommendations made by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to this effect,” observes former MP and honorary president of the Virginia Tobacco Growers’ Association Y. Sivaji.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-casts-shadow-on-tobacco-auctions/article34287239.ece
10 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Naidu spreading lies on Amma Vodi, Nadu-Nedu’||Education Minister A. Suresh has accused TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu of spreading false information during his election campaign on the Jagananna Amma Vodi scheme and Nadu-Nedu works in schools. Addressing the media at the district party office in Ongole on Friday, Mr. Suresh, while showing the newspaper clippings on the poor condition of government schools in Kuppam constituency and other areas in Chittoor district during the tenure of the TDP government, said that this was proof of how the previous government had neglected the education sector. The Minister said the State government was revamping the schools under the ‘Manabadi - Nadu Nedu’ programme in three phases. A total of 15,715 schools had been renovated at a cost of Rs. 3,700 crore in first phase, he said. The government had spent nearly Rs. 315 crore for revamping 1,533 schools in Chittoor district alone, he said, and added that 121 schools were given a facelift at a cost of Rs. 30 crore in Mr. Naidu’s Kuppam constituency in the first phase. Showing the photographs of the renovated Government High School in Kuppam and Sanganapalli, the Minister asked Mr. Naidu to inspect the schools himself. The Amma Vodi scheme was launched to ensure that no student dropped out of school because of poverty, he said, and added that Mr. Naidu would never understand the purpose of the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-spreading-lies-on-amma-vodi-nadu-nedu/article34287211.ece

Presently, irrigation authorities are supplying 2,660 cusecs per day to the crops being grown in the Rabi season in the entire Godavari delta in East Godavari district. In the central delta, a total of 38,441 hectares of land is under paddy cultivation. In the eastern delta, a total of 87,307 hectares of land is under the paddy cultivation. “At least 200 cusecs of irrigation water should be diverted from the eastern delta to the central delta as 15% of paddy harvesting has been completed in the eastern delta. The diversion of the irrigation water will save crops in the central delta where paddy sowing was delayed in the Rabi season,” said Mr. Viswaroop. The State government is yet to fix a date to stop the release of Godavari water from the Polavaram project site to begin the construction of the cofferdam. Mr. Viswaroop has also asked Agriculture Department Joint Director J.D.

10 April 2021||KHAMMAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sharmila to float a party in Telangana||Sharmila, daughter of former Chief Minister of erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh late Y S Rajasekhar Reddy, vowed to form a new political party on YSR’s birth anniversary on July 8, 2021. The name of the new political party and its agenda will be unveiled on the same day, she announced at a well-attended Sankalpa Sabha, a public meeting held in Khammam on Friday night. Training her guns at the ruling TRS party, she charged the persons at the helm with betraying the faith of unemployed youth, farmers and aspirations of people of Telangana. The self-esteem of people of Telangana is being crushed under the feet of Doras (rulers), she alleged, adding that Telangana earned the dubious distinction of witnessing more than 6,000 farmers’ suicides, the second highest in the country. Distressed over the failure of the TRS regime to fill up the vacant jobs, several unemployed youths committed suicide in the recent weeks, she flayed. ‘Hunger strike’ “We will organise a three-day hunger strike in Hyderabad from April 18 to press for immediate filling up of 1.91 lakh vacant posts,” Ms Sharmila said urging unemployed youth to desist from taking extreme decisions. Accompanied by her mother Vijayamma and scores of admirers of YSR on the dais, she extolled YSR as a visionary leader who implemented a plethora of path-breaking welfare and development schemes during his five year stint at the helm in the old undivided Andhra Pradesh. On this day in 2003, my father embarked on a historic padayatra from Chevella that concluded in Ichachapuram covering a distance of 1470 km, she recalled, saying the Sankalpa Sabha will herald a new change on the political horizon of Telangana, empowering masses with power to question the misrule of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) dispensation. A new political party is the need of the hour as the Congress has become an "agent" in the hands of the TRS and the BJP is not in a position to raise its voice as its government at the Centre failed to set up railway coach factory in Kazipet, turmeric yard in Nizamabad district, she said, reaffirming to usher in Rajanna Rajyam (pro-poor and welfare regime) in Telangana. Invoking "YSR's legacy', Vijayamma sought the blessings of people of Telangana to her daughter Ms Sharmila in her endeavour to serve Telangana. YSR’s name will remain etched in the memory of Telugu people owing to his path-breaking welfare initiatives, she said amid thunderous applause from the gathering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sharmila-to-launch-party-in-telangana/article34286439.ece

He asked the DMHO to camp at Adoni till normalcy was restored in the region. Food poisoning suspected Five new cases were reported on Thursday, even as the officials were trying to find out the cause for the large number of GE cases. Preliminary reports suggest food poisoning due to the prasadam consumed at a religious gathering as the reason. Mr. Srinivas wanted that two ambulances be kept ready at the Urban Health Centre and in the colony so that needy persons could be shifted to the GGH in Kurnool for better treatment.

10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Will end trial once Italy pays Rs. 10 cr.’||The Supreme Court on Friday said it would order the closure of criminal proceedings against the two Italian marines accused of killing fishermen off the coast of Kerala only after Italy paid Rs. 10 crore as compensation to the victims’ families. Earlier in the hearing, both the Centre and Kerala informed a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde that the families had “happily” agreed to the compensation. This amount was over and above the ex gratia amount Italy had paid them earlier. “The trial court do not have the authority to close the proceedings. The trial can be closed only by the Supreme Court,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted for the government. The court directed that Italy should transfer the compensation to an account number which would be handed over to it by the Ministry of External Affairs. The Ministry would in turn deposit the money with the court. The SC would directly disburse the compensation to the families. The court has fixed a hearing date for Friday next, by which time the money should be deposited in the court. It was Kerala which raised the point that the compensation should be deposited with the Supreme Court before the closure of thetrials. “We have consulted with the families and they have agreed [to the compensation and closure of criminal trial in India]... But the money should be deposited in the Supreme Court before the proceedings are quashed,” senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, for the Kerala government, said.  Advocate Suhail Dutt, for Italy, said his client was “waiting for the MEA to give an account number ... we will transfer the money”. The marines, Salvatore Girone and Massimiliano Latorre, were detailed on ship Enrica Lexie when they allegedly shot the fishermen thinking they were “pirates” in 2012. The marines, who are in Italy now, will face criminal investigation there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/will-end-trial-once-italy-pays-rs-10-cr/article34286423.ece

Nagi Reddy urged the Centre to make available all types of fertilizers at affordable rates . Mr. Nagi Reddy said that farmers were finding it increasingly difficult to do farming in the wake of increasing prices of inputs on one hand and absence of remunerative price for their produce on the other. “It is unfortunate that the prices of almost all crops are falling below even the Minimum Support Price (MSP) fixed by the Centre, which has remained a mute spectator to unfair practices by big corporate agri-marketing firms,” Mr. Nagi Reddy said. He added that the decontrolling of the prices of fertilizers other than urea has come as a big blow to farmers, he said, adding that the fertilizer firms had only agreed to sell only the old stocks at low rates. Mr. Nagi Reddy said the Centre’s direction to fertilizer companies to not hike the maximum retail price (MRP) of non-urea fertilizers was unlikely to give much relief to farmers as now was not the farming season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-urged-to-make-fertilizers-affordable/article34286473.ece

10 April 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||If Puducherry can get SCS, why not A.P., asks TDP||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MPs, during their campaign for the Tirupati Lok Sabha byelection, took potshots at the BJP-led Union government and the YSRCP government in the State over the Special Category Status (SCS) issue. Lok Sabha members Jayadev Galla, K. Rammohan Naidu and Rajya Sabha member K. Ravi Kumar, during a meeting organised as part of the campaign here on Friday, they questioned the YSRCP for its ‘prolonged silence’ in both the houses of Parliament on the SCS that was promised to the State in the run-up to the bifurcation. “The BJP has denied SCS to Andhra Pradesh, but promised the same to Puducherry during its campaign for the elections,” said Mr. Galla said, adding that the if party candidate Panabaka Lakshmi is elected, it would give the much-needed boost to the TDP in the Parliament to question the Centre. Mr. Rammohan Naidu wondered as to how could the BJP, after claiming the SCS issue to be a ‘closed chapter’ for Andhra Pradesh, promise the same to Puducherry. He also sought to know why the YSRCP MPs had been silent over the issue in the Parliament.  Accusing the YSRCP government of violating norms and throwing the minimum decorum to wind by ‘misusing the official machinery and vilifying all constitutional bodies such as election commission, opposition parties and public representatives’, Mr. Ravi Kumar asked why the ruling party was not showing a similar aggressiveness while taking up the issues pertaining to the State against the Centre. Ms. Panabaka Lakshmi lamented at the ‘lack of progress of several Central projects’. She blamed it on the ‘inability of the YSRCP government to bargain in favour of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/if-puducherry-can-get-scs-why-not-ap-asks-tdp/article34286478.ece

Lakshman on Friday said that it was distancing the ruling party from the people. Addressing the media as part of his campaign for the Tirupati Lok Sabha byelection, Mr. Lakshman claimed that the people, who had given an overwhelming mandate to the YSRCP two years ago, were dejected as the party had started commanding the administrative set-up by appointing the ‘yes men’ in revenue, police and other departments. “It is nothing but the a mockery of democracy,” said Mr. Lakshman.

10 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘No motive behind stopping benefit shows of Pawan film’||Refuting the BJP’s claim that permission has been denied for the benefit shows of Pawan Kalyan’s film Vakeel Saab , the YSRCP has said that there is no political motive behind it. “It has been done as per regulations and to check escalation of ticket price,” Minister for Information and Public Relations Perni Venkataramaiah has said. “There is no connection between the Tirupati bypoll and the film, as movies will in no way influence the outcome of the election,” he told the media in Tirupati on Friday. Mr. Venkataramaiah criticised the BJP leaders for alleging that the benefit shows were stopped as the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was afraid of Mr. Pawan Kalyan. The government denied permission as tickets of Rs. 150 were sought to be sold for Rs. 1,000 in the name of benefit shows. The A.P. Cinematography Act allowed only four shows per day starting 11 a.m, he said. “Why will people vote for the BJP? Will they vote for putting the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant for sale, or for failing to fulfil the bifurcation promises, or for betraying the State on Special Category Status?” he asked. Recalling Mr. Pawan Kalyan’s criticism of the BJP leaders during the 2019 elections, the Minister questioned what prompted the two parties to bury their differences, and the reason for the BJP declaring the JSP chief as its Chief Ministerial candidate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-motive-behind-stopping-benefit-shows-of-pawan-film/article34287247.ece

The government may not be able to come out of the crisis in the near future,” he said. In a statement on Friday, the former Finance Minister said the Centre’s directions on capital expenditure and borrowings showed the pathetic position of the finances. “The Centre will review the capital expenditure every quarter. It will leave no leverage to the State. It will have to follow the advice. Else, it will attract an embargo on inflow of finances from the Centre and financial institutions,” he said. The per capita income was 15% during the TDP rule, which slipped to 1.03% now, he said. There was a continuous double-digit growth for five years during the TDP term, he added. This was brought down to a single digit now. “There is a slide in the GSDP as well. Inefficiency, inexperience, corruption, have impacted the State.

He said the court had made several observations asking managements not to put students and parents to inconvenience, and said the latter should follow them scrupulously. School managements should not insist on payment of the entire fee at once, should not stop students from attending online or physical classes even if they have not paid their fee, should not withhold exam results and be sympathetic towards students who are unable to pay their fees, Mr. Reddy said. Mr. Reddy said any violation would amount to contempt of court and the Commission would not spare such managements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/schools-told-to-follow-court-order-on-fees/article34287245.ece

10 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||New civic body adopts unanimous resolution against VSP privatisation||The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) council passed a unanimous resolution to stop privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), here on Friday. This was the first resolution passed by the new council which was formed after the recently held Urban Local Body (ULB) elections in March 2021. Corporators of various political parties, including the YSR Congress Party, Telugu Desam Party (TDP), CPI, CPI(M), Jana Sena Party and independents, have agreed to pass the resolution after Mayor G. Hari Venkata Kumari brought the issue before the council members. The Mayor said that the resolution would be forwarded to the State government. Speaking on the issue, MP M.V.V. Satyanarayana said that the YSRCP has conducted number of agitations and met Central Ministers on the issue. Supporting the council’s resolution, he said that the party would continue its fight against VSP privatisation. Gajuwaka MLA T. Nagi Reddy and CPI(M) corporator from Ward No. 78 B. Ganga Rao hailed the decision. Earlier TDP leader and corporator from 67th ward, P Srinivasa Rao, and a few others questioned the members of YSRCP, why no resolution is passed in the Assembly yet. The TDP leaders also suggested the YSRCP leaders to take a leaf out of agitation for Telangana and said that resignation of MPs is the only way left to stop privatisation. There were heated arguments between the members of TDP and YSRCP, when Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath, an ex-officio member, said that their party does not sing different tunes “one in Delhi and another in the gully”. He said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had met members of various unions during his recent visit to Visakhapatnam. As soon as the Assembly session begins, their party would pass a resolution, he added. Meanwhile, members of the Left parties, Jana Sena and the TDP urged the Mayor to organise question hour in the council meet. A few members also said that the council should oppose the decision to sell government lands in Visakhapatnam. 10-point agenda A 10-point agenda was placed before the council members. Among them include utilisation of services of 38 community guards at beach areas, facelift of Mudasarlova park at a cost of Rs. 50 crore, to control pollution under the National Clean Air Programme, construction of urban Primary Health Centre (PHC) at Thatichetpalem, additional supply of street lights (LED) to the city, action plan for supply of drinking water during this summer, budget allocations for garbage transport vehicles and a few others. The proposal for utilisation of services of 38 community guards at beach areas was put on hold as some of the corporators questioned about the skills of the guards. JSP leader P.L.V. Murthy Yadav suggested that the Tourism Department should bear the salaries and other expenses of the community guards, instead of the GVMC. Visakhapatnam (South) MLA Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar said that the district administration should appoint the youth from the fishermen community as community guards. A few corporators demanded that the GVMC appoint guards at Yarada, Meghadrigedda and other beaches also. The council approved the proposals of giving wages to NMR workers in Anakapalle zone, setting up PHC at Thatichetpalem after the GVMC announced that the project would be taken up under the National Health Mission (NHM). The proposal for additional supply of street lights was also put on hold, as several corporators complained of non-functioning of street lights at their respective wards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gvmc-meet-opposes-move-to-privatise-steel-plant/article34287259.ece

Sarma, has taken strong exception to the way in which the AP Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) has issued an E-Tender for ‘Working of Calcite Mining Lease’ of 8.725 hectares at Nimmalapadu village in Ananthagiri mandal in Visakhapatnam district, on ‘Raising-cum-sale contract basis’. In a letter to the Chief Secretary, he stated that the APMDC has no right to unilaterally issue such a notification and it was in gross violation of the provisions embedded in the Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA) and the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act (FRA). Speaking to The Hindu , he said that both the Acts are applicable to the Nimmalapadu village, as it lies within the notified Scheduled Area of Visakhapatnam district. According to him, in the Scheduled Areas, as per the provisions of PESA, the question whether any mineral should be extracted and, if so, by whom, should be discussed first by the local adivasi Gram Sabha. Such a prior discussion had not apparently taken place, he alleged. Even under the FRA, it is necessary that the individual and community rights to the land and the forest resources should be subject to prior discussion by the local adivasi Gram Sabha, which appears to have been bypassed, he added. As such, the e-tender notice is patently illegal and liable to be set aside, he said. The Samata Judgement and the judgement in the case of bauxite mining by Vedanta in the scheduled area of Odisha, holds good in this case also, said Mr. Sarma. It is learnt that a local tribal cooperative has approached the AP High Court to obtain a stay on the e-tender. A few years ago, the same tribal cooperative had approached the government for lease for mining and was denied.  Both FESA and FRA are applicable to Nimmalapadu as it lies within the notified Scheduled Area of the district||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/eas-sarma-faults-issue-of-calcite-mining-tender-by-apmdc/article34287363.ece

The relay hunger strike, being organised under the aegis of the committee, continued for the eight day on Friday. Some of the participants had to be carried to the venue of the protest. Addressing the participants, Insurance Corporation Employees Union divisional secretary N. Ramanachalam has called upon the gathering to stand united against privatisation of the VSP and other public sector units. He said that PSUs not only provide jobs to differently-abled and socially disadvantaged sections of society but also extend various facilities to them, to enable them to do justice to their jobs. On the contrary, the private sector has no place for them as its sole motto was profits, he said. Handing over PSUs to corporate groups would deprive these sections of their right to employment and push them into the dark. This necessitates the need to protect PSUs and prevent privatisation of banks, insurance, oil and defence sectors by unitedly opposing the policies of the Union government. National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled (NPRD) State president Koduru Appala Naidu, district secretary B. Nookappa Rao and president K. Appalaswamy Naiduand Y. Raju were among those who attended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/differently-abled-join-protest-against-privatisation-of-steel-plant/article34287356.ece

Special focus has been laid on the border mandals and the industrial belt of the district frequented by a large number of trucks carrying various goods, industrial raw materials and products from different States, sources said. Collector M.V. Reddy has instructed mandal level officials to ensure strict adherence of the COVID-19 safety protocols by industries, function halls and all other business establishments and invoke the provisions of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897, against the violators. As part of efforts to increase vaccine coverage, the daily target for administering the vaccine has been set at around 1,000 doses, including 375 in the District Headquarters Hospital, 250 in Bhadrachalam Area Hospital, 250 in the CHSs, and 125 in the PHCs. In adherence to the “test, track, treat” approach, the authorities have made COVID-19 testing facilities available in all 29 PHCs and all major State-run health facilities besides the designated centres in a few private hospitals, sources in the health department said. However, the fresh surge in cases in the neighbouring States and slight increase in the daily case count in the district with a long inter-State border brought into focus the urgent need for strengthening screening and treatment services across the district.

Of the total, 504 TDRs worth Rs. 1,128 crore have been issued for road widening projects, 115 TDRs worth Rs. 263 crore for SRDP, 83 worth Rs. 1,124 crore for development of link roads, 65 TDRs worth Rs. 539 crore for removal of encroachments in water bodies, and 40 TDRs worth Rs. 41 crore for nala widening project. The policy of issuing TDRs in lieu of compensation was initiated in 2006 as part of the Revised Common Building Rules. Transferable Development Rights are issued as a percentage of the area of the property forgone for civic infrastructure. These rights may be used, sold or transferred for construction of additional floors over and above permissible limits at the same location or elsewhere. Initially, the amount of TDRs issued were 100% of the area for Master Plan road widening, 50% for protection of lakes, water bodies and heritage buildings. In 2012, the extent was increased to 200% for Master Plan road widening, 100% for lakes/water bodies, and heritage buildings. After introduction of the new Land Acquisition Act which had doubled the compensation payable in instances of property acquisition for public utilities, the GHMC was left struggling with the compensation component in relation to all its developmental projects. In order to encourage more people to opt for TDRs instead of compensation, the Telangana government has enhanced the extent of TDRs once again in 2017.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/record-tdrs-issued-by-civic-body/article34287153.ece
10 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||All civic employees in State to be vaccinated||Director of Municipal Administration (DMA) N. Satyanarayana on Friday has informed that the entire municipal workforce across the 141 urban local bodies (ULBs) in Telangana would be vaccinated within the next three days starting from Saturday by Telugu New Year ‘Ugadi’. After participating in a video-conference with the municipal commissioners in the presence of Municipal Administration Secretary Arvind Kumar, he informed that while there were 29,522 staff on the rolls, about 10,930 of them had either already received the first vaccination dose or in some cases both the doses. The target is to vaccinate 18,935 municipal personnel with the available vaccine in the respective municipalities. “We will make use of the available vaccination facilities in the towns mostly. Wherever the number of personnel to be vaccinated will be more than 100, we will have special rooms with proper medicare and drinking water facilities for the post-vaccination observation,” he said. Adilabad, Warangal, Khammam, Peerzadiguda, Bandlaguda, Nizampet, Karimanagar, Nalgonda and Miryalaguda ULBs are likely to have these special vaccination facilities since the number of employees is considerably more when compared to other municipalities. Contract municipal personnel too would be vaccinated, he said. Early Bird Mr. Satyanarayana also urged the property owners in ULBs to make use of the five % rebate by paying the property tax for the current financial year of 21-22 by the month-end including during notified public holidays and Sundays under the ‘early bird scheme’. In a notification, he informed citizens can pay the tax without waiting for the official bill to be issued or the demand notice to be raised. The need to make the citizens aware of the facility has become imperative as just 7,996 owners had made use of the scheme whereas there were as many as 13,57,973 property owners in the 141 urban local bodies. Revenue collection has been about Rs. 2.68 crore this month when the overall demand is closer to Rs. 450 crore for the financial year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/all-civic-employees-in-state-to-be-vaccinated/article34287163.ece

10 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Why is CM silent on TRS MLAs involved in drug case?’||Telangana Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has questioned the moral right of the government to seek votes when Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao doesn’t speak a word against a Minister threatening realtors for money, MLAs figuring in drugs cases and illegal mining, and a ZP chairperson accused in the murder of High Court lawyers. Speaking to reporters here along with AICC spokesperson, Dasoju Sravan, he said it was disgraceful that the CM was silent on such illegal activities when he claims his government to be corruption-free. Instead of being responsible and answerable CM is taking the state people for granted, he alleged. The Nalgonda MP said the CM is silent when Labour Minister Ch. Malla Reddy was openly caught on tape extorting money from real estate dealers and also when four TRS MLAs names cropped up in drugs case unearthed by the Bengaluru police. CM is also unmoved when Peddapalli ZP Chairperson Putta Madhu is accused in the daylight murder of High Court lawyers in Manthani. Similarly, several news reports have been published on Thungaturthy MLA Gyadari Kishore Kumar’s involvement in illegal sand mining. He demanded that the four MLAs be disqualified immediately for their alleged involvement in the drugs scandal. He reminded that the Benguluru police have recorded the statement of a prominent businessman who said that four MLAs of TRS were involved. He also sought the dismissal of Mr. Malla Reddy from the Cabinet. Mr. Reddy said the BJP president, Bandi Sanjay was silent on TRS MLAs involvement in the drugs case and alleged that maybe he has settled the case with the help of the BJP government in Karnataka. “If BJP has not colluded with the TRS, why it is not bringing pressure on the Karnataka government to take up action on the four MLAs.” Mr. Reddy said the CM was confident of ignoring these allegations as he feels elections can be won pumping money and misusing machinery. This pure arrogance that money can win elections should be rejected by voters in Nagarjunasagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-cm-silent-on-mlas-drug-case/article34287169.ece

10 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Take available vaccine: Kishan||Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy has urged eligible people of 45 years and above to take whatever vaccine was available — Covishield of Serum Institute or Covaxin of Bharat Biotech — without any hesitation, instead of demanding either of them, as both have been cleared by the regulatory authorities as being safe and effective against COVID. The Minister disclosed that he himself had been administered Covishield whereas Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been given Covaxin. “Both vaccines are giving excellent results, so there should not be any doubts in the minds of people. Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech too, have been ramping up production to vaccinate all the people of the country on a priority,” he told the media on Friday after visiting the vaccination ward at Gandhi Hospital. “Mr. Modi has permitted export of the vaccines to just 58 countries though the demand is from several other countries as it is necessary to take care of the needs of the country first. Since it is not possible to vaccinate the entire population of ours at once, a schedule has been prepared,” he explained. “The vaccination centre here has been placed in an isolated corner for the safety of people,” he added. Mr. Reddy appealed for cooperation and participation from citizens to tide over the second wave of COVID. “Governments alone cannot win the battle against coronavirus. Unless the common public join hands, it will be very difficult to overcome the current dire situation,” he said. He cautioned people to continue to practise safety rules like wearing mask, washing hands frequently and social distancing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/take-available-vaccine-kishan/article34287146.ece

10 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High Court sets aside order suspending HCA Ombudsman appointment||Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao of Telangana High Court had set aside a lower court order suspending appointment of retired judge of Supreme Court Justice Deepak Varma as Ombudsman-cum-Ethics Officer of Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA). Pronouncing verdict in a Civil Revision Petition challenging the lower court order, the judge observed that HCA secretary Vijayanand and Budding Star Cricket Club (BSCC) secretary Syed Maavin Uddin wanted to delay the appointment of Ombudsman-cum-Ethics Officer. They also wanted “to embarrass Justice Deepak Varma”, the verdict said. In year 2020, BSCC filed a petition before City Civil Court Additional Chief Judge challenging the appointment of Justice Deepak Varma as Ombudsman-cum-Ethics Officer by HCA. According to BSCC, HCA initiated process of Ombudsman appointment by writing a letter to Justice Deepak Varma on November 5, 2019. Two days later, Justice Deepak Varma gave his consent. HCA wrote to Justice Deepak Varma stating that the consent would be placed before HCA’s general body meeting for approval. BSCC filed the petition in the lower court seeking to declare the appointment illegal as it was in violation of rules of the HCA. BSCC also filed an interim application to suspend HCA’s Apex Council decision over Ombudsman appointment. The lower court passed an order suspending decision of the apex council. Questioning the lower court’s order, Charminar Cricket Club (CCC), which is also a member of HCA, moved the HC. The judgement said that HCA secretary agreed for the Ombudsman appointment in the apex council meeting held June 6, 2020. It was ratified by another meeting held on August 13, 2020. But he tried to sabotage the appointment by setting up BSCC to file a petition in lower court. Then he himself filed a counter affidavit in the petition agreeing with the contentions raised by BSCC, the verdict said. By using BSCC’s services, HCA secretary sabotaged SC’s decision to have Ombudsman. By misleading the lower court, an order was secured stalling Ombudsman’s appointment, the judge stated. The judge directed the BSCC and HCA secretary to pay Rs. 25,000 towards costs to CCC.  Internal Sabotage Filing of Original Petition itself is an abuse of process of Court. There is clear collusion between M/s Budding Star Cricket Club and M/s Hyderabad Cricket Association. Both of them did not come to court with clean hands. They suppressed facts. They wanted to delay appointment of Ombudsman and Ethics Officer and to embarrass former judge of Supreme Court Justice Deepak Varma||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-sets-aside-lower-court-order-suspending-appointment-of-ombudsman-by-hca/article34287159.ece

10 April 2021||GURUGRAM,||‘KMP E-way blockade to impact movement of 25,000 vehicles’||Farmer unions have advanced the 24-hour blockade of the 135-km-long Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway by three hours to start at 8 a.m. on Saturday. “Earlier, the blockade was to start at 11 a.m. on April 10, but we have rescheduled it to start at 8 a.m.,” said Inderjit Singh, vice-president, Haryana All-India Kisan Sabha. He said farmers in large numbers would hold sit-ins at all the eleven toll plazas on the highway and also put up tents, if required. “The farmer union activists would also be deployed at the entry points to the highway to ask commuters to avoid the road. Those who would already enter the highway, would be allowed to exit. Commuters stranded on the road will be given food and water by the protesters,” he said. Mr. Singh said the drastic increase in fertiliser prices, almost 60% for DAP, was like adding insult to injury for the struggling farmers. “It is yet another act that exposes the absurdity of doubling farmers’ income, often repeated by the Modi regime,” he added. The KMP Expressway, connecting Delhi-Ambala and Delhi-Agra highways, cuts through five districts of Haryana — Sonipat, Jhajjar, Gurugram, Nuh and Palwal. Vijay Tiwari, senior project manager, Path India, the toll collection agency for KMP, told The Hindu that 25,000 vehicles, a third of them commercial vehicles, used the road every day on an average. The blockade, he said, would cause an estimated loss of around Rs. 75 lakh. Traffic advisory The Haryana Police issued a traffic advisory during the day asking commuters to plan and modify their journey keeping the blockade in mind. Traffic diversions have been put in place by affected districts, including Panipat, Rohtak and Faridabad, said the advisory. Those coming from Chandigarh and headed towards Noida have been advised to go via Karnal and Shamli or Panipat and Sanauli. Similarly, vehicles headed towards Gurugram from Chandigarh can take NH 71-A at Panipat to travel via Gohana, Rohtak, Jhajjar and Rewari. In response to the appeal of Samyukta Morcha to block the KMP Expressway on Saturday, Bhartiya Kisan Union has decided to jam the entry point at Dasna in Ghaziabad. BKU national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, who will lead the protest at Dasna, appealed to the public not to use KMP on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/kmp-e-way-blockade-to-impact-movement-of-25000-vehicles/article34286758.ece

The Minister further added: “When foodgrains are being procured inside the mandis across the country, why does FCI have a problem only with Delhi? Farmers are fighting the MSP battle, they know how much they will be harassed after the implementation of the three farm laws.” Responding to the allegation, the FCI said they have opened procurement counters in Food Storage Depot (FSD) in Narela, which is only a few meters from the Narela mandi, and shared photos and videos of wheat procured. FCI’s rebuttal “FCI has opened up purchase centres at Najafgarh mandi, FSD in Narela, and FSD in Mayapuri, which are fully functional with effect from April 1. FSD Narela is adjacent to APMC Narela mandi, hardly few meters away from the main gate of the mandi and offers a more appropriate place for procurement for farmers,” FCI said in a statement. According to the FCI, it has procured 158 quintals of wheat at Minimum Support Price at FSD Narela procurement centre on April 6 and released the payment of Rs. 3.13 lakh directly to accounts of farmers within 24-48 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gopal-rai-has-exposed-lies-on-wheat-purchase/article34286704.ece

An NGT Bench said: “It is established on record that so far there has been serious failure of the authorities in performing their responsibility under [relevant rules] to effectuate the right of citizens to clean environment.” “Since the Tribunal has already monitored the failures of the authorities for sufficiently long time, the State must now take ownership of its basic responsibility in the interest of rule of law, protection of environment and public health. Having regard to serious past failures and sensitivity of the issue, Chief Secretary of Haryana may personally monitor compliance periodically,” the Bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ngt-raps-authorities-over-legacy-waste/article34286707.ece
10 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘Vaccine averts severe illness, not infection’||There have been cases of people, who have taken two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, testing positive, according to doctors. But doctors said that in such cases, people had only “mild symptoms”. According to experts, COVID-19 vaccine prevents “severe illness” and not an infection. Sumit Ray, Head of Department of Critical Care at Holy Family Hospital, said that the hospital has seen four to five such cases. “We have seen about four to five patients who after two doses of the vaccine and a 15-day period after it, have tested positive. But all of them were mild cases,” Dr. Ray said. Also, 37 doctors of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a private hospital in the city, have tested positive in the last 10 to 12 days, despite most of them taking two shots of the vaccine, said hospital officials. “All of them have mild symptoms and five of them are admitted at the hospital, while others are under home isolation. All of them are stable,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/vaccine-averts-severe-illness-not-infection/article34286705.ece

After the incident, accused Ravinder, a labourer, fled to Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh, from where he was arrested later, they said. On Sunday, victim Sonu (35) came to Ravinder’s house and asked for liquor. Ravinder stepped out to buy the same and when he returned home, he found Sonu “misbehaving” with his wife. This led to an argument between them. Sonu tried to flee but Ravinder followed and stopped him at a distance. Another argument ensued and he killed Sonu near Ram Ghat, according to the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/29-year-old-arrested-for-killing-friend/article34286706.ece

10 April 2021||London,||Britain’s Prince Philip passes away at 99||Prince Philip, the longest serving royal consort in British history who was a constant presence at Queen Elizabeth II’s side for decades, died on Friday aged 99, Buckingham Palace has announced. The death of the Duke of Edinburgh is a profound loss for the 94-year-old monarch, who once described him as her “strength and stay all these years”. Queen Elizabeth announced his passing “with deep sorrow” after he died peacefully in the morning at Windsor Castle, west of London, the palace said in a statement. “The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss,” the statement said. The outspoken former Navy commander devoted much of his life as the Queen’s husband to charity work — but was notorious for numerous gaffes, some of them causing offence. He was admitted to hospital on February 16, and went home after a month during which he was treated for a pre-existing heart condition and an infection. Flags lowered Announcing his passing, BBC television played the national anthem over a picture of Prince Philip in his prime, dressed in military dress uniform. Flags were lowered to half-mast on royal and government buildings and a notice announcing his death pinned to the gates of Buckingham Palace. “We give thanks, as a nation and a kingdom, for the extraordinary life and work of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said outside 10 Downing Street. Mr. Johnson said Prince Philip had “earned the affection of generations” at home, in the Commonwealth and across the world after first serving in the Royal Navy and then over nearly eight decades beside the queen. Tributes poured in from the U.S., Europe and Commonwealth countries including Australia, India and New Zealand. Condolences were also expressed by leaders in Ireland, where in 2011 the queen and Philip paid the first royal state visit for a century following generations of enmity with Britain. Prior to this year’s crisis over relations with the Queen’s grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the monarchy had to weather the 1997 death in a car crash of Prince Harry’s mother Princess Diana. The couple, who celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary in November, had been living largely in isolation at Windsor Castle, west of London, because their age put them at heightened risk from Covid-19. Prince Philip and the Queen — isolated in what they called “HMS Bubble” — received their first vaccinations against the virus in January. Prince Philip was no stranger to health issues. He was previously fitted with a stent in 2011 after suffering from a blocked artery. He also had a hip operation in 2018 and in January 2019, he emerged unscathed after his vehicle was involved in a traffic accident that injured two people near the monarch’s Sandringham estate in eastern England. Modi hails his career Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute on Friday to Prince Philip who visited the former British colony four times, not always helping to mend ties. Mr. Modi praised his “distinguished” military career. “My thoughts are with the British people and the Royal Family on the passing away of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,” Mr. Modi said on Twitter. “He had a distinguished career in the military and was at the forefront of many community service initiatives. May his soul rest in peace.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/britains-prince-philip-passes-away-at-99/article34286369.ece
10 April 2021||COLOMBO,||Jaffna Mayor arrested on charge of promoting LTTE ideology||Sri Lanka police’s Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) on Friday arrested the Mayor of Jaffna for allegedly promoting the LTTE’s ideology, in the choice of uniforms for an environment task force of the local municipal council. The move has drawn wide condemnation, including from the country's Tamil polity and civil society. Late on Friday, the Jaffna Magistrate’s Court released him on bail, on a surety bond, amid a growing backlash. In the early hours of Friday, police arrested the Jaffna Mayor Viswalingam Manivannan, in connection with the municipal body assigning light blue coloured uniforms to a newly set-up team tasked with monitoring environmental violations. Police likened their uniform to that worn by the “police force” run by the LTTE in areas that the rebel outfit controlled during the civil war. Police spokesman DIG Ajith Rohana said “promoting” symbols associated with the LTTE, including uniforms, was an offence under Sri Lanka’s Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), a law that activists deem draconian, and have been campaigning to repeal. Last month, the government expanded the ambit of the PTA, allowing the detention of anyone suspected of causing “acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony”. Authorities had indicated that the Mayor would be detained and charged under the PTA, but subsequently, the charges were framed under Sri Lanka’s penal code. Jaffna parliamentarian and senior lawyer M.A. Sumanthiran, with a team of 25 juniors, appeared for Mr. Manivannan. “We made submissions that the LTTE police force has not been there for over a decade, and that the government is seeing a ghost behind every bush,” he said.  Critical reactions Mr. Manivannan’s detention had triggered strong, critical reactions from within and outside Sri Lanka on social media. “We condemn the unjustifiable arrest of the Mayor of Jaffna Viswalingam Manivannan by the TID purportedly in connection with “the revival of the LTTE”. Most ludicrous claim, given that he only authorised a uniform that is very similar to the Traffic Wardens of the Colombo MC,” the Tamil National Alliance said in a tweet, pointing to law enforcement authorities’ apparent double standards. The Tamil National People’s Front said it “unreservedly condemns” the arrest of Mr. Manivannan by the TID and called for his immediate release. “The severe racial and political insecurities of this regime have reached such heights that a steady path towards fascism is inevitable,” its leaders and Jaffna district parliamentarian G.G. Ponnambalam said. Jaffna legislator and former Chief Minister of the Northern Provincial Council C.V. Wigneswaran said the arrest was based on “racism and fascism”. Writing on the development, political commentator and former diplomat Dayan Jayatilleke, a senior adviser to the Leader of Opposition, said “Myanmarisation may be under way” in Sri Lanka. “The arrest of the Jaffna Mayor over a non-violent alleged offence, actually a procedural or regulatory one if at all, gives the signal that there will be no autonomous space for the minorities even at the level of the smallest unit, namely the municipality, let alone the province,” he said. Colombo-based NGO Centre for Policy Alternatives said it was “deeply troubling” to see the government resort to criminal legislation such as the PTA, in order to stamp its authority over decentralised government entities and to detain an elected official on “tenuous grounds”. It further pointed to “deeply problematic” use of the PTA over decades to detain individuals for prolonged periods of time without charge and with limited due process safeguards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/jaffna-mayor-arrested-for-promoting-ltte-ideology/article34286372.ece
10 April 2021||New Delhi,||Bhutan, China to schedule boundary discussions soon||Bhutan and China have agreed to set up the next round of much-delayed boundary talks between them “as soon as possible” and discussed a roadmap for expediting the boundary resolution, a joint release of the 10th Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on the Bhutan-China Boundary held in Kunming announced on Friday. The upcoming talks, the 25th round of the boundary talks mechanism, will be the first since the Doklam standoff in 2017, and the first since China made new claims on Bhutan’s eastern boundary bordering Arunachal Pradesh in June 2020. “The EGM was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere, and held in-depth and fruitful discussions on the boundary issue in keeping with the close ties of friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and China,” a joint statement issued in Kunming at the end of talks between senior officials from April 6-9 said. “The two sides agreed to continue to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas pending a final settlement of the boundary issue,” it added, referring to the annual boundary talk mechanism that began in 1984, and was followed by two agreements on the maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the border areas in 1988 and 1998. Since then, 24 rounds of talks have been held, but there have been no talks scheduled since 2016, ostensibly due to tensions over the Doklam standoff between India and China over PLA transgressions in Bhutanese territory, and more recently due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The previous 9th round of the ECG was also held prior to the Doklam standoff, in April 2017 in Beijing. The talks have thus far focused on two areas of dispute: Pasamlung and Jakarlung valleys to the North of Bhutan and Doklam to the West of Bhutan, along the tri-junction with India. However, at a UN environmental meeting in June 2020, China raised an objection to a grant for Bhutan’s Sakteng Sanctuary to the East frontier as well, saying that it was disputed as well. In a rare public statement on the issue, the Bhutanese Embassy in Delhi, which handles relations with a number of countries including China, had said that “all disputed areas” would be discussed in the next round of boundary talks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bhutan-china-to-schedule-boundary-discussions-soon/article34286365.ece
10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||China, Pakistan to back each other’s ‘core interests’ at UN||China and Pakistan have pledged to back each other’s “core and major interests” in the United Nations after holding bilateral consultations on UN affairs. The countries, which describe their relationship officially as one of “all-weather partners” and “iron brothers”, have in recent months stepped in to provide crucial support to the other on issues they see as sensitive, with Beijing raising the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council and Islamabad backing China on Hong Kong and Xinjiang. The two sides on Thursday held the third round of consultations on UN affairs virtually, led by Yang Tao, Director-General of the Department of International Organisations and Conferences of China’s Foreign Ministry, and Usman Iqbal Jadoon, Director-General (United Nations) of Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, and with their permanent missions to the UN in New York and Geneva also participating. In a joint statement, the two countries said they would “firmly safeguard multilateralism and support the central role of the United Nations in international affairs.” This comes amid heightened Chinese criticism of what it calls United States-led “selective multilateralism”, aimed particularly at the India, U.S., Australia and Japan Quadrilateral framework, as well as the “rules-based order” advocated by the Quad. Peace and stability China and Pakistan also agreed to “strengthen their cooperation on the UN and other multilateral platforms and to support each other on each side's core and major interests, work toward the political and peaceful resolution of regional and international hotspot issues, and jointly safeguard peace and stability of the world, especially in Asia.” The statement said they would “continue to strengthen cooperation on counter-terrorism and peacekeeping in the UN framework, by addressing the issue of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations”. China has in the past stepped in on many instances to block the listing of Pakistani terrorists at the UNSC sanctions committee.. The statement added they would “consolidate strategic coordination in the field of human rights, jointly opposing double standards and the politicisation of human rights issues, and working for the promotion and protection of all human rights in a cooperative manner.” China in 2019 and 2020 raised the Kashmir issue at the UNSC on at least three occasions, calling for discussions in the wake of India’s dilution of Article 370, reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir and revocation of special status. Pakistan, meanwhile, has lobbied for China’s support amid increasing criticism from western countries over Xinjiang. In October, Pakistan also made a joint statement on behalf of 55 countries at the UN "opposing interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of Hong Kong."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-pakistan-to-back-each-others-core-interests-at-un/article34286364.ece

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||India does have a refugee problem||The heart-wrenching scenes of Myanmarese citizens, including little children — fleeing from a junta bent on killing its way into power in Myanmar — being turned away at the Indian border in the Northeast has once again revived the domestic debate about refugee protection in India. The current plight of the Myanmarese has been preceded by that of another group of Myanmarese, the Rohingya. And not too long ago, the debate was dominated by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and its impact on those seeking refuge in India, even though new refugees would not be benefited by the law since the cut-off year of the CAA is 2014. In any case, refugee flows to India are unlikely to end any time soon given the geopolitical, economic, ethnic and religious contexts of the region. There is, therefore, an urgent need today to clinically address the issue of refugee protection in India and put in place appropriate legal and institutional measures. Refugees versus immigrants India has emphatically argued over time, particularly in the recent past, that illegal immigration from the neighbouring countries to India must come to an end. There is little doubt that illegal immigration is a threat to the socio-political fabric of any country, including India, with potential security implications. And yet, in this growing debate about the sources and implications of illegal immigration into the country, the issue of refugees tends to get subsumed under it or at best relegated to the backburner, neither of which do justice to the helpless people fleeing from persecution at home. While the reality is that much of the debate in the country is about the illegal immigrants, not refugees, the two categories tend to get bunched together. And because we have jumbled up the two issues over time, our policies and remedies to deal with these issues suffer from a lack of clarity as well as policy utility. Ambiguity in the framework The main reason why our policies towards illegal immigrants and refugees is confused is because as per Indian law, both categories of people are viewed as one and the same and are covered under the Foreigners Act, 1946 (https://bit.ly/320UBiI) which offers a simple definition of a foreigner — “foreigner” means “a person who is not a citizen of India”. Needless to say that there are fundamental differences between illegal immigrants and refugees, but India is legally ill-equipped to deal with them separately due to a lack of legal provisions. Recall that India is not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention (https://bit.ly/2Qej4hF) and its 1967 Protocol (https://bit.ly/3d3nlNZ), the key legal documents pertaining to refugee protection. The absence of such a legal framework also leads to policy ambiguity whereby India’s refugee policy is guided primarily by ad hocism which, of course, often has its own ‘political utility’. Ad hoc measures enable the government in office to pick and choose ‘what kind’ of refugees it wants to admit for whatever political or geopolitical reasons, and what kind of refugees it wants to avoid giving shelter, for similar reasons. At the same time, the absence of a legal framework increases the possibility of the domestic politicisation of refugee protection and complicates its geopolitical faultlines. The absence of a clearly laid down refugee protection law also opens the door for geopolitical considerations while deciding to admit refugees or not. Consider the most recent case of Myanmarese refugees fleeing to India for protection from the junta at home. New Delhi’s concern is that if it takes a decision that irks the Generals in Naypyitaw, Beijing would get closer to the junta and use the opportunity to hurt India’s interests in Myanmar. This fear, at least partly, is what has prompted India’s decision not to admit the refugees. However, hypothetically speaking, if New Delhi had a domestic legislation regarding refugees, despite not being a signatory to the relevant international conventions, it could have tempered the expectations of the junta to return the fleeing Myanmarese.  Legal, moral complexities India, for the most part, has had a stellar record on the issue of refugee protection, a moral tradition that has come under great stress of late. New Delhi has been one of the largest recipients of refugees in the world in spite of not being a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. Whether or not India should be a party to these international legal instruments has been a matter of some debate in the country. A proper interpretation of the text of the 1951 Convention and the less-than-perfect western practice of refugee protection could lead one to conclude that a country like India, given its track record of refugee protection as well as a vulnerable geopolitical and socio-economic situation, need not unreservedly accede to the convention and the protocol in the way they currently stand. For one, as is often discussed in India, the definition of refugees in the 1951 convention only pertains to the violation of civil and political rights, but not economic rights, of individuals, for instance. Put differently, a person, under the definition of the convention, could be considered if he/she is deprived of political rights, but not if he/she is deprived of economic rights. If the violation of economic rights were to be included in the definition of a refugee, it would clearly pose a major burden on the developed world. On the other hand, however, this argument, if used in the South Asian context, could be a problematic proposition for India too. And yet, this lop-sidedness is something New Delhi has traditionally highlighted, and justifiably so, as a reason for its non-accession to the treaty. The West’s lopsided obsession with civil and political rights at the cost of economic rights is a convenient excuse with little moral backing. Second, as scholar B.S. Chimni has argued, “India should not accede to the 1951 convention at a time when the North is violating it in both letter and spirit… India should argue that their accession is conditional on the Western States rolling back the non-entrée (no entry) regime they have established over the past two decades. The non-entrée regime is constituted by a range of legal and administrative measures that include visa restrictions, carrier sanctions, interdictions, third safe-country rule, restrictive interpretations of the definition of ‘refugee’, withdrawal of social welfare benefits to asylum seekers, and widespread practices of detention.” In other words, India must use its exemplary, though less than perfect, history of refugee protection to begin a global conversation on the issue. Let us return to the Indian context. So if we have a refugee problem, as we do, and the accession to the refugee convention, in the manner it exists today, is neither desirable nor pragmatic, what other options do we have to respond to the refugee situation we are faced with and which is increasingly getting mixed up with the raging political debate on illegal immigration into the country? New domestic law needed The answer perhaps lies in a new domestic law aimed at refugees. The CAA, however, is not the answer to this problem primarily because of its deeply discriminatory nature: it is morally untenable to have a discriminatory law to address the concerns of refugees who are fleeing their home country due to such discrimination in the first place. More fundamentally, perhaps, the CAA is an act in refugee avoidance, not refugee protection. What is perhaps equally important is that such a domestic refugee law should allow for temporary shelter and work permit for refugees. This is crucial because in the absence of proper legal measures, refugee documentation, and work permit, refugees may end up becoming illegal immigrants using illicit means. Put differently, the absence of a refugee law incentivises illegal immigration into the country. New Delhi must also make a distinction between temporary migrant workers, illegal immigrants and refugees and deal with each of them differently through proper legal and institutional mechanisms. Our traditional practice of managing these issues with ambiguity and political expediency has become deeply counterproductive: It neither protects the refugees nor helps stop illegal immigration into the country.

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The world knew him as Periyar’s editor||Periyar E.V. Ramasamy was a great thinker and propagandist. To disseminate his ideas he established a series of publishing firms such as the Kudi Arasu Pathippagam, Pagutharivu Noorpathippu Kazhagam (modelled on the Rationalist Press Association of London) and the Periyar Self-Respect Propaganda Institution. Printed on flimsy paper with worn-out types, the price of the publications was kept low. In the near-daily meetings that he addressed, Periyar would urge the audience to buy these books. Often, his wife Maniammai herself would hawk them. The downside of this democratising zeal was that his ideas were scattered in booklets and pamphlets and unavailable for systematic study until V. Anaimuthu (1925-2021), who passed away on April 6, stepped in. Two years before Periyar’s death, Anaimuthu ( picture ) undertook the challenging task of compiling his writings. What Periyar wrote and spoke over a 50-year period lay dispersed as ephemeral publications. No library assembled the back volumes of his Kudi Arasu , Revolt and other journals. With no file copies of his own, Periyar himself had to issue notices asking for them from his committed party cadres. A project and its hurdles In January 1972, Anaimuthu issued the first notice about his plans to publish the collected writings of Periyar. A few months later, another advertisement sought to raise Rs. 1.5 lakh. Even as the project was under way, more than a year later, funds remained an issue. After acquiring copyright permission, Anaimuthu marshalled the voluminous source material. Periyar was greatly enthused by the project, and there were poignant moments especially when his emotional obituary to his wife Nagammal was read out to him. Months before his death he saw some printed formes, but not the final publication. Originally planned as two volumes, Periyar Ee.Ve.Ra. Chinthanaikal (Thoughts of Periyar E.V.R.) eventually appeared in three crown quarto-sized volumes. Thematically classified and chronologically arranged, it came with a good index. Running into over 2,000 pages, bound in black rexine, and embossed in gold letters, the volumes included photographs and facsimiles. Printed at the Kabeer Printing Works and published by the Chinthanaiyalar Kazhagam of Trichy (Thinkers’ Forum), Periyar Ee.Ve.Ra. Chinthanaikal remains a landmark in the pre-Desktop publishing (DTP) era of Tamil publishing. On July 1, 1974, six months after Periyar’s death, the volumes were formally launched. Anaimuthu’s travails did not end there. At Rs. 200 per set, the price was steep. The print run was a substantial 2,500 copies. Less than 200 subscriptions had been raised and the uptake by the government’s directorate of public libraries was a disappointing 300 sets. Binding being expensive, unbound printed formes lay at Anaimuthu’s house, and there was a real danger of termite attacks. It was some years later, during the Periyar centenary year, that 1,500 sets were acquired by public libraries. As it often happens, what at one point did not have takers, later became a collector’s item. As an oft-cited primary reference for subsequent scholarship on the Dravidian movement, there was new demand and second-hand copies were sold at a premium. Other contributions It was another 35 years before a greatly expanded second edition — 20 demy octavo volumes of about 10,000 pages — appeared. While Anaimuthu bravely confessed to earlier sins of omission and commission, the second edition was not as well organised, as has been pointed out by the scholar Pazha. Athiyaman. Like the first, the new edition too was launched by M. Karunanidhi even as a possible copyright issue hung over it like a sword of Damocles.. Publishing Periyar Ee.Ve. Ra. Chinthanaikal alone would have made any life worthwhile. But Anaimuthu had further claims to fame. In 1997, he unearthed and published Periyar’s diary of his European and Soviet tour (1931-32). A detailed chronology of Periyar’s life followed. Since 1975, he gleaned documents for a detailed biography of Periyar. The incomplete manuscript, said to run into hundreds of pages, apparently covers only the early part of his life. Another major contribution was Anaimuthu’s discovery of Thathuvavivesini (1882-1888) and the Thinker (1882-1885). Published by the Hindu Freethought Union, these pioneering rationalist weeklies ran ‘a crusade against superstition, poverty and prostitution’. His search for the radical thinker Athipakkam Venkatachala Nayakkar (1800-1897) had led Anaimuthu to unearth these unknown vehicles of radical thought. Author of the iconoclastic Hindu Mathachara Abasa Darshini (1882), Venkatachala Nayakkar was also the voice of peasant distress under the Ryotwari system. In a rare act of intellectual generosity Anaimuthu permitted the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi and the Roja Muthiah Research Library, Chennai to microfilm these volumes for wider scholarly use. Sadly, a dodgy academic tried to steal Anaimuthu’s thunder by trying to upstage him in the publication of these volumes. Life and times Born in a village in Perambalur district, an 18-year-old Anaimuthu was inspired by Periyar’s speech. After studying for the intermediate examination at Annamalai University, he took an active role in the Dravidar Kazhagam. Maintaining a close association with Periyar in his last years, he accompanied him on many of his tours. Expelled from the party soon after Periyar’s death, he started his own party, Periyar Samaurimai Kazhagam (renamed Marxia Periyariya Pothuvudamai Katchi), and strove to bring together Periyarists, Marxists and Ambedkarites on a single platform. Apart from editing the monthlies, Chinthanaiyalan (Tamil) and Periyar Era (English), he commissioned the Tamil translation of Dhananjay Keer’s biography of B.R. Ambedkar. Associated with the Lohiate leader Ram Awadesh Singh, he participated in agitations that led to the constitution of the Mandal Commission, and lobbied tirelessly for the implementation of its recommendations. A committed and self-willed man, Anaimuthu worked without respite. There was a time in the 1980s and 1990s when it was hard to take the Tamil Nadu Express without running into him on the train. For a life packed with meaningful activities, Anaimuthu will always be remembered as Periyar’s editor. A.R.

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||A disturbing order||The order of a civil court in Varanasi that the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) should conduct a survey to ascertain whether the Gyanvapi mosque was built over a demolished Hindu temple is an unconscionable intervention that will open the floodgates for another protracted religious dispute. The order, apparently in gross violation of the explicit legislative prohibition on any litigation over the status of places of worship, is likely to give a fillip to majoritarian and revanchist forces that earlier carried on the Ram Janmabhoomi movement over a site in Ayodhya. That dispute culminated in the country’s highest court handing over the site to the very forces that conspired to illegally demolish the Babri Masjid. The plaintiffs, who have filed a suit as representatives of Hindu faith to reclaim the land on which the mosque stands, have now succeeded in getting the court to commission an ASI survey to look for the sort of evidence that they would never have been able to adduce on their own. The order has been issued despite the fact that the Allahabad High Court reserved its order on the maintainability of the suit on March 15 and is yet to pronounce its ruling. It is not clear why the civil judge did not wait for the ruling and went ahead with his directive to the ASI. By an order in 1997, the civil court had decided that the suit was not barred by the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which said all pending suits concerning the status of places of worship will abate and that none can be instituted. The 1991 Act also froze the status of all places of worship, barring the then disputed site in Ayodhya, as on August 15, 1947. There was another exception — any place of worship that was an archaeological site or ancient monument covered by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. On a revision application, another court had asked the trial court to decide afresh the question whether the suit was barred afresh “after taking evidence”. Presumably, the latest application seeking a survey by the ASI as an expert body is aimed at providing that “evidence”. Regardless of the merits of either side’s case, it ought to be clear to anyone concerned with peace and harmony in the country that the attempt to resurrect disputes buried by law is a serious setback to the cause of secularism and peaceful coexistence. That new challenges are emerging to the wisdom of Parliament in giving a statutory quietus to squabbles over religious sites is deeply disturbing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-disturbing-order/article34286345.ece
10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Time tests ties||Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Delhi this week, saw both he and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar reaffirming traditional India-Russia ties, but there were signs that those ties are being tested. Mr. Lavrov’s trip was to make preparations for the upcoming visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin for the annual summit — it was postponed last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. On the bilateral front, both sides appeared to make progress on strategic cooperation, cooperation in energy, nuclear and space sectors, and on talks on a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Also discussed were more agreements on military-technical cooperation for the joint production of India-made Russian weapons, with Mr. Lavrov highlighting Russia being the only partner supplying India “cutting-edge military technology”. While neither side referred to the upcoming delivery of the $5 billion S-400 missile defence system directly, they reaffirmed their commitment to their defence partnership, as well as avenues for more investment in connectivity including the International North-South Transport Corridor and the Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor. The areas of divergence over their worldview seemed to emerge during their public remarks, which were prefaced by Mr. Jaishankar’s reference to the “rebalanced nature” of international relations. Mr. Lavrov’s praise of Russia-China ties was clearly not shared by Mr. Jaishankar. While he referred repeatedly to India’s “Indo-Pacific” strategy, Mr. Lavrov preferred the more continental reference to the “Asia-Pacific” region. Mr. Lavrov’s derisive indirect reference to the Quad as an “Asian NATO” was significant, although he said both sides agreed that military alliances in Asia were inadvisable and counterproductive. On Afghanistan as well, the Russian push for bringing the Taliban into a power-sharing arrangement in Kabul seemed to come up against India’s consistent push for a “democratic Afghanistan”. Beyond those divergences, it was the optics of Mr. Lavrov’s brief visit that fuelled the impression that New Delhi and Moscow are not as much on the same page as they have traditionally been; it did not include a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, unlike earlier. The absence of a meeting at the highest level seemed more in focus, as Mr. Modi met with U.S. Special Envoy John Kerry just a day later, and at his next stop, in Islamabad, Mr. Lavrov was received by Prime Minister Imran Khan and Pakistan Army Chief General Bajwa. This was Mr. Lavrov’s first visit to Pakistan in nine years, and was a clear message of deepening ties. Unlike in 2012, Mr. Lavrov this time said that Russia was ready to strengthen Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts with the supply of “relevant equipment”, which will raise eyebrows in Delhi. While India and Russia have successfully addressed divergences between them, even deep, traditional and “time-tested relations” of the kind they have shared for decades cannot be taken for granted, and the two sides should move quickly, if they desire to dispel the notion that those ties are under any strain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/time-tests-ties/article34286346.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Net direct tax receipts rise 5%||India’s net direct tax collections for the pandemic-hit financial year 2020-21 grew by almost 5% year-on-year to Rs. 9.45 lakh crore, exceeding the revised estimates of Rs. 9.05 lakh crore presented in the Union Budget and reflecting a gradual economic recovery in recent months. Tax experts said that the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme to settle pending tax disputes also helped bolster the collections, with net Corporation tax collections for the year at Rs. 4.57 lakh crore. Revenues from personal income tax, including the Securities Transaction Tax, were Rs. 4.88 lakh crore, as per provisional data released by the Finance Ministry on Friday. Direct tax refunds grew more than 42% in FY21 to Rs. 2.61 lakh crore from Rs. 1.83 lakh crore in the previous year. “Despite an extremely challenging year, the Advance Tax collections for 2020-21 stand at Rs. 4.95 lakh crore which shows a growth of approximately 6.7% over the preceding financial year,” the Ministry said. The improved direct tax collections, along with the recent uptick in inflows of indirect taxes, including the GST, suggest that India’s fiscal position may be better than the 9.5% of fiscal deficit projected in the revised estimates, said Devendra Pant, chief economist, India Ratings and Research. ‘Expenditure is the key’ “The fiscal deficit in 2020-21 may be lower than the revised estimate, provided there is no slippage on the expenditure side. This is further corroborated by the central government cancelling the last scheduled government borrowing in the previous financial year,” Mr. Pant said. “The strong campaign for the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme, the use of technology and digitisation, and the widening of tax base coupled with tax collected at source has contributed to higher tax collections,” said Samir Kanabar, tax partner at EY India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/net-direct-tax-receipts-rise-5/article34286326.ece
10 April 2021||MUMBAI,||Transporters, MSMEs wary of a lockdown||As COVID-19 cases continue to spike in several parts of the country, fears of a fresh nationwide lockdown have caused panic among transporters and MSMEs. Following protests by traders, restaurant owners and their employees in Maharashtra, which is under a mini-lockdown and night curfew, transporters warned that supplies of essential items and medicines may be impacted as drivers were heading to their hometowns in large numbers. “We understand that the lockdown measures in several States are slowly leading to concern among the drivers,” said Abhishek Gupta, joint secretary, All India Transporters Welfare Association. “We anticipate that if the availability of vehicles reduces, supply of medicines, essentials and raw materials would be affected,” he said. “A totally unpredictable situation and insecurity has already set in the minds of employers, employees and customers,” said K.E. Raghunathan, convenor of Consortium of Indian Associations. “All payables to the government must be extended by six months,” he added. He said since new restrictions had been put in place, fresh order bookings had been put on hold. This would hit the sector hard because companies generally finalise annual rate contracts in the first quarter. “Advances against orders have stopped because firms are unable to give delivery commitments and there is uncertainty whether migrant labourers would continue to work,” he said. Stating that SMEs were finding it difficult to bear the COVID-19 related additional cost, he said banks had started pressuring for regularisation of accounts. MFI collections Mini lockdowns imposed by States could impact the collections of micro-finance institutions (MFIs), rating agency Crisil said. The collection efficiency in Maharashtra had been relatively lower at 85-90% even before the latest curbs, because of previous extended lockdowns, Crisil added hinting at further reduction in collections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/transporters-msmes-wary-of-a-lockdown/article34286324.ece

The company did not disclose the value of the contract, but said the orders fall under the ‘major’ category, which ranges between Rs. 5,000 crore and Rs. 7,000 crore, according to its classification of contracts. The Renewables arm has secured a turnkey EPC contract from the consortium of ACWA Power and the Water and Electricity Holding Company for Sudair Solar PV Project of 1.5GW (Gigawatts) capacity, according to a statement from the company. This project is considered to be the largest solar plant in Saudi Arabia with a power purchase agreement (PPA) signed. It is also one of the largest such plants in the world.  “We have been building efficient power transmission and distribution networks with modern substations and transmission lines in this region for more than two decades,” T. Madhava Das, whole-time director and senior executive VP (utilities), L&T, said. “This is yet another recognition of our capabilities to construct mega projects to speed and scale.” The project coming up in Riyadh Province has a 30.8 sq. km. land parcel available to instal a total capacity of 1.5 GW PV solar modules with associated single- axial tracker and inverters. “With several GWs of solar EPC experience, L&T has emerged as a global technology player for solar plants,” said S.N. Subrahmanyan, CEO and MD. L&T has more than 2.1 GW of utility-scale solar projects commissioned and is also operating and maintaining several of them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/lt-arm-to-set-up-15-gw-solar-unit-in-saudi-arabia/article34286330.ece

10 April 2021||new delhi,||Fitch Solutions sees RBI holding rates through FY22||Fitch Solutions sees RBI keeping benchmark interest rates unchanged during the fiscal to March 2022 following its decision to buy Rs. 1 lakh crore of government bonds. “We had initially expected another policy rate cut to arrest the rise in government bond yields since the Union Budget announcement in February. “However, having an explicit bond purchase guidance from the RBI following the announcement of the G-SAP will also achieve a similar effect, if not even be more effective than a rate cut on capping the increase in bond yields,” it said. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) held its policy repurchase (repo) rate unchanged at 4% at its monetary policy meeting on April 7. In addition, the RBI announced a secondary market government securities acquisition programme, committing to buy up to Rs. 1 lakh crore worth of government bonds in April-June, taking another step towards formalising quantitative easing. “We at Fitch Solutions have revised our forecast for the RBI to keep its policy repurchase (repo) rate on hold at 4% over the course of FY22 (April 2021 – March 2022), from our view of a 25 basis point cut previously.” Fitch Solutions also revised its inflation rate forecast to an average of 5% in FY22, up from 4.6% previously, due to elevated inflationary pressures. The elevated inflation “underscores our expectation for the RBI to keep its policy rate on hold”, it said. Government bond yields have trended higher since the Union Budget announcement in February, given the government’s substantial market borrowing plan of Rs. 14.3 lakh crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fitch-solutions-sees-rbi-holding-rates-through-fy22/article34286334.ece
10 April 2021||new delhi,||Fuel consumption falls 9.1% in FY21; first drop since 1998-99||India’s fuel demand contracted by a massive 9.1% in the financial year ended March 31, the first in more than two decades, as a stringent lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the pandemic pummelled economic activity, government data showed on Friday. India consumed 194.63 million tonnes of petroleum products in 2020-21 as compared with 214.12 million tonnes demand in the previous year, according to the latest data released by the Oil Ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell . This is the first time fuel consumption has contracted since 1998-99, the most historical year for which government data is available. The demand contraction was led by diesel, the most-consumed fuel in the country. Diesel consumption fell 12% to 72.72 million tonnes while petrol demand shrank 6.7% to 27.95 million tonnes. The government imposed a nationwide lockdown in March last year, shutting down factories and businesses. It was lifted in stages beginning June. The GDP is estimated to have contracted by 7-8% in 2020-21 as economic activity showed signs of recovery in the last quarter of 2020. However, a second wave of COVID-19 infections despite a broadening vaccination roll-out, with renewed lockdowns implemented in some States, is threatening to hit the nascent recovery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fuel-consumption-falls-91-in-fy21-first-drop-since-1998-99/article34286342.ece

10 April 2021||New Delhi,||Second wave poses increased risks for fragile recovery, banks: Fitch||Fitch Ratings on Friday said the second COVID-19 wave poses increased risks for India’s fragile economic recovery and its banks. The rating agency expects a moderately worse environment for the Indian banking sector in 2021, but headwinds would intensify if rising infections and follow-up measures to contain the virus further affect business and economic activity. India’s active COVID-19 infections have been increasing at a rapid pace with new infections exceeding 1 lakh a day in early April. “The government’s more accommodative fiscal stance may also mitigate some short-term growth pressures,” Fitch said. “However, inoculating India’s large population in a fast and effective way will be important to avoid repeated disruptions,” it said. Fitch forecasts India’s GDP growth at 12.8% for the current financial year and this incorporates expectations of a slowdown in the April-June quarter due to the flare-up in new coronavirus cases. But the rising pace of infections poses renewed risks to the forecast. Infections concentrated “Over 80% of the new infections are in six prominent States, which combined account for roughly 45% of total banking sector loans. Any further disruption in economic activity in these States would pose a setback for fragile business sentiment, even though a stringent pan-India lockdown like the one in 2020 is unlikely,” Fitch Ratings said in a statement. The operating environment for banks will most likely remain challenging. The second wave could dent the sluggish recovery in consumer and corporate confidence, and further, suppress banks’ prospects for new business. There are also asset quality concerns since banks’ financial results are yet to fully factor in the first wave’s impact and the stringent 2020 lockdown due to the forbearance in place. “We consider the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and retail loans to be most at risk. Retail loans have been performing better than our expectations, but might see increased stress if renewed restrictions impinge further on individual incomes and savings. “MSMEs, however, benefited from state-guaranteed refinancing schemes that prevented stressed exposures from souring,” the ratings agency noted. It said the extension of the MSME refinancing scheme until June 30, will alleviate short-term pain, but potentially add to the sector’s exposure to stressed MSMEs, which was around 8.5% of loans at the end of December, as per Fitch’s estimate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/second-wave-poses-increased-risks-for-fragile-recovery-banks-fitch/article34286340.ece

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Harshal’s dream spell and de Villiers’ genius help RCB edge MI||IPL throws up unlikely heroes. Cricketers who move from periphery to centrestage. It was seamer Harshal Patel’s turn to enter the limelight here on Friday. He bowled cleverly, mixed his pace, varied his length, and sent down yorkers to scalp five for Royal Challengers Bangalore — the first five-wicket haul by any bowler against Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Crucially, he removed the MI big-hitters with clever variations. Still holder MI’s 159 for nine, it lost wickets and momentum in the end overs, needed some chasing on a sluggish pitch at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in the IPL lung opener in Chennai. And RCB nailed a last ball victory by two wickets with Harshal there at the end to finish the contest with a single off the last ball. Extreme creativity The gifted AB de Villiers lifted RCB with some extraordinary strokeplay of extreme creativity. de Villiers, with his 27-ball 48, was at his innovative best, launching into the bowling. Everything hinged on the South African now for RCB. de Villiers straight hit for a six off Boult was high on skill and timing. And then he unleashed a straight drive. Seven were needed off the last over. Two were needed from two when de Villiers, going for a second run, was run-out. Earlier, Washington Sundar, opening the innings, fell early. Virat Kohli stroked Boult through covers. And then swung the tall Marco Jansen, the new kid on the block. Much hinged on Kohli and Glenn Maxwell. And Maxwell coming down the track struck Krunal Pandya for a huge six over wide long-off. And a Maxwell switch hit off leg-spinner Rahul Chahal soared over the square-leg. Bumrah broke the partnership, getting a good length delivery to seam into Kohli. Mercurial Maxwell Soon, the mercurial Maxwell was brilliantly held by Chris Lynn at short fine-leg off Jansen. Earlier after MI,inserted, was jolted early. Rohit surged for a single from the non-striker’s end but the swift Kohli terminated the Mumbai skipper’s innings. The lanky Kiwi Kyle Jamieson was impressive with his control, extra bounce and the ability to pull back his pace. Meanwhile opener Chris Lynn (49), with his baseball-type swing of the ball, went for the bowling. The Aussie has terrific bat speed and clears the front leg to give himself the room to bludgeon the ball. There was no other substantial contribution for MI even if RCB dropped catches.

10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indian women raring to meet Latvia||Taking on Latvia in the World Group play-off tie of the Billie Jean King Cup will be a daunting task, but the Indian team views it as a privilege and the best chance to make an impact on the world stage. Qualifying for the first time for the play-offs was in itself a historic step for Indian women’s tennis. “The players are excited and hungry to do well. Latvia has top-50 players. We have nothing to lose. We can only gain from this tie,” said captain Vishaal Uppal addressing the media on Friday, before the team’s departure for Latvia. With Sania Mirza and Ankita Raina training in Dubai and Karman Kaur Thandi training in Germany, the captain felt the team was adequately prepared to play its best tennis on the indoor hardcourts in Jurmala on April 16 and 17. On Sunday the players will be in isolation and may get to train from Monday. “We are not getting the indoor facility on Monday. We will figure out our practice,” said Vishaal. Rutuja Bhosale, who played a significant role in helping the team qualify second behind China, recalled how the team played better after meeting the formidable China in the first tie. “When there is no expectation, we play good. There is a lot of pride, playing for the country,” said Rutuja. Zeel Desai said she was thrilled to be just part of the historic moment, and assured she would play her best tennis when called for duty.  Foreseeing two days of intense battle against former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko and her team, Vishaal said the Indians had endured five days of competition against five different teams in the regional competition. “Everything depends on how you play on the day. We are not going to play the reputation of the opponents or their high rank. We will compete as hard as possible,” said Vishaal. Coach Radhika Tulpule Kanitkar, quite familiar with Ankita and Rutuja in Pune, said she had been following the significant improvement in Indian women’s tennis. The team is equally excited that the two-day tie would be telecast live in India by EuroSport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-women-raring-to-take-on-latvia/article34286488.ece
10 April 2021||Augusta,||Stunning 65 puts Rose in front||Justin Rose humbled a firm and fast Augusta National layout that wreaked havoc upon many of the world's top golfers, seizing a four-stroke lead on Thursday at the 85th Masters. Rose, the 2013 US Open champion, birdied five of the last seven holes in shooting a seven-under 65, his career-low score by two strokes in 59 Masters rounds. The 40-year-old Englishman defied a lightning-fast layout that baffled his rivals by going nine-under over the last 11 holes, the best such Masters closing run by any golfer since 2004. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and American Brian Harman shared second on 69. Neither has ever won a Major — or any US PGA Tour event since 2017. Only 12 players finished under par as mistakes were magnified around the hard-baked greens with winds adding to the intense challenge. Top-ranked defending champion Dustin Johnson, trying to become only the fourth back-to-back winner, lipped out a two-foot putt at 18 to close with a double bogey and shoot 74. Four-time Major winner Rory McIlroy, seeking a victory to complete a career Grand Slam, was off to his worst Masters start with a 76. England's Tommy Fleetwood aced the 170-yard par-3 16th hole, the 32nd hole-in-one in Masters history, and shot 74.  Top scores:   65: Justin Rose; 69: Brian Harman, Hideki Matsuyama; 70: Will Zalatoris, Christiaan Bezuidenhout, Webb Simpson, Patrick Reed; 71: Kim Si-woo, Jason Kokrak, Shane Lowry, Tyrrell Hatton, Jordan Spieth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/stunning-65-puts-rose-in-front/article34286451.ece
10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Can protege outsmart master in battle of ’keepers?||In the IPL’s inaugural edition in 2008, M.S. Dhoni was the only wicketkeeper to lead a side. On Saturday, his opposing number will be a fellow gloveman whom he has inspired and mentored. When Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings begins its campaign against Rishabh Pant’s Delhi Capitals at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, the limelight would perhaps be more on the young skipper than the ageing lion. Brutal onslaught Pant’s brutal onslaught across formats over the last four months has been a feature of India’s success. He will be hoping to repeat his heroics, leading his IPL franchise for the first time, in Shreyas Iyer’s absence. Dhoni may not mind the spotlight being on his counterpart. The veteran knows that he has an uphill task to revive CSK’s fortunes. Had it not been for a hat-trick of wins at the end of last season, powered by the promising Ruturaj Gaikwad, it would have finished at the bottom of the table. Since then, Suresh Raina, whose absence hurt the team in the UAE, has returned, while Robin Uthappa’s addition has bolstered its dodgy batting. Despite having let go of Shane Watson and Harbhajan Singh, CSK still retains many of the old guard. It will be interesting to see whether the next generation, including the likes of Sam Curran and Gaikwad, proves it can carry the legacy forward. Despite last year’s hiccup, Super Kings will enter the tournament on a confident note. Pant’s Capitals, however, will not be able to field their best XI in their tournament-opener.  The South African pace combo of Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje will be unavailable since they are serving the mandatory isolation period. All-rounder Axar Patel, recovering from COVID-19, will be missing too. The only solace Capitals have is the return of Amit Mishra to partner the veteran R. Ashwin in the spin department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/can-the-protege-outsmart-the-master/article34286458.ece
10 April 2021||Buenos Aires,||India returns to top level competition||The Indian men’s hockey team will return to top-level international competition after more than a year when it takes on Olympic champion Argentina in the first match of the two-game FIH Pro League tie here on Saturday. After being stuck at the Sports Authority of India, Bengaluru centre, for the entire last year, the Indians will finally get to play high-intensity international matches. India played its last FIH Hockey Pro League match against Australia in February last year in Bhubaneswar. Fifth in standings The Indians are currently fifth in the standings with 10 points from six games, with two wins and as many loses and draws. World champion Belgium tops the standings with 32 points from 13 games, followed by Germany (19 from 8), the Netherlands (18 from 11) and Australia (14 from 8). The Indians couldn’t have asked for a better time to return to top-flight international hockey as the Pro League will provide them valuable match practice ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. Earlier India embarked on a tour of Europe, where it played out two draws and registered two victories in its four games against Germany and Great Britain. India will take on Argentina in the iconic Cernard Stadium here on Saturday and Sunday. The Indians had a good build up to the two-match tie having defeated Argentina 4-3 before drawing 4-4 in the two practice games. There were plenty of encouraging signs for India’s chief coach Graham Reid as skipper Manpreet Singh, Varun Kumar and Rupinder Pal Singh were on target despite being out of action for lengthy periods. The forwards, in particular, impressed and created a lot of goalmouth opportunities. Mandeep Singh, Nilakanta Sharma and Dilpreet Singh had good outings. But, Reid stressed the importance of the defence being frugal. In both the practice games, Argentina managed to make its way back in the contest after India’s rapid start. Skipper Manpreet, however, is satisfied with performance of his side in the two practice games and feels it needs to utilise every opportunity that comes its way ahead of the Olympics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-returns-to-top-level-competition/article34286752.ece
10 April 2021||Los Angeles,||Red-hot LA Clippers sinks Phoenix Suns||Paul George and Kawhi Leonard combined for 60 points as Los Angeles Clippers beat Phoenix Suns 113-103 in a Western Conference showdown between two teams playing their best basketball down the final stretch of the season. George delivered 33 points and Leonard tallied 27 for the Clippers, who recently added some experienced veterans in DeMarcus Cousins and Rajon Rondo to help fortify their playoff roster. The Clippers are in the midst of a nine-game homestand and have won eight of their last 10 games. Elsewhere, Chicago's new-look roster is blending together nicely as the Bulls had seven players in double-figure scoring in beating Toronto Raptors 122-113 in an Eastern Conference matchup. Chris Boucher carried the offensive load with 38 points and 19 rebounds for the Raptors, who completed a four-game homestand. It was a career-best performance by Boucher. LaVine completed a double-double with a game-high 13 assists for the Bulls, who had opened their current road trip with a 113-97 win at Indiana. In Texas, Luka Doncic finished with 27 points, nine rebounds and nine assists as Dallas Mavericks posted a 116-101 win over Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks played without two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo (knee) for the third straight game and the fifth time in the past 10. Milwaukee has lost two straight games and five of the past eight. Also, Jimmy Butler scored 28 points to lead host Miami Heat to a 110-104 win over the mistake-prone Los Angeles Lakers.  The results: Utah Jazz 122 bt Portland Trail Blazers 103; Dallas Mavericks 116 bt Milwaukee Bucks 101; Toronto Raptors 113 lost to Chicago Bulls 122; Miami Heat 110 bt LA Lakers 104; LA Clippers 113 bt Phoenix Suns 103.   Sacramento Kings 101 lost to Detroit Pistons 113; Oklahoma City Thunder 102 lost to Cleveland Cavaliers 129.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/red-hot-la-clippers-sinks-phoenix-suns/article34286755.ece
10 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Praggnanandhaa stuns Nihal, shares lead||Prodigious R. Praggnanandhaa made light of his opening round loss to win the next four games and lead with two others in the Polgar Challenge, the first leg of the online Julius Baer Challengers Tour chess on Thursday. After a shock loss to Russian talent Volodar Murzin, third seed Praggnanandhaa scored over Gunay Mammadzada (Azerbaijan), second seed Nihal Sarin, Olga Badelka and Lei Tingjie to share the lead at four points with his Team Kramnik teammates, top seed Uzbekistan’s Nodirbek Abusattorov and USA’s Christopher Yoo. On a day when Team Kramnik and Team Polgar were locked at 25-all after five rounds, D. Gukesh (3.5) shared the fourth spot with Germany’s Vincent Keymer and China’s Lei Tingjie. Fourteen more rounds remain. Recovery Like Praggnanandhaa, Gukesh started with a defeat but recovered through victories over China’s Zhu Jiner, Keymer, a drawn encounter with compatriot Leon Mendonca and signed off with a victory over Kazakhstan’s Zhansaya Abdumalik. Poor time handling The only undefeated Indian in the first round following a draw with Lei Tingjie, Nihal defeated Carissa Yip (USA) but lost rather tamely to Praggnanandhaa owing to poor time management. Out of the 10 minutes of allotted time at the start for both players, at one stage Nihal was down to 40 seconds when Praggnanandhaa had almost seven minutes on his clock. Nihal won the fourth round against Nurgyul Salimova and then drew with Dinara Saduakossova to be seventh in the 20-player field. Leon Mendonca, who like Praggnanandhaa is part of Team Kramnik, was sharing the 12th spot with three others. He lost the first and fifth rounds to Christopher Yoo and Keymer. In between, he drew with Polina Shuvalova (Russia) and Gukesh. His lone victory came in the third round against Denmark’s Jonas Bjerre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/praggnanandhaa-stuns-nihal-shares-lead/article34286756.ece
10 April 2021||KOZHIKODE,||A big step forward for Kerala’s women cricketers||Finally S. Sajana knows how her batting and bowling look on television. Some eight years after she started playing cricket. Being part of a televised match was indeed a new experience for most of the players who took part at the KCA Pink Challengers Women’s T20 tournament that concluded at Alappuzha on Thursday. That was only one of the several positives from the tournament. “The biggest positive was that so many youngsters got an opportunity and they made excellent use of it,” says Sajana, who had made news when she was gifted a bat by former India opener Gautam Gambhir after he noticed her skills during the Ranji Trophy match between Delhi and Rajasthan at Krishnagiri (Wayanad) in 2016. “Suddenly our talent pool looks much bigger.”  S. Ramesh, who heads Kerala Cricket Association (KCA)’s game development and operations, could not have agreed more. “I thought we had a pool of some 45 players,” he says. “After this tournament that number has gone up to 90.” Sajana, who captained Sapphire to victory at the Pink Challengers, believes some of those players would not have come through without such a tournament. “We hardly have any women’s tournaments,” says the Wayanad-based all-rounder. “We cannot improve just with training sessions alone; we need to play more matches.” After playing or watching all those matches at the Pink Challengers, she is confident that the women’s cricket would soon be on a much stronger wicket in Kerala. “We have been doing rather well over the last few years in national tournaments,” she said. “With so many youngsters coming through from this tournament, we could field stronger teams in the near future.” Impressive youngsters Among the youngsters she is impressed with are batters Bhoomika Umbarje, K.S. Sayoojya and P. Akhila, spinners Diya Gireesh, Sandra Suren and C.M.C. Najila, pacer Soorya Sukumar and wicket-keeper M.P. Vaishna. “We will see more talented players if we have more tournaments like this,” says Sajana. The KCA certainly intends to have more tournaments for women. “We have a long-term agreement with the Twenty First Century Media,” says Ramesh. “We are glad that they have come forward to sponsor women’s tournaments and live-stream the matches on fancode.com. “I had watched all the matches live by mirroring the stream on television.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-big-step-forward-for-keralas-women-cricketers/article34286653.ece
10 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Batra backs Bhanot to the hilt||The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Narinder Batra said he has not accepted the resignation of Lalit Bhanot, who holds important post in Athletics Federation of India and Indian Olympic Association including the chairman of Tokyo Olympics Preparation Committee. Corruption charges Interestingly, Bhanot has several cases of corruption charges related to the 2010 Commonwealth Games pending against him in court. “It is abundantly clear that If I get re-elected [as IOA president] in November, he [Bhanot) becomes the chairman [of Tokyo Olympics Preparation Committee]. “If somebody doesn’t like his face, thank you very much,” said Batra, who was here as the chief guest on Friday for the N.P.V. Ramasamy Udayar Hockey Cup tournament held at the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research. He added: “For me he (Bhanot) is very important. If a Member of Parliament can continue in his post when charges are framed, why not Bhanot?” Batra also said the Junior Hockey World Cup will be held in Guwahati in November this year.  If a Member of Parliament can continue in his post when charges are framed, why not Bhanot?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/batra-backs-bhanot-to-the-hilt/article34286481.ece
10 April 2021||Berlin,||Arsenal left to rue late equaliser||Arsenal conceded in injury time to draw 1-1 with Slavia Prague in the first leg of its Europa League quarterfinal, while Manchester United won 2-0 in Granada. Bruno Fernandes’ last-minute penalty on Thursday put United in a commanding position to reach the semifinals after Marcus Rashford had given the visitors the lead in Spain. Rashford scored with a cool finish past Granada goalkeeper Rui Silva in the 31st. It was the England striker’s 20th goal of the season in all competitions. Harry Maguire became the third United player to be ruled out of the second leg through suspension when he was booked for a foul on Soldado in the 72nd. Luke Shaw and Scott McTominay were booked earlier, as was Granada defender Domingos Duarte, who will also miss next week’s game. Arsenal paid the price for a lack of concentration after failing to defend Nicolas Pepe’s 86th-minute opener. Goalkeeper Bernd Leno made a fine save to deny Lukas Provod in injury time, but couldn’t stop Tomas Holes from grabbing Prague’s equaliser from the resultant corner. Roma also came from behind to win 2-1 at Ajax, and Villarreal won 1-0 at Dinamo Zagreb thanks to Gerard Moreno’s penalty before the break. Arsenal had worked hard for Pepe’s opener. Brazilian winger Willian struck the post with a free kick early in the second half, and Alexandre Lacazette should have scored later when he only had the goalkeeper to beat.  The results: Granada 0 lost to Manchester United 2 (Rashford 31, Fernandes 90-pen).   Arsenal 1 (Pepe 86) drew with Slavia Prague 1 (Holes 90+4).   Ajax 1 (Klaassen 39) lost to Roma 2 (Pellegrini 57, Ibanez 87).   Dinamo Zagreb 0 lost to Villarreal 1 (Gerard 44-pen).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/arsenal-left-to-rue-late-equaliser/article34286491.ece
10 April 2021||Washington,||Rahul Dravid bats for data-driven strategy||Data, used in statistics-driven cricket to help formulate strategy and player selection, should drive a good contest, legendary India player Rahul Dravid said. “Cricket has always been statistics-driven, like baseball, but over the past 15 years we have moved beyond comparing averages and now use data to help in strategy and player selection,” Dravid said at a panel discussion at the 15th MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. The discussion titled ‘Howzdata — How Analytics is Revolutionising Cricket’ focused on how data analytics and machine learning are helping to bring advances to the game. Former South Africa batsman and ex-India coach Gary Kirsten and former England women's cricketer and commentator Isa Guha were part of the discussion moderated by Alok Singh, director at Dell Technologies. Topics ranged from how data helps players train and stay fit to how scoring 4s and 6s has changed team decisions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahul-dravid-bats-for-data-driven-strategy/article34286445.ece
10 April 2021||Chennai,||Behrendorff comes in for Hazlewood||Chennai Super Kings has replaced Josh Hazlewood — who pulled out ahead of the IPL — with fellow Australian Jason Behrendorff. The 30-year old Behrendorff is a left-arm seamer who bowls at a lively pace. A swing bowler, he can be potent with the new ball. This is not the Aussie’s first stint in the IPL. He represented Mumbai Indians in 2019, where he played in five games. Behrendorff has 17 wickets from 11 ODIs for Australia and seven scalps from an equal number of T20Is. At the base price Talking about the acquisition of Behrendorff, CSK CEO K.S. Viswanathan told The Hindu on Friday, “We have got him at his base price of Rs. 1 crore. He swings the ball at a sharp pace and is a left-armer too.” Viswanathan added, “We noticed that he has been in impressive form in the Marsh Cup being played in Australia currently and that prompted us to go for him.” The CSK CEO said Behrendorff would be available for the franchise after the first three matches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/behrendorff-comes-in-for-hazlewood/article34286455.ece
10 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Indian team leaves for Olympic qualies||A 13-member Indian team, including Sajan Prakash and Srihari Nataraj, will leave for Tashkent on Friday to compete at the Uzbekistan Open Swimming Championship, a Tokyo Olympic qualifying event. The FINA-accredited Olympic qualifier begins on April 12. Apart from Olympic B qualifiers Nataraj and Prakash, who are hoping to make the A qualification for the Tokyo Games, the team comprises other seniors like Maana Patel, Shivani Kataria and a few TOPS (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) development group swimmers. The team is accompanied by seasoned coaches Nihar Ameen, Pradeep Kumar and Asian Games medallist swimmer turned coach Sandeep Sejwal, a media release said. This will be the first international meet for Indian swimmers since the COVID-19 lockdown in March last year. The top Indian swimmers have been in a national camp organised by the Swimming Federation of India (SFI) since January 11 at the TOPS National Centre of Excellence here. While their counterparts across the world resumed their training in June-July, the Indian swimmers headed back into the water only in November due to the COVID-19 protocols put in place in the country.  “With most international meets not accessible to Indian swimmers due to host countries limiting entries or travel restrictions due to COVID, our swimmers have to make the most of any racing opportunity that will come their way,” SFI executive director Virender Nanavati said. The squad: Seniors: Srihari Nataraj (50m & 100m backstroke), Sajan Prakash (200m butterfly, 200m & 400m Freestyle), D. Adhithya (50m & 100m butterfly), S.P. Likhit (50m & 100m breaststroke), S. Dhanush (50m & 100m breaststroke), A.S.

When we gathered for the first camp, there was a very clear instruction to me that I was going to bowl at least two overs at the death,” said Harshal, whose spell restricted MI to 159. “It gave me a lot of clarity and confidence to just work on my skill and develop certain plans for the batters I am going to face in the various teams. That clarity also made my preparation a lot more concise,” said Harshal.  Despite taking the match to the last ball, MI opener Chris Lynn felt that his side was “a little bit off its game.” When asked if the team’s preparations were hurt after its talent scout Kiran More tested positive for COVID-19, Lynn said though it had been “tricky,” the team had decided not to use it as an excuse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/clarity-about-role-gave-me-confidence-harshal/article34287046.ece

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Saiva Agamas equal to Vedas||Saint Thirumoolar’s verses known as Thirumandiram are part of the collection of verses known as Thirumurai. Saint Thirumoolar had many disciples, whose names we come across in his Thirumandiram. One of them was Malangan. Paayiram is the introductory portion of Thirumandiram, said R. Narayanan in a discourse. In this section, Thirumoolar explains the significance of the Saiva Agamas to Malangan. Thirumoolar tells Malangan the reason why he left Kailasa and came to the earth. He says that he came to tell the world about the sacred texts which Lord Siva taught to Uma Devi, namely the Saiva agamas. There were two important categories of sacred works, which Lord Siva taught. The Vedas were taught by Him to four sages. The Saiva Agamas were taught by Him to His Consort Uma Devi. Thus Thirumoolar shows that the Saiva Agamas are equal to the Vedas in importance. Actually, Thirumoolar came to see sage Agastya, but divine will was such that he became the recipient of Agamic knowledge. It is the result of this divine will which Thirumoolar is pointing to here. While it might have been Thirumoolar’s intention to meet Agastya, Lord Siva had other plans for him. Thirumoolar then says that Uma Devi is the embodiment of bliss. She is the One who saved Thirumoolar from the cycle of births and deaths and granted him moksha. She reigns in the temple town of Thiruvavaduthurai, says Thirumoolar. Lord Parvathi did penance in Thiruvavaduthurai. Thirumoolar stayed at Thiruvavaduthurai, and his mention of Uma Devi shows that Thirumoolar worshipped both Siva and His Consort. This is how a devotee should worship. As Ardhanarisvara, Siva is seen as a half male, half female God.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/saiva-agamas-equal-to-vedas/article34286404.ece

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Burger day delivery||Some friends had been drooling over the burgers they had been preparing at home. They had got some soft, sesame seed topped buns, and ordered pork patties from Meatigo. I began dreaming about this: creamy mayo slathered over a piece of bun, onion rings, perhaps a slice of tomato over it. A juicy patty on that, a crisp lettuce leaf and another soft bun on top. The problem was that we didn’t have any buns, and it was too late to have them delivered. But burgers had been promised to two young people at home — one visiting Delhi for the first time. So, I turned to my good friend, the internet, and chanced upon a place called Boss Burger. I liked the different kinds of burgers it offered, and was further encouraged by the fact that it has branches across the city. With the help of Swiggy, we placed our order. The youngsters like chicken, so for them we asked for two OG Chicken Burgers (Rs. 518 for two). They are also fond of hot food, so we added a Crispy Peri Peri Chicken Burger (Rs. 299). A Crispy Fish Fillet Burger (Rs. 349) and what seemed rather interesting — a Mutton Ghee Roast Burger (Rs. 369). The burgers arrived just when the mice in the stomach had started kicking up a real shindy. The boxes were encouraging — strong, well packed cartons, which contained the burger, as well as sauces and napkins. Without much ado, we got down to business. The young ones were happy with their burgers — brioche wrapped around melted cheese and chicken topped with a hot sauce. The hot peri peri chicken was even better. The chicken and cheese patty had been doused with garlic aioli and a spicy sauce. The fish fillet burger, which came with tartar sauce, was disappointing. The patty was crisp from the outside, but sadly soggy within. My mutton ghee roast burger, however, was delicious, with its fusion flavours. The patty had been prepared in the Mangalorean style — slow cooked and then garnished with curry leaf flavoured mayo. It had a taste of soft onions that I really liked, and, overall, the patty cooked with Indian spices went rather well with the soft, bland buns. My last happy burger meal was when I had ordered in from Aku’s, which has some outstanding burgers with blue cheese, wild mushrooms, jalapenos, caramelized onions and more. Boss Burger’s menu is comprehensive, too. For vegetarians, it offers Aloo Rataloo (sweet potato patty with mozzarella cheese, garlic aioli and chutney), Spicy BBQ Paneer, Quinoa & Veggie (quinoa-crusted roasted root vegetable patty, topped with sriracha mayo and saunth chutney) and Holy Guacamole! Black Bean Burger. Meat lovers can have its Truffled 3 Cheese Tenderloin Burger (grilled tenderloin and cheese patty, topped with truffled aioli and pickles, served in a sesame brioche bun) and a Chicken Tikka Burger. There are fries, chicken nuggets, wings and various kinds of shakes on the menu. All in all, we had a nice meal, indeed. But now I need to order in some buns and patties. Nothing like a DIY burger.

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Jaipur’s design community is standing strong||Jaipur is a contradiction of sorts. Its beautiful forts and palaces are contrasted by crowded urban sprawls. It is the production centre for intricate embroidery and prints that’s used by some of the world’s most luxurious brands, but the city has few big local brands to boast of. “Though Jaipur has been a centre for various aesthetic activities through the centuries, the average lay person doesn’t belong to the cognoscenti. In fact, the cognoscenti is very small here,” says art curator and founder of arts organisation Red Earth, Himanshu Verma (aka the Saree Man), pointing out that a price-sensitive market also “waters down how brands grow”. But what it lacks in size, it makes up in heart, drawing talent from all corners of the globe. Much of the works of note are being created through the agency of a group of itinerant creative practitioners — those who shuttle between the Pink City and London, Paris or New York. And while their works, ironically, may not be available to the locals, they help charge the economy. This was seen last year. When much of the country’s craft segments struggled to regain their footing, Jaipur’s artisans, in the most welcome of contradictions, got busy with orders — exports stepping up as tourism dried up. “I know there have been international buyers arriving in the city and collaborating on design and production, over the last few months,” says travel writer Fiona Caulfield. “I know there are some jewellers and textile people in town. It’s impossible to fly in from Australia, of course, with our stringent border lockdown, but that is not true for some Europeans and Americans.” A strong sense of community is also helping. Not only do the designers look out for (and collaborate with) each other — be it textile entrepreneur Jeremy Fritzhand or printmaker Shaivyya — they are also giving back to their artisans through creative interventions and training. We speak with 10 designers on how they are surviving the pandemic.  — With inputs fromRosella Stephen                                                                            We changed, we adapted and we still believe in making beautiful things Marie-Anne Oudejans,interior designer For Oudejans,2020 was a time of new beginnings. “Being forced to stay in one place, when a pandemic is wrecking havoc, makes you really think about what’s important in your life,” she says. To the Dutch designer, whose noteworthy projects include Jaipur’s popular restaurant-lounge Bar Palladio, that meant finding time to relax, to exercise, “to do things for myself. I just spent the days with my dog and my friends on the phone”. Workwise, it saw her stepping out of her comfort zone. “Since I had plenty of projects, both in India and abroad, I learned how to delegate. And to collaborate over Zoom calls with different teams in the locations that I couldn’t travel to,” she laughs. Aquazzura Capri is one such, where Oudejans used summery pastels and an explosion of seaside references to evoke Capri’s landscapes and craft Instagrammable interiors. “Currently I am doing an incredible project — restoring a fort just 45 minutes from Jaipur. There’s also a hotel in Mount Abu that I’m working on.” Local market:“Normally, Jaipur sees large numbers of foreign tourists. Since that has dried up, craftspeople are suffering. We are doing our bit by continuing to work with local artisans and suppliers, and ensuring they are kept busy.” Design aesthetic:“People may talk about minimalism, but in my line of work clients still want things big and beautiful, with lots of magic. I love colour and all my mood boards at the moment are colourful expressions.” Up next:“I’m doing a project in New York [that I can’t talk about yet] which will launch in 2022. I’m also doing collaborations with Aquazzura.”  If you repeat traditional designs, the appeal is limited  He may be based in Mumbai, but the crafts entrepreneur is a significant presence in Jaipur, where he works with printers. “The situation of artisans here is quite different from say Lucknow or Banaras, which are in the doldrums. Jaipur artisans are gifted because of the international community [and their global clientele]. Of course, they haven’t regained the kind of exports that they used to have, so they need to reinvent themselves to adapt to a more local market,” says Modesti, whose clients include luxury maison Hermès and French designer Isabel Marant. Lockdown was spent reading books (Ramachandra Guha’s India After Gandhi being one), collecting Venetian glass and art — especially by young Indian artists like T Venkanna, Shine Shivan, and Prashant Pandey from Jaipur — and fine-tuning initiatives to educate artisans on how to better understand the market. “They are used to repeating certain types of products. But these don’t match what the market wants. We are teaching them to make less, but produce the right product, the right designs.” Pandemic pivot:“Having all that time gave me a chance to clean up my clients’ list. I have retained only those that I consider the best not only financially but also in their commitment to the artisans. I don’t want to waste time on people who come here for the price and never acknowledge how much India brings to their collections.”       Up next:“Expect a specialArchitectural Digestcover soon, and an interesting collab with an Indian industrial company, where they are merging craft DNA with their own.” Changing aesthetic:“It is historical what is happening [the pandemic], and historic moments always have an impact on design. My intuition is that there is going to be more care given to the handmade.” Maximiliano Modesti,founder, Les Ateliers 2M||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/jaipurs-design-community-is-standing-strong/article34286997.ece
10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Sabyasachi on your sofa||Hundreds of couriers travelled between Tarapur (Maharashtra) and Kolkata last year, carrying upholstery and drapery samples from Asian Paints’ manufacturing units to designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee’s home. “Working through a pandemic — with the lockdowns and ensuing lack of physicality — was a challenge,” shares Amit Syngle, Managing Director and CEO of Asian Paints. We are talking about India’s number one paint company venturing into home furnishings and their most recent collaboration with the master couturier. This is the first time Sabyasachi has explored interiors beyond wallpapers. “Sabya was very particular,” says Syngle, hinting that the partnership was a challenging one. “He wanted to see the factory, the machines, so we conducted digital walk-throughs. And of course, samples of everything were sent across. We literally converted his home into a factory. He showed me his living room once, saying ‘It’s now only filled with your furnishings.’” The result is five collections, themed Thar, Makhmal, Soofa, Hazaribagh and Chowk, that veer away from safe solids to play with print on print and a vibrant colour palette of ochre yellows, royal blues, crimsons and dusty pinks. The luxury, says Syngle, comes through not only in the materials — “the Sabyasachi for Nilaya line uses only the best fabrics, from pure linens and silks to mulmuls and velvets” — but also in the designs that “reflect our shared cultural heritage”. Think motifs inspired by old-world Calcutta, painted fabrics from the Coromandel coast, heritage embroideries, and miniature paintings from Murshidabad. The line also includes three Nilaya x Sabyasachi wallpapers (the earlier two collabs were big successes).  Print perfect  Asian Paints has been looking beyond walls for some time now. Learnings from their annual ‘State of Indian Homes’ surveys have been invaluable in forecasting what people want (such as a more earthy palette, and a return to minimalist hues of raw silk and ivory), and saw the brand launching furniture and lights in 2020. “People’s relationships with their homes are changing. Connectedness is becoming stronger — they tend to socialise more at home — as is its multifunctionality; the same space converting into an office, a gym, an entertainment centre. We are putting these learnings into our products,” says Syngle. In the Sabyasachi line this finds expression in the versatility of the furnishings. The upholstery can become a lampshade, table linen or even a wall hanging. “This collab is a game changer because it has transformed the décor sensibilities within the Asian Paints world. Normally collections are solids, as people play it safe. They struggle to visualise print on print. We want to work with visualisation strongly now [their 3D paint visualisation app is a step in this direction] and the Sabya line works into this,” he concludes.  Fabrics cost between Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 9,000 per metre. Available across Beautiful Homes boutiques.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/sabyasachi-on-your-sofa/article34287006.ece
10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Krug’s onion chronicles||There’s a symmetry at the heart of Krug’s annual Chef Encounters trips, which bring together their cellar master ( chef de cave ) and chef ambassadors ( a mbassades ). Each trip focusses on a single ingredient and the chefs use their imagination to create dishes that elevate the simple into something striking — all to be paired with the Krug Grand Cuvée and Krug Rosé. In 2018, they travelled to Mallorca where fish was the focus. 2019 saw Oaxaca and its piquant pepper taking centrestage. Last year, just before the pandemic put an end to international travel, 11 chefs visited India, specifically Jaipur, to celebrate the humble onion. Julie Cavil, Krug’s new chef de cave (she took on the role early last year) explains that each excursion is similar to the maison’s Champagne-making philosophy, of “paying close attention to the vineyard’s character” and of “respecting the individuality of each plot and its wine” so as to allow each year’s cuvée to shine.  A winning cuvée  2020’s epicurean getaway — with names such as Tristin Farmer, executive head chef of Michelin two-star Singapore restaurant Zén, and Hiroyuki Kanda, owner-chef of Michelin three-star restaurant, Kanda, in Tokyo — had an Indian in the ranks. Chef Prateek Sadhu, the chef-partner at Mumbai’s Masque restaurant, is the first Indian chef a mbassade for Krug. “Obviously, it was a huge honour. It was so humbling just to be around all these amazing and great chefs,” he exclaims, recalling celebrating Holi in Samode, eating dal baati churma in Jaipur’s street stalls and enjoying flutes of Krug Grande Cuvée in the midst of onion fields. His restaurant is one of the few in India to serve Krug. Given its price tag (Rs. 21,462 for a bottle of Grand Cuvée in Mumbai), Krug is a niche product. Moët and Chandon, which retails for about Rs. 8,163 (in Mumbai), is the front-runner in India’s Champagne market. Distributors share that the bubbly hasn’t seen the kind of growth that other segments such as spirits and beers have over the last couple of years, because every bottle, with its attendant taxes, has to be imported. As a result, Krug is targeted at HNWIs (high net worth individuals) who are willing to pay for quality. However, Sadhu, says the maison’s offerings are a great fit for Indian food. By avoiding malolactic fermentation (MLF) in which the tart malic acid, naturally present in freshly-crushed grape juice, is converted to a softer-tasting lactic acid, the final pour still tastes fresh and vibrant. And therefore “pairs well with the food that we serve at Masque, where the flavours are very Indian”.  Allium tales  Meanwhile, for the brand at large, 2020 was about moving online. Cavil says, “Last year, we quickly adapted to the situation with digital experiences called Krug Connect, which allowed us to continue to host events and reach out to our network of Krug Lovers while respecting social distancing. We also worked closely with chef partners to create videos, tutorials and social media takeovers so people could get to know the chefs while also having a more inspiring culinary experience at home.” Ultimately though, it is the onion that created the best memories. A mbassade Angus McIntosh Jr, executive chef of The Farm at Brush Creek Ranch (Saratoga, Wyoming) remembers how his father would smell of onions when he would hug him after work. "To this day, the scent comes back to me every time I come into the kitchen and put on my apron,” he says. For Sicilian chef Ciccio Sultana, the allium brings a moment of self-identification. “I like to think I identify with the onion. My homeopath even tells me I share its sulphurous character; I like to lead but I do it with love to create an environment where people enjoy what they do rather than follow orders,” he concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/krugs-onion-chronicles/article34287007.ece

That’s close to 40 brands under one virtual roof and 400 hours of presentations! As suave CEOs (mostly French and Italian) and marketing heads line up to present the timepieces they and their teams have worked on for years, those with the best audio-visual experience and ease in front of the camera stand to win. Terms like ‘new normal’ or ‘deep dives’ are generously dropped before the presentations, and Q&A sessions are carefully manned. And as the days unfold, some strong trends emerge — the importance of e-commerce, for instance (Hermès had its brand new flagship collection, H08, available for retail online immediately after their launch). Travel is another theme, whether with IWC’s Big Pilot’s watches, Rolex’s releases or Montblanc’s tribute to mountaineer Reinhold Messner’s five-week solo trek across the Gobi Desert in 2004. There are golden ‘beach to tuxedo’ watches, integrated steel bracelets, the return of the fumé trend from the 70s, coloured experiments from Cartier, Oris and Rolex, and a focus on transparency in watches (courtesy strides in sapphire tech).

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Bald, the new black||I have often wondered if there is a God and standing in front of a mirror — or any reasonable reflecting surface really — paints a rather shoddy picture for Him/Her/Them. How, in all His/Her/Their wisdom did they look me over? How is this (pointing at my reflection) anywhere near perfection? Sure my insides are unparalleled in being super-fabulous but surely an exterior shell to go with all that awesomeness would have helped. There’s a reason you don’t house an Aston Martin engine in a Maruti. Among the many imperfections that I find agonising, baldness would rate pretty seriously high. I mean, imagine a world where we can almost cure cancer, and AIDS and even put up a serious fight against a pandemic within a short span of two years and yet, alopecia leaves our science fraternity flummoxed. Given how most of them look, you’d think they’d see a major personal gain in prioritising this issue. Instead, they continue to work, oblivious of such worldly woes. Now, remember that being bald is not something we can control and yet us baldies get ostracised — stared at, called names, felt for smoothness, segregated, all for no fault of ours. We need our own minority rights movement because nobody is fighting for us. So when a popular rag goes and announces the World’s Sexiest Bald Man Alive awards or recognition, it is just the shot in the arm that our community needs (with a booster, maybe every few months). But then, in what world of fairness does that award get awarded to the outcome of a royal gene pool? Just because these ‘Princes’ seem to remain endlessly ‘in line to the throne’, is this why we plebs have to compensate them with the crown of ‘Sexiest Bald Man’? Even Bollywood hasn’t done us any favours. Baldies was a synonym for bad-man, or the villains’ henchmen; it was as if a shaved head meant all loss of any sense of righteousness. Like not just Samson’s strength but even a sense of what is morally and ethically correct was shed once someone’s hair was trimmed on setting zero. Thankfully Hollywood has been kinder. Jason Statham, he makes bald look lean, like there could be a fat content to a bald man’s pate. The Rock, apart from being bald and successful, also makes you realise that a shaved head can take a lot of pummelling and still look smooth. Both of them together make you realise that you can make a crap movie with a few fancy cars and a plot line that drifts all over the place and still have a blockbuster on your hands because baldness can be sexier and hotter than all the V8 turbos you can line up and crash into heaping piles of flames. And let’s not forget Yul Brynner, the OG baldie, who made people sit up and notice our kind, even if it meant applying a helluva’ lotta’ make-up for the camera. By comparison, all that Prince Andrew has done by way of achievement is being born and then managing to lose all his hair and that too, with much left (pun intended) to be desired. We already have female superheroes and toddler superheroes and animal superheroes and even LGBTQ+ ones. But it might be a while till we have a proper bald superhero. No, Doctor Manhattan doesn’t count. Neither does Professor X or Luke Cage. Thanos was bald and although his idea was pretty much about doing the right… okay, let’s not start. Maybe Saito-san from theOne-Punch Manfranchise which just goes to show that as always, the Japanese have beaten us to evolution. But that’s the sad reality of life, losing your hair for no inexplicable reason is somehow linked to being a lesser human. When science has already proven that hair is a primitive relic of/in/on our species and rather inutile on the whole. If only matrimonial sites would understand this and just remove this segregating filter… This column is for anyone who gives an existential toss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/bald-the-new-black/article34287000.ece
10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Tough love: should you peel to heal?||Who in their right mind would create wounds on their face with a bunch of needles? The idea may be outrageous, but it’s perfectly acceptable in the world of microneedling, a procedure that’s becoming as popular as Botox and retinol. And if you, like me, aren’t yet comfortable with the idea of injectables, this could be one way to achieve smoother, tighter skin, with minimal downtime. How it works “It’s popular because [when done correctly], the micro injuries cause a cascade of cytokines — a category of small proteins important in cell signalling — and growth factors to rush to the injury site for repair, thereby increasing collagen production,” says Mumbai-based cosmetic dermatologist Dr Jaishree Sharad, who was the first to bring the technique to India in 2006. She also explains that deeper needle lengths (up to 3 mm) break up fibrous bands in the skin, thereby reducing acne scars. The contraindications I’d never do it at home, since some things are best left to experts. “There was one patient with abscess in two places because she didn’t sanitise the tool properly and another developed tiny holes in the skin, caused when the device is rolled excessively in one direction,” says the doctor. But if you still insist on doing it yourself, she advises you discard the tool after one use. “Women with acne scars can begin in-office treatments in their 20s, and for anti-ageing begin in your 30s,” she says. Even in the doctor’s office there are times when the procedure could have adverse effects. “I don’t treat melasma or active acne with this,” says Dr Meghna Gupta, Delhi-based dermatologist who performed the procedure on me. My experience The treatment itself was painless because of the numbing cream. On Dr Gupta’s recommendation, I went for the ‘Cocktail Facial’ that utilised a Nanopure Dermapen “with hollow needles for deeper product penetration”. To treat shallow acne scars she used a depth of 1.5 mm needles on my forehead and 2 mm on the rest of my face. We were done in what felt like 15 minutes. My face was unnaturally raw afterwards but for that the fault is mine. I had used tretinoin cream the night before and because my skin was already slightly peeled, the microneedling ‘injured’ it more than it should have. Thankfully I was with my dermatologist so I wasn’t too alarmed. Road to recovery  Soon,the redness turned into brown scabs that flaked away on their own on day three while I was patting on some cleansing oil. The immediate difference: the lines around my eyes and the acne scars did fade a bit. As I write this piece three weeks later, my skin still looks smooth, taut and bouncy. Does it last? “Microneedling at home is very temporary,” says Dr Sharad. “Electronic dermapens are more advanced.” A friend who tried it with PRP (platelet-rich plasma) calls it ‘the gift that keeps on giving’ as the results keep improving upto a year. “But the real workhorse is radiofrequency microneedling,” says Dr Sharad. “It fades scars permanently and reduces lines for a longer period of time.” It also hurts and costs more: Rs. 10,000 plus taxes for the Cocktail Facial vs Rs. 20,000 plus taxes for RF microneedling at Dr Gupta’s Delhi Skin Clinic. But despite the increased pain and price I will try the radio frequency next time around.

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Cracking down on builders||In 2012, Vikram S (name changed) booked an apartment at Green 201, a project at Siruseri, Chennai. Almost 400 residents were promised homes - to be delivered within three years after the launch in 2011. The project was to be spread across four blocks. Unfortunately, construction stopped midway and now, nine years later, buyers continue to pay EMIs on a home they don’t own. “The project was marketed well with unique balcony gardens for each home. The layout of the apartment, amenities, and even the company’s city office was well designed,” says Vikram, who invested Rs. 57 lakh in the house, of which Rs. 45 lakh was from a bank loan. “The EMI is approximately Rs. 45,000 a month. Since the EMI was calculated slab-wise, and the builder completed constructing 13 floors, the EMI has been on for the last eight years.” He explains that the resident’s welfare association lodged a police complaint against the builders and a case is ongoing between the landlord, builder and the association. “The association tried to collect money to restart the project but it didn’t materialise. The project was a dream home for many. Now, tower A stands as a bare shell along with a half-done Tower B. Tower D was removed from the design at a later stage and other towers remain on paper,” says Vikram, adding that the court has asked another builder to take it up but the appointment of a new firm is pending. Bengaluru-based Suzan R, who resides at an apartment complex in Indira Nagar, explains how the builder of the complex (who also stays in the same premises) deviated from the original plan when it was constructed in 2011. “I bought one under-construction unit then and another later as an investment. By the time the project was handed over, he had sold the designated common areas as garden areas to the ground floor apartments. In addition, the builder deviated from the Occupation Certificate (OC) to construct another floor above the one he lives in,” says Suzan, adding that they continue to pay the monthly maintenance and property tax on common areas that are not accessible or usable. For the last six years, the builder, who insisted on registering the apartment association under the Karnataka Apartment Owners Act, has been urging owners to sign the document that he has tweaked to add his deviations. “He went ahead and registered the Deed of Declaration (DoD) in a hurry because the owners had paid the building maintenance in advance for 15 years. He ran out of money in seven years and they could not collect it from owners until the Association was formed,” she says, adding, “He added a clause in the DoD stating that all owners who had not signed it could join the Association by signing a Deed of Affirmation that by default gets the signatories to acknowledge the DoD.” Over time, barring her, all the residents (12 owners signed the DoD and 2 signed the Deed of Affirmation) gave in and signed. Suzan says that she refused to sign the DoD as it was factually incorrect and any violation of the OC will result in its revocation. “I do not want to be party to the violations.” Last year, she took the legal route and issued notices to all the owners and the builder when she was refused a seat as a committee member. “I have made my point by doing so and I also realise that taking the issue to court will take several years to resolve. People need to be aware of such issues as many buyers don’t read their home documents carefully, especially on the formation of associations.” As per Anarock Research, as of 2020-end, altogether 1,132 projects accounting for approx. 5.02 lakh units (launched in 2013 or before) are stuck in various stages of (non) completion in the top seven cities. “Project delays have been the bane of the real estate sector over the last decade. Even the implementation of the Real Estate Regulation and Development Act (RERA) has had only little impact. Among other factors, the liquidity crunch threw up roadblocks for developers, which is why the government intervened with the creation of the Alternate Investment Fund (AIF) in late 2019 with a corpus of Rs. 25,000 crore,” says Prashant Thakur, Director & Head – Research, Anarock Property Consultants. He says this last-mile capitalisation mechanism couched in the Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) fund has proved to be marginally effective in getting stuck projects going again. Consumer sore points Before the Act was implemented, the most common issue was builders deviating from plans, says Thakur. “Some developers duped buyers by building more floors than actually approved; some built clubhouses on the terrace (which is illegal), or built penthouses on the top-most floors in violation of the approved plan. Additionally, they pre-launch projects at lower prices to lure buyers while actually having no clear land titles or approvals in place,” he explains, adding that this was in addition to project delays, lack of clarity on actual carpet area, inferior quality of construction, etc. While most of these issues have more or less been addressed by the reformatory changes brought into the sector, it’s imperative that buyers remain cautious and vigilant, warns Thakur. While many experts may argue that instances of such issues have come down after the implementation of RERA, that isn’t the case on-ground. Last month, a Mumbai-based builder was arrested for cheating 59 homebuyers of Rs. 30 crore. In December 2020, a builder was booked for cheating a client of Rs. 16.45 lakh in Pune. A 2019 report in Hindustan Times states that ‘more than 5,000 homebuyers have been cheated of Rs. 3,683 crore in 123 mass housing frauds in Mumbai in the past three years’. “There were no laws governing real estate transactions,” says S.C. Raghuram of Chennai-based Rank Associates. “Since the Court process was also lengthy, customers were struggling to cope with the unreasonable attitudes and demands of many of the builders.” He explains that while RERA has covered many of the gaps and ensured that future transactions are structured and transparent, the calculation of undivided share (UDS) remains unaddressed by any Act. R. Saravanan in Chennai bought a flat for Rs. 32 lakh (with a legal agreement and a registered bank loan) in December 2016 (RERA came into force in May that year). Of the Rs. 32 lakh, he paid Rs. 28.5 lakh at the time of registration. Of seven flats, six were completed and handed over, while his unit remains pending. “I approached the consumer court and filed a case in June 2018. The matter is still pending for the past three years and I have faced heavy financial losses,” writes Saravanan in a letter to The Hindu . RERA’s slow pace The implementation of the Act has been slow and uneven across the country. A report by Moneylife Foundation and HDFC titled ‘Efficacy of RERA From the Consumer Perspective 2020’ addresses how, though several States have implemented RERA, it hasn’t led to a boost in buyer confidence nationwide. The slow pace of the Act’s implementation in some States, including project and agent registrations, is one of the reasons. “Ensuring that the regulation is followed in both letter and spirit is essential to securing consumer trust. Additionally, RERA covers only projects after 2016 but there is a sizeable chunk of projects facing issues that were launched prior to that. It will help to have a one-time settlement of these issues,” says Saurabh Garg, Co-Founder & CBO, NoBroker. The HDFC report highlights how several RERA authorities are mute spectators to the non-execution of their own orders. ‘Most confirmed that they have no authority to recover assets themselves but can only forward the details to the Deputy Commissioner. Our research also points out that people have complaints about getting the RERA orders executed,’ states the report. For instance, the model sale agreement is not being implemented/ enforced by any State RERA authority and developers continue to have their own versions; most of them continue with one-sided agreements even now. While the Act calls for synchronisation with other legislations, ‘several inconsistencies have remained, partly due to insufficient dialogue amongst stakeholders and partly the lack of political will to resolve them’. Thakur explains how plan deviations and project delays continue to be issues even today. “Certain smaller developers still try to operate outside the purview of RERA. Customers who deal with them may or may not be aware of the dangers. However, with huge expense involved, it is every buyer’s responsibility to be as fully informed as possible.” Getting redress For projects registered under RERA, any dispute can be tried by the authority constituted under the Act, says Raghuram. However, the jurisdiction of the consumer forum and civil court are also available for affected customers, but simultaneous proceedings cannot be initiated (i.e., they can use only one forum). “What the average customer needs right now is more customer education around his/ her rights. A campaign by RERA - on the lines of what the consumer forum ‘Jaago Grahak Jago’ and IRDA did - is required. The government can take over or fund projects that are stuck and complete them,” says Garg of NoBroker. The one common advice that all experts share is that buyers need to remain vigilant and aware. Maintaining a checklist helps. For instance, a buyer needs to check the builder’s track record and get feedback from previous customers; check building plans; insist on an architect’s certificate regarding common areas; ensure original documents of title are handed over to the association on completion of the project;, and check that the UDS is proportionately conveyed in their favour as per the FSI mentioned in the approved plan. Buyers should also take independent legal opinion, says Raghuram. “He/she should go through the terms of the agreements with a fine eye and ensure that no demand for an additional payment can be raised at a later date, and that the timelines for completion and compensation for delay are clearly mentioned,” he says. Specifications of construction and the brand/make of components can also be specified in the annexures to the said agreements. Also, it is advised that buyers frequently visit the site to ensure usage of quality materials and in case of any discrepancy, it should be communicated to the builder via email. “This will help as a record/evidence if the matter goes to courts or a consumer forum at a later date,” he says.

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Get innovative with materials||It is a known fact that alternative building materials are eco-friendly and sustainable. They not only provide cost-effective construction but also ensure the judicious utilisation ofresources with the least possible degradation of the environment. The demand for building materials has been continuously rising with the increasing need for housing, both in rural and urban areas. It is time to take a look at some of the major innovations in the world of construction. Two innovative rebar alternatives are Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) and aluminium which are non-corrosive as well as light in weight in comparison to traditional steel. Here are a few more innovations to track:  Infusing bacterial spores : The great downfall of concrete, the world’s most widely used building material, is due its unavoidable cracking which is caused by exposure to water and chemicals. However, a new development from a team in the Netherlands could extend the life of concrete, by infusing it with bacterial spores that patch up cracks when water seeps through. Plans are on to make this self-healing concrete commercial.  Enabling technology: Nanotechnology is the use of very small particles of material. A nanometre is a billionth of a metre. The use of nano fillers in concrete improves its weakness in tension and results in a concrete with greatly improved stress-strain behaviour. The addition of nano silica fume improves the durability of concrete structures.  White pigment: TiO2 is a white pigment and can be used as an excellent reflective coating. It is hydrophilic and therefore gives self-cleaning properties to surfaces to which it is applied. The addition of small amounts (1% wt) of CNT (carbon nano tube) can improve the mechanical properties of samples consisting of Portland cement phase and water.  Aero gel: It is solid with the lowest known density. It stands up to 2,000 times greater load than its own weight. It has extremely low thermal conductivity, and is suitable to limit the heat losses of buildings. Its melting temperature is 1,200 °C. The life expectancy of present-day reinforced concrete structures is about 100 years. The production of construction materials requires energy and generates greenhouse gases. Innovative materials offer opportunities to change the way in which we construct and retrofit buildings. They give added value in terms of increased performance and functionality. Ancient structures were not reinforced, had good longevity, and were corrosion-free, unlike present structures.

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Stay cool with clay tiles||One of the most ubiquitous architectural elements around the world is the clay roof tile. Clay tiles have a history dating back to the Neolithic Age. They were first used as roofing in China and then in the Middle East. Soon after, the use of the clay tile for roofing gradually spread throughout the world. The material has been seen as an integral part of architecture for thousands of years and in many cultures, clay roof tiles carry with them a sense of timelessness and tradition. In India, the first clay tile factory was set up in Mangalore in 1860. Called ‘Mangalore tiles’, these were made from the hard laterite clay available in the area and became popular for their colour, shape and quality. The deep red shade of the tile is due to the high iron content in the clay used. There are multiple advantages of using clay roof tiles. Here are a few of their myriad benefits: Durability When installed correctly, they could have a lifespan of almost 75 years, making it a durable and sturdy building material. Being modular, they have minimal maintenance requirements and in the case of any damage only the affected tiles usually require replacement.   Aesthetics Available in several shapes, colours and sizes, clay tiles are testimony to the varied regional soil types and the skill of artisans. The different shapes were derived from the many methods of installation. Some of these include: flat tiles, pot tiles (curved and handmade), pan tiles (similar to pot tiles but differ in the process, and are widely used in villages), S-shaped tiles (Allahabad tiles), and so on. Besides these, clay tiles also offer opportunities for customisation to fit different roof shapes. Varied colours can be brought out in the tiles during the firing process as heat leads to chemical changes that can alter colour. The tiles can also be glazed to create varied colours other than the natural unglazed terracotta, creating a unique aesthetic. Environmental sustainability   Insulation:  Due to the undulating shapes of these tiles, they allow for continuous airflow, ensuring the space below is cool, thereby reducing our reliance on air conditioning.   Recyclability:  A clay tile is 100% recyclable. It can be crushed and re-introduced into tile production. Or, if properly salvaged, they can be reused as roof tile.   Responsible manufacturing process:  Modern advances in tile manufacturing are starting to take into account environmental sensitivity where production waste is re-introduced into the manufacturing process and production uses water captured and recycled back into the process, thus preventing pollution. Eyes on solar Today, solar roof tiles are starting to become popular. These are solar panels that would fit into the frames of clay tiles, serving as building integrated photovoltaic systems. By sourcing raw materials responsibly and using environmentally sensitive manufacturing processes, clay tiles can be one of the most sustainable building materials available today that would also encourage local artisans and bring out our unique regional diversity.

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Encroachment of land||Our (unregistered) Flat Owners Association comprises 19 flat owners and has been in existence since the year 2000. It comes under the Iyyappanthangal Panchayat. While handing over the project to the Association in 2000, the builder did not include a triangular area of 728 sq.ft. - situated within our compound gate’s perimeter - and left it outside our east-facing main gate’s compound that adjoins the road. We realised this much later and on physically measuring it, we found that the area within the present compound perimeter is only 8,216 sq.ft., instead of the 8,944 sq.ft. as given in the sales deed. Even though no outsider has occupied our area, the Panchayat (it’s located across the road from our apartment) has encroached upon this 30 ft wide road. This violates CMDA layout norms as they have constructed a boundary wall which has reduced the 30ft wide road to a 17 ft wide road. In the process, they have encroached our south eastern boundary with their concrete road and there is also a transformer located in the same corner (which the TNEB initially installed for our apartment and later used it for giving connections to houses on the adjacent road). It appears like a common walkway with no boundary demarcations. We have already sent a petition to the collector and assistant director of the Kanchipuram Panchayat. There are differing opinions and apprehensions among the 19 flat owners about retaining this 728 sq.ft. land. Some say it is better to leave it as is as they fear complications, while others opine that the gate compound perimeter has to be shifted to include this area.

Since the flats have been occupied since 2000, it has to be seen whether the flat owners collectively can claim rights over 728 sq.ft., of land under ‘adverse possession’. After registering your Association, you can apply for a patta for the land and check the extent for which the same is issued. If the encroachment has happened recently, the Association can also file appropriate legal proceedings for removal of the same.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/encroachment-of-land/article34287023.ece

On a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) basis, net absorption in Q1 2021 stands at 64% of the levels witnessed in Q1 2020. Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Delhi NCR accounted for nearly 80% of the net absorption during the quarter. Moreover, Bengaluru and Delhi NCR were the two markets which witnessed an increase in net absorption when compared to Q4 2020.  Pre-commitments in new completions played a significant role in driving net absorption. In the first quarter, 31% of the new completions during the quarter was already pre-committed. Maximum pre-commitment levels were observed in the southern markets of Bengaluru (51% of the new completions) and Hyderabad (45% of the new completions). At the same time, it is important to note that the leasing momentum in some of the larger markets have remained promising in the first quarter of 2021.

Almost 400 residents were promised homes - to be delivered within three years after the launch in 2011. The project was to be spread across four blocks. Unfortunately, construction stopped midway and now, nine years later, buyers continue to pay EMIs on a home they don’t own. “The project was marketed well with unique balcony gardens for each home. The layout of the apartment, amenities, and even the company’s city office was well designed,” says Vikram, who invested Rs. 57 lakh in the house, of which Rs. 45 lakh was from a bank loan. “The EMI is approximately Rs. 45,000 a month. Since the EMI was calculated slab-wise, and the builder completed constructing 13 floors, the EMI has been on for the last eight years.” He explains that the resident’s welfare association lodged a police complaint against the builders and a case is ongoing between the landlord, builder and the association. “The association tried to collect money to restart the project but it didn’t materialise. The project was a dream home for many. Now, tower A stands as a bare shell along with a half-done Tower B. Tower D was removed from the design at a later stage and other towers remain on paper,” says Vikram, adding that the court has asked another builder to take it up but the appointment of a new firm is pending. Bengaluru-based Suzan R, who resides at an apartment complex in Indira Nagar, explains how the builder of the complex (who also stays in the same premises) deviated from the original plan when it was constructed in 2011. “I bought one under-construction unit then and another later as an investment. By the time the project was handed over, he had sold the designated common areas as garden areas to the ground floor apartments. In addition, the builder deviated from the Occupation Certificate (OC) to construct another floor above the one he lives in,” says Suzan, adding that they continue to pay the monthly maintenance and property tax on common areas that are not accessible or usable. For the last six years, the builder, who insisted on registering the apartment association under the Karnataka Apartment Owners Act, has been urging owners to sign the document that he has tweaked to add his deviations. “He went ahead and registered the Deed of Declaration (DoD) in a hurry because the owners had paid the building maintenance in advance for 15 years. He ran out of money in seven years and they could not collect it from owners until the Association was formed,” she says, adding, “He added a clause in the DoD stating that all owners who had not signed it could join the Association by signing a Deed of Affirmation that by default gets the signatories to acknowledge the DoD.” Over time, barring her, all the residents (12 owners signed the DoD and 2 signed the Deed of Affirmation) gave in and signed. Suzan says that she refused to sign the DoD as it was factually incorrect and any violation of the OC will result in its revocation. “I do not want to be party to the violations.” Last year, she took the legal route and issued notices to all the owners and the builder when she was refused a seat as a committee member. “I have made my point by doing so and I also realise that taking the issue to court will take several years to resolve. People need to be aware of such issues as many buyers don’t read their home documents carefully, especially on the formation of associations.” As per Anarock Research, as of 2020-end, altogether 1,132 projects accounting for approx. 5.02 lakh units (launched in 2013 or before) are stuck in various stages of (non) completion in the top seven cities. “Project delays have been the bane of the real estate sector over the last decade. Even the implementation of the Real Estate Regulation and Development Act (RERA) has had only little impact. Among other factors, the liquidity crunch threw up roadblocks for developers, which is why the government intervened with the creation of the Alternate Investment Fund (AIF) in late 2019 with a corpus of Rs. 25,000 crore,” says Prashant Thakur, Director & Head – Research, Anarock Property Consultants. He says this last-mile capitalisation mechanism couched in the Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) fund has proved to be marginally effective in getting stuck projects going again. Consumer sore points Before the Act was implemented, the most common issue was builders deviating from plans, says Thakur. “Some developers duped buyers by building more floors than actually approved; some built clubhouses on the terrace (which is illegal), or built penthouses on the top-most floors in violation of the approved plan. Additionally, they pre-launch projects at lower prices to lure buyers while actually having no clear land titles or approvals in place,” he explains, adding that this was in addition to project delays, lack of clarity on actual carpet area, inferior quality of construction, etc. While most of these issues have more or less been addressed by the reformatory changes brought into the sector, it’s imperative that buyers remain cautious and vigilant, warns Thakur. While many experts may argue that instances of such issues have come down after the implementation of RERA, that isn’t the case on-ground. Last month, a Mumbai-based builder was arrested for cheating 59 homebuyers of Rs. 30 crore. In December 2020, a builder was booked for cheating a client of Rs. 16.45 lakh in Pune. A 2019 report in Hindustan Times states that ‘more than 5,000 homebuyers have been cheated of Rs. 3,683 crore in 123 mass housing frauds in Mumbai in the past three years’. “There were no laws governing real estate transactions,” says S.C. Raghuram of Chennai-based Rank Associates. “Since the Court process was also lengthy, customers were struggling to cope with the unreasonable attitudes and demands of many of the builders.” He explains that while RERA has covered many of the gaps and ensured that future transactions are structured and transparent, the calculation of undivided share (UDS) remains unaddressed by any Act. R. Saravanan in Chennai bought a flat for Rs. 32 lakh (with a legal agreement and a registered bank loan) in December 2016 (RERA came into force in May that year). Of the Rs. 32 lakh, he paid Rs. 28.5 lakh at the time of registration. Of seven flats, six were completed and handed over, while his unit remains pending. “I approached the consumer court and filed a case in June 2018. The matter is still pending for the past three years and I have faced heavy financial losses,” writes Saravanan in a letter to The Hindu . RERA’s slow pace The implementation of the Act has been slow and uneven across the country. A report by Moneylife Foundation and HDFC titled ‘Efficacy of RERA From the Consumer Perspective 2020’ addresses how, though several States have implemented RERA, it hasn’t led to a boost in buyer confidence nationwide. The slow pace of the Act’s implementation in some States, including project and agent registrations, is one of the reasons. “Ensuring that the regulation is followed in both letter and spirit is essential to securing consumer trust. Additionally, RERA covers only projects after 2016 but there is a sizeable chunk of projects facing issues that were launched prior to that. It will help to have a one-time settlement of these issues,” says Saurabh Garg, Co-Founder & CBO, NoBroker. The HDFC report highlights how several RERA authorities are mute spectators to the non-execution of their own orders. ‘Most confirmed that they have no authority to recover assets themselves but can only forward the details to the Deputy Commissioner. Our research also points out that people have complaints about getting the RERA orders executed,’ states the report. For instance, the model sale agreement is not being implemented/ enforced by any State RERA authority and developers continue to have their own versions; most of them continue with one-sided agreements even now. While the Act calls for synchronisation with other legislations, ‘several inconsistencies have remained, partly due to insufficient dialogue amongst stakeholders and partly the lack of political will to resolve them’. Thakur explains how plan deviations and project delays continue to be issues even today. “Certain smaller developers still try to operate outside the purview of RERA. Customers who deal with them may or may not be aware of the dangers. However, with huge expense involved, it is every buyer’s responsibility to be as fully informed as possible.” Getting redress For projects registered under RERA, any dispute can be tried by the authority constituted under the Act, says Raghuram. However, the jurisdiction of the consumer forum and civil court are also available for affected customers, but simultaneous proceedings cannot be initiated (i.e., they can use only one forum). “What the average customer needs right now is more customer education around his/ her rights. A campaign by RERA - on the lines of what the consumer forum ‘Jaago Grahak Jago’ and IRDA did - is required. The government can take over or fund projects that are stuck and complete them,” says Garg of NoBroker. The one common advice that all experts share is that buyers need to remain vigilant and aware. Maintaining a checklist helps. For instance, a buyer needs to check the builder’s track record and get feedback from previous customers; check building plans; insist on an architect’s certificate regarding common areas; ensure original documents of title are handed over to the association on completion of the project;, and check that the UDS is proportionately conveyed in their favour as per the FSI mentioned in the approved plan. Buyers should also take independent legal opinion, says Raghuram. “He/she should go through the terms of the agreements with a fine eye and ensure that no demand for an additional payment can be raised at a later date, and that the timelines for completion and compensation for delay are clearly mentioned,” he says. Specifications of construction and the brand/make of components can also be specified in the annexures to the said agreements. Also, it is advised that buyers frequently visit the site to ensure usage of quality materials and in case of any discrepancy, it should be communicated to the builder via email. “This will help as a record/evidence if the matter goes to courts or a consumer forum at a later date,” he says.  As of 2020-end, altogether 1,132 projects accounting for approx. 5.02 lakh units (launched in 2013 or before) are stuck in various stages of (non) completion in the top seven cities||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/cracking-down-on-builders/article34287035.ece
10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Sabyasachi on your sofa||Hundreds of couriers travelled between Tarapur (Maharashtra) and Kolkata last year, carrying upholstery and drapery samples from Asian Paints’ manufacturing units to designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee’s home. “Working through a pandemic — with the lockdowns and the ensuing lack of physicality — was a challenge,” shares Amit Syngle, managing director and CEO of Asian Paints. We are talking about India’s number one paint company venturing into home furnishings and their most recent collaboration with the master couturier. This is the first time Sabyasachi has explored interiors beyond wallpapers. “Sabya was very particular,” says Syngle, hinting that the partnership was a challenging one. “He wanted to see the factory, the machines, so we conducted digital walk-throughs. And of course, samples of everything were sent across. We literally converted his home into a factory. He showed me his living room once, saying ‘It’s now only filled with your furnishings.’” The result is five collections, themed Thar, Makhmal, Soofa, Hazaribagh and Chowk, that veer away from safe solids to play with print on print and a vibrant colour palette of ochre yellows, royal blues, crimsons and dusty pinks. The luxury, says Syngle, comes through not only in the materials — “the Sabyasachi for Nilaya line uses only the best fabrics, from pure linens and silks to mulmuls and velvets” — but also in the designs that “reflect our shared cultural heritage”. Think motifs inspired by old-world Calcutta, painted fabrics from the Coromandel coast, heritage embroideries, and miniature paintings from Murshidabad. The line also includes three Nilaya x Sabyasachi wallpapers (the earlier two collabs were big successes).  Print perfect  Asian Paints has been looking beyond walls for some time now. Learnings from their annual ‘State of Indian Homes’ surveys have been invaluable in forecasting what people want (such as a more earthy palette, and a return to minimalist hues of raw silk and ivory), and saw the brand launching furniture and lights in 2020. “People’s relationships with their homes are changing. Connectedness is becoming stronger — they tend to socialise more at home — as is its multifunctionality; the same space converting into an office, a gym, an entertainment centre. We are putting these learnings into our products,” says Syngle. In the Sabyasachi line this finds expression in the versatility of the furnishings. The upholstery can become a lampshade, table linen or even a wall hanging. “This collab is a game changer because it has transformed the décor sensibilities within the Asian Paints world. Normally collections are solids, as people play it safe. They struggle to visualise print on print. We want to work with visualisation strongly now [their 3D paint visualisation app is a step in this direction] and the Sabya line works into this,” he concludes.  Fabrics cost between Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 9,000 per metre.

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Krug’s onion chronicles||There’s a symmetry at the heart of Krug’s annual Chef Encounters trips, which bring together their cellar master ( chef de cave ) and chef ambassadors ( a mbassades ). Each trip focusses on a single ingredient and the chefs use their imagination to create dishes that elevate the simple into something striking — all to be paired with the Krug Grand Cuvée and Krug Rosé. In 2018, they travelled to Mallorca where fish was the focus. 2019 saw Oaxaca and its piquant pepper taking centrestage. Last year, just before the pandemic put an end to international travel, 11 chefs visited India, specifically Jaipur, to celebrate the humble onion. Julie Cavil, Krug’s new chef de cave (she took on the role early last year) explains that each excursion is similar to the maison’s Champagne-making philosophy, of “paying close attention to the vineyard’s character” and of “respecting the individuality of each plot and its wine” so as to allow each year’s cuvée to shine.  A winning cuvée  2020’s epicurean getaway — with names such as Tristin Farmer, executive head chef of Michelin two-star Singapore restaurant Zén, and Hiroyuki Kanda, owner-chef of Michelin three-star restaurant, Kanda, in Tokyo — had an Indian in the ranks. Chef Prateek Sadhu, the chef-partner at Mumbai’s Masque restaurant, is the first Indian chef a mbassade for Krug. “Obviously, it was a huge honour. It was so humbling just to be around all these amazing and great chefs,” he exclaims, recalling celebrating the Holi festival in Samode, eating dal baati churma in Jaipur’s street stalls and enjoying the flutes of Krug Grande Cuvée in the midst of onion fields. His restaurant is one of the few in the country to serve Krug. Given its price tag (Rs. 21,462 for a bottle of Grand Cuvée in Mumbai), Krug is a niche product. Moët and Chandon, which retails for about Rs. 8,163 (in Mumbai), is the front-runner in India’s Champagne market. Distributors share that the bubbly hasn’t seen the kind of growth that other segments such as spirits and beers have over the last couple of years, because every bottle, with its attendant taxes, has to be imported. As a result, Krug is targeted at HNWIs (high net worth individuals) who are willing to pay for quality. However, Sadhu, says the maison’s offerings are a great fit for Indian food. By avoiding malolactic fermentation (MLF) in which the tart malic acid, naturally present in freshly-crushed grape juice, is converted to a softer-tasting lactic acid, the final pour still tastes fresh and vibrant. And therefore “pairs well with the food that we serve at Masque, where the flavours are very Indian”.  Allium tales  Meanwhile, for the brand at large, 2020 was about moving online. Cavil says, “Last year, we quickly adapted to the situation with digital experiences called Krug Connect, which allowed us to continue to host events and reach out to our network of Krug Lovers while respecting social distancing. We also worked closely with chef partners to create videos, tutorials and social media takeovers so people could get to know the chefs while also having a more inspiring culinary experience at home.” Ultimately though, it is the onion that created the best memories. A mbassade Angus McIntosh Jr, executive chef of The Farm at Brush Creek Ranch (Saratoga, Wyoming) remembers how his father would smell of onions when he would hug him after work. "To this day, the scent comes back to me every time I come into the kitchen and put on my apron,” he says. For Sicilian chef Ciccio Sultana, the allium brings a moment of self-identification. “I like to think I identify with the onion. My homeopath even tells me I share its sulphurous character; I like to lead but I do it with love to create an environment where people enjoy what they do rather than follow orders,” he concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/krugs-onion-chronicles/article34286686.ece

10 April 2021||April 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Tough love: should you peel to heal?||Who in their right mind would create wounds on their face with a bunch of needles? The idea may be outrageous, but it’s perfectly acceptable in the world of microneedling, a procedure that’s becoming as popular as Botox and retinol. And if you, like me, aren’t yet comfortable with the idea of injectables, this could be one way to achieve smoother, tighter skin, with minimal downtime. How it works “It’s popular because [when done correctly], the micro injuries cause a cascade of cytokines — a category of small proteins important in cell signalling — and growth factors to rush to the injury site for repair, thereby increasing collagen production,” says Mumbai-based cosmetic dermatologist Dr Jaishree Sharad, who was the first to bring the technique to India in 2006. She also explains that deeper needle lengths (up to 3 mm) break up fibrous bands in the skin, thereby reducing acne scars. The contraindications I’d never do it at home, since some things are best left to experts. “There was one patient with abscess in two places because she didn’t sanitise the tool properly and another developed tiny holes in the skin, caused when the device is rolled excessively in one direction,” says the doctor. But if you still insist on doing it yourself, she advises you discard the tool after one use. “Women with acne scars can begin in-office treatments in their 20s, and for anti-ageing begin in your 30s,” she says. Even in the doctor’s office there are times when the procedure could have adverse effects. “I don’t treat melasma or active acne with this,” says Dr Meghna Gupta, Delhi-based dermatologist who performed the procedure on me. My experience The treatment itself was painless because of the numbing cream. On Dr Gupta’s recommendation, I went for the ‘Cocktail Facial’ that utilised a Nanopure Dermapen “with hollow needles for deeper product penetration”. To treat shallow acne scars she used a depth of 1.5 mm needles on my forehead and 2 mm on the rest of my face. We were done in what felt like 15 minutes. My face was unnaturally raw afterwards but for that the fault is mine. I had used tretinoin cream the night before and because my skin was already slightly peeled, the microneedling ‘injured’ it more than it should have. Thankfully I was with my dermatologist so I wasn’t too alarmed. Road to recovery  Soon,the redness turned into brown scabs that flaked away on their own on day three while I was patting on some cleansing oil. The immediate difference: the lines around my eyes and the acne scars did fade a bit. As I write this piece three weeks later, my skin still looks smooth, taut and bouncy. Does it last? “Microneedling at home is very temporary,” says Dr Sharad. “Electronic dermapens are more advanced.” A friend who tried it with PRP (platelet-rich plasma) calls it ‘the gift that keeps on giving’ as the results keep improving upto a year. “But the real workhorse is radiofrequency microneedling,” says Dr Sharad. “It fades scars permanently and reduces lines for a longer period of time.” It also hurts and costs more: Rs. 10,000 plus taxes for the Cocktail Facial vs Rs. 20,000 plus taxes for RF microneedling at Dr Gupta’s Delhi Skin Clinic. But despite the increased pain and price I will try the radio frequency next time around.
