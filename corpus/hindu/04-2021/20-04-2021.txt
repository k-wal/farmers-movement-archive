20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Vaccines for all above 18 from May 1; States can buy directly||Amid a virulent second wave of COVID-19 infections, the Centre allowed vaccination for all persons above the age of 18 from May 1. The decision, announced on Monday evening, followed a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pharmaceutical companies, doctors, Union Ministers in charge of Health and drugs and officials from multiple nodal Ministries. However, questions remain on whether enough stocks of vaccines will be available to cater to the accelerated demand. When the year began, the government’s plan was to inoculate 30 crore, or about a third of its adult population by August. As of Monday, only 8% had got one dose and 1% were fully inoculated. Immunisation Phase 3 The Phase 3 of the National Vaccine Strategy will enable vaccine manufacturers to sell half their vaccines to the State governments and the open market. The rest will mandatorily be sold to the Centre. Manufacturers would make an advance declaration of the price for 50% supply that would be available to the States and in the open market, before May 1. Based on this price, the States, private hospitals, industrial establishments and so on would be able to procure vaccine doses from the manufacturers. Private hospitals will have to procure their supplies exclusively from the 50% supplied to the States and the open market. As of Monday, India had administered 12.4 crore doses of vaccine since January 16. When it opened up vaccines for those above 45 on April 1, there was an initial surge in the number of vaccinations every day — touching 4.5 lakh on April 5. However, the numbers declined steadily thereafter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccines-for-all-above-18-from-may-1-states-can-buy-directly/article34362978.ece
20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Second wave is not more lethal, says ICMR||There is no difference in mortality among COVID-19 patients in the first and second waves, said leading doctors in charge of the national COVID-19 management strategy. There was a relative increase in instances of those manifesting shortness of breath as a symptom of the infection but those above 60 — as in the first wave — continued to be most at risk from dying. A “marginally higher” proportion of patients younger than 20 years were present in the second wave (5.8%) compared with the first (4.2%). In the first wave, 25.5% of the patients were between the ages of 20 and 40, compared with 23.7% in the ongoing second wave. Shortness of breath Citing data from a section of hospitalised patients from the first and second waves, Director-General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Balram Bhargava said 47% of the symptomatic patients presented “shortness of breath” in the second wave (March-April 2021), compared with 41% in the first (September-November 2020).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/second-wave-is-not-more-lethal-says-icmr/article34362976.ece

20 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Stern steps to be announced today after all-party meet||As legislators of both the ruling BJP and the Opposition opposed a total lockdown of Bengaluru, amidst a spike in COVID-19 cases, the State government has indicated that tough measures may be enforced after an all-party meeting to be chaired by Governor Vajubhai R. Vala on Tuesday. This virtual meeting is being attended by presiding officers of the two Houses of the legislature, leaders of the Opposition in both Houses, prominent leaders of political parties, Ministers, and senior bureaucrats. The fact that the Governor is holding such a meeting instead of the Chief Minister has aroused curiosity in political circles. In fact, the Governor had already held two rounds of consultations with the Chief Secretary and senior bureaucrats on COVID-situation. Meanwhile, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who attended a meeting with MLAs and Ministers from Bengaluru on Monday, virtually from the hospital where he is undergoing treatment for COVID-19, is said to have opined against the lockdown. This is because he held it would cause inconvenience to the public and increase misery among the people in the unorganised sector. Congress MLAs have strongly favoured imposition of Section 144 in busy markets and crowded places in Bengaluru to contain the spread of the virus. They blamed the government’s laxity for a sharp rise in cases and urged it to credit Rs. 25,000 each in individual accounts of the unorganised sector workers if it was enforcing total lockdown in the city. Minister for Revenue R. Ashok, who briefed the media about discussions at the meeting, said all legislators and Ministers of Bengaluru unanimously opposed lockdown of the city. There was no discussion on week-end lockdown, he said. “Since the next two months are crucial” in the containment of the spread of the pandemic, it was decided to open COVID-19 care centres like last year in different locations of the city. A nodal officer would be appointed to each of the Assembly constituencies in the city for allocation of beds, he said. On the delay in generation of the Bengaluru Urban code before patients were allotted beds in the hospital, Mr. Ashok said the BBMP Commissioner had been instructed to expedite the process and reduce the time. Hand stamping on home isolation patients would be continued again, he said. About shortage of oxygen cylinders, the Minister said a decision had been taken to appoint a nodal officer to ensure supply of cylinders three times a day for small hospitals which did not have storage facilities. There was no shortage of oxygen cylinders in government and corporate hospitals. The police had been instructed to crack down on agents involved in the sale of oxygen cylinders and other drugs related to the COVID-19 treatment on the black market, he said. The private managements had assured the government of providing 50% beds, which came to around 7,000 beds, in their hospitals for COVID-19 patients. Only patients with serious health cases would be provided beds in hospitals and the rest would be shifted to nearby three-star hotels on a temporary basis, he said. Crematoriums would start functioning on 24x7 and final rites of COVID-19 victims would be done for free. Hospitals had been told to hand over bodies of COVID-19 victims from the morning itself to avoid waiting periods at crematoriums. Before the meeting, Health and Family Welfare Minister K. Sudhakar said: “in Bengaluru, there is an increase in infections, when the infections increase there will be a shortage of beds at hospitals. We are seeing a shortage of ICU beds.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/stern-steps-to-be-announced-today-after-all-party-meet/article34363111.ece
20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Johnson trip off, India on travel red list||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday cancelled his visit to India, due on April 25 and 26, “in view of the prevailing COVID-19 situation”, both governments announced. Last week officials had said Mr. Johnson would cut short the duration and limit his travel to New Delhi. “I do think it’s only sensible to postpone, given what’s happened in India, the shape of the pandemic there,” Mr. Johnson told mediapersons, adding that while it would be “frustrating” to hold the summit via videoconference, he hoped to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi “when circumstances allow”. He expressed “massive amounts of sympathy” for India during the crisis. Later in the day, the U.K. Health Security Agency added India to its travel “red list”, which restricts other passengers from entering and requires all British nationals travelling from India to quarantine at a hotel for 10 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/johnson-trip-off-india-on-travel-red-list/article34362974.ece

20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||IAF chief to flag off Rafale jets during France visit||The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Chief Marshal R.K.S. Bhadauria, who left on a five-day visit to France on Monday, will flag off the next batch of Rafale fighter jets to India, according to a defence source. “The Air chief will flag off the next batch of three or four Rafale jets,” a defence source said. These jets, once inducted into service, will complete the first Rafale squadron — No. 17 ‘Golden Arrows’ — based in Ambala. As reported by The Hindu , India will receive another eight or nine Rafale jets from France by mid-May. The IAF has so far inducted 14 jets, which arrived in four batches, and is also set to operationalise the second Rafale squadron at Hasimara in West Bengal. Last September, the IAF inducted the batch of five Rafales of 36 jets contracted from France under a €7.87 billion Inter-Governmental Agreement signed in September 2016. The CAS will hold meetings and discussions with the senior military leadership of France and visit operational facilities and airbases, an IAF statement said, adding that the visit comes after General Philippe Lavigne, Chief of Staff, French Air and Space Force (FASF), visited India in February 2020. The visit of the CAS from April 19 to 23 will enhance potential avenues for strengthening the level of interaction between the two Air Forces, it stated. The IAF and the FASF engage in the bilateral air exercise series Garuda, as well as hop exercises, the last being Ex Desert Knight 21 held at the Air Force Station Jodhpur in January 2021. The two also participated in Exercise Desert Flag hosted by the UAE Air Force, along with other friendly countries, in March 2021. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was in Delhi last week, during which he held talks with his Indian counterpart S. Jaishankar. The visit also comes few weeks after a three-part investigative series by French media outlet Mediapart revealed, based on French anti-corruption agency audit, how French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation had paid €1 million to an Indian company owned by a middleman Sushen Gupta in connection with the Rafale deal. The articles also detailed how Mr. Gupta obtained crucial documents on the Indian negotiating team involved in the Rafale deal and supplied them to Dassault Aviation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iaf-chief-to-flag-off-rafale-jets-during-france-visit/article34362893.ece
20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM ignoring responsibilities: Cong.||Congress leaders, including former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, on Monday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attending election rallies in West Bengal in the middle of a public health crisis. While Lok Sabha MP Manish Tewari, in a video message, demanded a two-day special Parliament session before things went out of hand, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan asked the Centre to use its Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and National Investigation Agency (NIA) to crack down on hoarders of life saving medicines, instead of political rivals. “Why is PM addressing 4 rallies in one day ignoring his responsibilities as PM?”asked Mr. Chidambaram on Twitter, wondering if it is “because of fear that the BJP is losing the election”. At a virtual press conference, jointly addressed by Mr. Chavan and spokesperson Supriya Shrinate, the party asked if seeking votes for the party was more important than savings lives. “Is Modi ji, on whose shoulders lie the responsibility of running this country, not aware of his responsibility? Is seeking votes at election rally more important for him than protecting lives of his countrymen?” said Ms. Shrinate. The former Maharashtra Chief Minister said it was time for the Centre to rise above politics and take the challenge head on. “The government should bring in the NIA, CBI and the Enforcement Directorate against black-marketeers and hoarders of injections and vaccines. When you can use them to target your political opponents, why not utilise them sensibly against black-marketeers and hoarders?” Mr Chavan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-ignoring-responsibilities-cong/article34362911.ece
20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Manmohan in AIIMS with COVID-19||Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here on Monday after testing positive for COVID-19. “Wishing our former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh ji good health and a speedy recovery,” tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Congress president Sonia Gandhi in a statement said, “I am deeply concerned to learn that Dr. Manmohan Singh is unwell & has been hospitalised. On behalf of all of us in the Congress Party I send my good wishes to him for a speedy and complete recovery.” A source close to 88-year-old Dr. Singh said he had been admitted to the AIIMS trauma centre for monitoring and further treatment and his condition is reported to be stable. He had taken both the doses of COVID-19 vaccine. The former Prime Minister, who has been having a mild fever since Sunday night, tested positive on Monday morning. ‘Get well’ wishes As the news of his hospitalisation spread, messages for his speedy recovery poured in on social media platforms. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Wishing you a speedy recovery. India needs your guidance and advice in this difficult time.” Former Union Minister P. Chidambaram, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, Chief Ministers Ashok Gehlot, Amarinder Singh and Mamata Banerjee, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma, TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu, National Conference leaders Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah were among several leaders who prayed for the early recovery of Dr. Singh. “My prayers are with Manmohan Singh ji and his family today, and my deepest respect. May he fight this scourge with all his might and get well soon,” Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/manmohan-in-aiims-with-covid-19/article34362920.ece
20 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Vande Bharat becomes one of top civilian evacuations||The Vande Bharat Mission (VBM), which started repatriating Indians stranded abroad due to COVID-19 and the resultant lockdowns since May 7 last, has turned out to be one of the largest evacuations of civilians by a country. Into the middle of Phase 10, the VBM has surpassed the large-scale airlift of 1,10,000 people in 1990 at the onset of the Gulf War. Till now, the Air India (AI) Group has operated 11,523 inbound flights to carry 18,19,734 passengers and 11,528 outbound flights and 13,68, 457 passengers. National carrier Air India, which carried out the bulk of air transfers under the mission, was supported by its budget carrier Air India Express. Patronage drops The first phase of the VBM, which lasted 11 days from May 7 to 17, was aimed at destinations with high concentration of Indians. As many as 64 inbound and outbound flights each were operated by the AI group to carry 12,708 and 3,562 passengers respectively. The lengthiest was VBM VI and VII lasting 61 days each. The current VBM Phase 10 has international and domestic schedules operating till October 31. Of these, 373 are international flights from the country and another 376 are flights from abroad. Patronage has come down in the VBM flights these days as there is a spurt in COVID-19 cases in the country and many countries of late, airline sources told The Hindu .  Cargo only flights Air India Express (AIE) used its B-737-800 fleet to lift agricultural products, mainly fruits and vegetables, to West Asian countries, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The airline also chartered some of the 24 flights in the fleet as ‘cargo only flights’ to ship fruits and vegetables, the most sought-after items among the NRI Indians. Besides, helping rural farmers and the NRIs, the aim was to keep the supply chain intact. “Transport bubbles” or “air travel arrangements”, temporary arrangements between two countries aimed at restarting commercial passenger services when regular international flights are suspended as a result of the pandemic, are in place. Reciprocal benefits Reciprocal in nature, airlines from both countries enjoy similar benefits. Such arrangements had been established with Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Canada, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Maldives, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Russia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Uzbekistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vande-bharat-becomes-one-of-top-civilian-evacuations/article34362883.ece
20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jaishankar returns after UAE trip||India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are focused on post-COVID recovery, said External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Sunday. The visit by Mr. Jaishankar drew attention as his visit overlapped with that of Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi. The Minister met his counterpart from UAE Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who also met with Mr. Qureshi. The meetings came amidst strong speculation that the Gulf country was mediating to restart dialogue between India and Pakistan. “Took forward our ongoing discussions on this subject (bilateral cooperation), starting on February. The strong focus on post-COVID economic recovery will remain a priority for us,” said Mr. Jaishankar, indicating India’s concern about re-employment of nationals who lost jobs in the Gulf country during the pandemic and are now waiting to return to their previous positions. While the MEA has maintained silence about exchanges, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Qureshi, in an interview to Gulf News , has talked about “sittings” that have taken place in the UAE during the last few days. Mr. Jaishankar' visit lasted a day while Mr. Qureshi’s visit lasted from April 17-19. This was the first time that Pakistan has given a strong hint of the third party-led talks in the India-Pakistan ties. Mr. Qureshi said Pakistan “always welcomes third party mediation whether it is UAE or any other country”. He, however, denied meeting Mr. Jaishankar. “Now, we have to see what the way forward is and how we can sit and talk as two neighbours to sort out our issues. I can assure you that Pakistan is ready to talk, provided India revisits the decision on Jammu and Kashmir, which in our opinion is not only illegal but also unilateral,” Gulf News quoted Mr. Qureshi as saying. The Foreign Minister of UAE also met with Mr. Qureshi as the two sides geared up for a list of activities to mark the 50th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jaishankar-returns-after-uae-trip/article34362908.ece
20 April 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata repeats demand for clubbing of three phases||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday reiterated her demand for holding the remaining phases of elections on a single day emphasising that it also makes lot of administrative sense to doing so. The Chief Minister also announced closure of schools in the State and said her party will campaign through small programmes. Schools across the State will remain closed from April 20 as the State government has decided to advance the summer holidays. “On behalf of our party we have written to the Election Commission (EC) on holding polls of the remaining phases on a single day. It also makes a lot of administrative sense to hold remaining phases in one day — will the District Magistrate manage the polls or the COVID-19 situation?” Ms .Banerjee said speaking to journalists in Malda. However, the Chief Minister assured the people that there was no need to panic and the West Bengal government has formed a task force to tackle the surge in the State. Earlier in the day, while addressing a public meeting in Chakulia in Uttar Dinjapur district, Ms. Banerjee once again urged the Election Commission to club the remaining three phases. “I will appeal Election Commission with folded hands that five phases of elections have been completed and three phases are remaining We have no issues if the polls are clubbed. Even if they cannot all the three together, the last two phases can be clubbed, that will save one day,” Ms. Banerjee said. The Trinamool Congress chairperson urged the EC not to listen to the BJP and play with the lives of the people. Later addressing another rally at Kaliganj, she urged the people to exercise their right to franchise even if they test positive for COVID-19. Speaking to journalists, Ms. Banerjee said she will hold small rallies as part of her campaign and give shorter speeches. At a press conference during the day, Trinamool leaders said Ms. Banerjee has curtailed on her campaign including public meetings in Kolkata. Curfew no solution The Chief Minister also ruled out the possibility of a curfew or lockdown in the State. “Night curfew is not the solution,” she said responding to questions. Ms. Banerjee pointed out that people have to suffer because of the lockdown and such decisions makes no sense when the trains and buses are running and reiterated her allegation that many people from outside the State had come to participate in the election campaign. During the day senior officials of the State government met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and briefed him about the steps taken to mitigate the surge of COVID-19 in the State. “CS @MamataOfficial and Health Secretary briefed me on Covid-19 scenario. Impressed upon then to take all affirmative steps to secure full participation of people. Central Government & State Government must act in tandem to combat this menace to humanity,” Mr. Dhankhar tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-repeats-demand-for-clubbing-of-three-phases/article34362915.ece
20 April 2021||Mumbai,||Sena, BJP in war of words over supply of Remdesivir||The ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra on Monday accused the Opposition BJP of playing with an agenda to ensure that the State government failed in handling the COVID-19 situation. The BJP, however, dared the government to take action against its leaders if it had evidence that the party leaders were involved in black marketing of Remdesivir injection. The Congress, a Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partner, too slammed the BJP alleging that the party misled the State by claiming that it had permission to buy and distribute Remdesivir in Maharashtra. The political slugfest began on Saturday night after the Mumbai police questioned the owner of a pharma company over the allegations of hoarding of thousands of vials of the injection, which is being used to save lives amid the pandemic. BJP leaders, including former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, rushed to the police station objecting to the police action and claimed that the BJP had permission to buy those vials, which were to be given to the Maharashtra government itself. According to sources, the Daman-based company had no such permission. Leader of the Opposition in the State Council, Pravin Darekar, on Monday dared the State government to take action against him if the illegally hoarded injections were found. “We too have the demand to arrest those who are involved in black marketing of Remdesivir,” said Mr. Darekar. Sena mouthpiece Saamna , in its editorial, on Monday said that at a time when the State government is not getting Remdesivir, the BJP is purchasing it. It termed this behaviour of companies a ‘crime.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sena-bjp-in-war-of-words-over-supply-of-remdesivir/article34362924.ece
20 April 2021||New Delhi,||Centre acted on our counsel: Congress||After the Centre decided to allow vaccinations for everyone above 18 from May 1, Opposition leaders on Monday sought to claim credit for making such a suggestion to the Narendra Modi government. With the decision coming a day after former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh made five concrete suggestions to the Modi government, former Finance Minister P. Chidamabaram claimed nearly all his suggestions were accepted. “The nation is gratified to know that practically all the suggestions in Dr. Manmohan Singh’s letter have been accepted by the government. Better late than never. Two suggestions remain: ONE, there is an immediate need to provide funds to the manufacturers of the two Indian-made vaccines to ramp up production. TWO, there is an urgent need to invoke the provision of compulsory licensing of the India-made vaccines. That is the only way to use the enormous vaccine manufacturing capacity in India,” he said in a series of tweets. Earlier, both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi had written to Mr Modi to open vaccination to all those “who need based on their exposure instead of age”. Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress leader Derek O Brien tweeted that the Prime Minister had finally listened to India’s only woman Chief Minister. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, however, questioned the vaccine availability for such large population. “The solution to every problem can’t be a PR gimmick to deflect attention & grab headlines. Where are the vaccines for those above-18 to be vaccinated? Unless the numbers for provisioning the vaccines are publicly declared, this announcement has no meaning,” he said on Twitter.

20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||EU Council approves conclusions on Indo-Pacific strategy||The Council of the European Union on Monday approved conclusions on a European Union strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific to “reinforce its strategic focus, presence and actions” with the aim to contribute to “regional stability, security, prosperity and sustainable development,” at a time of “rising challenges and tensions in the region.” “Current dynamics in the Indo-Pacific have given rise to intense geopolitical competition adding to increasing tensions on trade and supply chains as well as in technological, political and security areas. Human rights are also being challenged. These developments increasingly threaten the stability and security of the region and beyond, directly impacting on the EU’s interests,” a statement from the Council said. “The Council tasked the High Representative and the Commission with putting forward a Joint Communication on cooperation in the Indo-Pacific by September 2021,” it stated. Long-term focus The renewed EU commitment to the Indo-Pacific will have a long-term focus and will be based on “upholding democracy, human rights, the rule of law and respect for international law,” it stated. The EU will aim to promote effective rules-based multilateralism, it said, reiterating its support for ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) centrality, a point also stressed by India. The EU will work together in order to mitigate the economic and human effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and work towards ensuring an inclusive and sustainable socio-economic recovery, it said. The EU’s approach and engagement will look to foster a “rules-based international order, a level playing field, as well as an open and fair environment for trade and investment, reciprocity, the strengthening of resilience, tackling climate change and supporting connectivity with the EU.” “Free and open maritime supply routes in full compliance with international law remain crucial,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/eu-council-approves-conclusions-on-indo-pacific-strategy/article34362904.ece
20 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘Congress fuelled vaccine hesitancy’||A day after former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ramp up vaccination efforts, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan alleged that the statements by Congress leaders were behind “vaccine hesitancy” in the country and accused Congress-ruled States to be “big contributors” in the second wave. In his letter, Dr. Singh had suggested scaling up vaccination efforts, giving flexibility to State governments in deciding who needed to be vaccinated and expanding the number of vaccine producers by invoking compulsory licensing. Responding to the letter, Dr. Vardhan said while the former Prime Minister understood the importance of vaccination, his party, the Congress, not only did not share such a view but was spreading “negativity”. “History shall be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh ji if your offer of ‘constructive cooperation’ and valuable advice was followed by your @INCIndia [Congress] leaders as well in such extraordinary times! Here’s my reply to your letter to Hon’ble PM Sh @narendramodi ji,” tweeted Dr. Harsh Vardhan in an apparent reference to Dr. Singh’s January 2014 comment at a press conference that “history would be kinder to him than the Opposition and contemporary media”. “Let alone thanking our scientists, many Congress members and Congress-ruled State governments have taken extraordinary interest in spreading falsehoods regarding the efficacy of these vaccines, thereby fuelling vaccine hesitancy, and playing with the lives of our countrymen,” Dr. Vardhan alleged. Without naming anyone, the Health Minister also accused a sitting Chief Minister of a Congress-ruled State of “directly inciting people against an indigenously developed vaccine”. “The irresponsible public pronouncements made by some of your leaders have resulted in a below national average vaccination coverage of senior citizens and even frontline workers in some of the Congress-ruled States. Please do note that it is these very same States that have also become the big contributors in the second wave of COVID-19 infection,” the Health Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-fuelled-vaccine-hesitancy/article34362927.ece
20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ongoing talks with China wasteful: Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday targeted the Narendra Modi government over the ongoing talks with China, describing them as “wasteful” and claiming that it has “jeopardised” national security. Separately, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge reacted to reports that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was trying to “broker” peace between India and Pakistan, and asserted that the two neighbours had always dealt with each other bilaterally. “Chinese occupation of Gogra-Hot Springs & Depsang plains is a direct threat to India’s strategic interests including the Daulat Beg Oldi [DBO] airstrip. National security massively jeopardised by GOI’s wasteful talks. Our nation deserves better,” Mr. Gandhi said in a tweet. His comments came after India and China held the 11th round of Corps Commander-level talks in Ladakh last week on the issue of disengagement of troops at Gogra-Hot Springs and Despang plains. While there was no official word, there were reports that China, after initially agreeing to pull out its troops from Hot Springs and Gogra, has refused to do so. For almost a year now, the two countries have been engaged in a military face- off, but disengaged from the most contentious Pangong Tso area last month after extensive talks. The Congress also questioned India’s policy with regard to Pakistan. “We have seen reports of a UAE diplomat claiming to have brokered contacts between India and Pakistan. It has been one of the successes of Indian diplomacy since the 1972 Simla agreement to ensure that we deal with Pakistan bilaterally... Not only are others now mediating between India and Pakistan but our internal affairs like Jammu and Kashmir have been internationalised,” Mr. Kharge said in a virtual press conference.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ongoing-talks-with-china-wasteful-rahul/article34362885.ece
20 April 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||BJD won’t hold rallies for Pipili bypoll: Naveen||A day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi suspended all his rallies in West Bengal, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Monday announced that his party would not hold any public rallies or campaign meetings for the ensuing Pipili bypoll. The Pipili by-election, scheduled to be held on April 17, was postponed following the death of Congress candidate Ajit Mangaraj due to COVID-19. Subsequently, the Election Commission has announced May 13 as the new date for polling. In a series of posts on Twitter, Mr. Patnaik said, “every life is precious and I always consider people of Odisha as my family members. In this extremely serious COVID-19 situation amid surge in cases in the country, the Biju Janata Dal has decided not to hold any public rallies or campaign meetings in Pipili by-poll.” The BJD’s decision came on a day when the State clocked highest single-day infection since the pandemic hit the country last year. The State on Monday reported 4,445 cases, taking the total cases to 3,72,703.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjd-wont-hold-rallies-for-pipili-bypoll-naveen/article34362902.ece
20 April 2021||CHANDIGARH,||‘Invite farmer leaders for talks to end stalemate’||As the stand-off between the agitating farmers and the BJP-led government at the Centre continues over the three farm laws, some eminent citizens have written to the Union government to invite the farmers’ leaders for a dialogue to end the stalemate. The long-drawn peaceful movement against the laws, enacted at the time of COVID-19, was the manifestation of the persistent and deep-rooted agrarian crisis and farmers’ distress, they said in a joint appeal to the Union government. In the understanding of the farmers, and rightly so, the implementation of these three laws would not only accentuate their crisis but would also pose a serious threat to their livelihood, they added. They said the adamant attitude of the Union government was causing unprecedented psychological and physical sufferings to lakhs of agitating farmers, including women, children, the old and the youth, who have been camping in the open on the outskirts of Delhi for more than 140 days and are facing numerous problems. “Their families at home are undergoing a traumatic situation and are living under an atmosphere of fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Already more than 300 persons have died. Several hundred have suffered injuries and detentions and there does not seem to be an amicable solution insight... The ongoing movement needs to be understood in the larger human and social context as the stand-off is in nobody’s interest,” they said. Prominent among those who have made the appeal are Som Pal Shastry (ex-Minister of State for Agriculture), T.K.A. Nair (ex-Chief Secretary, Punjab) and Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar (former Vice-Chancellor, Gujarat Vidyapith, Ahmedabad).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/invite-farmer-leaders-for-talks-to-end-stalemate/article34362898.ece

Last week, officials said Mr. Johnson would cut short the duration of the trip and limit his travel to New Delhi. “I do think it’s only sensible to postpone, given what’s happened in India, the shape of the pandemic there,” Mr. Johnson told presspersons, adding that while it would be “frustrating” to hold the summit via videoconference, he hoped to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi “when circumstances allow”. He expressed “massive amounts of sympathy” for India. Later, the U.K. Health Security Agency added India to its travel “red list”, which restricts other passengers from entering the country and requires British nationals travelling from India to quarantine at a hotel for 10 days. “The two sides will be holding a virtual meeting in the coming days to launch plans for a transformed India-U.K. relationship,” the Ministry of External Affairs official spokesperson said in a statement. “Both leaders attach the highest importance to taking the India-U.K. partnership to its fullest potential and propose to remain in close touch in this regard and look forward to an in-person meeting later in the year.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/johnson-trip-off-india-on-travel-red-list/article34362886.ece
20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Couple without masks misbehave with police||A Delhi court sent a couple to judicial custody on Monday after being arrested for allegedly misbehaving with policemen when they were stopped for not wearing masks in central Delhi’s Daryaganj. While the man was arrested on Sunday, his wife was arrested on Monday, the police said. A senior police officer said that the couple was produced before a magistrate in Tis Hazari Courts. The court will hear their bail plea on Tuesday. A purported video of the incident was shared on social media platforms wherein the couple could be seen misbehaving with police personnel when they were asked the reason for not wearing masks. The police said they registered a case against Pankaj, a marketing salesman, and his wife Abha, residents of Patel Nagar in central Delhi. “The husband wife couple who refused to wear mask and misbehaved with Police personnel of PS Daryaganj during weekend curfew and further obstructed them in the discharge of their duties have been booked and arrested [sic.],” tweeted Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Jasmeet Singh from his official Twitter handle. “During interrogation, the man blamed his wife and told the police that she does not wear masks and also does not let him wear it. However, he claimed that whenever she is not around, he always wears a mask,” a senior police officer said. According to the police, the incident took place around 4.30 p.m. on Sunday. The woman misbehaved with the police personnel and said they would not pay fine and started arguing with them, the police added. The couple also obstructed personnel in discharging their duties. Later, they were taken to Daryaganj police station where they were made to wear masks, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/couple-arrested-for-not-wearing-masks-misbehaving-with-police/article34363170.ece
20 April 2021||New Delhi,||JMM first to declare name of electoral bonds donor||The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) is the first party that has declared the name of the entity which made donations to it through electoral bonds, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), a poll rights group, said. A declaration of a Rs. 1 crore donation was made in the party’s 2019-20 contribution report, it added. According to the contribution report of the ruling party in Jharkhand, the donation was made by aluminium and copper manufacturing company Hindalco. The ADR, in a new report, said the most common source of income for national and regional political parties in 2019-20 were donations through electoral bonds. “Given the anonymity provided to donors by the scheme, electoral bonds have emerged as the most popular channel of donations to parties in the last two years,” the ADR report said. “It is to be noted that the JMM party has declared the name of the donor who donated Rs. 1 crore through electoral bonds in its contribution report for FY [financial year] 2019-20. However, this income through electoral bonds has not been declared by the party in its audit report for FY 2019-20,” it said. This raises the question as to whether political parties are aware of the identity of the donors who have made contributions through electoral bonds, the report added. Electoral bonds have been pitched as an alternative to cash donations made to political parties as part of efforts to bring transparency in political funding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jmm-first-to-declare-name-of-electoral-bonds-donor/article34362892.ece
20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Second wave is not more lethal, says ICMR||In the first wave, 25.5% of the patients were between the ages of 20 and 40, compared with 23.7% in the ongoing second wave. Citing data from a section of hospitalised patients from the first and second waves, Director-General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Balram Bhargava said 47% of the symptomatic patients presented “shortness of breath” in the second wave (March-April 2021), compared with 41% in the first (September-November 2020). In all other symptoms associated with COVID-19 — “fast breathing”, cough, chills, joint pain, fatigue — there was a greater proportion who manifested these symptoms in the first wave than in the ongoing second wave. A key caveat to the data was that for the first wave, 6,642 patients were analysed, while in the second wave, only 1,405 were analysed. Of 6,650 admitted patients from September to November last year, 9.6% succumbed, whereas from March to April, 9.7% of a group of 351 died from the virus. There was no difference in the proportion of patients who required mechanical ventilation in the first and second waves, Dr. Bhargava said. The second wave — apart from a steep rise in coronavirus cases — has been characterised by unprecedented demand for medical-grade oxygen leading to severe shortages. Dr. Bhargava said the sudden surge may have triggered panic and a demand for more oxygen. V.K. Paul, who chairs the empowered group on vaccinations and COVID-19 management (NEGVAC), said there was no difference in mortality, in the first and second wave, in those 40 and under. “There is no overarching extra/ excess risk of younger becoming COVID-19 positive,” he said. On drug protocol for treatment, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria stressed that none of the antiviral drugs — Remdesivir, Fapiravir — as well as convalescent plasma had any established benefit in curing the disease. Other medication — the use of the steroids such as dexamethasone, tocilizumab — too had limited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/second-wave-is-not-more-lethal-says-icmr/article34362894.ece
20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Vaccines for all above 18 from May 1, says govt.||On Monday, about 2.8 million doses were administered. Several States have complained of shortages and having to close down vaccination centres. After initially defending its decision to rationalise vaccine administration as based on “global scientific protocol”, the Centre subsequently allowed imported vaccines to apply for supply without first conducting mandatory local trials. Serum Institute of India is supposed to have supplied 100 million doses of Covishield every month from May but has said it would not be able to do so before July. Bharat Biotech, manufaturer of Covaxin, whose current capacity is around 20 crore doses annually, is supplying around 1 crore vaccines a month. It has said it will take around two to three months to start production at its Bengaluru facility, which will take its overall Covaxin manufacturing capacity to 70 crore doses annually, or around 6 crore doses per month. Sputnik V, the Russian vaccine has been approved and is set to begin supply by May, though it isn’t clear how many doses will be available to Indians. The ongoing vaccination programme for healthcare workers, frontline workers and those above 45 would continue. While all vaccines manufactured in the country would have to abide by the 50% rules, imported fully-ready-to-use vaccines can be entirely sold to the States and the open market. The Centre, from its share, would allocate vaccines to States/UTs based on the criteria of extent of infection (number of active COVID-19 cases) and performance (speed of administration).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccines-for-all-above-18-from-may-1/article34362895.ece

During these six days, we will make arrangements for oxygen, medicines and hospital beds. We will confront this situation and we will win,” Mr. Kejriwal said. However, despite the Chief Minister’s assurance, the announcement triggered a desperate exodus of migrant workers — most notably from the Anand Vihar area which has both an inter-State bus terminal and a railway station in close proximity. Blaming the Uttar Pradesh government for the “present chaotic health problems” and not planning in advance, the High Court directed it to enforce a complete lockdown in Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Kanpur and Prayagraj and consider imposition of a complete lockdown in the entire State for at least two weeks. “Those in the helm of affairs of governance are to be blamed for the present chaotic health problems,” the court said. The U.P. government, in its reaction, admitted that cases had gone up and it was necessary to bring in strict measures but said no complete lockdown would be enforced at this stage. “The government has taken several steps and would take further strict steps. Along with saving lives, also need to save the livelihoods of the poor. Therefore, there shall be no complete lockdown in the cities as of now,” the government said.

20 April 2021||NEW DELHI:,||BJP lodges plaint with EC over Mamata audio||The BJP on Monday asked the Election Commission to take action against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for “promoting hate” in the context of an alleged conversation she had with Trinamool Congress candidate from Sitalkuchi, Partho Pratim Roy.

20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Yoga Maya’s forewarning||Krishna was taken to Gokula by Vasudeva in order to protect Him from Kamsa. In Gokula, a girl was born to Yasoda. She was taken away by Vasudeva, who left Krishna in her place. When this girl child was lifted by Kamsa, with a view to killing her, she slipped from his grasp, rose in the sky, and warned Kamsa that the One who was going to kill him was safe and sound in Gokula. Who was this girl child? She was Yoga Maya. She always remains single, and so she is known as a nitya kannika. She is also called Durga, but is not to be confused with Parvati, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. She is known as antari because she rose up in the sky. All this was pre-planned by the Lord. Balarama was the seventh child of Devaki. But he was transferred by Yoga Maya to the womb of Rohini, another wife of Vasudeva. Later Yoga Maya entered the womb of Yasoda, and Krishna took His place in Devaki’s womb. After birth, the two were exchanged by Vasudeva. Krishna was born on Ashtami and because Yoga Maya was born on Navami, which comes after Ashtami, she is considered His younger sister. In Her Nachiar Thirumozhi, Andal, while speaking of Her marriage to Krishna, speaks of Her sister-in-law Antari! She says Antari helped Her drape the wedding saree. It is customary for the groom’s sister to help the bride wear the wedding saree, and Andal refers to this tradition, and says it was Antari who performed this task as Krishna’s sister. We find a representation of Yoga Maya in the Trivikrama temple in Thirukkoilur, in Tamil Nadu. Although Yoga Maya warned Kamsa, he could not bear to think that Krishna was alive. “Tharikilaanaagi,” says Andal, of Kamsa’s intolerance. He sent many to kill Krishna, but Krishna destroyed all of them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yoga-mayas-forewarning/article34362916.ece

20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Healthcare firms should innovate’||External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Monday defended the decision to export vaccines, and urged the domestic industrial sector to innovate so that they can meet the challenges thrown up by the second wave of COVID-19. At a virtual event organised by the All India Management Association (AIMA), Mr. Jaishankar said “irresponsible people” were likely to criticise the exports. “So ask yourself this question — can I on the one hand go around the world and say guys keep your supply chains flowing towards me and by the way, the end product of the supply chain I am asking you raw material for — vaccine — but I am not going to give you the vaccine. If you get into this why are you exporting at all, then someone else will ask why am I exporting to India and that is so short sighted and only really irresponsible, really non serious people will make that argument, and by the way there are some around as you would have noticed,” said Mr. Jaishankar to a question from industrialist Sunil Munjal. He said the second wave had exposed the vulnerabilities in the Indian capabilities that require upgrade, and said a “blame game” would not help the situation. “There was a lot of societal complacency. For anyone of us to point a finger at anybody else, I think it is a very shortsighted attitude because the fact is everybody was complacent for a period,” Mr. Jaishankar said. Oxygen production The Minister urged the industrial sector to step forward and augment factors such as production of oxygen that was necessary to counter the pandemic. “The pandemic has brought out deficiencies in our developmental model, in our health infrastructure. A year ago, we were scrambling for face masks and how to make PPEs. We were far too dependent on supply chains abroad. I will say this candidly. Business is very fixated on its bottom lines and is not doing enough to build its own supply chains at home,” he said highlighting the shortfall of medical oxygen. He dwelt on the “long-term problems” and “potentially long-term answers” to counter COVID-19. “One part of our collective ‘us’ should be asking ourselves why isn’t there medical oxygen production at home. I think there are long term lessons,” said Mr. Jaishankar.

The CPI(M) Polit Bureau in a statement said that the Centre must spend the budgetary allocation of Rs. 35,000 crore for vaccine production immediately. “The government immediately must marshal all public sector drug production facilities towards vaccine production. It is reported that one of the facilities in Tamilnadu, the Integrated Vaccine Complex (IVC), in the public sector, built at a cost of Rs. 600 crore is lying unutilised. Capacities of all such facilities need to be utilised to their maximum to meet the demand-supply gap,” the party said.

20 April 2021||BENGALURU,TAMIL NADU||Lexicographer G. Venkatasubbaiah passes away||Renowned lexicographer, Kannada writer and critic Professor Ganjam Venkatasubbaiah is no more, family sources said here. He was 107. Prof. Venkatasubbaiah, fondly addressed as GV, was suffering from renal problems for the past few days and was admitted to a hospital. He was due for discharge on Monday, but suddenly his condition worsened and died on Sunday night, family members said. Born on August 23, 1913 in Ganjam village of Srirangapatna in Mandya district, Venkatasubbaiah was the second among eight children of Ganjam Thimmannaiah. The grammarian had compiled 12 dictionaries, authored around 60 books and brought out four seminal works on dictionary science in Kannada. His book Kannada Nighantu Shastra Parichaya and Klishtapada Kosha earned much acclaim in the Kannada literary circle. Recipient of the Padma Shri, Kannada Sahitya Akademi award and Pampa Award among others, the centenarian was an eminent academician and a noted orator as well. He became a household name for his popular column Igo Kannada (This is Kannada) in a Kannada daily, detailing the nuances of the language, its idioms and phrases. A patriot, Venkatasubbaiah was fascinated by the freedom struggle. He had the opportunity to see Mahatma Gandhi, who was on a drive to collect donations to sustain the freedom struggle in 1927. As a young scout of 14 years, Venkatasubbaiah was assigned to make arrangements for Gandhiji’s stay in Madhugiri. Recalling the incident on the 149th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2018, the grammarian said he was thrilled to see the huge turnout in Madhugiri to see the Mahatma. “Mahatma Gandhi delivered a speech for only ten minutes, that too in Hindi and in front of Kannada people who did not know Hindi. All of them were villagers. They were economically weak. Most of them were women. However, people who understood Gandhi's speech gave donations generously and participated in India's freedom struggle,” the professor recalled. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Venkatasubbaiah was a prolific writer and thinker who made great efforts to popularise Kannada. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and his Cabinet colleagues joined many others in expressing their grief.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lexicographer-g-venkatasubbaiah-passes-away/article34362942.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Government hospitals in Chennai do a tightrope walk||With the active caseload surging past 25,000 in Chennai on Sunday, it is a tightrope walk for government hospitals in the city. Hospitals are focusing on triaging patients and are taking up work to increase the bed strength. In all, the five major government hospitals in Chennai have 4,368 beds for patients with COVID-19. As on April 18, 3,002 beds were occupied, with the Government Corona Hospital at Guindy running to full capacity. A number of patients are waiting for admission depending on discharges. “We have been running to capacity for some time now. Our admissions depend on discharges. We have a COVID-19 Care Centre near our campus at NTSI, Guindy. So, we are triaging patients and sending those with mild symptoms, asymptomatic patients, young patients with no co-morbidities to the CCC while keeping the beds for those with moderate and severe illness,” K. Narayanasamy, Director of the Government Corona Hospital, said. Oxygen saturation He said doctors, who work in four batches, closely monitor the patients round-the-clock to pick up any changes in symptoms and track oxygen saturation level. “Oxygen saturation level is checked a minimum of eight times a day,” he said. At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Dean E. Theranirajan said they were working out ways to add 250 beds. “Earlier, we had 60% asymptomatic patients and 40% symptomatic cases. Now, we have more number of symptomatic patients. Many of them require oxygen and are admitted to the hospital,” he said. Crucial days Persons who come in with respiratory distress and require oxygen come on day four or five after symptoms start to develop. “Day five to nine is the critical period, and many come during this time. Those who come on the first day do not experience such severity of disease,” he said. R. Jayanthi, Dean of the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, said they had set up two separate outpatient departments and triage from Monday — one for positive patients and the other for those with suspected symptoms. “This helps streamline the outpatient department, and patients are not hassled,” she said, adding that they would certainly increase the number of beds as they get more manpower. A senior doctor in another hospital said cases were on the rise, and they were handling admissions on a day-to-day basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-hospitals-in-chennai-do-a-tightrope-walk/article34363463.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State’s tally goes past 10 lakh||Tamil Nadu’s overall COVID-19 tally surpassed 10 lakh cases on Monday, with 10,941 people testing positive for the infection. The State recorded 44 deaths, including that of a 28-year-old woman and two persons in their 30s. The State has added nearly one lakh cases in the last 13 days. It was on April 5 that the overall tally crossed nine lakh. With the fresh cases, the State has so far registered 10,02,392 cases. At present, 75,116 people are under treatment. Chennai recorded 3,347 fresh cases and 15 deaths, taking its tally to 2,86,569 and toll to 4,415. There were 970 cases in Chengalpattu, 735 in Coimbatore and 535 in Tiruvallur. While Salem recorded 359 cases, Madurai and Tiruchi recorded 328 and 303 cases respectively. Eight districts had 200-plus cases. They included Thoothukudi (288), Tirunelveli (286), Tiruppur (296), Krishnagiri (287) and Kancheepuram (240). Four of the deceased did not have co-morbidities. Among them was a 28-year-old woman who was admitted to the Kanniyakumari Medical College Hospital on April 11, and died on April 18 owing to COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure. A 35-year-old woman from Cuddalore, with morbid obesity, died at the Government Headquarters Hospital on April 17 owing to COVID-19 pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital on April 15 with complaints of fever and cough for one day and difficulty in breathing. A 36-year-old man from Chennai, who had diabetes and hypertension, was admitted to a private medical college hospital in Kancheepuram on April 11 with complaints of cough and difficulty in breathing for three days. He died on April 17 owing to COVID-19 pneumonia. The State’s toll rose to 13,157. Six lakh doses A total of 6,172 people were discharged. This took the total number of those discharged so far to 9,14,119. In the last 24 hours, 1,11,590 samples were tested. Tamil Nadu will receive six lakh doses of Covishield on Tuesday, Health Department officials said. On Monday, 76,005 people were vaccinated across the State — 35,376 people aged 45-59, 29,704 senior citizens, 7,552 frontline workers and 3,373 healthcare workers. The overall coverage has reached 48,07,148. Covishield was administered to 2,018 healthcare workers, 5,336 frontline workers, 23,079 people aged 45-59 and 19,991 senior citizens, while Covaxin was administered to 1,355 healthcare workers, 2,216 frontline workers, 12,297 people aged 45-59 and 9,713 senior citizens, according to the daily report issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/states-tally-goes-past-10-lakh/article34363058.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||More doctors to be hired for mini clinics||The Greater Chennai Corporation will recruit 42 additional doctors for mini clinics to improve COVID-19 containment in the city. Over 200 doctors were expected to be recruited for mini clinics a few months ago. Ahead of the launch of the mini clinics, the Corporation finalised a list of 198 doctors. But 42 doctors failed to join owing to the pandemic. Meanwhile, doctors in the mini clinics said they had not been paid salary for the past few months, leading to discontent among many of the newly recruited medical officers. As a result, containment activities had been affected in low-income neighbourhoods of the city. Officials said the mini clinics were the centres for COVID-19 vaccine administration in low-income neighbourhoods. Officials said more than 92 mini clinics had been converted into centres of vaccination. Testing had been intensified in mini clinics to help residents of low-income neighbourhoods. Vaccine shortage Residents in various neighbourhoods on Monday alleged that immunisation was not carried out in many centres as vaccines were not available. According to health officials, there was a supply crunch from the Government of India. “It is coming tomorrow. Six lakh doses are for the State,” said an official. In Chennai, many residents were unable to get vaccinated even at private hospitals on Monday. Over 1,470 streets have reported more than three cases. Over 400 streets have more than six cases. A total of 118 streets had reported a high case load. Such streets would be barricaded, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-doctors-to-be-hired-for-mini-clinics/article34363457.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Voluntary groups adapting to new normal||Several voluntary organisations and citizens groups engaged in environmental conservation are adopting alternative measures due to the severity of the pandemic. Weekend volunteering for various environmental causes, be it lake cleaning, tree plantation or awareness drives through wall paintings have been affected because of COVID-19 mitigation restrictions. Finding sufficient number of volunteers has become a challenge, say environmental activists. The new restrictions, including lockdown on Sundays, will delay the work. S. Sekaran, secretary of Korattur Aeri Padukappu Makkal Iyakkam, a citizens’ group dedicated to lake protection, said, “We recently launched ‘Save Korattur lake’, a 52-week campaign. We removed 300 liquor and plastic bottles and 100 sacks of garbage during a drive on a Sunday alone. We want to clean up to 6 km of the lake’s periphery to help more people use the area without hassles.” However, the number of volunteers, particularly from educational institutions, has dropped by 50%. The citizens’ group is managing the activities with teams from other voluntary organisations, he added. A few organisations plan to use machinery for clearing vegetation. S. Sameer of the Social Work Team Trust (Swott) said there had been a setback in weekend activities as students were not participating now. “We have limited the number of volunteers to 10-20 for maintaining trees planted around the lake. This would mean a delay in work. But we have to manage with available resources,” he said. A few organisations, particularly in the southern suburbs, have stopped regular weekend volunteering activities owing to the pandemic. Darwin Annadurai, founder, Eco Society India, said, “Participation has reduced considerably over the past few months as priorities have changed. Regular environmental activities have been stopped in Agaramthen and Selaiyur lakes. We seek only a few volunteers to maintain trees planted along the waterbodies.” “The absence of campaigns has aggravated issues like garbage dumping along roads in areas, including Pallavaram and Chromepet.” As an alternative, plans are afoot to employ people or provide remuneration for activities like wall painting and maintenance of saplings planted through fundraisers, he said. Officials of the Water Resources Department said requests for volunteering activities were not encouraged. “We have advised not to carry out any activities around Red Hills lake on Sundays this month. Volunteers are involved in tree maintenance efforts on other days. We monitor if they follow COVID-19 safety protocols,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/voluntary-groups-adapting-to-new-normal/article34363461.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu becomes fourth State to report over a million cases||Tamil Nadu on Monday became the fourth State, after Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka, to cross a total of one million COVID-19 cases. The number of people who have so far tested positive account for roughly 1.3% of the total population. With 10,941 cases reported on Monday, the State took just 14 days to go from nine lakh cases to 10 lakh cases. An analysis of the number of days it took to cross every one lakh case showed that this was the shortest period taken to add one more lakh to the tally, indicating the sharp rise being seen during the second wave of the pandemic. The second shortest was in July-August last year during the first wave when the State moved from two lakh cases to three lakh cases in 16 days. The highest daily tally of 6,993 cases wave was reported on July 27, 2020. Cases reported daily during the second wave, which began in the middle of March, have crossed the 10,000-mark in the past two days. The number of active cases more than tripled from 23,777 on April 5 to 75,116 on April 19. A worrying trend during the second wave is the consistent increase in the test positivity rate (TPR), even as the number of persons tested continued to increase beyond one lakh. Tamil Nadu reported a TPR of 9.99% on Monday. Tamil Nadu stood 11th in the number of tests performed per million (TPM) population. With a TPM of 2.69 lakh, the total number of tests conducted so far accounted for more than 25% of the population. The State has relied completely on RT-PCR tests, unlike most other States that opted for antibody tests too. Though the State had a relatively low overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.31%, it stood 12th in the country and the value was higher than the national average of 1.19%. Deaths have begun to increase in the past two weeks, with more than 40 deaths reported in the last two days. The last time the State reported more than 40 deaths was during October 2020. The analysis also showed that the percentage of people in the 13-60 age group testing positive had increased in the second wave after declining during the relatively lull period from November to February.  A worrying trend during the second wave is the consistent increase in the test positivity rate, even as the number of persons tested continued to increase beyond one lakh||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-becomes-fourth-state-to-report-over-a-million-cases/article34363059.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State may not exceed grain production target||Tamil Nadu’s food grain production for 2020-21 is not likely to exceed the target of 125 lakh tonnes. Officials of the Agriculture Department attribute the possible under-performance to the adverse impact of Cyclones Nivar and Burevi, which struck the State in November and December last year, and the unseasonal rain in February this year. According to data compiled after the second estimate, the overall figure is 108.26 lakh tonnes. The third estimate figures, which are likely to come out by September, will include the production achieved through crops that have been planted after the Samba season and are expected to be harvested in the coming months. For 2019-20, the figure went up from 101.02 lakh tonnes (after the second estimate) to 115.02 lakh tonnes (after the third). If a similar pattern occurs, the tally may touch around 120 lakh tonnes. But for the natural calamities, the production would have exceeded the target because, in terms of area under paddy, the State had exceeded the target by about 3.75 lakh hectares, the officials said. Compared with the targeted 16.515 lakh hectares, the coverage was 20.256 lakh hectares. This was nearly 1.3 lakh hectares more than what was recorded during 2019-20. As for the total food grains, including millets and pulses, 38.33 lakh hectares were covered as against the target of 37.75 lakh hectares. Again, this was around 1.66 lakh hectares higher than the 2019-20 figure. Meanwhile, the State stood on top for the second year in succession in micro-irrigation coverage. Under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), it achieved coverage of about 2.14 lakh hectares during 2020-21 with an expenditure of Rs. 1,314 crore, including the State’s share, said a senior official monitoring the implementation of the scheme aimed at promoting the “more crop per drop” concept. According to the PMKSY website maintained by the Central Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, the total coverage nationwide last year was around 6.48 lakh hectares, accounting for 68.45% of the target. Tamil Nadu could cover only about 71% of the target of 3 lakh hectares. The official, while explaining the reason, pointed out that while determining the target for Tamil Nadu, the Union government authorities had fixed a greater area under drip irrigation than what was assigned for sprinkler. Of the assigned area, 70% was earmarked for drip and the rest for sprinkler. At the end of the year, the State had exceeded the target for sprinkler by about 5,000 hectares (approximately 95,434 hectares). But its performance in drip irrigation was about 56%, with around 1.19 lakh hectares covered. The adverse impact of COVID-19 was a reason for the under-performance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-may-not-exceed-grain-production-target/article34363056.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai hospital performs liver transplant on 3-year-old girl||A three-year-old girl underwent liver transplant surgery without blood transfusion at a city hospital recently. Milana, from Ukraine, was brought to Rela Hospital in a critical condition. Her family belongs to Jehovah’s Witnesses, followers of a Christian faith that prohibits use of blood or blood products during treatment. The family requested that the surgery be performed without blood transfusion. Hospital chairman Mohamed Rela said, “With liver failure, blood does not clot. So during the transplant we need to transfuse blood and blood products. But in this case, the child was prepared for liver transplant with medication to improve her anaemia and later taken for transplant. Meticulous care was taken during surgery to reduce blood loss. We managed to perform the liver transplant successfully without blood transfusion.” Birth defect Milana was born with biliary atresia, a birth defect where the bile duct connecting the liver and intestine is not formed. “It occurs in one in 10,000 births. If the condition is diagnosed within 60 days of birth, surgery can be performed to clear the jaundice and protect the baby from undergoing a transplant,” said Naresh Shanmugam, director, women and child health, and senior consultant of paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology. Milana’s father Boris said she was suffering from liver disease for more than two years. “We travelled across Europe but no doctor gave assurance on the transplantation without blood transfusion. Then we came to know about Rela Hospital from our friends and they saved our child’s life. We are grateful to the medical team for their efforts and obeying our belief,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-hospital-performs-liver-transplant-on-3-year-old-girl/article34363478.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Doctors want term of insurance to be extended||The Service Doctors and Post Graduates Association has written to the Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan seeking Rs. 50 lakh insurance cover for doctors and healthcare workers who died due to COVID-19 in 2020 as was announced. Last year, the Centre had announced compensation for healthcare and frontline who die on the line of duty due to the infection. The Centre had announced the “Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package” insurance scheme for health workers fighting COVID-19 on March 30, 2020, for a period of 90 days. It was extended for another 90 days and then for another six months. The scheme provides insurance cover to healthcare providers, including community health workers, who are required to be in direct contact and care of COVID-19 patients putting them at risk of infection. It also includes accidental loss of life due to the infection. The scheme covers all healthcare staff in private and government service and is over and above insurance cover that the beneficiary may avail himself of. An appeal to PM Meanwhile, in a letter, the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association has requested the Prime Minister to intervene to extend the life insurance for healthcare professionals and frontline workers. Life insurance cover for these categories is due to expire on April 23. Withdrawing the insurance may lead to hesitancy in some of the cadre, the association said, seeking the Prime Minister’s intervention in the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-doctors-want-insurance-term-extended/article34363089.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||TNERC levies surcharge on open access consumers||The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) has said that the open access consumers (who buy power directly from third parties without depending on State utility) have to pay an additional surcharge of Rs. 0.7 per unit to Tangedco for the period April 16-September 30, 2021. Open access concept allows consumers like industrial users and commercial buildings to buy cheaper power directly from private generators. The move is aimed at increasing competitiveness and efficiency in the power sector and the loss of revenue suffered by Tangedco due to open access mode was compensated through the levy of a cross-subsidy surcharge. In its petition before TNERC, Tangedco said it has tied up a capacity of 21,654 MW, taking into account the overall growth, and therefore tied up power for upcoming consumers as well. However, it pointed out that since open access consumers were not using power supply from Tangedco, some of the tied up generation capacity remains stranded, but it has to pay fixed (capacity) charges to the generators as per the power purchase agreement entered with them even if it is not utilised. Tangedco said the stranded capacity had caused under-recovery of fixed cost. It claimed the stranded capacity to be 609.56 MW, which resulted in fixed charges of Rs. 8,521.41 crore for the period October 2019 to March 2020. As per the petition, Tangedco pegged the net stranded fixed charges recoverable from open access consumers at Rs. 243.1 crore and sought levy of additional surcharge at Rs. 1.23 per unit. After considering the plea of Tangedco and comments of various stakeholders, the TNERC said as per rules, additional surcharge shall become applicable only if the obligation of the licensee (Tangedco) in terms of power purchase commitments has been and continues to be stranded. If fixed costs due to stranded capacity are recovered from open access consumers, that burden would be loaded on to other consumers of Tangedco through a tariff hike, which would be unfair and unwarranted, it added. The TNERC arrived at an average stranded capacity of 557.55 MW and fixed cost of Rs. 7,702.27 crore and net stranded fixed charges recoverable from open access consumers of Rs. 190.06 crore. Based on it, TNERC arrived at an additional surcharge of Rs. 0.85 per unit and said it is comparable with other States, which ranged from Rs. 0.52-Rs. 1.3 per unit. However, it said if the additional surcharge is fixed at Rs. 0.85 per unit, the all inclusive price of electricity may be higher than the electricity tariff now chargeable to the consumer by Tangedco. So, it decided to levy 80% of additional surcharge calculated, i.e Rs. 0.7 per unit which shall be recoverable from open access consumers. The TNERC also directed Tangedco to file a petition to determine the applicability of additional surcharge on a six-month basis. It also told Tangedco to strive to maintain the optimum availability of power so as to avoid the payment of fixed charges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnerc-levies-surcharge-on-open-access-consumers/article34363481.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation reopens COVID-19 tele-counselling centre||The city is reporting over 3,200 cases every day, 1,000 more than last year’s peak, Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash said. Stressing the need for tightening regulations to contain the spread of COVID-19, he said the civic body was taking steps to restrict indoor activity and impose local restrictions. With the surge, the Corporation had permitted 80% of the 20,000 active cases to be under home isolation. The COVID-19 Control Room and Tele-Counselling Centre for assisting residents, which was shut last December after cases in the city reduced to less than 100, have been reopened. Residents under home isolation are requested to call the centre for assistance. Trained volunteers will answer calls on helplines 044-46122300 or 044-25384520 and help them in all aspects of COVID-19 management. Last year, the Corporation handled 4 lakh calls. “Residents of all the 200 wards of the Corporation will get answers for all questions, including ones on vaccination. Residents can call the number during an emergency to get assistance in reaching hospitals. They can even get information regarding precautions for COVID-19,” Mr. Prakash said. Volunteers will work three shifts at the COVID-19 control room. Residents can also ask questions about testing, vacancies in hospitals, essential medicine availability, disinfection of neighbourhoods, COVID-19 waste disposal, and emergency and psychological support for patients. “The centre will build confidence among residents that they will get help all the time,” the Corporation Commissioner said. “Traders have made representations against restrictions. We have to regulate to bring discipline during the pandemic. We will lock and seal the premises if violations continue for the second time after officials collect fine,” Mr. Prakash said. Restrictions in 240 playfields are expected shortly. Currently, 475 streets have registered more than three cases, 363 streets have more than six cases and 108 streets have more than 108 cases. “The streets with more than 10 cases will almost be like a sealed area. All streets will not be restricted as there may be public unrest,” he said. Pointing to the 3 lakh stock availability of vaccines in the city, he said 60% of the eligible age group had been vaccinated. “We will achieve complete coverage by the end of July.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-reopens-covid-19-tele-counselling-centre/article34363745.ece

Two persons involved in the murder were arrested on Sunday. A police official of the K.K. Nagar station said N. Kasiviswanathan was engaged in painting jobs. The 30-year-old painter, after having consumed liquor, was sleeping in an autorickshaw when two persons in an inebriated condition hit him with a spanner. He died on the spot. The accused — M. Sundar and V. Paramaguru — were later arrested by the police based on CCTV footage. The duo killed Kasiviswanathan since he had threatened Sundar and told him to withdraw a manhandling complaint filed against his friend Sureshkumar at the MGR Nagar police station in March. To avenge the insult, Sundar and Paramaguru attacked Kasiviswanathan. The police sent the body to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital for post-mortem examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/painter-killed-during-spat-two-arrested/article34363470.ece
20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||IIT-Madras filed 184 patents in 2020||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) have filed 184 patents during the year 2020, including 65 international ones. Nine of the patents were related to COVID-19 for inventions to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2); a standalone portable single-use wireless ventilator system, a system for non-invasive calibration-free blood pressure measurement and sustainable devices to treat infectious masks and PPE waste. Patents were filed in fields such as 5G, telecommunication, sensors and instrumentation. According to IIT-M officials, the number of patents had risen steadily since 2017 when 22 patents were filed. The number of international patents had tripled in just four years to 65 during 2020. The officials attribute the rise in patent filing to initiatives of the Centre for Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research (ICSR), such as a dedicated intellectual property cell. It conducted awareness programmes for students and faculty members. During the lockdown, the cell took all activities online. ICSR Dean Ravindra Gettu said, “The innovations at the institute have resulted in the filing of 184 patents during 2020. The extensive research related to COVID-19 has led to the institute short-listing nine Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) to be filed during 2020.” Virtual Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) meetings helped applicants seek patent protection internationally for their inventions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iit-madras-filed-184-patents-in-2020/article34363476.ece

It also ordered that the buildings have facilities, such as ramps and elevators, and that every effort be made to establish the special counters as early as possible. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy issued the directions while disposing of a public interest litigation petition filed by polio survivor Meenakshi Balasubramanian of Chennai. The litigant had said the differently abled were highly vulnerable, running the risk of contracting COVID-19 at least six times more than others.  Earlier, State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan informed the Bench that Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan had written to the Centre on March 17 seeking permission to vaccinate the differently abled on priority. In that letter, the present case had also been mentioned. However, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had not replied so far, he said. Mr. Jayaprakash Narayanan also said the State government would form special queues for the differently abled at all vaccination centres if the court directed it to do so. He said the State had only a small percentage of the differently abled people, and hence there would not be any impediment to their vaccination on priority.

20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Modi must resign, says VCK chief Thol. Thirumavalavan||VCK president Thol. Thirumavalavan on Sunday demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi take moral responsibility for the loss of thousands of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic due to his “utterly inept handling of this public health crisis”, and resign immediately. In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan noted that Mr. Modi continued to campaign in West Bengal, drawing huge crowds, in spite of a huge increase in COVID-19 infections across the country. “The scale of the devastation caused by this second wave greatly exceeds that of the first wave. In the interim period, vaccines have been discovered to fight the virus, and India leads the world in vaccine production. If vaccines made in India were administered to the people in a proper and timely manner, such massive loss of lives could have been averted. However, without any care for the people of India, Mr. Modi was paying more attention to exporting Indian vaccines to other countries and to his election rallies,” he said. The VCK leader said the State governments were not being allowed to take decisions independently as their hands were tied. “If the State governments had been allowed to directly procure vaccines, the scale of damage could have been restricted. The PMGKP insurance scheme, created to provide insurance coverage to healthcare providers, including doctors and community health workers, has also been stopped by the Modi government since March 24. This is another example which shows the Modi government does not care about people’s lives,” he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said the Prime Minister “does not have any long-term vision for handling the COVID-19 pandemic”. Demanding his resignation, Mr. Thirumavalavan said, “If Mr. Modi continues as the Prime Minister, it will further endanger the lives of Indians. His disregard for people’s lives has already caused enormous loss of life, a public health emergency and a financial emergency.”  The scale of the devastation caused by this second wave greatly exceeds that of the first wave||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/modi-must-resign-says-vck-chief-thol-thirumavalavan/article34363747.ece

In February 2020, TNRERA directed the developer to refund the sale consideration of about Rs. 15.17 lakh, along with interest of 10.15% per annum, and pay compensation of Rs. 1 lakh to P. Murugan for non-delivery of a row house flat in its project Villagio in Padappai, Kanchivakkam, Kancheepuram. Execution petition Mr. Murugan moved an execution petition before the authority, stating that the developer had not complied with its order. G. Saravanan, adjudicating officer, TNRERA, noted that since the amount due to the complainant was yet to be recovered as arrears of land revenue, it was just and necessary to issue a warrant under Section 40(1) of the RERA Act, read with Rule 26 of the TNRERA Rules. He also directed the recovery warrant to be sent to the District Collector to collect the due in favour of the home buyer. According to a source, the Collector will now serve a notice to Vivendi Ventures to pay the claims and if it does not, the properties would be attached or auctioned to recover the dues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnrera-orders-recovery-warrant-against-builder-for-not-refunding-a-home-buyer/article34363746.ece

20 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC orders notices to Stalin, DMK MLAs||The Madras High Court on Monday ordered notices, returnable by June, to DMK president M.K. Stalin and many other legislators on writ appeals preferred by the Tamil Nadu Assembly Secretary and its Privileges Committee, challenging a single judge’s order which set aside fresh show cause notices issued to the legislators last year for having displayed banned gutkha sachets in the House in July 2017. Justices M.M. Sundresh and R.N. Manjula chose to order notices after Advocate General Vijay Narayan said the proceedings of the Committee of Privileges could be continued even after the expiry of the present Assembly. Special senior counsel for the government A.L. Somayaji said that there was every possibility of the same government continuing for another term and hence the appeals would gain relevance. The explanations were given since the polling for the Assembly election had already been conducted on April 6 and the counting of votes is expected to be carried out on May 2. Though the appeals were within days after Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana quashed the show cause notices on February 10, they got listed for admission only on Monday. Allowing a batch of writ petitions filed by the legislators, the single judge had set aside the fresh show cause notices issued to them by the Committee of Privileges in September 2020. The original notices issued in 2017 were quashed by a Division Bench of the court in August 2020 with liberty to proceed further if the committee was still of the view that any of the privileges of the House had been breached. On the strength of such liberty, the Committee issued fresh notices but they did not find favour with the single judge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-orders-notice-to-dmk-mlas-on-plea-by-privileges-panel/article34363480.ece

Alagiri questioned the Central government on Monday over the lack of preparedness for the second wave of COVID-19. “The Centre failed to set up enough medical infrastructure in the country during the first wave itself. Today, for every 10,000 patients, India has only nine hospitals and eight doctors. At present, 80% of the people have not got any health insurance and 68% of citizens do not get proper and adequate medical attention,” he charged. Mr. Alagiri pointed out that while oxygen manufacturing facilities were given approvals in 162 districts across the country in October 2021, the government did not sanction the Rs. 202 crore that had been allotted to them. It was due to this delay by the government that there is an oxygen short supply, he said. He criticised the government for holding the Kumbh Mela in Uttarakhand. If Prime Minister Narendra Modi failed to take decisive action to save the lives of citizens, the BJP government would have to face severe consequences, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alagiri-warns-modi-govt-over-second-wave/article34363054.ece

20 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Stage artistes, troupe musicians demand COVID-19 relief||Stage artistes and troupe musicians have sought financial relief from the State Government saying that the COVID-19 lockdown had affected their livelihood. Carrying their music instrument and dressed up as various characters, the artistes who went to the Coimbatore Collectorate on Monday said the lockdown imposed in March 2020 had impacted their income in that they had no bookings to play at events or festivals. The Government should therefore come to their help by allowing functions or events to be held with COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and giving financial relief to their members, they said. The stage artistes too placed a similar demand. The Kovai Mavatta Medai Nadana Kalaithurai Sangam treasurer Jayanthi Anandakumar said in a year, the artistes had bookings for only six months starting April, when many temple festivals were held. The lockdown imposed by the Central Government in March 2020 had hit hard their livelihood. As the artistes were getting back on their feet, the new restriction imposed a couple of days ago had come as a blow. Ms. Anandakumar said the State Government that had permitted 50% occupancy in cinemas and restricted entry in shopping malls and big shops should consider similar relaxations for temple festivals and other socio-cultural events. The only relief that the Government had given the artistes was the Rs. 2,000 given to all PDS (ration) card holders, and the Rs. 5,000 it gave to artistes had not reached all. Therefore, the Government should consider extending financial assistance to all registered artistes to help them overcome the impact of the second wave of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stage-artistes-troupe-musicians-demand-covid-19-relief/article34363497.ece
20 April 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore choreographer makes music video for Dhoni||A Coimbatore-based choreographer has released a music video he made with his students as a tribute to cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni and the Chennai Super Kings (CSK), the team led by him in the Indian Premier League (IPL). B. Madhan, who has been running a private dance school in R.S. Puram for 11 years, said he had been a fan of Mr. Dhoni for over a decade. “We wanted to do something like this during the last IPL, but, unfortunately, CSK did not perform well at that time,” he said. Having wanted to do the music video for this IPL season, Mr. Madhan roped in his students Nighil Shiv and Shaarodh J. Thumati to handle the lyrics and music composition respectively, while he choreographed the dance sequences. The music video titled “Merattal” features seven dancers including Mr. Madhan wearing CSK's iconic yellow jerseys. The seven dancers signify Mr. Dhoni's jersey number, he noted. Having prepared for the song for nearly six months, the 32-year-old Mr. Madhan said that the team ran into issues due to the COVID-19 restrictions. “The parents of my students were initially hesitant to send them for the video shoot due to the COVID-19 situation,” he recalled. Upon fixing the location for the shooting on a private school campus at Kalapatti, he recalled that the team began the shooting early in the morning, so that the school’s functioning was not disturbed. With the shoot wrapping up earlier in April, the music video was released on various social platforms on Sunday. The comments and responses have been encouraging so far, Mr. Madhan said. On whether CSK will bag the IPL trophy this season, he said “Definitely, CSK will win this time. Players like Suresh Raina and Sam Curran are in good form this season. Whatever Dhoni does will be correct”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-choreographer-makes-music-video-for-dhoni/article34363091.ece

But given the restriction imposed on such events due to the COVID-19 spread, the number of events had become few and far between, impacting their income.

20 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Panchayat officials unaware of new building plan approval rules, reveals RTI reply||The Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department is unaware of the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019 and the Department of Housing and Urban Development order delegating building plan approval power for residential buildings to panchayats, replies from the Department officials to a series of Right to Information (RTI) queries have revealed. The rules framed by the Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department in February 2019 have allowed local bodies to approve building plans for five years and thereafter give a one-time extension of three years. Unaware of the rules, village panchayats that come under the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department have been giving plan approval with only one-year validity. Likewise, the panchayats are giving plan approval for residential buildings measuring only 2,000 sq.ft., when the Department of Housing and Urban Development has delegated powers to the rural local bodies to approve of plans for buildings measuring up to 10,000 sq.ft. Prior to this, the Directorate of Town and Counting Planning had increased the approval powers to 4,000 sq.ft. in 2010 and 7,000 sq.ft. in 2019. This came to light when consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon filed an RTI application and followed it up with a series of applications to officials in the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department, starting from panchayat secretary to assistant director to the Commissioner of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj in the Department. Finally, when the issue reached the office of the Commissioner, the reply was that the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019 applied to all village panchayats. But, on the question of period of plan approval, Commissionerate chose to forward the RTI query to its subordinate officers. Commenting on the issue, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said the RTI replies had exposed how each State Government departments functioned in silos, unaware of the rules and regulations framed by the other. In this case, having admitted that the Rules applied to the panchayats, the Commissionerate should have taken care to reply to the period of approval, but simply chose to forward the RTI query to assistant directors, who, in turn, forwarded it to block development officers and they, in turn, to panchayat secretaries. It was only in an RTI appeal that the Commissionerate chose to reply that the period of approval was five years. The ignorance cost the public more than the officials, who, unaware of the rules, would have made the applicants to apply every year for plan approval extension or directed them to another office for approval of plan of a building measuring more than 2,000 sq.ft. Therefore, the Government should put in place a system where the orders of one department reached another, in public interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/panchayat-officials-unaware-of-new-building-plan-approval-rules-reveals-rti-reply/article34363490.ece

20 April 2021||DHARMAPURI,TAMIL NADU||Ease restrictions to enable revival of business, say service providers for weddings, functions||The Tamil Nadu Hire Goods Owners Association that includes an umbrella of service providers for wedding parties and festivals, has appealed for the easing of COVID-19 restrictions to enable them to eke out a living during the pandemic. The service providers that include sound and lighting organisers, generators and pandal organisers, cooking utensil providers and stage decorators among others, took out a rally to the Dharmapuri Collectorate on Monday, demanding the easing of restrictions along the lines of relaxations provided for movie halls and industrial establishments. According to the Hire Goods Owners Association, the renewed restrictions on wedding parties and festivities at religious places has put a strain on the business of service providers, who have just picked up work after a year-long lull forced by COVID-19. In the wake of the spike in new cases, the government has restricted wedding parties and banned temple festivals to stem the spread of the pandemic. However, the association has stated that the restrictions are selective, allowing for the operation of movie halls and industrial establishments with 50% capacity. Similarly, wedding halls should be allowed to be opened to host weddings to 50% capacity, which in turn would generate employment for the ancillary service providers, who are dependent on weddings and festivals. The array of services represented by the association find business especially in summers, when temple festivals are scheduled. While last year, the start of the lockdown killed the businesses of ancillary services, the continuance of similar restrictions would hurt prospects of the revival of businesses, the association has said. The members of the association held a similar rally in Krishnagiri before dropping off a petition at the Collectorate here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ease-restrictions-to-enable-revival-of-business-say-service-providers-for-weddings-functions/article34363093.ece

The members of various associations urged the government to lift the ban on tourists. With the increase in the number of cases, the State government imposed the ban on the entry of tourists to hill stations like Yercaud, Kodaikanal and Udhagamandalam in order to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. The members of the hotel owners, traders and other associations of Kodaikanal said that the people of the hill station were dependent on tourism. The months of April and May were the peak months for tourism in Kodaikanal, they said. The Hotel Owners Association said that the stakeholders of the tourism industry had already suffered due to the COVID-19 lockdown that was imposed last year to contain the spread of the pandemic. The members were financially hit as a result of the tourism ban, they said. Tourism was the main source of income for the people of Kodaikanal. If the tourists are not allowed to visit the hill station, it will further weaken the already financially hit people of the hill station, said S.

20 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Districts geared up to tackle night curfew’||The Collectors and Superintendents of Police in the southern districts have jointly announced the "plan of action" ahead of the stricter restrictions in view of the rising COVID-19 cases on Monday. The State government had imposed night curfew and also total lockdown on Sunday in a bid to contain the spread of the virus, which is gaining fast pace in many districts in Tamil Nadu. Sivaganga Collector P Madhusudan Reddy and SP M.

The curfew, which would be in effect from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., should be strictly enforced by the personnel. He appealed to the public to cooperate and fight the virus. The public places, such as markets and restaurants, shall have only 50 % of capacity. Marriage hall owners have already been briefed about the need for physical distancing of the guests. Any negligence would be viewed seriously and the premises sealed, if warranted. In Ramanathapuram, Collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver and SP E. Karthik told reporters that the beaches in the district would be out of bounds for the public. Similarly, pilgrims or tourists travelling in private cabs should not travel during the curfew hours. Strict compliance alone would ensure the official machinery to fight the virus, they said and added that public can contact 7708711334, 7708292732, 7708357835 and 7708925833 round-the-clock for any COVID-19 related information or emergencies.

20 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Allow weddings with 50% of hall’s capacity, say service providers||Madurai District Hire Goods Owners Association petitioned the Collector here on Monday, urging the government to allow weddings with 50% of the hall’s capacity. Service providers, including sound and light organisers, stage decorators, cooking utensils providers and ‘pandal’ organisers were some of the service providers who were members of the Association. According to its treasurer P. Chandran, the members earn most of their income during April, May and June. Hundreds of people and their families are solely dependent on this business for their income. The new restrictions on wedding parties and festivities at religious places has put a strain on the business of service providers, who have just picked up work after last year's lull forced by COVID-19. In the wake of the spike in new cases, the government has restricted the number of participants in a wedding to 100. “Since there is restriction in number of participants in weddings, families are opting for low-key weddings. Hence, many of the orders have been cancelled following the announcement of the restriction," said Mr. Chandran. “While cinemas are allowed to screen movies with an occupancy of 50%, the government must allow weddings to be held with 50% capacity of the wedding hall,” he added. Only if restrictions were eased will the livelihood of service providers will improve. While last year, the start of the lockdown killed the businesses of ancillary services, the continuance of similar restrictions would hurt prospects of the revival of businesses, the association has said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allow-weddings-with-50-of-halls-capacity-say-service-providers/article34363583.ece

A release from its president N. Jegatheesan said many auspicious events planned for this Sunday were in jeopardy due to the imposition of full lockdown. Meanwhile, the State Chief Election Commissioner has announced that full lockdown restrictions will not be imposed on May 2, a Sunday, when counting of votes will take place.

The government should not impose any restrictions this Sunday and allow weddings to be conducted as planned, by following the Safety Operating Procedure laid down by the government. Perishable goods The government must exempt wholesale trade of perishable commodities such as vegetables, fruits and flowers during night hours by following safety precautions as the business is predominantly done during night hours. If such permission is not granted, huge quantities of perishable commodities such as vegetables, fruits and flowers would be damaged and these businesses will face huge losses. Further, the Prime Minister and the Union Health Department must permit State governments to directly purchase COVID-19 vaccines under the Disaster Management Act, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/exempt-april-25-from-lockdown/article34363067.ece

A taluk office was already constructed on the temple land in Tenkasi district. A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S.

The judges issued a show cause notice to the authorities on the takeover of the land for the construction of Taluk office. The court was hearing the petition filed by M. Sankarapandian of Tenkasi district. In his public interest litigation petition, Mr. Sankarapandian said that the Navaneethakrishna Swamy Temple dates back to over 1,000 years. Without following proper land acquisition laws, three acres of the temple land was acquired to build a taluk office in 2002. There was no proper compensation paid, the petitioner said. Under these circumstances, authorities were trying to acquire two more acres of the temple land to establish a taluk-level government hospital, he said.

20 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Allocate more medicines, ex-CM tells PM||Former Chief Minister and Congress leader V. Narayanasamy has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking increased allocation of medicines and funds to rein in the pandemic. He also urged the Centre to remove the age stipulation for vaccination and allow the States to administer vaccines to anyone who wants them. (Later in the day, the Centre announced that from May 1, everyone above 18 years of age can get vaccinated.) Addressing the media, the Congress leader said the official machinery in Puducherry, which was under President’s rule, should step up to the challenge of tackling the second wave of COVID-19. There were critical gaps in the monitoring of patients in home isolation, he claimed, adding that top officials should be assigned to the field and health teams should undertake door-to-door visits, a practice followed by the the previous government that had been able to keep a tight leash on the spread of the virus. Wondering how many of the 81 sites identified as hotspots had been effectively barricaded as micro-containment zones so far, Mr. Narayanasamy stressed that the administration had to strike a balance between saving lives and livelihoods. He pointed out that there were an estimated 3,800 home isolation patients across the Union Territory and about 3,000 in Puducherry alone, who were not being closely followed up with. As a result, many patients were reaching hospitals with advanced medical conditions, and there had also been an increase in fatalities. He also sought better utilisation of available hospital beds by admitting more patients so that the mortalities could be brought down. He called for increasing testing, and wanted the health authorities to ensure the availability of swab test results in 24 hours instead of three days, as was the case now, to reduce transmission risk. Congress MP V. Vaithilingam flagged the issue of inadequate medical facilities and testing in rural areas. Health infrastructure in hospitals in rural areas should also be ramped up, he said. Puducherry PCC president A.V. Subramanian urged the administration to take steps to ensure uniform availability of medicines and medical oxygen in the wake of the sharp spike in COVID-19 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allocate-more-medicines-ex-cm-tells-pm/article34363698.ece

20 April 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||Bodies swapped at Theni govt. hospital||In a shocking incident, the staff in the Government Medical College and Hospital here allegedly swapped the bodies of two persons, which came to light on Monday. Four days ago, a 71-year-old man identified as Ayyavoo of Batlagundu in Dindigul district had fainted near the bus stop. Immediately, the police there had rushed him to the GH, where the doctors referred him to be treated at Theni Government Medical College Hospital. After two days of treatment, the patient had died. Since the admission was categorised as medico-legal case, the post-mortem had to be conducted for which the relatives consent was mandatory. Under such circumstances, there was the body of one Ramu of Periakulam lying in the mortuary. When the relatives of the deceased Ramu came there, the mortuary staff reportedly handed over Ayyavoo's body to them, which was taken to the graveyard and cremated by them. As the relatives of Ayyavoo assembled on Monday to receive the body and take it to their home for performing the last rites, the staff at the mortuary initially said that the body was not there. As the relatives threatened to resort to agitation, the police arrived at the spot. Inquiries by ADSP Sankaran revealed that some staff at the mortuary had by mistake handed over Ayyavoo's body to the relatives of Ramu (also the deceased, whose body was in the morgue). As the faux pas came to light, the relatives of Ayyavoo were persuaded to collect the ashes from the crematorium following which the issue was solved. Meanwhile, the Collector H Krishnanunni said that he would look into the issue and directed the Dean of the hospital to conduct an inquiry. The relatives of Ayyavoo appealed to the Health department officials to be more alert and vigilant as it hurt them badly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bodies-swapped-at-theni-gh/article34363078.ece
20 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 testing facility feels the pressure||As the number of COVID-19 cases is on an upward climb in the district, testing facilities, especially at the K. A. P. Viswanatham Government Medical College (KAPVGMC) are feeling the weight of the increasing workload. While the team processing the tests was sizeable last year, many have returned to their regular duties, while those appointed on contract-basis were also relieved of the duty. The number of samples lifted across the district, on an average day is around 4,500 per day. The testing facility at the KAPVGMC can process 1,600 tests at once, which means they are doing the same routine at least three times. With the Post-Graduate students preparing for upcoming examinations, the laboratory is looking for a boost in manpower. In 2020, nearly 80 people were deputed to the team, however, with the resumption of other testing units including a TB-culture facility at the college, they have all returned to resume their initial responsibilities, doctors said. Members appointed through the National Health Mission too, left after their contract period was completed. Around 30 team members are running the show now, putting in long hours, sources said. While a few private laboratories continue to conduct and process COVID-19 tests, a large number of the load is borne by the KAPVGMC facility. “Only those whose family members had tested positive earlier, or people with travel requirements go to private facilities. Nearly 90% of the samples are processed at the testing facility at the medical college,” a senior health official said. Speaking to The Hindu , Gnanaguru Pichaimani, Head, Department of Microbiology at the KAPVGMC, said that he has written a request letter via the District Collector and the Dean to the Health Secretary seeking more hands. He also plans to convene a coordination meeting on a planned way of executing sample collection. “Instead of taking nasal swabs at random locations, the authorities must plan and execute selectively. Areas where patients have already tested positive, areas with a high viral load must be focussed,” he said. Due to the unpredictable nature of the samples, they are also unable to conduct pooled testing. “Even if one of the samples in the pool show positivity, then all of it must be re-tested,” he said.  Instead of taking nasal swabs at random locations, the authorities must plan and execute selectively Gnanaguru Pichaimani Head, Department of Microbiology at the KAPVGMC||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-testing-facility-feels-the-pressure/article34363042.ece
20 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 restrictions trigger unease among migrant workers||The COVID-19 lockdown restrictions announced by the State Government with effect from April 20 is understood to have caused unease among migrant/guest workers in Tiruchi district. The fear of getting stranded has gripped the minds of the workers, according to proprietors of fabrication units in industrial estates in the district. Though the number of guest workers is much lesser in Tiruchi district, when compared to Karur and other districts in the Western part of the State, their presence is of huge advantage for the industries here from the point of view of productivity. “There was an exodus during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and many returned subsequently. There should be at least 1,500 workers from North-Indian States employed by industries in Tiruchi,” R. Ilango president of Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries' Association said. Night curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. and a complete lockdown on Sundays may not be severe for the workers for now. And, the Railways has assured continuity of services. “Yet, there is a sense of unease among the North Indian workforce as there is no certainty about how things will pan out,” Mr. Ilango said. The practice of industry proprietors in Tiruchi region is to arrange for accommodation of the workers either inside the premises of the factories or in the vicinity so as to ensure that they are able to work conveniently for long hours. They usually work overtime, and are relatively more productive, according to a proprietor of a manufacturing unit in the SIDCO Industrial Estate at Thuvakudi. The workers live in groups and cook food by themselves to cut down expenditure so as to support their families in their home States. Their single-minded focus on completing tasks at workplace has a direct bearing on the productivity, he said. In the absence of regular orders from the BHEL and the escalation in the cost of steel, the fabrication units are already operating on a slender margin, and exodus of North Indian workers during the second wave of COVID-19 spread would well turn out to be the proverbial ‘last straw that broke the camel’s back’ for the industries, many proprietors fear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-restrictions-trigger-unease-among-migrant-workers/article34363027.ece
20 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Farmers stage protest against ‘steep hike’ in fertilizer price||Farmers representatives continued to register their strong protest against the ‘steep hike’ in fertilizer prices. While a delegation of farmers chose to petition the district authorities to convey their displeasure to the Centre, another group resorted to a protest in the city on Monday. The country’s largest fertiliser producer IFFCO recently revised rates for a 50 kilogram bag of Di-Ammonium Phosphate or DAP to Rs. 1,900 from Rs. 1,200, citing a surge in prices of raw materials, and other companies followed suit. Prices of other complex fertilisers were raised by 46% to 51.9%. Although, the Centre announced that price revision has been put on hold for now, farmers organisations dismiss it as an ‘eye wash’. “The hike is too steep. The government should fix the price of fertilizers as earlier (prior to decontrol of fertilizer prices),” said R. Raja Chidambaram, State Secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, who led the delegation to present a petition to the Collector. To highlight their plight, the farmers’ representatives hung empty fertilizer bags on their shoulders. The revision of prices two or three times a year not only affects farmers but also gives room for irregularities, Mr. Chidambaram contended. Earlier, the Desiya Thennindhiya Nadhigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam president P. Ayyakannu along with 44 of his outfit members was arrested after they staged a road roko on the Karur By Pass Road demanding the withdrawal of the hike in fertiliser prices. Mr. Ayyakannu who had planned to go to New Delhi to stage a demonstration in support of this demand was advised by the police personnel on Sunday evening to desist from going to the national capital in view of the spike in COVID-19 cases and due to the lockdown currently in place in the State. The police had served him a memo not to indulge in any agitation during the pandemic period, said police sources. However, Mr. Ayyakannu along with his outfit members came in a procession from his house and resorted to a road roko on Monday morning on the Karur By Pass road for about 15 minutes in support of the demand when the police personnel arrested all of them. Among those arrested included two women. Those arrested were lodged in a wedding hall. A case has been registered against Ayyakannu and the outfit members by the Woraiyur police following their arrest, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-stage-protest-against-steep-hike-in-fertilizer-price/article34363033.ece
20 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Over 1,000 industrial workers get the jab||A little over 1,000 industrial workers above 45 years have been covered so far in Tiruchi district in the COVID-19 vaccination sessions being conducted at workplaces since April 12 by the Health Department. The District Industries Centre, SIDCO and Department of Industrial Safety and Health have taken the support of industry associations to arrive at the list of workers for the immunisation exercise. As per the guidelines of the Union Health Ministry, COVID-19 vaccination sessions are conducted at work places with about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries (to facilitate optimal utilization of vaccine dosage and reduce wastage). Preventing the need for travel and thereby reducing the risk of exposure to COVID-19 virus is the rationale behind the initiative to conduct vaccination sessions at workplaces. As per the guidelines, one type of vaccine is administered to workers at such sessions to avoid mixing of vaccine in the first and second dose. In Tiruchi district, Covishield doses are being administered to industrial workers, General Manager of District Industries Centre G. Raveendran said. So far, 1,003 workers have been vaccinated at their workplaces; the highest number of 270 workers were administered vaccine at the workplace of Lion Dates Pvt. Ltd., Mr. Raveendran said. The vaccination exercise has gathered pace and the sessions have been completed in the SIDCO industrial estates at Ariyamangalam, Tiruverumbur and Vazhavanthankottai. The initiative will cover the Industrial Estate at Thuvakudi where the workers are more in number in the coming days, president of Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries' Association R. Ilango said. The TIDITSSIA president had got himself vaccinated first to motivate the workers in the industrial estates to follow suit. In a video message, District Collector S. Divyadharshini, Tiruchi Zone CII Chairman D. Senguttuvan and the Deputy Director of Health Services S. Ram Ganesh exhorted industrial workers to make the best use of the opportunity to get themselves immunised against COVID-19. The second wave of COVID-19 being more serious in nature, adherence to safety protocol has to necessarily be backed by vaccination for safeguarding lives, Mr. Senguttuvan said. The Collector said that having been administered the COVID-19 vaccine, she was certain that there would be no side effects. There was no cause for any apprehension about the efficacy of the vaccine, and industrial workers could get their doubts cleared by dialling the COVID 19 toll free number 104, Dr. Ram Ganesh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-1000-industrial-workers-get-the-jab/article34363038.ece
20 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Restaurants get ready to bear the brunt||Restrictions imposed by the State Government on transacting business with limited seating capacity have led to fall in business in restaurants to a great extent. As per the government order, restaurants and eateries can function only with 50% of their seating capacity. Though they are initially permitted to continue business up to 11 p.m., they have to down shutters at 9 p.m. from Tuesday in adherence to the night curfew. On Sundays they are permitted to offer take away services only. While cab operators, tour guides, travel agents and hotels, which are part of the hospitality industry, are yet to return to normalcy due to the impact of the nationwide lockdown and subsequent restrictions on movement of domestic and international tourists, there were signs of revival of business for restaurants over the last few months. With the new restrictions and night curfew, the business of restaurants has once again been hit. Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 over the last few weeks particularly after the State elections and the subsequent restrictions in accommodating passengers in buses, it is said that the movement of commuters had gone down to a great extent. Many people have either cancelled or postponed non essential travel. The Central Bus Stand, which is usually busy with the arrival and departure of buses carrying a large number of passengers including transit, is witnessing just half of its passengers for the last two weeks. The impact has already been felt by the restaurants. “We have no other way but to adhere to the restrictions. But we need to acknowledge that it has hit business hard,” says KMS. Hakkim, proprietor of a chain of non vegetarian restaurants in Tiruchi. Other problem that the restaurant owners face is the shortage of workers and chefs, who specialise in North Indian dishes. Anticipating a total lockdown, it is said that a section of workers from Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and other States have already returned to their native places.  We have no other way but to adhere to the restrictions. But we need to acknowledge that it has hit business hard KMS.

20 April 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||The Nilgiris closed to tourists from today||With the Nilgiris set to shut doors on tourists from April 20 to combat the spread of COVID-19, many tourists on Monday prepared to leave the hill station. The Nilgiris Collector J. Innocent Divya told journalists that based on guidelines issued by the State government (in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases), the district would be closed for tourists. “Tourists will not be allowed to enter the Nilgiris from Tuesday,” she said. However, exceptions may be given for people travelling on essential work, such as for trade, business or medical treatment, with the e-registration system set to remain in place. Last year, following the outbreak of the pandemic, the district was closed for tourists in March and continued to remain closed until September. On Monday, most of the remaining tourists in the Nilgiris prepared to cut their trips short and leave early. One hotel owner said occupancy had already been almost zero at the hotel during the weekend. “With the latest announcements, people have decided to return home before the new restrictions come into force from Tuesday onwards.” Heavy vehicles carrying goods and supplies would, however, be exempted and allowed to travel into and out of the Nilgiris, said the Collector. The Inspector of Factories had also been told to identify continuous process industries in the district, and they would be allowed to function if they sought permission from the district administration. Employees at such factories would be given special passes if the industries were given permission to keep operating. Mass gatherings had also been banned, with only 100 people being allowed to attend weddings and 50 people to attend funerals. Committees were being formed to ensure that the Standard Operating Procedures were being adhered to. Tea stalls would also be allowed to only function at 50 % capacity, with the district administration insisting that the patrons wore masks before entering and when leaving the shops, the Collector said.  Protest Following the announcement of restrictions, shopkeepers and small business owners staged a protest at Charring Cross. They said the new restrictions would mean that many businesses would have to close down permanently. “Businesses are yet to recover from the closure of the district for tourists from last year. If the summer season is again affected, and tourists are not allowed, many of the shops will have to shut down permanently and workers employed at these shops stand to lose our livelihoods,” said one of the protesters. The police rushed to the spot and held talks with the protesters. Sub-collector, Monikha Rana tried to convince them to disperse. However, the protesters continued to demand that 50 % of total tourist capacity to the Nilgiris be allowed, failing which people dependent on the tourism industry would have to find alternative livelihood. Taxi drivers in the Nilgiris also came to the Collectorate, seeking an extension to pay tax dues for their vehicles as well as loans. The drivers said another ban meant that they would be left without any source of income for the foreseeable future. The drivers submitted a petition to the Collector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-nilgiris-closed-to-tourists-from-today/article34363086.ece

Out of the 54 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines supplied to Tamil Nadu, the State has been left with only 7.41 lakh doses of Covishield and 1.75 lakh of doses of Covaxin. However, majority of Government hospitals and Primary Health Centres in all districts were denying vaccines to all the people who have registered for vaccination stating that there was acute shortage of vaccines. While some people were waiting for second doses, Mr. Tagore expressed fear that if the second dose was not given within the prescribed time due to lack of supply of vaccine, the first dose of vaccine might not have the desired effect in people to protect them from the virus. “The delay in supply of adequate quantity of vaccines would expand the radius of vulnerability with an increased number of causalities,” he said. Mr. Tagore said that authorities should make sure that vaccination is available for all the persons who have registered themselves in all hospitals and PHCs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-seeks-pms-intervention-to-ensure-covid-19-vaccine-stock/article34363074.ece

TNTC buses from Tenkasi to Tirunelveli (4 a.m. to 8 p.m.), Tenkasi to Ambasamudram (4 a.m. to 8 p.m., Tenkasi to Madurai (4 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and Tenkasi to Sankarankovil (4 a.m. to 8 p.m.) would be operated in restricted fashion. Sources in State Express Transport Corporation, which operated buses to Chennai, said their services would start from 7 a.m. “Since the duration of journey between Tirunelveli and Chennai is more than 10 hours, the last bus for Chennai from Tirunelveli would leave by 10 a.m. until further orders,” said the sources. After the judicial magistrate of the court in Valliyoor tested positive for COVID-19, the court was closed temporarily for disinfection. Since the public came in large numbers to the District Police Office and also to police stations across the district, Superintendent of Police, Kanniyakumari, V. Badri Narayanan has ordered disinfection of the places regularly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/top-priority-to-giving-second-dose/article34363740.ece

The road widening project began in 2010. Though a major portion of the work was completed, the Kalamavur ROB remained incomplete for nearly a decade as the original concessionaire of the project left the work midway. NHAI terminated the contract and awarded a separate tender in 2019 for completion and other pending works on the bypass road on the outskirts of Tiruchi. Even though the bridge remains unfinished, NHAI collects toll from users of the highway, much to their chagrin. Some consumer organisations have protested the decision and a few political parties have called for protests. The delay in opening the road overbridge remains an irritant for motorists. Thousands of people commuting between Tiruchi and Pudukottai face much hardship every day due to traffic hold-ups. The alternative road alongside the ROB is full of potholes, Mr. Thirunavukkasar said in a statement issued here. “After I was elected as MP of Tiruchi, I pressed for early completion of the ROB and pending works on the highway. Now that the the ROB has been completed, it should be opened for traffic at the earliest,” he said. Mr. Thirunavukkarasar has also urged Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to take steps for expeditious transfer of about 0.6 acre of land required for completing the first stage of the multi-level bridge near the railway junction in Tiruchi. Mr. Thirunavukkarasar, who called on Mr. Singh in New Delhi recently, urged him to order the transfer by accepting the State government’s offer of alternative land in the adjacent Tamil Nadu Special Police Grounds. He also presented a petition to the Minister highlighting the problems faced by city residents due to the incomplete ROB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/open-new-kalamavur-rob-mp/article34363024.ece
20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Seven surrender in priest murder||Seven persons wanted in connection with the murder of a temple priest near Seevalaperi in the district on Sunday have surrendered before police. Earlier, demanding immediate arrest of the armed gang that murdered the priest, Chidambaram, 45, and grievously injured his friend, Nataraja Perumal, 53, relatives of the victims and members of the Yadava community staged road roko near Tirunelveli Government Medical College Hospital on Monday. The protestors, led by Tamil Nadu Yadava Maha Sabha youth secretary Pottal Durai, also demanded compensation of Rs. 20 lakh to the murder victim’s family and government job to a family member. The agitation was withdrawn after police held talks with the protestors and assured them of the arrest of the culprits at the earliest. Tracing the circumstances leading to the attack, relatives of the victims said Sannaasi Konar, a shepherd from Kuppaikurichi near Seevalaperi, had darshan of Sudalai Maadan several decades ago when he took his cattle for grazing near Seevalaperi. He wanted to build a temple for Sudalai Maadan at the spot and sought the help of his community members, who obliged. The Sudalai Maada Saamy Temple came into existence and four families belonging to the community took turns to administer it. “However, problems cropped up between the temple administrators and another dominant community from Seevalaperi over granting permission for setting up shops during the annual festival at the temple and sacrificing goats and roosters during the celebration,” said a relative on condition of anonymity. “The enmity has resulted in the murder of the temple priest, Chidambaram alias Durai, who resisted the opposite group’s attempts to snatch the administration of the temple. Moreover, they also objected to Chidambaram setting up his shop in the temple to sell puja material. He was also instrumental in constructing a compound wall around the temple when the opposite group tried to encroach upon temple land,” he said. He also revealed that a youth from the opposite group tried to marry a girl from Yadava community, which was stopped by Chidambaram. “All these reasons have collectively led to his murder even though he wanted to settle the issue passively by discussing it at a peace meeting held on the day of the murder. It is a well-planned murder as the assailants came to the meeting with lethal weapons.” The condition of Mr. Nataraja Perumal was stated to be ‘critical’. Since the assailants and the victims hailed from different castes, tension prevailed near Seevalaperi and surrounding areas. SP N. Manivannan visited the spot on Monday again and strengthened security arrangements. Meanwhile, M. Maharajan, 23, M. Petchikutti, 23, C. Esakkimuthu, 19, A. Valathi alias Arumugam, 28, K. Maasaanamuthu, 19, K. Muthumari Durai, 19, and M. Thangapandi, 24, all from Seevalaperi, who were wanted in connection with the murder, surrendered before police on Monday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/priest-murder-seven-surrender/article34363072.ece

Arriving at the Collectorate with cone speakers and lighting systems, the petitioners led by district president of their association Dhanushkodi and secretary Selvaraj said the restrictions would spell doom to 500-odd sound system organisers, who were feeding over 2,000 families directly by giving employment to them. After last year’s festival season was washed out by the lockdown, the latest round of restrictions would wipe out the industry. Hence, the State government should relax the restrictions and give relief to workers involved in this industry, they said. A similar petition was submitted at the Thoothukudi Collectorate. The petitioners appealed to the State government to allow weddings with 50% guests. Apart from sound system organisers, the restrictions would also threaten catering, stage decoration, pandal contractors and allied businesses. While cinema halls were allowed to operate with 50% seating, similar allowance should be extended to wedding functions too considering the wellbeing of the people associated with the celebrations, the sound system organisers said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sound-system-workers-urge-collectors-to-relax-restrictions/article34363736.ece

Th inscription was found during renovation of one of the buildings on the campus of Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Nursery and Primary School. On being informed by V. Panchapakesan, school management representative, Mani. Maran, Tamil Pundit, Saraswathi Mahal Library, Thanjavur, inspected the inscription along with his associates G. Thillai Govindarajan and G. Jayalakshmi. Mr. Maran, in a press release, said the 15-line inscription standing 3.5 feet in height belonged to the period of Nayak kings who ruled Thanjavur between 1535 and 1675 AD and referred to a donation made to Singaperumal temple that was believed to have existed in Srinivasapuram and shifted to Palliagraharam area during the Nayaks rule. Though the inscription carried symbols such as sangu and chakra, there was no mention of the year or name of the donor. It read that anybody acting against the nandavanam and poonthottam donated to the temple would be deemed to have committed the sin of killing a cow on the banks of the Ganges. The inscription could have been left behind when the temple was shifted from Srinivasapuram, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nayak-era-writing-found/article34363025.ece

As the police acted swiftly, the attempt by N. Ananthan, 44, of Keezha Thattappaarai was thwarted. Mr. Ananthan, who runs a grocery shop in the same area, said he purchased a lorry for transporting cargo with loan obtained from a private bank,. As this venture caused hefty loss, he decided to sell the vehcile and the ration shop worker, Subramanian of Maappillaiyoorani near here, bought it on the condition that he would repay the remaining dues to the private bank. Hence, Mr. Subramanian paid only Rs. 45,000 to him at the time of buying the lorry. However, the hypothecation was still in the name of Mr. Ananthan. “But Mr. Subramanian did not pay the loan leaving me at the mercy of the bank that warned that my house, against which I had borrowed the loan, would be brought under distrainment proceeding,” Mr. Ananthan said. “When I asked Mr. Subramanian about non-payment of loan, he issued death threat and I filed a complaint with the police who did not take any action against him. I cannot even feed my wife and two daughters.”  Those in distress or having suicidal tendencies could seek help and counselling by calling State’s health helpline 104 or Chennai-based Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/self-immolation-bid-by-shop-owner/article34363079.ece

Speaking to reporters here after chairing a review meeting on steps taken to implement the new lockdown restrictions, Dr. Senthil Raj said action taken against COVID-19 protocol violators had ensured that 80% of the public wore masks while visiting public places. Also, anti-COVID-19 operations had moved to top gear in the district. Since 5,000 vaccine doses were at vaccination centres across the district, there was no dearth for the immunogen and any sudden spurt in demand could be managed with stocks available at the cold storage facilities Tirunelveli and Madurai. He also allayed fears and scotched rumours about “foulplay in counting centres” “We have installed 180 surveillance cameras at all vantage points of the counting centres including strong rooms where electronic voting machines were kept,” Dr. Senthil Raj said.

20 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State unprepared despite second wave warning in Nov.: Experts||Although experts had warned of the onset of a secondwave of COVID-19 in Karnataka in November 2020 itself, the State did little to keep its health infrastructure prepared. As a result, there has been a rapid surge and the situation has gone out of control, say a few experts. The State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) had, on November 30 last year, submitted a report to the government recommending that the State should, by January first week, keep ready the clinical facilities at an October 2020 level in terms of beds, ICUs, ICU-ventilators, oxygen availability, vital drugs, and other infrastructure, both in government and private hospitals, including ambulance services. “Or this should be ramped up on a short notice of 2-3 days maximum. An early recognition of second wave in the State can be done by closely monitoring the seven-day average growth rate and reproduction number at the district and State levels. The second wave of COVID-19 is expected during January-February 2021,” the report had stated. More importantly, the TAC had recommended the restriction of mass gatherings such as fairs and festivals, religious congregations, and cultural events. “Super-spreader events during December and January should be strictly restricted and events such as weddings and other social gathering should be permitted only in open areas and with an audience of not more than 100 persons. A maximum of 200 persons should be allowed at all political and public events, 50 at death ceremonies, and 20 at funerals,” the report had stated. However, the government did not consider the report seriously. “Restrictions for cinema halls have been repeatedly rolled back. If the report was taken seriously then or even in March this year and stringent measures initiated early, the situation could have been controlled,” said V. Ravi, TAC member and nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka. Another expert pointed out that declaring elections was the biggest blunder. “Elections could have been postponed... However, the State followed a wait-and-watch policy and we are seeing the consequences now,” the expert asserted. ‘People at fault’ C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer of labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said people were yet to realise the gravity of the situation. “People are going out of Bengaluru to their native places even if there is a day’s holiday. They have been participating in temple fairs, village festivals, and weddings relentlessly. If people had taken precautions and if all these were banned much earlier, we could have cut the transmission to some extent,” he said. “We now have to further reinforce our healthcare systems by providing more manpower because our health professionals are facing fatigue syndrome. They are unable to handle the pressure with cases being reported in the thousands every day,” he said. TAC member Giridhar R. Babu, who heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, tweeted, “The onset of the second wave was warned by experts in Karnataka on November 30, 2020... Government had all the time to review and prepare.” “We did not land in this situation overnight. It will not be over without devastating losses. Actions are needed now, late but still useful to save more lives. Wait and watch is not a public health strategy,” he said in another tweet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-unprepared-despite-second-wave-warning-in-nov-experts/article34363129.ece
20 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Stagnation of lexicographic work caused him concern||G. Venkatasubbaiah was nagged by one concern during his last days: work on the monumental eight-part dictionary put together over five decades by two generation of lexicographers, including himself, had stopped in 1994. It has neither been revised nor updated, while the language had changed tremendously. Every two or three decades, at least 10% new words get added to a language, he opined, and advocated that the dictionary needs to be revised, like the Oxford English Dictionary. At his centenary celebrations in 2012, he appealed for the lexicon branch of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat (KSP) to be reopened. “Hire a dozen young lexicographers and work on updating the dictionary and creating new bilingual and trilingual dictionaries,” he said, even offering to train them. While the then Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar had expressed support for the project, nothing has come of it till date. The dictionary is yet to even be digitised in an accessible manner. Though proud of his work to create the authoritative dictionary, GV, being an erudite lexicographer, was aware of its limitations too. The dictionary was created exclusively after going through 1,750 works of literature and not the spoken word. He had called for a linguistic survey of Kannada-speaking areas to fill this gap, which never happened till date. “None of the politicians are interested in such projects these days,” GV often lamented. Noted Kannada linguist K.V. Narayana, while acknowledging the towering contributions of GV, said though he identified the new challenges, he did not address them, for which age could have been a reason. “The Kannada-Kannada dictionary suffers from exclusion of the spoken word, sticking to a standard shishta Kannada and a bias towards the language spoken in the Old Mysore region,” he said. Prof. Narayana said a true tribute to GV would be to take his work forward, update it. “Probably his was the last major lexicographical work in Kannada. While there have been individual efforts like a dictionary of Kundapra Kannada, Morasunadu Kannada, Persian words in Kannada that have come out, there has been no institutional effort to build a dictionary on modern Kannada,” he said. There has been a corpus of nearly 10 million Kannada word entries created at the Central Institute of Indian Languages, which can be the base for such an effort, but has sadly remained inaccessible to Kannada scholars, Prof. Narayana lamented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/stagnation-of-lexicographic-work-caused-him-concern/article34363246.ece
20 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Lockdown in Bengaluru is now inevitable, say some experts||A complete lockdown in Bengaluru has become inevitable now to cut the transmission chain and the State government should consider it seriously, say a few COVID-19 experts. This is because the city’s health infrastructure can no longer take the load. With no availability of oxygen, ICU and ICU-ventilator beds in hospitals, it has become a scary situation, experts opine. V. Ravi, member, State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said that with the situation going out of control and cases surging beyond projections, a lockdown was inevitable in Bengaluru. TAC member Giridhar R. Babu, who heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India in Bengaluru, said a total lockdown of 14 days had become essential now to reduce the speed of transmission. “This is my opinion. We need to enhance the bed capacity by using facilities in medical colleges at the earliest,” he said. TAC recommendations Meanwhile, the TAC recommended a revision of existing night curfew timings and weekend janata curfews. All cinemas, drama theatres, and auditoriums, amusement parks, parks, arcades, video game parlours, clubs, swimming pools, gyms and sports complexes should be closed till May 31, the TAC recommended. In its report, the TAC said there should be strict enforcement of restrictions in public areas and Section 144 should be imposed with immediate effect till May 31. “The daily night curfew should be from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. and weekend janata curfews on Saturdays and Sundays from 8 p.m. of Friday till 6 a.m. of Monday. All shops, malls, shopping complexes and business establishments should remain closed. However, essential commodities and services should be provided during fixed hours. Public transport should also be restricted to the prescribed seating capacity,” the report stated. Recommending that offices and workplaces use staggered timings and work from home options, the TAC report stated that all bars and pubs should be closed. “All places of worship should remain closed to the public. However, daily rituals can be performed following strict COVID-19 protocols,” the report stated. It also said all schools and colleges (except health sciences) should remain closed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lockdown-in-bengaluru-is-now-inevitable-say-some-experts/article34363131.ece
20 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC restrains B.R. Shetty, wife from alienating movable assets||The High Court of Karnataka has granted temporary injunction restraining B.R Shetty, NRI entrepreneur and promoter of UAE-based NMC Healthcare, and his wife from alienating, transferring, dissipating, mortgaging, etc., their movable assets like shares, mutual funds, and deposits in banks. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum delivered the verdict while allowing an appeal filed by the Bank of Baroda, which had question the August 28, 2020, order of the Commercial Court, which had granted temporary injunctions in respect of only immovable properties of Mr. Shetty and his wife Chandrakumari R. Shetty. Meanwhile, the Bench dismissed the appeals filed by Mr. Shetty and Ms. Shetty challenging the Commercial Court’s order of granting temporary injunction in respect of immovable properties. The High Court said the Commercial Court was not right in denying temporary injunction in respect of movable assets merely cause the bank had furnished specific particulars of assets like shares, mutual funds, bank deposits etc. The bank was not in a position to provide these details as Mr. Shetty had failed to furnish details of all movable and immovable assets as per the undertaking given to the bank in the form of Letter of Negative Lien submitted to the bank, the High Court said, while pointing out that Mr. Shetty declined to provide details despite a notice issued by the bank to him in May 2020. The bank had filed suit before the Commercial Court seeking direction to Mr. Shetty and his wife to comply with their obligations, made in the Letter of Negative Lien, to provide details of all movable and immovable assets, create mortgage in favour of bank and not to alienate, etc. the declared assets. Mr. Shetty and the Dubai-based companies/entities controlled by him had taken loan to the tune of Rs. 2,077 crore and as on May 5, 2020, liability of him and his companies to the bank is around Rs. 1,912 crore.  The Bench dismissed the appeals filed by Mr. Shetty challenging the Commercial Court’s order of granting temporary injunction in respect of immovable properties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-restrains-br-shetty-wife-from-alienating-movable-assets/article34363254.ece

The court also noticed from details submitted by the State government that there were no toilets in 21,686 anganwadis and fans were provided only in 29,560 anganwadis across the State. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj made the observation during the hearing of a PIL petition initiated in 2011 based on a letter by one B.L. Patil of Vimochana Sangha, a Belagavi-based NGO, about children suffering from malnutrition. The Bench found that data of infrastructure in the report pointing out compliance of recommendations made by a committee, headed by then judge of the High Court N.K. Patil, which was set up in 2012 by the High Court to study the issue of malnutrition. The Bench noted from the report that though the Justice Patil committee had recommended providing pure and warm drinking water facility in every anganwadi, the government simply said that water filters had been given without providing details like whether all anganwadis have filters and types of filters. ‘Submit programme’ Meanwhile, the Bench directed the government to submit a time-bound programme to ensure all anganwadis are provided with electricity connection, fans, and children-friendly toilets. The court recently reactivated the committee, now headed by A.N. Venugopala Gowda, a retired judge of the High Court, to look into issue of malnutrition, to oversee the process of process of identification, medical examination, and treatment of malnourished children, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-expresses-shock-over-lack-of-basic-facilities-in-nearly-half-of-anganwadis/article34363244.ece

20 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Allocate Rs. 30,000 crore to health sector: DKS||Following the rapid spread of COVID-19, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar on Monday urged the State government to set aside Rs. 30,000 crore for the health sector by stopping all development works in the current financial year. In a press statement, he said the number of cases was rising and the State is facing severe shortage of ICU beds, oxygen, and Remdesivir, causing the situation to get out of control. “The government should immediately stop development works and allocate funds for taking steps on a war footing to control the spread of COVID-19,” he said. Saying that the situation was not under control despite the State having the highest number of medical colleges and medical staff, the Congress leader demanded effective utilisation of staff and resources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/allocate-rs-30000-crore-to-health-sector-dks/article34363242.ece

The issue will be discussed in the State Cabinet and the decision will be informed to the Karnataka State Election Commission, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa told presspersons here on Monday. Elections to 30 ZPs and 175 TPs were last held in February 2016. The government had postponed elections to gram panchayats for 5-6 months last year following the pandemic. Mr. Eshwarappa said there was general consensus among the department officials on postponing the elections due to sharp rise in cases. More than 3.5 crore people will have to participate in these polls. Administrators would be appointed to ZPs and TPs till the polls, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/postponement-of-zp-tp-polls-under-study/article34363251.ece

20 April 2021||Bengaluru/Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Man caught trying to sell fake Remdesivir vials||City Crime Branch (CCB) officials caught a pharma company executive trying to sell fake Remdesivir vials on the road at Shivajinagar, in Bengaluru, last Saturday. Based on a tip-off, a team raided an eyecare shop on Hospital Road in Shivajinagar and caught Syed Khaja Kaleelulla, 27, and seized five vials from him. He was trying to sell each vial for Rs. 14,500 in the black market. Kaleelulla was working with a pharma company in Wilson Garden and claimed that his colleague, identified as Mujeer, had given him the veils to sell, promising him of commission for the sale. Kaleelulla was later handed over to the Commercial Street police for further investigation, while the CCB officials seized his mobile phone. They are probing further to ascertain the source of the drugs. Meanwhile, the police have continued to track down Mujeer, who is on the run. Mysuru racket The CCB of Mysuru city police unearthed a racket of fake Remdesivir sale. A special team of the CCB, set up in the wake of growing complaints of black-marketing of Remdesivir injection amid the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, stumbled upon a large quantity of fake Remdesivir medicine in the house of Girsh, a male nurse working with a private hospital, at Vidyanagar, in Nazarbad police limits, on Monday. Briefing reporters, City Police Commissioner Chandragupta said the nurse was collecting the exhausted bottles of Remdesivir from the hospital and refilling them with Cefuroxime antibiotic and saline water before selling it to gullible buyers for an inflated price. Girish was assisted by Shivappa and Mangala, security personnel and housekeeper, respectively, at the private hospital, in gathering the exhausted bottles of Remdesivir. Girish managed to sell fake Remdesivir in the black market with the assistance of two men, identified as Prashant and Manjunath. Remdesivir has been in huge demand ever since pharmacists ran out of stock and the government began supplying it to hospitals so that the injection could be administered directly to the patients in need. Apart from arresting all five accused, the police also recovered Rs. 2.82 lakh that they had collected by selling the fake medicine. The seized fake medicine includes several bottles bearing stickers of well-known pharmaceutical brands that manufacture Remdesivir. A case has been booked against the accused under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and various sections of the IPC. With regard to the fate of those who have bought the fake medicine, the police said investigation was still under way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/man-caught-trying-to-sell-fake-remdesivir-vials/article34363126.ece
20 April 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||KSRTC dismisses 13 trainee employees||The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation has dismissed 13 trainee employees of Chikkamagaluru division for taking part in the strike. They include three trainee driver-cum-conductors, seven trainee-technical assistants, and three artisans. The Divisional Controller of Chikkamagaluru issued the orders on instructions from the head office. The decision was taken as they did not report for duty even after repeated calls, notices and paper notification. Of the total 114 trainee staff members in the division, these 13 had not returned to duty. The Chikkamagaluru division operated 140 buses on the day.  In Hassan  KSRTC Hassan Division operated 150 buses on Monday. The number of employees reporting to duty was less on the day compared to Sunday, as the protesting employees had planned a dharna at the depots. “On Sunday, we had operated more than 300 buses, but on Monday, we could operate only 150, as many did not report to duty. A section of employees had planned hunger protest at depots. Anticipating that operating buses, when the dharna was going on, might lead to arguments, many did not work today”, said Rajesh Shetty, DC of Hassan division. As the number of KSRTC buses operating on the day was low, the passengers had to depend on private buses. Many passengers had heated arguments with private bus operators, who charged high fare. A driver of a mini-bus was demanding Rs. 250 for a journey to Mysuru from Hassan. The driver maintained that he would be at loss if he ran the vehicle at KSRTC rates. “I have to come back from Mysuru empty with no passengers. Considering the fuel expenses and daily wages of two people, I have to charge Rs. 250 per passenger”, he maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ksrtc-dismisses-13-trainee-employees/article34363233.ece
20 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Extensive mass sensitisation programme launched||With the number of COVID-19 cases going up in the last fortnight, the Dharwad district administration has embarked on an extensive sensitisation programme in a bid to increase adherence to health protocol. According to official data, Dharwad district has recorded 1,100 new cases in the last 18 days and registered 20 deaths due to the pandemic. On Monday, the district administration along with the police launched a mass sensitisation programme. Leading a team along with Hubballi-Dharwad Police Commissioner Labhu Ram, District Health and Family Welfare Officer Yeshvanth Madinkar, vaccination nodal officer S.M. Honakeri, Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil visited market areas and infection-prone areas as part of the awareness programme. During the programme, the officials emphasised on the need for wearing face masks, using hand sanitisers and maintaining physical distancing. The officials handed over face masks and sanitisers to vegetable and fruit sellers in the market area and asked them to be cautious in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. Subsequently, the Deputy Commissioner paid surprise visits to cloth shops, hotels, provision stores, among others, to check whether the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is being followed. During his interaction with traders and vendors, Mr. Patil highlighted the need for adhering to SOP during business hours and compulsorily wearing face masks. He also asked them to stick “No mask, no entry” notices in front of shops. Mr. Patil said that as the second wave would spread faster than the first, there should not be any negligence towards following the guidelines. Emphasising that no customer should be allowed to enter hotels or shops without wearing masks, he asked hoteliers to ensure proper seating arrangements and avoid crowding. Commercial property where there was no adherence to SOP would be sealed without any hesitation, he told them. Later, speaking to presspersons, Mr. Nitesh Patil said that government officials too had been directed to hold meetings only if it was very urgent and such meetings should be held in strict adherence to SOP. Virtual meetings would be held for review of each department, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/extensive-mass-sensitisation-programme-launched/article34363123.ece
20 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Areas with five or more cases to be declared as containment zones||Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil has said that with a view to checking the spread of the pandemic, it has been decided to declare areas with five or more positive cases as containment zones. Speaking to presspersons here on Monday, Mr. Patil said that the move was aimed at checking the spread of the infection and it will help in restricting the movement of infected people so that they do not become super spreaders. He said that municipal officials and tahsildars had been authorised to declare containment zones in areas, hostels, colleges and apartments where more than five positive cases are reported. Directions have already been issued to ensure that there is no dereliction of duties by officials and the onus is now on health officials to go that extra mile and stop the pandemic in its tracks, he said. They should ensure that medical oxygen was available in COVID Care centres and hospitals, he said. Mr. Patil said that at present medical oxygen is being supplied by Southern Gas Pvt. Ltd., Karnataka Industrial Gas Ltd. and Prox Air & Inox Ltd. to hospitals and they should ensure continuous supply as per demand. “The Union government has through its order on April 19 identified nine sectors for supplying medical oxygen. And, these private medical oxygen suppliers cannot supply oxygen to other industries after April 22,” he said. He said that seven ambulances would be available in Hubballi and three in Dharwad for ferrying infected persons to hospitals or COVID Care centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/areas-with-five-or-more-cases-to-be-declared-as-containment-zones/article34363124.ece
20 April 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Sudden surge renders medical supplies, facilities inadequate||Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, speaking to media representatives at Humnabad in Bidar district, had said that there was no dearth of either drugs, including Remdesivir, or beds in hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients. However, a video clip showing relatives of COVID-19 patients requesting the staff at Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences to treat patients on the hospital floor itself, if there were no beds available, that went viral on Monday tells a different story. The staff are seen turning down the request as the hospital was full. A day before, a 55-year old woman patient, with an oxygen cylinder attached to her body, roamed Kalaburagi city in an autorickshaw for nearly five hours visiting one hospital after the other desperately searching for an ICU bed. At the end, she was treated in the vehicle outside Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences for a few hours before being admitted in hospital. These are not isolated and rare incidents. Patients arguing with hospital authorities for beds, suffering due to lack of drugs and oxygen cylinders and running from pillar to post for treatment are common scenes in towns and cities across Kalyana Karnataka. The sudden surge in COVID-19 cases in the region, particularly in Bidar and Kalaburagi districts, coupled with shortage of drugs, oxygen cylinders and hospital beds has worsened the condition. These districts are reporting between 300 and 700 cases every day at 70% positivity rate which was just 5% in January. Shortage of Remdesivir and oxygen cylinders, apart from the shortage of beds, are the biggest problems that COVID-19 hospitals are facing in the region. There are only two oxygen manufacturers in the district which can together cater to 100 patients a day. However, there are around 600 patients being admitted to various hospitals. The huge gap between demand and supply has led to an unreasonable rise in the prices of oxygen cylinders. As per information provided by the authorities in a private COVID-19 hospital, the price of Jumbo Oxygen Cylinder has gone up from Rs. 200 a week ago to Rs. 600 now. “No hospital in Kalaburagi has any beds left to accommodate new patients. As for Remdesivir, there is no stock at all. The distributors who had received payment well in advance are supplying only 25% of the requirement. If we ask patients to get the drug from outside, they are overcharged. A standard Remdesivir that costs Rs. 2,500 is being sold at over Rs. 12,500. The government should put a mechanism in place to prevent hoarding of the drug by facilitating online procurement of Remdesivir to ensure that the drug is purchased only for immediate treatment. This can be done by introducing OTP-based transactions,” Chairman and Managing Director of United Hospital Vikram Siddareddy told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sudden-surge-renders-medical-supplies-facilities-inadequate/article34363122.ece
20 April 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘Media should infuse confidence in people, not create panic’||Busting myths surrounding COVID-19, doctors P.S. Shankar, Vikram Siddreddy and S.S. Gubbi have urged people not to panic but to take necessary precautions such as wearing face masks, maintaining social distancing and frequently washing hands to prevent the spread of the pandemic. In an interaction with media representatives here on Monday, they strongly advised people to get admitted to hospitals only when they develop symptoms and not just because they tested positive for the pandemic. “Media, especially electronic media, is creating panic among the people. Instead, they should infuse confidence among the people by inculcating awareness with scientific information. If you strictly follow the three mantras — wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and frequently washing hands, you can check the spread of COVID-19,” Dr. Shankar said. On the misconceptions about Remdesivir, Dr. Shankar said that the injection was more effective compared to others but it was not a perfect medicine for cure. “One has to take other medicines for 15 days. But, Remdesivir gives the same results in nine days. That’s the difference. People should show more interest in getting vaccinated against the pandemic. Two doses of vaccine would give you more protection against COVID-19,” Dr. Shankar said. ‘Sell drug online’ Taking serious note of the shortage of drugs, especially Remdesivir, used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, Dr. Vikram Siddareddy, who is Chairman and Managing Director of United Hospital, strongly proposed that COVID-19 drugs should be sold online. “The government should put a mechanism in place to facilitate the sale of COVID-19 drugs online. To ensure that the drugs are ordered online only for immediate use and not for hoarding, an OTP [One Time Password] should be sent to the patient and the hospital treating him to procure the required drug. This would effectively prevent the illegal hoarding of drugs essential for treating COVID-19 patients,” Dr. Siddareddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/media-should-infuse-confidence-in-people-not-create-panic/article34363120.ece
20 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Pending road-widening work resumes in city||Work to widen Mangaladevi Temple-Pandeshwar Road, which remained incomplete between the temple and Emmekere Cross Road for over six years now, resumed here on Monday. It was one among the two model road projects which had been taken up by Mangaluru City Corporation under Tender SURE (Specification for Urban Road Execution) format. Tender SURE is a document that enables a city planner or a contractor to refer to the document as a single-point reference for design, procurement and execution of urban roads instead of referring to many documents. Land issue had forced the city corporation to suspend the work half-way between the temple and Emmekere Cross Road. Mayor Premananda Shetty and Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyasa Kamath launched the pending works on Monday. Mr. Shetty told The Hindu that Ramakrishna Mutt has relinquished 31 cents of land for the project. The city corporation handed over TDR (transferable development rights) certificate to the mutt a week ago for surrendering the land to the project. The pending work is expected to be completed in another three months, he said and added that the city corporation will build a compound wall for the mutt after using the required land for the project which will be jointly completed by the city corporation and Mangaluru Smart City Ltd (MSCL). Road widening will be taken up using the Premium Floor Area Ratio (FAR) fund and a concrete road will be laid under MSCL fund, the Mayor said. The particular road project between the temple and Srinivasa College in Pandeshwar cost Rs. 4.5 crore. The other model road laid in the city under the Tender SURE format was the Kuloor Ferry Road (Kudroli Temple, New Chitra Cinema Road) at an estimated cost of Rs. 11.5 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pending-road-widening-work-resumes-in-city/article34363637.ece
20 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Residents of Kundapur demand solution to service road issues||Residents of Kundapur have resolved to invite Udupi Deputy Commissioner and officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to visit service roads of National Highway 66 passing through the town so as to address their concern about shoulder drains, median openings and other concerns. Rashtriya Heddari Horata Samithi convened a meeting on Saturday in view of the work on Shastri Circle Flyover and the vehicular overpass at Basrur Moorkai for the four-laning project coming to an end. This work, however, commenced about 12 years ago. The samithi said that while the work on flyovers was nearing completion, project concessionaire Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt. Ltd. was least bothered about setting right service roads, shoulder drains and median openings for movement of people and vehicles from one part of the carriageway to the other. Speaking at the meeting, samithi convener Kenchanoor Somashekhar Shetty said that KSRTC buses coming from Udupi have to take a round of over 2 km to reach the bus stand located on the right hand side of the highway. They have to travell till Sangam Circle and take a U turn to reach the bus stand. Again, they have to use the carriageway towards Udupi, take a U turn beneath Shastri Circle flyover to go towards Byndoor and beyond, he said. Mr. Shetty further said that there was no proper rainwater drainage facility all along the service roads on both the sides. The concessionaire has not completed work on service roads and drainages throughout the project highway — from Talapady to Kundapur — and similar haphazard work is being repeated in Kundapur town too. Kishore Kumar from the samithi said that initially only a vehicular underpass was proposed at Shastri Circle and following protests, it was changed to a flyover after three years. The inordinate delay in completing the flyover and related infrastructure work was solely due to the indifferent attitude of people, their representatives and the district administration. If people did not raise their voice at present, the town was bound to witness endless problems. Prathap Shetty from Sasthan Heddari Horata Samithi, Ganesh Puthran and Vivek Nayak from Kundapur Railu Prayanikara Hitarakshana Samithi, general public Madhava Nayak, Sudeep, Shreepathy Acharya, Mahesh Shenoy, Jayananda Kharvi and others also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/residents-of-kundapur-demand-solution-to-service-road-issues/article34363622.ece
20 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Lunar Occultation of Mars observed in city||A Lunar Occultation of Mars was observed and photographed in Mangaluru by Rohit S. Rao of the Amateur Astronomers Association on Saturday. Lunar Occultation occurs when the Moon passes in front of Mars. It is similar to an eclipse. “Since the Moon is quite close to the Earth and Mars is far away, Mars appears to be a little dot in comparison to the Moon,” a release quoted Mr. Rao as saying. Though Mars passes close to the Moon frequently, Lunar Occultation can be viewed only rarely from different parts of the world depending on the astronomical positions. The previous Lunar Occultation was visible only from Africa and South America, he said. The present occultation was visible throughout India on Saturday commencing at 5.08 p.m. in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada and concluding at 7.20 p.m. During this period, being hidden by the Moon, Mars was invisible in the night sky. These photos were taken at the time of conclusion of the celestial event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lunar-occultation-of-mars-observed-in-city/article34363620.ece
20 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Several fined for not wearing face masks||Udupi Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha fined those who did not wear face masks at Santhekatte in Udupi city on Monday. He advised people to always wear masks in public places. Mr. Jagadeesha, who is also the District Magistrate, imposed fine on drivers and conductors of five buses for overloading. The Deputy Commissioner instructed the officials to register cases against owners of these buses and told the drivers and the conductors that passengers should not be allowed to stand inside buses while travelling. Mr. Jagadeesha made passengers who were standing on these buses get off the vehicles and board other buses where seats were available. He asked the conductors concerned to return the ticket fare to passengers who were disembarked. The Deputy Commissioner also took these passengers to task. Mr. Jagadeesha imposed fine on the staff of a pharmacy for not wearing masks and in addition, imposed a fine on the store itself. Fine was collected from the staff of a cooperative bank and also from the bank, from a relative of a patient at a clinic, from a couple standing in a bus stop, from a person collecting cash at an ATM kiosk — all for not wearing face mask. A student who was not wearing a mask was given a mask to wear. The Deputy Commissioner also imposed fine on some drivers and others of other vehicles for not wearing masks. Chief Executive Officer of Udupi Zilla Panchayat Y. Naveen Bhat, Additional Deputy Commissioner B. Sadashiva Prabhu and Commissioner of Udupi City Municipality Udaya Shetty were with him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/several-fined-for-not-wearing-face-masks/article34363628.ece

Ramanath Rai on Monday alleged that there was a complete lack of coordination between the bureaucracy and elected representatives in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to reporters, he said COVID-19 would not disappear while the government was busy issuing statements. There should be proper coordination between the Ministers and officials for effective control of the spread of the infection, he said. Alleging that the Union and State governments had breached promises, Mr. Rai noted that what came to the rescue of the common man during the last lockdown was the Anna Bhagya and Indira Canteen schemes brought out by the Siddaramaiah government. Similarly, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, food security scheme, National Rural Health Mission and such other programmes introduced by the erstwhile UPA government too helped the common man to a considerable extent, he said. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy electioneering and was indifferent to the spread of COVID-19. Former Mangaluru Mayors Shashidhar Hegde and Bhaskar Moily, leader T.K.

20 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Isolation coaches ready for use||The South Western Railway has reviewed the condition of 320 isolation coaches under its jurisdiction to cope with any emergency in the wake of the daily surge in the COVID-19 cases and the scenario of hospitals running out of beds in the State. The State has recorded over 19,000 COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours alone, taking the total number of active cases to over 1.33 lakh and these numbers were increasing by the minute. Sources in the SWR told The Hindu that out of 320 isolation coaches almost 80 per cent were found fit for immediate deployment in case of any medical emergency and requirement. In case of the remaining coaches it would require minor maintenance work and the authorities were already at it. The coaches are deployed across the 3 divisions under the SWR and will be used only in case there was a request from the State government. Each coach can accommodate 16 to 18 patients at a time and the coaches have been retrofitted with certain amenities. Converting coaches to isolation wards was an ingenious solution offered by the Indian Railways to cope with the outbreak of the COVID-19. The conversion to isolation coaches entailed a few modifications that included removal of middle berths and ladders to ensure better comfort and additional space, provision of plastic transparent air curtains for isolation and screening, providing bottle holders in each compartment for holding medical equipment as well as water bottles, suitable clamping to hold oxygen cylinders etc. Besides these, additional sockets were provided for operating electrical equipment. Sources said these coaches have been berthed in different parts of the State and could be hauled for deployment at the nearest station if required. For remote areas Ideally these isolation coaches can be used to cope with medical emergencies arising in small towns or remote areas where cases are high and hospitals may be running out of beds. The isolation coaches can be berthed at the wayside station with access only to authorised medical and paramedical staff looking after the patients, said a senior official of the SWR. Though the railways were ready with the isolation coaches last year, they were never utilised given the high rate of recovery and the steady drop in number of active cases after September. Also, additional isolation facilities were created by taking over hotels, hostels and guest houses while home isolation was recommended for people who were asymptomatic. Consequently, the isolation coaches were earmarked for reconversion into freight containers. But there is a perception that these coaches may be required now following the surge in cases in the second wave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/isolation-coaches-ready-for-use/article34363238.ece
20 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Police outpost, 20 Home Guards sought for K.R. Hospital||The recurring incidents of assaults on doctors and hospital staff at the K.R. Hospital, a teaching hospital of MMCRI, here has now impelled the management of the medical college to demand a permanent police outpost on the hospital premises. “After I spoke to the Principal Secretary, Medical Education Department, about the incident, he has asked me to send a proposal on what needs to be done to strengthen the security for the hospitals and doctors. One of our demands is establishment of a police outpost for security besides deployment of 20 Home Guards, especially for COVID-19 and emergency wards,” MMCRI Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj told The Hindu . Despite repeated appeal by the hospital staff and the private security guards not to get inside the COVID-19 ward, a mob created ruckus on Sunday night damaging hospital property and causing disturbance to the patients battling COVID-19. Lack of security on the hospital premises is the reason for incidents of public resorting to attacks in the event of deaths or other reasons, the protesting doctors told the MMCRI officials. The resident doctors also claimed that the police arrived late to the spot despite the police control room being immediately alerted by the night-duty staff on the rumpus by a group of 30-40 members after a patient’s death. Police presence on the campus round-the-clock can help improve security for the hospital, they argue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-outpost-20-home-guards-sought-for-kr-hospital/article34363236.ece
20 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Trauma Care Centre to treat patients from tomorrow||With the Trauma Care Centre on KRS Road here being readied for treating COVID-19 patients, the ongoing vaccination against the disease at the facility is being shifted to the Government Ayurveda Panchakarma Hi-tech Hospital located on the same road. In the wake of a big spike in infections in Mysuru and the demand for oxygenated beds to cater to the treatment of severely-ill COVID-19 patients, the district administration decided to keep the trauma care centre ready for handling patients from Wednesday onwards. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri said this step had been taken to overcome any scarcity of beds following the surge in cases. The trauma care centre, attached to the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI), was inaugurated long ago but had not become functional for want of medical equipment and manpower. Last year, when Mysuru was in the grip of the COVID-19 crisis, the authorities decided to ready this hospital too for treatment, making all arrangements for future requirements. However, the cases dropped and the centre did not receive any patients. More than 40 oxygenated beds are available there. Meanwhile, 568 persons on Monday tested positive for COVID-19. The daily count dropped compared to the last two days. A total of 811 and 777 cases were reported on Saturday and Sunday respectively. Eight deaths were reported on Monday, taking the death toll to 1,122. The active case tally surged to 3,788 in view of the last three days’ big climb in new infections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/trauma-care-centre-to-treat-patients-from-tomorrow/article34363240.ece

Hospital on Sunday night and verbally abused doctors and nursing staff attending to critically-ill patients. Barring duties at the COVID-19 ICU ward and the emergency ward, all non-emergency services, including out-patient services and surgeries, would be withdrawn from Tuesday if the people behind Sunday night’s incident were not booked immediately, said RDA Vice-President Shivananda after staging a protest against the incident on Monday. The resident doctors staged the demonstration in protest against the alleged attempt to assault doctors and submitted a memorandum to the dean and director of the MMCRI listing out their demands for implementation. Police visited the hospital and enquired about the incident. Confirming the incident, MMCRI Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj said a group of 30-40 people tried to barge into the COVID-19 ward (at old Sri Jayadeva building) at K.R. Hospital following the death of a COVID-19 patient on Sunday night. A security guard suffered some injuries after he tried to stop the mob from barging into the ward and a police complaint had been lodged in this connection, he said. The incident has also been brought to the notice of the Principal Secretary, Medical Education, and the Deputy Commissioner, Mysuru, Dr. Nanjaraj said, adding that a glass door and a window had been damaged in the incident. The staff, including the doctor, could have been in trouble if they had not closed the door from inside stopping the mob from barging in. In the meantime, the police intervened and dispersed the people. However, the incident has been taken seriously and more security for the safety of doctors and staff had been sought, the dean told The Hindu . The RDA, in a statement here said, this sort of incident is not new in K.R. Hospital but no action had been taken for doctors’ safety. Appeals ignored Carrying out attacks on hospitals and doctors is a heinous act and has to be condemned. Despite repeated appeals to the higher authorities, no corrective measures had been taken and security at hospitals had not been improved. More such attacks will happen in the days ahead if the matter is not taken seriously and immediate steps were not taken, the RDA said. Dr. Shivananda demanded an FIRand arrest of the persons behind the attack within 24 hours. “In this connection, we met Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri and submitted a memorandum. We want immediate beefing up of security at the SARI ward and COVID-19 ICU ward where the COVID-19 patients are being treated,” he said. As a mark of protest, the resident doctors on Monday boycotted daily rounds of the wards but carried out OP services. The demands of the RDA include deployment of home guards for round-the-clock security in hospitals on the lines of Bangalore Medical College, particularly in emergency ward, COT, triage, COVID-19 ICU, SARI ward, SICU, OPDs and HDU. The RDA has also demanded appointment of nursing staff and Group D employees. Panic among patients Dr. Shivananda claimed that the late-night incident caused panic among the COVID-19 patients being treated at the ICU. “The incident disturbed the staff who have the task of continuously monitoring the oxygen saturation levels in patients.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/doctors-warn-of-suspending-duties-over-ruckus/article34363235.ece

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is now trying to control the spread of the virus within the complex, which has 3,002 flats and over 10,000 residents. According to R. Venkatachalapathi, Joint Commissioner, Mahadevapura zone, the civic body is trying to test as many residents as possible. So far, 1,500 residents have been tested. About the source of the infection, he said that many residents, who have tested positive, had travel history to other States, including Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. Also, COVID-19 appropriate behaviour (CAB) had allegedly been given a go by. The official said that all the common areas were open and residents were allowed to move around without masks. “We were informed that parties and social gatherings had also been held inside the complex,” he said. The civic body has arranged for micro containment in the towers where COVID-19 positive cases have been reported. That apart, marshals have been deputed to supervise and ensure adherence to CAB. However, residents’ association of the housing complex rubbished the allegations. Pradeep Nair, association president, told The Hindu that swimming pools and party halls had been shut down even before the government prohibited use of club houses. Questioning the credibility of BBMP’s testing, Mr. Nair claimed that many residents, who had been declared by the civic body to be infected with the virus, had got a negative result in tests by private hospitals. The number of COVID-19 cases also includes support staff, who had been counted as residents. “Contrary to BBMP’s claims, we have around 70 active cases. We are cooperating with the civic body,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/80-cases-in-prestige-shantiniketan/article34363438.ece

The Karaga will be celebrated in a low-key manner with a pooja inside the Dharamarayaswamy temple. An order to this effect was issued by J. Manjunath, Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru (Urban), on Saturday. The historical Bengaluru Karaga is synonymous with the city’s culture and has an over-300-year history. The Karaga celebrations were to begin on April 18 and culminate with a night-long procession on April 27. Mr. Manjunath told The Hindu that the order was in line with the Karnataka government’s decision on restricting all kinds of gatherings. “The order issued by the Chief Secretary in this regard is clear. There is no scope for any cultural or religious gathering. We have just reiterated the same thing,” he said and added that only a handful of priests will be allowed to perform the rituals. Incidentally, the Festival Committee constituted by Mr. Manjunath had also recommended low-key celebrations. However, some members wanted to carry out some rituals at the BBMP head office and Sampige Kere. “Given the spurt in cases, everybody is now in agreement that the procession has to be cancelled,” he said. This is the second year in a row that the Karaga celebrations have been restricted to prayers in the temple complex. Last year, the procession was cancelled following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/karaga-limited-to-pooja-inside-temple/article34363437.ece

After the meeting, Mr. Chandrashekar claimed that he has got an assurance that issues will be resolved within three days in a cordial manner. He told mediapersons that Mr. Bommai informed that talks will take place as soon as the Chief Minister, who is receiving treatment for COVID-19, gets discharged from the hospital, and Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi returns to Bengaluru. After the meeting, a message allegedly issued by the League, with a photo of Mr. Chandrashekar, started circulating among employees, stating that the Home Minister will hold talks with the CM on 6 th Pay Commission recommendations in two days. However, in the evening, Mr. Savadi and Mr. Bommai refuted claims that the government has initiated the process of talks. In a press release, Mr. Savadi said that when the strike had begun, the CM had clearly said that there is no need for any negotiation with employees, and instructed them to report back to duty. “Some leaders have said that they met the Home Minister on behalf of employees. When I checked with the Home Minister, he told me that there is no question of holding negotiations after they were ruled out by the CM, and, as instructed by the CM, employees must report back to duty,” he said in the release. The Home Minister too, in a press release, said during the meeting, he appealed to Mr. Chandrashekar to call off the strike in the interest of the general public but did not give any assurance on the 6th pay Commission recommendations. He further said that it is not the right time to go on strike considering the COVID-19 pandemic when the public is facing problems and the government is facing financial constraints. On Monday, the city police detained RTC employees who had come to Freedom Park and other places to take part in a hunger strike. Meanwhile, the managements of RTCs have warned of strict against those pelting stones at buses and assaulting employees. “RTCs are managing to run more buses. This has frustrated those on strike. Incidents of pelting stones at buses and assaulting bus crew on duty have increased. On Monday, stones were pelted at three buses running on the Kanakapura-Harohalli route. The police are taking strict action by filing cases and arresting the people involved,” said KSRTC MD Shivyogi C. Kalasad. BMTC MD C. Shikha said that employees should not believe fake news being circulated by those who are participating in the strike. She has maintained those who have been dismissed from the service will not be reinstated. “The BMTC has been strict against those who are taking part in the strike and remaining absent from work without any authorisation. After suspension and dismissal, many employees have communicated that they could not report to work out of fear. It is once again affirmed that adequate police protection will be given to employees returning to work,” she said. On Monday, the BMTC dismissed 200 employees for taking part in the strike while KSRTC dismissed 251 trainee employees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/meeting-of-union-leader-minister-stokes-controversy/article34363442.ece

The State police chief has now issued a circular directing the officers in charge to give priority to the well-being of their staff and ensure the best medical care for them. In a circular issued last week, Director-General and Inspector General of Police Praveen Sood directed the officers in charge to ensure that their staff, who are 45 years and above, and their family members are vaccinated. All the staff have been directed to get COVID-19 tests done. Those who have symptoms and related ailments should be deputed to office work only. The officers in charge should make three shifts to ensure the staff get adequate rest and work on rotation basis, he said. Sanitisation of police stations and vehicles is a must, and a separate meeting place has to be designated outside the office for the visiting public. Police personnel should follow the SoP while dealing with investigations, including questioning, arrest and escorting of accused to courts. The police personnel should wear masks, face shields, and sanitise regularly, apart from maintaining social distancing, the circular said. Mr. Sood also directed the police to initiate strict action against hospitals that refuse treatment to police personnel. The number of positive cases reported in the city police from January 1 till Monday was 174. Among them, four succumbed while 56 were discharged; 114 cases were active. West division has recorded the highest number of cases (20), followed by East and South divisions with 19 cases each. North division has reported 18 cases, while South East has seen 14. The Central division, command centre, and control room have reported zero positive cases so far. Among the reserve battalion, the CAR headquarters has had the highest with 19 positive cases.

Congress MLAs have strongly favoured the imposition of Section 144 in busy markets and crowded places in Bengaluru to contain the spread of the virus. They blamed the government’s laxity for a sharp rise in cases and urged it to credit Rs. 25,000 each in individual accounts of the unorganised sector workers if it was enforcing a city lockdown. Minister for Revenue R. Ashok said all legislators and Ministers of Bengaluru unanimously opposed lockdown of the city. There was no discussion on weekend lockdown, he said. “Since the next two months are crucial” in the containment of the spread of the pandemic, it was decided to open COVID-19 care centres like last year in different locations of the city. A nodal officer would be appointed to each of the Assembly constituencies in the city for allocation of beds, he said.  About the shortage of oxygen cylinders, the Minister said a decision had been taken to appoint a nodal officer to ensure supply of cylinders three times a day for small hospitals which did not have storage facilities. There was no shortage of oxygen cylinders in government and corporate hospitals. The police had been instructed to crack down on agents involved in the sale of oxygen cylinders and other drugs related to the COVID-19 treatment on the black market, he said. Crematoriums would start functioning on 24x7 and final rites of COVID-19 victims would be done for free. Hospitals have been told to hand over bodies of victims from the morning itself to avoid waiting periods at crematoriums.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/steps-to-be-announced-today-after-all-party-meet/article34363127.ece

20 April 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Cardamom price nosedives||Cardamom price often reaches its peak during the festival season after the harvesting season is over. However, one of the lowest prices was recorded this time on Saturday, raising concerns over a further drop in price. The average price dropped to Rs. 1,251 a kg at the auction held at the Spices Park at Puttady. The market price was much below the level and local traders at Kattappana said the average price offered was Rs. 1,000 a kg. The severe drop in the price has created concerns as the festival season in April was considered the one with the highest demand in north India. The export prospects of cardamom also increase during the Ramzan festival season. However, this time the reverse market trend happened. Expected better price Jijo Antony, a farmer, said he has not sold the produce expecting a better price in the festival season. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the price has remained low. “Now it is falling and it is a reverse trend we never expected,” he said. Mr. Antony said that it might be due to an impression that there was a high stock with farmers and the favourable climate would increase the production in the coming season. Since the pandemic started, the demand in the internal market declined and with low demand the export prospects also fell, said the manager of a company which participates in the e-auction at Puttady. The highest ever price of cardamom was recorded on August 3, 2019 at Rs. 7,000 a kg at the auction held at Puttady. The price in the local market also reached Rs. 6,000 a kg. The high expected production of cardamom in the coming season beginning August and the large stock of unsold cardamom with the traders and farmers are the main reasons for falling price. There may be a long-term effect on this as the pandemic had caused a decline in demand, said an agency engaged in preparing the marketing trend for cardamom.  Since the pandemic, demand in internal market declined and export prospects also fell.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cardamom-price-touches-an-all-time-low/article34363195.ece

District Collector Adeela Abdulla directed the travellers from other States to register on the e-Jagratha portal and produce RT-PCR test results, done in 48 hours, at the border checkposts to enter the State. If they failed to produce the test result, either they could undergo the test at the testing centres to be set up on the checkposts or go for 14 days’ compulsory home quarantine, Ms. Abdulla said. But it was mandatory for the workers in trucks, taxis and inter-State buses to produce the RT-PCR test results to cross the border, she said. Facilitation centres would be set up at Muthanga, Tholpetty, and Bavali checkposts to ensure the services to inter-State travellers, she said. Kiosks would also be set up at the checkposts for conducting RT-PCR tests. Five officials would be deployed in each testing centre and a team of three officials would be deployed at the checkposts, she said. Wayanad Sub Collector Vikalp Bharadwaj was appointed as the nodal officer for the smooth functioning of the centres, Ms. Abdulla said. COVID control rooms would be set up in all local administrative bodies in the district to ensure that the returnees from other States and abroad observed the COVID protocol, including quarantine.

The police are checking people entering the State from Karnataka through the Koottupuzha checkpost near Irrity in Kannur. The checking at Koottupuzha by the police is in addition to the checks conducted by the health department at the Kiliyanthara checkpost. Iritty DySP Prince Abraham carried out an inspection on Monday to ensure that the checking was properly conducted. In Kasaragod, the police have intensified the checking at the Talapady checkpost to ensure that those crossing into the State from Karnataka have the RT-PCR certificate. Besides, it has been decided to keep tabs on the 17 roads in the bordering villages of Kasaragod. Clarification issued Meanwhile, Kasaragod District Collector D. Sajith Babu came up with a clarification after his order to carry a “No-COVID” certificate or a certificate of receiving two doses of the vaccine to enter six towns in Kasaragod stirred a controversy. Mr. Babu clarified that the proposed inspection and restrictions would not apply to the movement of vehicles or persons passing through the town. Following the order, people had protested on the social media and also taken up the matter with higher authorities. Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan had to intervene in the matter and he suggested changes in the restrictions that caused hardships to people. N.A. Nellikunnu, MLA, said that the order had troubled the people. He said that the matter would be discussed with the district police chief and a complaint would be lodged with the Chief Secretary. The Collector, however, said that while the restrictions would not apply to the movement of vehicles or persons passing through the town, it would apply to those who do extended shopping and hold public meetings in the towns. He said during such inspections, the police were directed to coordinate activities in such a manner as not to infringe on the freedom of movement of the people. The Collector said that traders, workers, auto drivers and employees of private and government buses who are in close contact with the public were required to undergo a free government-mandated check every 14 days. Those who had received two doses of the vaccine and were over the age of 45 would not need to be tested for the time being. They could engage in regular activities using masks and keeping social distance, he said. Meanwhile, the spread of the disease in the district is on the rise. According to the latest figures, there are 4,062 COVID patients in Kasaragod. There are only 176 beds vacant in the four hospitals and there are only six ICU beds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vigil-intensified-at-inter-state-borders-in-kannur-kasaragod/article34363153.ece
20 April 2021||KASARAGOD,KERALA||Plants transfer experience to progenies||Researchers in the Central University of Kerala (CUK) have discovered that plants have memory and can transfer a part of their experiences to their first and even second generation progenies. Code language Researcher Joyous T. Joseph did the study under the guidance of assistant professor Jasmine M. Shah of the Department of Plant Science. The research found that plants exhibited memory of being under bacterial infection and this information was found in the second generation progenies. Elaborating on the research, published in the international journal Plant Molecular Biology Reporter , Ms. Shah says though plants do not have brain to remember, they do know how to write their experiences in the form of a code language. Dr. Shah and Dr. Joseph infected model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with Agrobacterium tumefacians , a bacteria that causes crown gall disease. “ Agrobacterium is also used as a tool for generating genetically modified (GM) crops and our group is the first to report Agrobacterium -induced memory in plants,” says Dr. Shah. Inducing memory “There are previous reports of a few other pathogenic bacteria inducing memory in the ‘defence DNA’ of plants. In our research, the parent plant’s experience of being infected by bacteria was seen in the DNA-repairing gene of the first and second generation progenies,” she says. This memory is called ‘epigenetic memory’, which means the experiences may not cause genetic mutations in the parent plant, yet the memory is heritable or transferred to the next generation. Environmental factors such as stress induced by diseases, drought or starvation can leave epigenetic marks on the DNA, which are heritable,” she says. Comparison This observation in plants is comparable to the parental trauma in humans. In 2015, a research team of New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital found that holocaust victims were capable of transferring their traumatic experience to their children’s DNA. In plants, such epigenetic memory can make the plants more immune or well prepared to face a similar stress, and understanding the code language will certainly aid in enhancing the ergonomic quality of plants, she says.

This is expected to offer a temporary solution to the increasing shortage of vaccines in the district. The vaccination drive will resume from Tuesday, according to the health authorities. Mega vaccination camps have been stopped on a temporary basis. The priority will be for the vaccination drive in government hospitals, primary health centres and private hospitals. The district administration had asked for 60,000 doses to tide over the shortage of vaccines. Steps will be taken to procure more doses. The vaccination drive will be expanded as per the availability of new stock, according to an official communication. Private hospitals The Health Department will recommend allocating 20% of beds, ventilators, oxygen and ICU facility in private hospitals for COVID-19 patients in the coming days. Special testing camps will be held again on Tuesday and Wednesday. The camps will focus on people who had participated in election-related activities and those prone to infection. District Medical Officer N.K. Kuttapan said the effort was to curb the spread by increased testing. More first and second line treatment centres will be set up in the district to check the second wave. The district has now got 1,076 ICU beds and 359 ventilators. Ward-level efforts The ward-level initiatives to tackle the pandemic will be strengthened in the district. A meeting attended by Ministers K.K. Shylaja and A.C. Moideen on Monday decided to ensure the participation of local bodies, volunteers and merchant and industrial communities in the drive. The functioning of the local administrative committees will be rejuvenated. The services of Anganwadi and ASHA workers, and junior health inspectors will be utilised. The ward-level samithis will visit each household and create awareness. They will monitor and report the health condition of those in home quarantine. The health protocol will be maintained while visiting houses. The samithis will carry out daily monitoring and assessment of the pandemic situation in each ward. Members of the Kudumbashree network will be part of the drive. Steps will be taken to ensure that those aged above 45 years in each ward have received vaccination. The civic bodies will be responsible for taking steps against the spread in shops and other commercial units. The monitoring in migrant workers’ camps will continue as scheduled. Community kitchens will be launched, if required. Ms. Shylaja asked the district administration to ensure adequate supply of oxygen in treatment centres. Sarada Muraleedharan, Additional Chief Secretary, said necessary steps would be taken to allocate more funds to local bodies. District Collector S. Suhas said about 3,333 oxygen beds were available in Ernakulam. An additional 1,000 such beds will be set up in the coming days. About 7.25 lakh doses of vaccines were distributed in the district. Mayor M. Anilkumar said more first-line treatment centres would be set up within Kochi Corporation limits. The centres could start functioning, after the deployment of doctors, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccination-drive-to-resume-as-ernakulam-gets-30000-doses/article34363579.ece
20 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Six more FLTCs to be set up in city||The civic administration is planning to set up more COVID Fist Line Treatment Centres (CFLTC) in the city in the wake of the increasing number of COVID cases in Kochi. Six more CFLTC will be made operational shortly in the city. Currently, CFLTCs are functioning at Mattanchery and Palluruthy and the one at Eda Kochi has been fully equipped for supporting the patients, according to the a communication from Mayor M. Anilkumar. As many as 1,000 beds with oxygen support system are available in the city. However, the influx of asymptomatic patients and those with minor ailments to the hospitals would deny the ones with acute illness the facility. More CFLTCs are being planned to cater to the needs of the asymptomatic patients and those with minor diseases, the communication said. A meeting of the representatives of various organisations has offered support for the civic administration for setting up the centres. The local body has received offers for providing refrigerators, washing machines and incinerators for the centres. Some organisations have offered to provide food for those who are admitted to the centres, the communication said. The meeting was attended by standing committee chairpersons T. K. Ashraf, Sheeba Lal, Sunitha Dixson, J. Sanilmon, Priya Prasanth, and V. A. Sreejith.

Nearly 60% of the 720 screens across the State started downing their shutters on Monday in view of the fresh curbs imposed by authorities and the lack of new releases following the worsening COVID-19 situation, according to the estimates by the Film Exhibitors’ United Organisation of Kerala (FEUOK). “With second shows off the air in view of the new restrictions, the collections have been hit badly. A few cinema theatres in the city limits may run a show or two for a few more days while the rest would have no other option but to stop screening,” said FEUOK president K. Vijayakumar. Stating that the rising pandemic fear prompted the family audience to stay away from cinemas, G. Suresh Kumar, president of the Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce, said there would be no new releases till the second week of May in view of the holy month of Ramzan. Low collections “The collections did not reach the expected levels for films released on the occasion of the Vishu festival following the pandemic situation,” he said. B. Rakesh, treasurer of the Kerala Film Producers’ Association (KFPA), said movies like Chaturmukham and Nayattu were running reasonably well when the pandemic situation took a worse turn. “The shooting of some of the movies has been cancelled. Producers will not be ready to release their films at this point of time. Many expected releases, including big budget movies, may be delayed further,” he said. Mr. Suresh Kumar said the film chamber had asked the KFPA to ensure the pandemic protocol at shooting locations. People should be permitted only after carrying out COVID-19 tests. Mr. Rakesh said the association had informed the members that it was not an ideal situation for film shooting. “However, we have not stopped anyone from continuing with the production work. But they have to strictly abide by the pandemic protocol,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/its-curtains-down-for-screens-amidst-rising-cases/article34363215.ece

Thrikkakara municipality chairperson Ajitha Thankappan said the municipal council had decided to go ahead with the project, which had been in planning for several years. She said the council had given in-principle approval for the project. The municipal complex was established way back in 1978, when K. Avukader Kutty Naha was the minister for panchayats. It had fallen on bad days as the municipality grew in population and more busy centres came to be established. It is close to the district headquarters, where thousands of people arrive on a daily basis for transacting different businesses. The proposed structure is expected to house a new municipal office with the latest facilities. The demand for a modern bus terminal, including facilities for long distance services, has been a long-standing one. Cartoonist Sudheernath, a local historian, said the old shopping complex and bus terminal were part of the memories of the past generation. He said with the establishment of the NGO Quarters, more than a kilometre away from the bus terminal, most commercial activities were shifted there. V.V. Vinod, who runs an Akshaya centre at the old shopping complex, said that there were 13 shops in the complex that was planned to be demolished. He said the municipal authorities had taken a generous view of the shop owners and they expected to get temporary relocation before the new complex was established.

20 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Civic bodies fail in waste management: survey||A survey by the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) has found that the “common facilities” for solid waste management provided by the municipalities in Ernakulam have turned into mere “dumping sites”. The survey was carried out by regional officers under the Ernakulam office of the board from February onwards. A preliminary assessment revealed serious lapses in the scientific management of solid waste generated in the civic bodies. The board has informed the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal that the survey has reached the half-way mark and it was delayed owing to the pandemic crisis. In Kothamangalam The field-level officers found that only dumping of mixed waste was taking place at the centralised facility of Kothamangalam municipality in Kumbalathumuri. Several pockets have turned in to dumping areas. The civic body has not yet begun the management of old waste. In Muvattupuzha, the centralised facility was found located at the municipal boundary. Dumping of mixed waste was found at the site. Decentralised facilities were provided at the household level. Several pockets have turned into dumping areas while the civic body has not yet started the management of old waste lying in heaps. In Perumbavoor Perumbavoor municipality has not provided any centralised plant for solid waste management. There was no scientific management of solid waste, except for a few decentralised units. The survey found that there was no centralised plant in Koothattukulam. The civic body also lacked scientific waste management practices. At North Paravur, the centralised facility was located at Vedimara, where a small portion of biodegradable waste was disposed through windrow composting. The major portion of mixed waste was dumped in the yard. Decentralised plants were provided at the household level. Several pockets have turned into dumping areas. The civic body has not yet started management of old waste. At Brahmapuram The situation was no different in Maradu, Aluva, Angamaly, Thrikkakara and Thripunitura municipalities that had failed to set up centralised plants. The civic bodies had a few decentralised units for waste management. The biodegradable waste in Aluva, Angamaly, Thrikkakara, Thripunitura and Kalamassery municipalities was transferred to the Kochi Corporation’s dumping yard at Brahmapuram. The survey teams found that a portion of the non-biodegradable waste was seen processed through a plastic shredder at the dumping yard of the Kalamassery municipality. The civic body had not yet launched any initiative for the management of old waste. The scientific management of solid waste seemed a Herculean task as the civic bodies in the district have not yet complied with the directives issued by the State Level Monitoring Committee on solid waste management appointed by the National Green Tribunal, according to the findings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-finds-lapses-in-waste-management/article34363566.ece

Under this, the State would give Rs. 832 crore, it being one-fourth of the Rs. 3,328 crore that is estimated to acquire land to widen the 227-km-long Thiruvananthapuram-Kottayam-Angamaly stretch of MC Road. Similarly, it would pool in with Rs. 372 crore of the Rs. 1,489 crore needed to acquire land for the Kochi-Theni NH which is being developed as a four-lane corridor. The funds will be routed through KIIFB. The State government had written to the Centre seeking development of MC Road as an NH corridor. This was in the wake of the road that was developed under KSTP developing traffic snarls even after bypass stretches were built in the vicinity of congested towns en route. Likewise, the NHAI has envisaged a revised alignment to develop Kochi-Theni NH, bypassing Munnar town. Alignment As per the revised alignment, the NH would begin 1 km south of the Kundannoor Junction on the Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass to prevent worsening of the congestion at the junction. The NH would have 45-metre width as compared with the old proposal for a 30-m-wide NH. It would pass through lands that were frozen for the Thripunithura Bypass.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-to-give-25-of-land-cost-for-road-projects/article34363560.ece

The Pokkali Samrakshana Samithi, working to protect the practice of pokkali rice cultivation, said in a statement that facilities should be put in place to drain saltwater from the pokkali fields to prepare them for rice cultivation in June as the monsoon sets in. The Samithi said the crop calendar, with the one-fish-one-rice cycle, should be maintained and that shrimp culture could not be allowed throughout the year. The Samithi said that with aquaculture gaining dominance, rice cultivation had been abandoned and that it had become impossible to continue with pokkali rice cultivation. The High Court had issued an order that the fields should be drained following a petition filed by pokkali farmer Manjadiparambil Chantu, said the Samithi. Rice cycle The pokkali rice cycle is between April 15 and November 15. The remaining period was used for shrimp and fish culture, which mutually supported each other, said Francis Kalanthungal of the Samithi. He said the cycle had been upset over several seasons and the pokkali rice cultivation faced the threat of being totally wiped out. It is a unique way of cultivation in the water-logged coastal regions spread in about 5,000 hectares area in Alappuzha, Thrissur and Ernakulam districts of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-steps-to-protect-pokkali-rice-cultivation/article34363576.ece

20 April 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Kadassery residents live in fear of wild cats||The residents of Kadassery, a ward in Piravanthur grama panchayat bordering the woods here in Kerala, have been living in constant fear for the last few days. Repeated leopard sightings, attacks on livestock, and disappearing dogs, have left them edgy and the villagers say there have been a steady spike in such incidents. They believe that the big cat population has swelled in the area, posing a serious threat to their routines. “Though it is not a new issue, the situation has aggravated of late. In the last 12 days, around 10 dogs have vanished and sightings have been reported from several neighbourhoods. People are panicking, as we have not experienced such frequent sightings and attacks in the past,” says Arya Sasidharan, ward member. According to the ‘Status of Leopards in India 2018’ report released by the Union Environment Ministry, the State has a total of 650 leopards. But experts say the figure can be far from real and we hardly have any accurate estimate about the leopard population in Kerala. Figures “What we have now is a figure based on the tiger census and 650 is an underestimation. It can only indicate the lower limit and the higher limit is unknown,” says E.A. Jayson, scientist and Head of the Department of Wildlife, Kerala Forest Research Institute. He adds the State is yet to conduct any specific study on human-leopard conflict while the official documentation is more or less based on cases that claim compensation. “Leopards always stick to their territories and sub-adults are usually kicked out of their mother’s territory when they grow. If they can’t find any prime location inside the forest, they can always stray to village areas and it’s not a new phenomenon. They spill out to human settlements,” he says. Renjan Mathew Varghese, State director (Kerala), WWF India, points out that increase in numbers cannot be the prime reason for the animals to stray, as Kerala forests can always accommodate more leopards. “A spate of issues including the depletion of their prey base and old age can contribute to straying. Also, there is no specific documentation of the incidents and attacks other than broad reports of escalating conflict.” He adds it is not possible to generalise on the basis of species or geography when it comes to addressing human-wildlife conflict. “The issue in Wayanad will be different from Thiruvananthapuram or Pathanamthitta. We need to monitor the forest fringe for a specific period to reach any conclusion,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kadassery-residents-live-in-fear-of-wild-cats/article34363194.ece

With 26 doctors at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) testing positive for the virus this month, the functioning of the hospital has been hit to a great extent. Apart from 26 doctors, 22 nurses, eight medical students and 20 employees of other departments have tested positive for the virus infection. Taking a serious note of the situation, the medical college authorities have convened a meeting of various department heads on Tuesday to chalk out plans for countering the emergency situation. According to hospital sources, the pulmonary medicine and surgery departments were most hit by the current wave of pandemic outbreak. In view of the situation, the services at the MCH are likely to be cut short to emergency services and COVID-19 treatment only. Meanwhile, the Fire Safety and Rescue Office at Kanjirappally has been temporarily shut after 37 out of 45 employees tested positive for the disease over the past five days. In view of the development, plans are afoot to open a temporary fire station at the location. Ten officers attached to the police station at Pala too tested positive for the virus infection. 973 fresh cases Meanwhile, the district on Monday reported 973 fresh cases with the test positivity rate coming down to 18.73% from 20%. With 181 cases, Kottayam reported the highest number of cases among the local bodies. The total number of cases has jumped from less than 3,000 to 7,932 in the past one week alone. Though only 1,335 out of the 6,851 patients have been admitted to various treatment centres, the sudden increase in patients may change the situation in coming days.

LDF councillor T.K. Shemina raised the issue of the only government college within the corporation limits, pointing out the lack of infrastructural facilities there. Presenting the motion, she said that the college had around 2,200 students and 150 employees and requested the civic body to make efforts to elevate the college to international standards. However, her comments did not go well with the opposition members in the council, especially that of the UDF, who termed the motion an attempt to tarnish the image of MLA from Kozhikode South M.K. Muneer, in whose constituency the college is located. UDF Independent councillor K. Nirmala lashed out at Ms. Shemina claiming that the MLA was not allocated much funds for developmental works in his constituency by the LDF government. Later, LDF councillor S. Jayasree, who retired recently as the Principal of the college, said that the MLA had cancelled a developmental project in the college, despite it being sanctioned by the State government. She also spoke of the MLA’s lackadaisical attitude regarding the development of the college. UDF councillor Moideen Koya replied by saying that Ms. Jayasree must have forgotten the MLA’s contributions to the college and called for a comparison between the MLAs of Kozhikode North and South. While the MLA of Kozhikode North, A. Pradeep Kumar, is particularly appreciated for raising some of the schools in his constituency to international standards, Mr. Muneer did not get credit for the high academic standards of Chalappuram Government Girls’ Higher Secondary School, which has earned a far better result compared to the ‘International’ Government Vocational Higher Secondary School, Nadakkavu. “Is infrastructure everything or do results matter too?” he asked. This kicked off a discussion about the achievements of both the MLAs and a political discussion between several councillors. LDF councillors alleged that Mr. Muneer failed to ask for funds and present his projects well, as he was busy fighting against KIIFB (Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board). However, Mayor Beena Philip and Opposition leader K.C. Shobhita put the matter to rest announcing that the councillors irrespective of party differences will work together to better the conditions of the college.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ruckus-in-corporation-council-over-development-of-college/article34363142.ece

20 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Illegal visitors suspected behind frequent incidents of wildfire||Even as summer rain continues to avert incidents of wildfire, the entry of careless trekking teams and suspected poachers into unguarded stretches along the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary emerges as a fresh threat with no quick solution in sight. Local residents living close to the forest boundary claim that illegal camp fires, and poaching practices have been found increasing in the absence of surveillance along vulnerable border areas. The latest wildfire outbreak near Pookkunnumala in Balussery is one such incidents allegedly caused by unpermitted visitors to the spot. Nearly five acres of land have been hit by the incident. The loss is yet to be estimated by the authorities. According to sources, cigarette butts not fully snuffed out have been causing huge safety threat in the area, which had come to the attention of the Forest Department many times. This was apart from other environmental pollution including the dumping of plastic waste and food items, they add. “There was a huge fall in the number of illegal trekkers when the Forest Department intensified night patrol and appointed more watchers near the forest borders. Now, there is shortage of staff to continue with the patrol duty,” said a Forest Department official from Thamarassery. He said flying squads were mostly depending on confidential information given by local residents to track such attempts. The suspected entry of poachers is a threat in areas where forest squads have limited access to the difficult geographical terrain. According to Forest Department sources, surprise inspections by flying squads sometimes fail owing to poachers’ secret connection with local sources. “Earlier, there were many incidents of poaching porcupines by setting fire near its burrows, which had emerged as a safety threat. Now, people keep vigil against such crude practices,” said a forest watcher under Peruvannamoozhi range. He added that the dedicated work of Vana Samrakshana Samiti members helped the department ensure proper vigil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/illegal-visitors-suspected-behind-frequent-incidents-of-wildfire/article34363144.ece
20 April 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Demand to equip peripheral govt. hospitals for COVID treatment||A section of doctors is apprehensive that non-COVID patients will be affected by the ongoing efforts to turn the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, to what they termed as the “sole point of definitive care” for those infected by the virus. They are also worried that the existing system to mainly utilise the services of house surgeons and resident doctors for the treatment will be effective on a long-term basis. According to sources, all the main wards in the general medicine department are slowly turning into COVID-only facilities right now. The newly constructed block under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) too will be utilised for the treatment as more cases are being reported. Some doctors at the MCH told The Hindu that this was likely to affect the treatment of non-COVID patients. They claimed that a majority of the other government hospitals in the district were ill-equipped to provide even basic oxygen care and support to the patients even a year after the pandemic struck. “We have such a huge resource of medical professionals in peripheral government hospitals. They should be empowered to provide basic medical care, including oxygen support, to the patients. People with other serious illnesses, who require only palliative treatment and not aggressive treatment, could be admitted there. Now, all such patients are referred to the MCH,” one of the doctors said. The plan to open up the PMSSY block for COVID care has also been criticised as there are no more nursing or para medical staff left to provide services there. The district administration, however, is planning to have at least 15% beds at the district hospital, taluk hospitals and other important healthcare institutions for COVID treatment alone. Oxygen cylinders too will be kept ready there. A total of 25% of beds and intensive care units in private hospitals too have been told to be kept aside for the purpose. But, some doctors said that even a slight change in the condition of the patients would suffice for the other government hospitals to refer them to the MCH. Only decentralisation of treatment would help, they claimed. Meanwhile, utilising resident doctors and house surgeons for treatment and services has also not gone down well with the medical fraternity. It has been claimed that the training of the young doctors would be hampered by this. According to sources, a full batch of over 200 intern doctors is ending their services on Tuesday and the administration has extended their tenure for another three months or till a new batch takes over. The next batch of medicos are yet to finish their final exams. Their joining duty will be delayed by at least another two to three months, it is learnt. A senior doctor pointed out that a definite long-term plan should be made to properly utilise peripheral government hospitals for COVID care instead of using only non-clinical and teaching doctors or residents at medical colleges.  We have such a huge resource of medical professionals in peripheral hospitals. They should be empowered to provide basic medical care||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/demand-to-equip-peripheral-govt-hospitals-for-covid-treatment/article34363149.ece
20 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Row over ad revenue issue||United Democratic Front (UDF) councillor K. Moideen Koya’s allegation that the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation was not much concerned about the loss of revenue from advertisements led to a heated debate at a meeting of the corporation council on Monday. Mr. Koya, in a submission, said that the corporation used to earn around Rs. 75 lakh per annum from advertisements. But with the amendments brought in with the introduction of GST, the corporation has lost that income. He said that the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has come up new laws to ensure its advertisement revenue. However, the Kozhikode Corporation has made no such moves, he said. He also alleged that the advertisement revenue that is due for the corporation is being received by an advertisement agency headed by a young CPI(M) leader, which is the reason why the corporation is not interested in earning it back. This led to debates between ruling and opposition councillors which was put to rest with the Mayor’s intervention. Containment zones LDF councillor P. Diwakaran pointed out the mistakes made by the district administration in determining containment zones and called for the corporation’s intervention to correct it. UDF councillor Manoharan Mangarayil made a submission about the after-effects of the 2004 tsunami that still lingers in some parts of Elathur. He said that around 400 families along Korappuzha to Elathur railway station had their wells polluted after the tsunami, which remains so even after 15 years. He suggested the construction of a canal in the region linking Korappuzha and the sea as a solution to the issue. LDF councillor V.K. Mohandas pointed out that the owner of the boat that capsized near Mangaluru coast recently had suffered a loss of Rs. 1.5 crore. As the boat was not insured, the corporation should exert pressure on Central and State governments to get him compensated by the shipping company, he added. BJP councillor Anuradha Thayat demanded that the corporation take steps to take the traffic park at Chakkorathukulam back from the Rotary Club.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/row-over-ad-revenue-issue/article34363143.ece
20 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Private bus operators warn of stopping services||Stung by the stringent enforcement of COVID-19 protocol and the steep fall in daily revenue, the majority of private bus operators in the district have warned of stopping their city and rural services from next month. As part of this, they will submit Form G to the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) by the end of this month, which will help them avoid tax payment for vehicles not in service. Many bus operators whose business plunged into a huge loss during the last lockdown had taken the same step. Many considered it as the last resort to save the tax and insurance premium amount. The option to retain permit was a relief as they hoped to resume service after the pandemic period. Latest order The move comes in the wake of the latest order from the district administration which disallowed standing passengers in buses. Bus operators claim that such a “thoughtless decision” will badly hit services and will not help in COVID-19 prevention. “Now, officials think that the pandemic will not spread if passengers are seated comfortably. In that case the best option is to stop the whole service and stay at home. What we really feel is that we have to face this situation with some logically fit measures and adopt practical solutions,” says M. Thulasidas, general secretary, Private Bus Operators’ Association, Kozhikode. He also slammed the practice of ‘imposing fine on bus operators alone in the name of violations’. Wage cut Drivers and conductors of some of the private buses in service point out that their daily wage has already been cut as a result of the declining daily collection. In many locations, the wage cut was introduced with the mutual agreement of owners and labourers. “Still, we go for work as we have no other option to survive and the situation has been almost the same for over a year,” they say. Lockdown-like air As a lockdown-like situation exists in the district on Sundays, there is also a plan to cut short the number of city and rural services. Only one third of the total private buses will be in service if the regulations are implemented as planned on Sundays and other holidays. Bus operators add that the ‘reckless collection of fines by enforcement squads’ in the district will only end up in the total cancellation of the remaining services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/private-bus-operators-warn-of-stopping-services/article34363158.ece
20 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Enforce restrictions, local bodies told||The Kozhikode district administration is strengthening restrictions within local bodies as new COVID-19 cases have gone up by eight per cent in the previous week. District Collector S. Sambasiva Rao told secretaries of local bodies at a meeting on Monday that a full lockdown would have to be enforced if there were any lapses. Wards had been divided into critical containment zones and containment zones depending on the number of infected persons. Such details were available in the Jagrata portal. Essential services would be permitted in containment zones. More than five persons would not be allowed at places of worship and at weddings and funerals. Critical containment zones, however, would have to be closed down and travel would be prohibited. Hospitals and shops selling food items would be allowed to function subject to restrictions. Those who hold events would have to register with the Jagrata portal. Cases would be registered against the organisers if any of the participants test positive for the virus, Mr. Rao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/enforce-restrictions-local-bodies-told/article34363148.ece
20 April 2021||MALAPPURAM/PALAKKAD,KERALA||Demand for resumption of day train on Nilambur route||The Nilambur-Mysore Railway Action Council has demanded resumption of train services between Nilambur and Shoranur during the day. Action council leaders blame Railways for ignoring the Nilambur sector even as several trains are restored in sectors such as Guruvayur and Punalur. Although Railways had stopped all seven pairs of trains in the Nilambur sector during the lockdown last year, only the Rajyarani Express train has been reinstated in recent months. Rajyarani is a night train and the people in the Nilambur route have no train during the day. Express trains Railway officials say only express trains have been reintroduced in the post-COVID-19 period. However, action council president C. Mohmmedali and secretary Biju Ninan say the Kottayam-Nilambur train is not resumed in spite of it having been converted to an express. Sources say the Palakkad Railway Division has recommended resumption of the Kottayam-Nilambur Express (16325/6) in January this year. However, the higher-ups in Railways are yet to take a decision about it. “A large number of people who used to depend on Railways on a daily basis are disappointed by the non-availability of trains on the Nilambur route during the day. Railways should not close a blind eye on their demand,” say Dr. Ninan and Mr. Mohammedali. They say Railways should resume the operation of at least two or three trains to ease the difficulties being suffered by the people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/demand-for-resumption-of-day-train-on-nilambur-route/article34363145.ece
20 April 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Online registration must on State borders||The police enhanced monitoring of passengers reaching Kerala from other States through the Tamil Nadu-Kerala borders in the district on Monday as part of an increased vigil against the COVID-19 pandemic. Mandatory Daring the summer heat, police officers were seen checking vehicles entering Kerala through Walayar for their online registration status. The State government has made it mandatory for all domestic passengers entering the State to register on the e-Jagratha portal. Although the State has made it mandatory for those arriving to undergo the RT-PCR test either within two days before reaching or soon after reaching, most passengers who arrived on Monday had not done the test. “They will have to do the test soon and they should remain in isolation until they get the result. Those who do not want to do the test should stay in quarantine for two weeks,” said District Police Chief Viswanadh R. Most people who reached Kerala through Walayar on Monday had registered themselves on the e-Jagratha portal. Those who did not were helped by the police to complete the registration. “Our objective is to have a clear tab on those reaching our State. That’s why registration on e-portal has been made mandatory,” said Mr. Viswanadh. The Tamil Nadu government too had enforced online registration of passengers from other States, including Kerala, a few weeks ago. The Tamil Nadu Police continued checking of passengers entering the State from Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/online-registration-must-on-state-borders/article34363689.ece
20 April 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||581 test positive in Palakkad||As many as 581 people tested positive for COVID-19 in Palakkad district on Monday. When 226 of them contracted the virus through direct contact with infected persons, there were 339 cases whose source of origin could not be identified. There were 165 recoveries in the district on Monday. District Collector Mrunmai Joshi directed 11 empanelled private hospitals in the district to set aside 10% of their ICU beds with oxygen facility for COVID-19 treatment. Hospitals having more than 50 beds have been empanelled under the State government’s Karunya Health Insurance scheme. COVID-19 patients who are beneficiaries of the scheme will get treatment at the empanelled private hospitals. Ms. Joshi said hospitals should give priority to such patients without waiting for the recommendation of a medical officer. Empanelled hospitals The 11 empanelled hospitals are Avitis Institute of Medical Sciences, Nemmara; Crescent Hospital, Alathur; Karuna Medical College, Chittur; Lakshmi Nursing Home, Palakkad; Mothercare and Healthcare, Mannarkkad; PK Das Medical College, Vaniyamkulam; Rajiv Gandhi Cooperative Hospital, Kallekkad; Valluvanad Hospital, Ottapalam; Welcare Hospital, Palakkad; Swami Vivekananda Medical Mission, Agali; and Palakkad Institute of Medical Sciences, Walayar.

20 April 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Strict curbs on public life in Pathanamthitta||Amidst a steady rise in fresh COVID-19 cases coupled with an acute shortage of vaccines, the authorities have imposed a new set of rules that stipulate stricter regulations on public life in Pathanamthitta. According to A.L. Sheeja, District Medical Officer (DMO), the number of patients suffering from serious complications in connection with the virus infection was doubling with each passing day. “While the total test positivity for the district was below 9%, it has crossed 15% in some panchayats. With a TPR of 41.08%, Anikkad panchayat leads the tally, followed by Mallappally with 29.64%,” she said. Adding to the concerns, the district is also experiencing a severe vaccine shortage with the vaccination programme in at least three locations facing disruptions during the day. “We are expected to receive a fresh stock of 5,000 doses by Monday midnight, which will be adequate for the vaccination requirement the next day,” the DMO added. Taking note of the rising cases, District Collector Narasimhugari Tej Lohit Reddy, by invoking provisions of the Disaster Management Act 2005, has sought advance registration of all public events with the COVID-19 Jagratha portal. The participation in outdoor events has been limited to 150 persons while that of indoor events to 75 persons. Travel restrictions Meanwhile, people in containment zones will be permitted to venture out of their homes only for the purchase of essential items and as part of their job requirements while those aged above 60 and aged under 10 are barred from travelling, except in case of medical purposes. A blanket ban on the functioning of air-conditioners has been imposed on all offices, including banks, in such locations. Stern action will be initiated against commercial establishments that violate the COVID-19 guidelines while shops are also required to put markings at a distance of 150 cm each to ensure physical distancing between customers. The number of participants in events such as marriages or funeral services is limited to 20. If cases continue to rise in containment zones, steps will be initiated for declaring IPC 144 and stern action will be initiated against those violating the curfew. The district police, meanwhile, has deployed a special team of 750 officers led by an Additional Superintendent of Police for pandemic duty. Besides physical inspections, surveillance using drones will be strengthened in all public places. Fresh cases As per estimates, the district on Monday reported 390 cases while five persons, including a 37-year-old, died of pandemic-related complications. With 37 cases, Thiruvalla had the highest number of cases, followed by Pathanamthitta with 33 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/strict-curbs-on-public-life-in-pathanamthitta/article34363206.ece

20 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||City exhausts its vaccine stocks||The district’s COVID-19 inoculation drive took a severe hit after it exhausted its vaccine reserves on Monday. While the acute shortage has prompted health authorities to call off the ongoing vaccination drive in several places, there is no word on when the next batch would arrive. The special vaccination drive that has been under way at the Jimmy George indoor stadium since March 2 will be suspended on Tuesday. The facility enabled numerous people to avail the doses instantly after registering at the venue without the need for online bookings. Having facilitated vaccination for a bulk of the COVID-19 vaccine recipients, the stadium has witnessed great rush during the last few days. The situation was no different on Monday when a serpentine queue formed outside the venue as early as 8 a.m., two hours prior to the drive. While many had come for the vaccine booster (second dose), the increased demand seen lately could also have been spurred by the fear of the depleting vaccine stock amid the sharp surge in COVID-19 cases, officials point out. A total of 1,641 people, including 448 senior citizens, were administered the vaccine at the facility. As many as 1,384 of the beneficiaries received their second doses. Several hundred people, who waited in the queue for long hours, had to leave empty-handed on being informed that the stock had run out. Some elderly citizens cried foul of the crowd management and suggested a token system commensurate with the vaccine stock available. In all, 20,247 vaccine doses were administered in Thiruvananthapuram district on the day. These included 17,010 Covishield and 3,237 Covaxin doses. 1,500 doses All of the 1,500 vaccine doses that remained in the district vaccine store is set to be utilised for vaccination camps being organised by the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. While the General Hospital is unlikely to provide any more doses, other major hospitals including Government Medical College Hospital could have stocks as low as 200 doses. Most private hospitals are also known to be running low on vaccine reserves with many being unable to honour the online bookings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-exhausts-its-vaccine-stocks/article34363724.ece
20 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State imposes night curfew till May 3||The State government on Monday urged citizens to remain sequestered indoors between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. till May 3 to curb the COVID-19 resurgence. The government will further tighten controls on civic life if the infection surge fails to plateau out in the next 14 days. Importantly, the government decided not to allow crowded merrymaking on Assembly election counting day on May 2. The administration has ordered cinema halls and malls to close at 7.30 p.m. Other businesses, including hotels, should shutter by 9 p.m. Home delivery of food and other items has been banned after 9 p.m. Passengers should have a valid reason to travel during the curfew. The police will curb non-essential travel. Medical stores, hospitals, fuel stations, night shift employees, milk vendors, newspapers and electronic media have been exempted from the curfew. The government has advised the public and private sectors to weigh the option of working from home given the risk of disease transmission in hemmed-in spaces. The State has banned private tuition. It has asked teachers and students to shift private classes online. The State’s containment strategy hinged on minimising the chance of interaction between people to slow the virus spread. Simultaneously, the administration would ramp up testing and vaccination. Bus operators should not admit passengers above the legal seating capacity. Restaurants should limit guests to half the seating capacity. The police would slap fines on those who violate the mask and social distancing mandate. The decisions were taken at a core committee meeting chaired by Chief Secretary V.P. Joy. State Police Chief Loknath Behera and top Health Department officials were present. Checking on borders On Monday, the police enhanced monitoring of passengers reaching Kerala through the Tamil Nadu borders in Palakkad district. A day ago, Kerala had made it mandatory for all domestic passengers entering the State to register on the e-Jagratha portal. Police officers were seen checking vehicles entering Kerala through Walayar for their online registration status. The Wayanad administration has intensified checking of those entering the district through the State borders. The police are checking people coming from Karnataka through the Kootupuzha and Kiliyanthara check-posts in Kannur. In Kasaragod, the police are strictly monitoring the Talapady check-post. It has been decided to keep a tab on the 17 roads that connect the border villages of Kasaragod to Karnataka. Collector clarifies Meanwhile, Kasaragod Collector D. Sajith Babu came up with a clarification after his order to carry ‘No-COVID’ certificate or a certificate of receiving two doses of the vaccine to enter six towns in Kasaragod stirred a controversy. Mr. Babu clarified that the proposed inspection and restrictions would not apply to vehicles or persons passing through the town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-imposes-night-curfew-till-may-3/article34363223.ece
20 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||A catchy call against gender bias||Singer Arya Dhayal’s catchy new video ‘Angane Venam’ for the Women and Child Development Department (WCD) has received over 1.5 lakh views and counting in just one day on YouTube. The song also garnered a few thousand likes and shares on the department’s social media accounts. Composed and sung by Arya, with lyrics by Sasikala V. Menon, the song, with a folksy touch, is a call against letting gender discrimination slide by. It asserts women’s right to eat, dress, study and stand on their own feet – in short, make their own choices in life and be themselves without being judged for what they do. Times have changed and so have women, so see them for what they are, it goes. Arya says she is excited by the response to the track, also her first original composition in Malayalam. “I have been getting many calls in support, especially from girls who said they could relate to it. I’m super-excited by the attention it has elicited.” Great opportunity Arya has been following the department’s Instagram page and when WCD department director T.V. Anupama reached out, asking if she wanted to be part of the project, she jumped at the opportunity. “Never have I been part of such an experience,” says Arya. Since the singer does not write Malayalam lyrics usually, she reached out to Ms. Menon whom she knew well and they worked seamlessly to translate what Arya had in mind into tuneful words. Ms. Menon, who has worked with greats such as composer G. Devarajan, had half the lyrics ready overnight. As they sat down to finish the rest, the tune just came to Arya.  “I wanted the song to have a folky flavour but a modern idiom too, so that women of my age as well as teenagers could relate to it,” she says. Arranged by Varkey, it was recorded at a home studio. Excellent medium The WCD department has also come in for praise for the attempt. Ms. Anupama says the department aims at connecting with the people through social media and mass media, and feels that a music video is an excellent medium to reach out to them. She says Arya is popular with the younger audiences and hence was an easy choice for the initiative. “She is not only a singer but also a composer and is involved in all aspects of music. A woman composing a song for other women and singing her heart out also resonate with the masses,” says Ms. Anupama.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-catchy-call-against-gender-discrimination/article34363200.ece
20 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Rain pushes down power demand||The plentiful summer rainfall has helped Kerala restrict electricity usage to manageable levels so far in April, much to the relief of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). Daily usage did not cross 80 million units (mu) even once in the past one week, but the picture may change when the rain subsides, leading to a rise in temperature and humidity, KSEB officials warned. “The summer rain has helped reduce the demand considerably in April. Our projections indicated that daily consumption levels would have averaged 80-90 mu if the temperatures had soared. Once the rain stops, consumption will pick up,” said KSEB chairman and managing director N.S. Pillai on Monday. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts, rainfall is expected to continue on a ‘light to moderate’ note in most districts till at least Friday. High demand in March Daily electricity consumption did breach the 80 mu mark on a number of days in the beginning of the month, peaking to 87.6 mu on April 9. Nonetheless, April has so far been lenient to the KSEB compared to March when the electricity demand was on the higher side. The State had set new records for daily power consumption on March 19 (88.42 mu) and maximum demand on March 25 (3,967 megawatts) this year. It is, however, pertinent to note that the previous records had been set in May 2019. The hydel dams managed by the KSEB are 42% full, with adequate storage for generating 1,734.19 mu, as on April 18. This is slightly lower compared to last year. Power imports from other States continue to be smooth and the KSEB has tied up adequate power through short, mid and long-term power purchase deals, Mr. Pillai said. “If the temperatures had remained high, the State would have had to go in for power purchases on an extensive scale,” he said. Copious rains Kerala has received copious summer rainfall this summer season with five districts — Kannur, Ernakulam, Kasaragod, Kottayam, and Pathanamthitta — recording a ‘large excess,’ indicating rainfall in excess of 60% or above from the normal. Between March 1 and April 19, the State has received 46% excess rainfall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/summer-rain-pushes-down-power-demand/article34363140.ece
20 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||981 new cases in capital||The district’s daily COVID-19 caseload continued to hover close to the 1,000-mark as 981 more cases were reported on Monday. The number of active cases consequently mounted to 6,585, even as 497 people recovered from the illness. The death toll also continued to rise alarmingly with five more deaths that had occurred during the last three days being attributed to COVID-19. The deceased include three males, who were aged 77, 73 and 60, and two females, who were aged 76 and 48. At 926, Thiruvananthapuram led in terms of COVID-19 deaths by a distance. The district also had a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.79. While Kozhikode has the second-highest number of deaths (557), Kannur came second in terms of CFR (0.53). As many as 2,897 entered quarantine in the district during the last 24 hours, taking the number of people who were being monitored for COVID-19 symptoms to 28,880. A total of 722 people were permitted to conclude quarantine after completing the mandated period in self-isolation. The Poojappura Central Prison, which had witnessed a rapid spread of COVID-19 cases during its first wave, was yet to report any fresh case in the current outbreak. None of the 400 hundred inmates who were subjected to rapid antigen testing on Monday tested positive. The rest among the 1,050 prisoners at the facility will be tested during the next few days. While most of the prison officers have been vaccinated, they were yet to be included in the ongoing COVID-19 testing drive. The authorities were also likely to commence an inoculation drive for the inmates next week. Violations The City police booked 983 people for violating the COVID-19 protocol on Monday. Among them, 364 people were booked under provisions of the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance 2020 for serious offences. Another 617 people were cumulatively fined Rs. 3.08 lakh for failing to wear masks outdoor. Police officials also reprimanded 1,460 people for ignoring precautionary measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/981-new-cases-in-capital/article34363722.ece
20 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||C orpn. may close camps due to vaccine shortage||The city Corporation which has been organising COVID-19 mass vaccination camps in a decentralised manner at the ward level has decided to cut down on the number of vaccines for each camp due to the shortage of vaccines. As on Monday evening, the civic body had only 1,500 doses of vaccine remaining in stock, hardly enough to last it for a day. Although the Corporation had put in requests with the Health Department, without supplies coming from the Union government, the Corporation will have to stop running its camps from Wednesday onwards. On Monday, the Corporation organised vaccination camps in 10 locations, with a total of 1,975 doses across wards. In the initial days of the mass vaccination, which began eight days ago, there was no fixed number for the vaccines to be given in each camp, with the numbers going up to 900 in some wards. But with stocks depleting, the Corporation fixed a maximum of 200 vaccines per camp on Monday. Camps were held in Vattiyoorkavu, Nemom, Thirumala, Sreekandeswaram, Kazhakuttam, Thirumala, Ulloor and Nanthancode wards on Monday, with three of the wards having two camps each. The number of vaccines given in each camp ranged from 82 to 286. “As of now, we have only enough vaccines to run five or six camps, to issue the current vaccine numbers. However, we are opening 10 camps, but limiting the number of vaccines from each to 100. When we began the drive, there was hardly any rush at the camps. But over the past few days, with the COVID-19 surge, an increase in awareness and the reports of the vaccine shortage, quite a large number of people have been flocking to the camps and queuing up right from 7 a.m. Now we do not have enough vaccines to meet these demands. So, some have to be turned back,” says a Corporation official. The city Corporation had opened the decentralised camps in wards with an aim to reduce the rush at the centralised vaccination venues like the Jimmy George stadium. With camps set up in an auditorium or a Corporation building in each ward, people could get vaccinated without travelling far from their neighbourhood. Headache For the Corporation authorities, the vaccine shortage has given rise to quite a headache with demands from councillors belonging to various political parties for vaccination camps and more vaccines in their particular wards. Though attempts were made to open camps across various wards, the lack of enough vaccines prevented the authorities from going ahead with the move. “We raise demands with the Health Department based on our remaining stock. For the next two weeks, we need on an average 3,000 vaccine shots per day to make the camps run at the current pace. But without stocks coming from the Union government, the Health Department cannot do much too,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/c-orpn-may-close-camps-due-to-vaccine-shortage/article34363728.ece
20 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||SSLC, Plus Two exams to continue||The SSLC, Plus Two higher secondary, and vocational higher secondary examinations in the State will continue in strict compliance with the COVID-19 protocols. The exams are being conducted as per the guidelines of the safety protocols issued to education officers and chief superintendents, a statement from the Director of General Education on Monday said. Arrangements have been made for students to appear for the exams maintaining physical distancing. Directives have been issued to ensure that teaching and non-teaching staff wore triple layer masks and students also wore such masks to the maximum extent possible. Strict scanning Students will be allowed inside school compounds only after their body temperature is scanned and soaps and sanitisers have been made available at every exam centre. Steps are in place to specially receive answer scripts of students who are COVID-19 positive and send these to valuation camps. Schools have made arrangements to seat separately students who are COVID-19 positive, those in quarantine, and those with high body temperatures. Principals have been asked to make travel arrangements for children to reach the exam centres. Halls will be sanitised after each exam. Monitoring teams Monitoring teams of education officials formed at State, revenue district, and education district-levels are reviewing the guidelines being implemented in each school. Besides, presence of health workers, voluntary organisations, parent-teacher associations, and school management committees has been ensured in each exam centre. Four SSLC papers remain to be conducted, as also Plus Two exams scheduled for four days. The SSLC exams will conclude on April 29, while the Plus Two and vocational exams on April 26. Students’ feedback Senior officials of the General Education Department told The Hindu that the feedback from students and parents was that they wanted the exams to be completed. Moreover, there were practical problems involved in the postponement since the exams were also being held in the Gulf region and Lakshadweep. Unlike Central or other State boards where exams were yet to begin, exams in Kerala were already under way, they pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sslc-plus-two-exams-to-continue/article34363225.ece
20 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State to ascertain if double mutant variant is driving transmission||The Core Group for COVID-19 Management, chaired by Chief Secretary V. P. Joy, on Monday directed the Health Department to take immediate steps to ascertain if the double mutant variant, or the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.617, is indeed driving the disease transmission in Kerala. The State is awaiting the results of the samples it had sent to national institutes for genome sequencing. A meeting of the group termed this a priority, given the intense pace of disease transmission in the State and the fact that vaccine breakthrough infections are being reported increasingly in health-care workers who have received both doses. The B.1.617 lineage is defined by two spike protein mutations, E484Q and L452R, which are involved in immune escape (which renders the virus capable of escaping the immune system’s response) as well as increased infectivity. The variant, which wreaked havoc in Maharashtra havoc, could have easily reached Kerala through domestic travel, experts point out. The core group directed the department to conduct a second round of augmented testing on April 21 and 22, with three lakh samples as the target. The department has been directed to focus the testing in local bodies where the test positivity rate is high and to trace and test as many contacts of patients as possible. The meeting directed the Principal Secretary (Health) to take a relook at the State’s discharge policy for COVID patients. Kerala is perhaps the only place where patients are discharged only after they test negative in a rapid antigen test. 13,644 new cases The results of the augmented COVID-19 mass testing drive in Kerala are still trickling in and on Monday, when the results of 87,275 samples analysed in the past 24 hours were released, the State reported 13,644 new cases. The test positivity rate (TPR) registered on the day was 15.63%. The State went past the the active caseload it had during the first peak of the epidemic in October last and now has a pool of 1,03,004 active cases. During the first peak, the active caseload had been 97,417 cases. Hospital admissions now number 12,281. On Monday, 2,506 persons were admitted to hospitals. ICU admissions are on the rise in all districts. The State now has 889 patients requiring ICU care, with the number of patients requiring ventilator assistance rising to 248. Doctors are still astounded by the sheer pace of the current disease transmission, as family clusters are being reported in large numbers. As vaccination is yet to penetrate to the 18-45 age group, the prospect of them transmitting the infection to the partially vaccinated adults at home has been high, it is said. 21 deaths The cumulative case burden of the State has risen to 12,53,068 cases. Twenty-one recent deaths to the official list of COVID-19 deaths on Monday. Kozhikode reported 2,022 new cases, Ernakulam 1,781, Malappuram 1,661, Thrissur 1,388, Kannur 1,175, Thiruvananthapuram 981, Kottayam 973, Alappuzha 704, Kasaragod 676, Palakkad 581, Idukki 469, Kollam 455, Pathanamthitta 390 and Wayanad 388.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-to-ascertain-if-double-mutant-variant-is-driving-transmission/article34363228.ece
20 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Bank workforce seeks more strong protective measures||Reduced working hours, five days working per week, working with reduced staff, and hub banking, have been mooted to ensure safety of the bank employees and customers from the pandemic. The seven-point suggestions to create a “strong shield of safety to banks’ workforce and customers” had been put forward by United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) in addition to the 13-point advisory given by SLBC to the member banks to comply with. Urgent necessity As done last year during the lockdown months, the UFBU has said that there is an urgent necessity to restrict physical banking for next four to six months and also to reduce working hours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Secondly, banking should be restricted to five days a week to break the chain. This would cut the exposure of the bank staff and the customers to a great extent without impairing services. Letter to CM In a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, forum convenor C.D. Josson has said all the banks should be asked to deploy minimum possible staff/officers at branches/offices. Measures like working with one third, half of staff strength, and work from home, should be implemented for four to six months. Staff and officers should be asked to work on rotation. Instead of opening all branches at multi-centres, numbers may be restricted in such a manner that banking facilities could be extended at select branches. All segments of society—commercial organisations, State/Central/banks/PSUs—should be directed to work only during stipulated hours. The time of working should be deferred so that the footfalls and traffic on road is reduced and congregations are minimised. Vaccination for staff Considering the nature of work to come in contact with hundreds of customers every day, bankmen carry higher risk and steps should be taken to initiate measures to provide vaccination to all employees and their family members. Exemption has sought for employees with existing co-morbidities, pregnant employees, and persons with disabilities from duty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bank-workforce-seeks-more-protective-measures/article34363156.ece
20 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Vigil stepped up on Inchivila border||Amid the rising COVID-19 caseload, the Kerala Police intensified surveillance on the inter-State border at Inchivila where motorists crossed over to Kanyakumari on Monday. However, the police were yet to strictly enforce the guidelines that had been issued by the government for domestic travellers a day ago. A team of six officials, led by a Sub-Inspector and comprising four police officers and two health workers, collected details of all incoming vehicles and the passengers. While some travellers carried passes obtained after registering on the e-Jagratha portal, others did not possess such documents. But, none were turned back on the first day of increased vigil. Besides, the authorities were yet to enforce the need for COVID-19 certificates obtained after undergoing RT-PCR tests. Goods vehicles were permitted to pass without inspection to prevent any hindrance for the supply for essential commodities and perishables. Officials conceded certain chinks persisted in the measures that were adopted at the border. While motorists were screened, people who entered the border on foot could pass through smoothly without having to provide any details. While Kerala State Road Transport Corporation buses conclude their services on the Inchivila check-post, such travellers cross over to the Kanyakumari side and board buses. Similarly, those from Kanyakumari too entered Thiruvananthapuram in a similar manner. Moreover, they added it was impractical to insist for RT-PCR reports from people who lived close to the border and frequented Kaliyikkavila and nearby areas for their livelihood and other purposes. Neyyattinkara Deputy Superintendent of Police (Dy.SP) R. Binu said a foolproof mechanism was yet to be put in place. He, however, added the screening will be strengthened in the days to come with further clarity expected on the guidelines for domestic travellers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vigil-stepped-up-at-inchivila-on-kerala-tamil-nadu-border/article34363211.ece

As part of maximising treatment facilities, it has been decided to set aside 20% of the beds in private hospitals in the district for COVID-19 patients, District Collector Navjot Khosa said after holding discussions with private hospitals here on Monday. The decision will ensure availability of about 1,000 beds in 24 private hospitals in the district for COVID-19 patients. Patients in the ‘B’ and ‘C’ categories will be given priority in the hospitals. Ms. Khosa urged the private healthcare establishments to support the efforts of the government for effectively curbing the spread of the disease. All private hospitals have been directed to appoint a nodal officer for matters related to the management of COVID-19 and they should remain in touch with the District Programme Management and Support Unit (DPMSU) which functions round-the-clock at the District Collectorate. The nodal officers should have a clear idea about the facilities available for COVID-19 patients, including the number of beds, in their hospitals, the Collector said. The nodal officer will also be responsible for uploading the information on the COVID-19 Jagratha portal. District Development Commissioner Vinay Goyal, District Medical Officer K. S.

20 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSRTC operates more services to ease curbs||The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has started operating more schedules in the State to mitigate the hassles caused by the restrictions on travelling standing on buses in the wake of the spurt in COVID-19. The government has restricted the number of passengers to the sanctioned seat capacity of buses. As the majority of seats often get filled at the starting point of the trip itself during peak hours, commute for others boarding in between has turned a hurdle. Compared to the 3,261 schedules the KSRTC operated on April 17, it had 3,362 schedules on Monday. On Sunday, the KSRTC operated 2,315 schedules and the services came in handy for many of those who attended the Public Service Commission examinations. To serve all “The aim is to provide services to all and help commuters not go in search of other modes of transport,” a senior KSRTC official told The Hindu . The corporation is also relieved to carry passengers in all seats now. However, the loss from ticketing revenue caused by disallowing travel by standing will not be overcome with operation of more schedules. In the South zone comprising Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta districts, the KSRTC ferries 7.5 lakh commuters daily and 8 lakh during peak days. The restrictions came at a time when the revenue was picking up after the KSRTC resumed full-fledged operations in December 2020 after the services were suspended for nine months from March 25 last year following the lockdown. COVID fares The KSRTC was operating 5,218 schedules before the lockdown days and the initial plan was to operate at least 4,791 schedules daily. COVID special fares introduced to overcome the curbs are still applicable, but fares have been reduced by 25% in superfast and above classes, air-conditioned and JNNURM buses on three post-peak days of the week.  Curbs come at a time when revenue has been picking up after KSRTC resumed full-fledged ops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-operates-more-services-to-ease-covid-curbs/article34363155.ece

In a letter to Governor Arif Mohammad Khan, Mr. Chennithala said a shutdown would wipe out jobs. Restricting shop timings was counterproductive. It would lead to panic buying and overcrowding. Instead, the administration should extend business timings. Authorities should ask shop owners to institute a token system to allot time to customers in advance. Crowd control should be the watchword and not lockdown, he said. However, Mr. Chennithala called for strict enforcement of the pandemic protocol in hotspots. He called for enforcing the social distancing and mask mandate via consensus. Mr. Chennithala said the government required redefining hospital admission protocol. The pandemic scare had caused the affluent with mild symptoms to get hospitalised as a precaution. Hence, the critically ill found themselves without beds. He said private hospitals should follow a referral system. Treatment cost There is a need to regulate the cost of COVID-19 treatment at private hospitals. The administration should ensure the availability of medical oxygen, beds, ventilators, steroids and anti-viral medication. The government should enumerate the ICUs and ventilators in public and private sectors. It should form a shared pool of critical medical care equipment and apportion it as required. The Centre’s insurance coverage for health workers had expired in March. Mr. Chennithala sought Mr. Khan’s intervention to extend the protection till December.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/opposition-argues-against-lockdown/article34363221.ece

20 April 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Farmers in Anantapur await financial aid under MGNREGS||Many farmers in Anantapur district, engaged in dryland horticulture, are still waiting for the financial aid sanctioned by the Central government under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. At least Rs. 87.47 crore was sanctioned for planting and cultivating the crops under the scheme, but many of the 13,700 beneficiaries are yet to receive it even after two years. While 23,320 acres were covered under this scheme in the 2019-20 financial year benefiting 8,100 farmers, 16,061 acres were covered benefiting 5,607 beneficiaries in the year 2020-21. The farmers planted mango, sweet lime, cheeku, pomegranate, among others.  The Hindu visited Patha Bathalapalli, a village in Nallamada mandal, where the farmers had planted mango saplings in December 2019 and had been nurturing them by buying water from tankers as groundwater was not available. “We got some respite during the monsoon, and some people were lucky as their borewells turned functional after the groundwater levels improved this year,” says Pulivendula Chittamma, one of the beneficiaries. Similar is the case with Gangulamma and C. Narasimhulu in the village, who have sown mango saplings in two acres and three acres respectively and had received some money for pitting operations, but were waiting for the larger chunk of the amount due to them. “With the financial year coming to an end, we are worried if our bills would be sanctioned,” explains Narasimhulu. He said they did not go for the regular NREGS work as all mandays got commuted under the scheme for raising the mango plants for three years. Nallamada mandal has 12 Gram Panchayats and 197 farmers had registered under the scheme for 2020-21 covering 197 acres, said Field Assistant M. Ganesh. Patha Bathalapalli alone has 42 farmers cultivating horticulture crops under the scheme in 111.94 acres and for the three-year period, they would be paid Rs. 31 lakh for the cost of saplings, pitting, adding fertilizer, transportation, and technical assistance on raising the crops. Mr. Ganesh said beneficiaries would get their money as it has been sanctioned and partially paid. But for reasons unknown, there was a delay in payment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmers-in-anantapur-await-financial-aid-under-mgnregs/article34362981.ece
20 April 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jogini’s daughter gets job||A jogini’s daughter from Kurnool district has been appointed as an outsourced digital assistant in the Chief Planning Officer’s office in Anantapur as rehabilitation measures after she, along with her husband, submitted a representation to the State government through Anantapur Collector. Rehabilitation measures A Bsc. graduate, P. Sugunavathi, along with her husband N. Bhaskar, took the appointment order from Collector Gandham Chandrudu on Monday. She had approached the government two years ago after her marriage, but it took some time for approval. Finally, the Collector under the ‘backlog posts’ filling criteria authorised the CPO to appoint Sugunavathi as digital assistant through the Andhra Pradesh Corporation for Outsourced Services (APCOS). The couple hailing from Marlamadiki village of Holagunda mandal had been suffering due to lack of work and doing some odd jobs for a living. “We are indebted to the Collector for providing us a livelihood,” Ms. Sugunavathi told The Hindu . In several mandals of Kurnool and Anantapur districts, devadasi, jogini, and basavini system is prevalent. The government is taking all steps to rehabilitate them by ensuring livelihood, said Mr. Chandrudu. During the COVID-induced lockdown in July last year, they were provided with 1,750 kits comprising food grains and other essentials through the district administration by the Sri Sathya Sai Trust. Each kit included 25 kg rice, 5 kg wheat flour, lentils, oil, and a saree.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/joginis-daughter-gets-job/article34363665.ece

20 April 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Lexicographer Venkatasubbaiah passes away||People of Karnataka called G. Venkatasubbaiah (GV), who passed away on Monday at 107, a “walking dictionary” and it was no cliché. Even at an advanced age, the lexicographer remained the final arbiter on Kannada words, their etymology, usage, and grammar. GV, suffering from age-related illnesses, was admitted to a private hospital a week ago. His last rites were conducted with State honours on Monday. All through his long life, GV was the go-to person when in doubt on a word, or when a new word had to be coined to keep Kannada in pace with the changing world. Never did he fail to rise to the occasion. Coming from a family of Sanskrit and Kannada scholars from Ganjam, Mandya district, GV developed a fascination for words, grammar and classical literature early in life. While studying Kannada in Mysuru in the 1930s, it was lexicographer and scholar A.R. Krishna Shastry who instilled in him a deep fascination for words. “One day, he asked me what my interests were. I said research, literary history and translation, not lexicography,” he recalled in what was probably his last interview to Frontline in February earlier this year. Though lexicography will dominate his legacy, he was also a literary critic, an editor of literary collections, a translator, and even author of children’s literature. He also taught Kannada at various colleges and had a long career at Vijaya College in the city, where he retired as principal in 1973. His life’s monumental work was the 9,000-page eight-volume Kannada-Kannada dictionary by the Kannada Sahitya Parishat compiled over five decades (1944-1994), started under the tutelage of Prof. Shastry. GV filled his shoes as chief editor of the project after his death and completed the work. GV went on to work on 14 Kannada dictionaries, including Klishta Padakosha , a dictionary of complex words. He also served as the vice-president of the Lexicographical Association of India for 17 years. Literary critic Rajendra Chenni credits GV with taking lexicography and etymology of words from the confines of the scholarly to civil society. His decade-long column Igo Kannada, where he discussed the socio-linguistic etymology of words and idioms and phrases in Kannada in the daily Prajavani was one such effort. “He was aware of the need for an educated awareness of the concerns of the language and articulated it as part of civil society,” he said. In his presidential address at the sahitya sammelan in 2011 in Bengaluru, he was critical of the “coarse language” of the State’s political discourse and the media. GV was a passionate advocate of the Kannada cause and argued for Kannada in education and administration and for preference to Kannadigas in jobs. He advocated for Kannada to be taught in all schools as a mandatory first language till class 10. On one occasion, he called English a “murderous language”, and said while he was not opposed to teaching English in school, parents ought to teach Kannada first to their children. However, he was open to assimilation of words from other languages, including English into Kannada. He said such words do not destroy Kannada and the language can absorb and digest such words and make them its own. Unlike many prophets of doom, he remained optimistic about Kannada till the end. He observed that Kannada was the 26th most widely spoken language in the world. “One should not jump to the conclusion that Kannada is dying because of the dismal state of the language in Bengaluru. The language is alive and kicking in the rural pockets of the State,” he said in the interview to Frontline .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/his-was-the-last-word/article34363250.ece
20 April 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Shetty, wife restrained from mortgaging assets||The Karnataka High Court has granted temporary injunction restraining NRI entrepreneur and promoter of UAE-based NMC Healthcare, B.R Shetty, and his wife from alienating, transferring, dissipating and mortgaging their movable assets such as shares and deposits in banks. A Division Bench passed the order while allowing an appeal by the Bank of Baroda, which had questioned the August 28, 2020 order of the Commercial Court granting temporary injunctions in respect of only immovable properties of Mr. Shetty and his wife Chandrakumari R. Shetty. Mr. Shetty and the Dubai-based companies/entities controlled by him had taken loans to the tune of Rs. 2,077 crore and as on May 5, 2020, liability of him and his companies to the bank is around Rs. 1,912 crore, the bank had told the court. Meanwhile, the Bench dismissed the appeals filed by Mr. Shetty and Ms. Shetty challenging the Commercial Court order of granting temporary injunction in respect of immovable properties. The High Court said the Commercial Court was not right in denying temporary injunction in respect of movable assets merely because the bank had not furnished specific particulars of assets such as shares, mutual funds, bank deposits etc. The bank was not in a position to provide these details as Mr. Shetty had failed to furnish details of all movable and immovable assets as per the undertaking given to the bank in the form of Letter of Negative Lien submitted to the bank, the High Court said, while pointing out that Mr. Shetty declined to provide details despite a notice issued by the bank to him in May 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/shetty-wife-restrained-from-mortgaging-assets/article34362934.ece

20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Take a call on curfew, HC tells Telangana||Telangana High Court on Monday asked the State government to take a call on imposing night curfew or weekend lockdowns to check spread of COVID-19. Observing that the courts were “bound by the interest of public”, the HC told the government that it would be compelled to pass directions if the government did not take a call on the matter in next 48 hours. “You do whatever you can do... We will do what you cannot do...” Chief Justice Hima Kohli told Advocate General B.S. Prasad appearing for State. Taking strong exception to the government’s inadequate response to its directions on managing and curtailing COVID-19, the HC instructed the Health Secretary and Director General of Police to appear during next date of hearing. A bench of CJ and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, hearing a batch of PIL petitions on COVID-19 related issues, noting that the “government’s monitoring was not enough”. “You (government) cannot afford to say monitoring when numbers of people testing positive for the virus were shooting up the ceiling,” the CJ remarked. The bench headed by the CJ directed the government to file a fresh affidavit. Among other details, the affidavit should explain what arrangements the government had made for people not having money for ambulances and to get blood and other tests done. The court wanted the government to explain if any nodal officer was appointed to supervise availability of Remdesivir vials. “What facilities were put in place to store Remdesivir stocks if they were seized during raids on hoarders,” the CJ wanted to know.  Helping families During the second wave of coronavirus infection, entire families were testing positive. The court sought to know if the government mooted any idea of supplying food to all such affected families since they cannot prepare food for themselves. The CJ repeatedly asked the AG why the government had not taken any specific decision to control the number of persons participating in marriages, funerals and election rallies. The court asked the government what information dissemination system about the availability of hospitals extending treatment for coronavirus was available to the public. Citing figures from the report filed by the government, the CJ observed that over 1,000 persons from the five districts of Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Sangareddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri districts tested positive in a specific period. What steps was the government taking in such areas witnessing high incidence of COVID-19, the bench questioned the AG. When the batch of PIL pleas came up for hearing in the morning, the CJ took serious objection to the failure of the government to comply with its earlier orders on the matter. Rejecting the repeated assurances of the AG that State government was doing everything and geared up to tackle COVID-19, the CJ said the court wanted to hear directly from the officials concerned what actions they were taking at the field level.  Curbs on participants The matter was passed over and taken up for hearing during post-lunch session. When the CJ expressed concern over the growing number of people testing positive for the virus, the State Health Secretary appearing in the virtual court proceedings said recently held festivals could be one of the reasons for the spurt. “We are not talking about religious congregations but want to know why you are not restricting number of people attending marriages, funerals,” the CJ said. When the Health Secretary sought time to give a detailed action plan, the CJ said it was already 10 days since the HC had instructed them to chalk out strategy to check the virus. “How much time is time for you... You already wasted 240 hours,” the CJ said. Addressing the AG, the CJ said the Secretary’s response to the questions posed by the bench was not good.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/take-a-call-on-curfew-hc-tells-telangana/article34362933.ece

20 April 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mad scramble for Remdesivir in the city||Anxious family members of COVID-19 patients jostled with each other outside a private firm’s premises near Kukatpally Y Junction here on Monday afternoon. All this to lay their hands on Remdesivir vials which was in shortage for the past few weeks. A serpentine queue extended for over 1 km and some more people stood along the length of a long gate of the firm’s building. When one opened the gate to step out of the premises, people barged in. Around two policemen posted there had to physically hold back people, many of whom had come from faraway districts in Telangana and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh in search of the drug. A few stood at the side fearing they might contract coronavirus if they joined the chaotic group. Doctors said the place could turn a COVID-19 hotspot. People have been trying all means to get some doses of Remdesivir for their dear ones admitted at hospitals. Apart from mid-level and small hospitals, a few corporate hospitals have been facing shortage of the medicine. Telangana Drug Control Administration (DCA) officials said the anti-viral drug is being supplied directly to hospitals and not sold at medical shops or any retail outlets as such. A list of around 1,300 hospitals were given to two companies manufacturing the drug. However, earnest requests from people requesting the anti-viral drug continued. A message was circulated on social media platforms that the medicine was available at the firm near Kukatpally Y Junction. On Monday afternoon, over 50 people stood in queue there. They brought a doctor’s prescription of Remdesivir, copies of Aadhaar card and test report of the patients. “I have been waiting for over two hours and saw only four people coming out with the medicine,” said a man standing a little away from the gate. In about half hour, two people were seen walking out with sealed thermocol boxes containing the drug. Despite multiple attempts to reach the firm’s management over phone and through texts, they did not respond. People hoped for a smooth process of the drug distribution, information on availability and time taken for their turn to get the drug. DCA officials said that revision of medicine price could be the reason for long delay in issuing it, and hence, the long queue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mad-scramble-for-remdesivir-in-the-city/article34363524.ece

20 April 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||CBI may file FIR in ISRO espionage case soon||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) may register a First Information Report (FIR) shortly on the alleged framing of space scientist Nambi Narayanan in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) espionage case. It was on a petition filed by Mr. Narayanan against the failure of the State government to initiate action against “erring” police officials Siby Mathews, K.K. Joshua, and S. Vijayan, who probed the ISRO espionage case, that the apex court passed the order. The Supreme Court had last week directed the agency to treat the D.K. Jain Commission report into the alleged incidents as a “preliminary inquiry report and proceed in the matter appropriately.” While asking the CBI not to make the committee report public, the court suggested that it use the report during “further inquiry/investigation process that is required to be undertaken by the CBI as recommended in the report.” In all probability, said a former member of the CBI investigation team, the probe would be entrusted to Special Crime Unit in New Delhi, which had earlier probed the case. Since the CBI had filed a closure report with the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, the FIR was likely to be filed with the same court, he said. According to C. Unnikrishnan, the counsel for Mr. Narayanan, the CBI will have to probe the criminal conspiracy hatched by the top Kerala Police and Intelligence Bureau officials, the political leaders and others to falsely implicate the space scientist. The agency may have to interrogate those persons who were in power in the State during the alleged offence to bring out the extent of the conspiracy, he said. The framing of the false case against the space scientist should be treated as waging of war against the government of India as it sabotaged the ambitious space exploration plans of the country besides causing economic loss, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cbi-may-file-fir-in-isro-espionage-case-soon/article34362937.ece
20 April 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Father behind girl’s death: Kerala police||Evidence indicates that Sanu Mohan, 40, who was arrested from Karnataka on Sunday, smothered his 13-year-old daughter Vaiga at his apartment in Kangarapady here with the intention of killing her on March 21, carried the unconscious child in his car and pushed her into the Muttar river from where her body was recovered on March 23, District Police Chief (Kochi City) C.H. Nagaraju said here on Monday. The police team probing the girl’s death got custody of Sanu for 10 days after he was produced in court on Monday. Mr. Nagaraju said there was no evidence of the involvement of anyone else in her death. Post-mortem report The post-mortem report mentioned water in her lungs, which suggested that she could breathe before drowning in the river. Sanu Mohan had been charged under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. He claimed that he wanted to take his life after killing his daughter. “These claims have to be verified, since he has been giving contradictory statements. He appears to be a secretive person, rarely sharing his business details with the family,” Mr. Nagaraju told the media. Cheating case in Pune Mr. Nagaraju said Sanu, who was into steel business in Pune, was wanted by the Economic Offences Wing of the Maharashtra Police in connection with a cheating case involving Rs. 3 crore. A case was charged five years ago, following which he gave the police the slip and came to Kochi. “He used to splurge on lottery tickets and was into gambling as well. It appears his mounting debts and his wish to escape from here led him to kill his daughter. He says he did not want his daughter to be ‘orphaned’,” Mr. Nagaraju said. On the bloodstains found at the apartment at Kangarapady, Mr. Nagaraju said Sanu attributed this to blood oozing from Vaiga’s nose as he tried to smother her. Scientific evidence on this is awaited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/girls-death-kerala-man-in-police-custody/article34362935.ece

20 April 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Farmer leaders call for ‘second freedom struggle’ against Centre||Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders on Monday gave a clarion call to the people to launch a sustained struggle against the Centre to end the ‘misrule’ of the Narendra Modi government, taking inspiration from the Indian freedom movement. Speaking at a farmers’ ‘Mahapanchayat’ presided over by All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee State convener Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao at the sprawling ABM College here, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait vowed to lead a protracted struggle till “the three black farm laws are either repealed or the Bharatiya Janata Party bows out of office”. “ Ladenge, jeetenge (we will fight, we will win), Mr. Tikait thundered, drawing a resounding applause from a huge crowd of farmers who had converged from across South Coastal Andhra Pradesh for the rally. Mr. Tikait said he was glad to be in Ongole, which was known for being the heartland of the famous Ongole bull and also the base for many farmer struggles. “The controversial farm laws will pave the way for a vice-like grip of corporate firms on the farm sector, leading to all-round price rise affecting the common people the most. The struggle by farmers has now got the support of more sections of people including industrial workers who were upset over the PSU privatisation spree of the BJP-led Government,” Mr. Tikait said. All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) national president Ashok Dhawale said statutory backing to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime was the need of the hour to provide succour to farmers who were taking the extreme step of ending their lives due to unremunerative returns for their produce. Kerala model The ‘Kerala model’ of remunerative price for paddy and other crops including fruits and vegetables should be implemented across the country to end the serious agrarian crisis, he opined. The NDA government was alienating farmers, farm workers and industrial workers who were major producers of national wealth, in order to please the corporate sector, Mr. Dhawale said and called for a sustained campaign to end the “misrule” of the NDA government at the Centre. AIKS Punjab unit president Balkaran Singh Brar said the farmers’ protest which started in the States surrounding Delhi had spread to different parts of the country now, drawing support from a larger section of people. ‘Do-or-die battle’ “We are prepared for a do-or-die battle,” he said, mentioning how farmers including women from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were staying put on the borders of Delhi for over five months now. Mr. Tikait released a Telugu version of ‘Mandi, Market and Modi’ written by journalist Hartosh Singh Bal and published by the AIKMS.

20 April 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Junior Investigation Officer project yielded good results’||Junior Investigation Officer(JIO) project, launched for the first time in the country in Prakasam to enhance professionalism of head constables(HCs) and assistant sub-inspectors(ASIs), has yielded positive results, noted Additional Director General of Police(Training) N. Sanjay. As part of the project, police personnel at the grassroots level are given training in techniques required during investigations, such as collecting the evidence at the crime scene or recording the witness’s statement under section Cr.PC. 161 or drawing a rough sketch of the crime scene. Prakasam Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal took the initiative to train a batch of 456 HCs and ASIs in October 2019. Now, one-and-a-half years after their training, they are investigating cases at par with senior investigation officers with confidence, said the SP. During an evaluation programme on Wednesday, the SP reviewed the performance of 62 JIOs attached to Ongole I town and Ongole Taluka police station. He was fully satisfied with their performance. The SP had also instructed inspectors to conduct a similar evaluation programme within their circles on Wednesdays and guide the JIOs suitably from time to time. Earlier, all the cases were investigated by the sub-inspectors and senior officers. As a result, registration of cases in the district used to be low. Now, 90% of the cases are being investigated by JIOs and the remaining cases, relating to grave offences, are taken up by senior officers, said Mr. Siddharth Kaushal.  Achievements So far, the JIOs have registered 15,820 cases since the launch of the project in Prakasam district. They have taken up probe in 15,211 cases and completed investigation in 11,998 and filed a final report in courts. The rest of the cases were under investigation, the SP noted and gave them valuable inputs to file charge sheets in the pending cases early. One of the JIOs, S.D. Hussain, recalled how he used to shy away from investigating cases on his own and preferred to do bandobust and patrolling duties only. “Thanks to JIO project, I am now confident of gathering necessary evidence in each case on my own and ensure conviction for the accused in courts,” he added with a sense of satisfaction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/junior-investigation-officer-project-yielded-good-results/article34362983.ece

20 April 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD decentralises cottage allotment system||In a pilgrim-friendly move, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) on Monday simplified the allotment procedure of cottages and guesthouses to the devotees who have booked their accommodation online. Special counters have been set up at Padala mandapam on the Alipiri footpath and Sri Vari Mettu trekking route, besides the security checking plaza in Tirupati for the purpose. Two counters on the trekking routes will cater to the needs of the devotees reaching on foot, while the one at Alipiri checking point will meet the requirements of those motoring up to the hill town. Devotees can scan their advance or online tokens at the counters and reach straight the specified sub-enquiry offices at Tirumala and avail of their accommodation. The move will not only enable the devotees save time, but also will save them from waiting hours at the Central Reception Office (CRO) at Tirumala and check the congregation of people at a particular place. On similar lines, the TTD is also mulling to decentralise the CRO and set up registration counters at six points and shift the allotment counters to the respective sub-enquiry offices. Flexible darshan Yet in another important decision, the temple trust board has announced that pilgrims unable to visit the Lord Venkateswara temple between April 21 and 30, despite having darshan tickets, can choose any day of their choice within 90 days for the darshan of Lord Venkateswara. The decision was taken amid growing concerns over pilgrims’ health and safety in the backdrop of the surge in coronavirus cases across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-decentralises-cottage-allotment-system/article34363667.ece
20 April 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||Curbs on darshan tightened||The surge in coronavirus infection has its impact felt at the temple of Lord Venkateswara, with the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) tightening the curbs when it comes to allowing pilgrims to have darshan . Reiterating that checking the second wave of the virus infection as paramount, the TTD slashed the issuance of Sarva Darshan tokens to 15,000 from 30,000 a day during the last week of March and imposed a complete ban on its issuance from April 12. The hundi income which was Rs. 3 crore a day is now around Rs. 2 crore after the enforcement of the limitations. The TTD has already imposed restrictions in permitting the pilgrims to Tirumala. Pilgrims with valid darshan tokens are alone allowed to motor up to the hill town. They can either motor up on the same day or a day in advance any time after 1 p.m. Similarly, those taking to the footpaths to the temple can trek either on the same day or a day in advance after 9 a.m. These initiatives have been taken to avoid congregation of more pilgrims atop the town. Speculations are rife that the TTD may impose curbs on the issuance of Rs. 300 special entry darshan tickets which at present are issued 30,000 a day. However, a decision is likely to be taken when the darshan tickets quota for the month of May will be released soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/curbs-on-darshan-tightened/article34363669.ece
20 April 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP made a mockery of democracy, says TDP||The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) accused the ruling YSRCP of having resorted to large-scale irregularities in the recently-held byelection to the Tirupati Lok Sabha constituencyon Monday. “The ruling party has made a mockery of democracy. The incidents that occurred on election day show the temple city in a poor light,” M. Sugunamma, the TDP’s Tirupati Assembly constituency in-charge said at the press conference which was attended by TDP State secretary B. Changalrayudu, youth wing leader Sridhar Varma and city unit chief D. Bhaskar Yadav. Recalling the turn of events on election day, when “bus loads of people from outside the constituency were brought here to cast their votes”, Ms. Sugunamma wondered why the ruling party, which was confident of victory , was so desperate to win the election. “Such incidents happening in remote villages go unnoticed, but it is an insult to the voters of Tirupati, which is home to intellectuals, academicians, educated people and industrial employees. Instead of importing voters from outside by paying them money, the ruling party could have spent the same on the welfare of local voters,” Ms. Sugunamma remarked. “The ruling party received intelligence inputs that the TDP will win 30% votes after the campaign of our president N. Chandrababu Naidu, hence the irregularities,” she alleged, wondering why the micro observers were unable to find a single act of discrepancy in the 380 polling stations in the city constituency. Meanwhile, the BJP has urged the police to register FIRs on the complaints lodged by the party activists regarding large-scale irregularities by the ruling party. Party spokespersons Kola Anand Kumar and Samanchi Srinivas told reporters on Monday that the ruling YSRCP had resorted not only to impersonation, but also in creation of ‘fake’ EPIC cards, which they claimed was a grave offence. “Though we caught several persons and handed them over to the police, no action was taken against them and they were let off,” they said. The party said it would submit evidence of discrepancies to the High Court in the form of a report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-made-a-mockery-of-democracy-says-tdp/article34363671.ece

Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU) Executive Council Member T.V. Muralinatha Reddy. Speaking after inaugurating the South Zonal Research and Extension Consultative Committee (ZRECC) meeting at Regional Agricultural Research Station here on Monday, Mr. Reddy said that the latest intervention of RBKs should be properly utilised to derive maximum mileage to the farming community. He opined that agriculture and cattle rearing should complement each other and appealed to the officials to ensure that dairying became an integral part of every household in villages. Referring to the recent visit of a team to Rajasthan to study the farming pattern followed in upland and dryland areas, he said fodder seeds grown in such areas should be distributed to the farmers to ensure higher returns where water supply is minimal. Director of Research N. Trimurthulu suggested to the officials to take mechanisation to the reach of small and medium farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rbks-play-key-role-in-the-delivery-chain-to-farmers/article34362993.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday said the sharp increase in the number of positive cases in the last few days necessitated the closure of schools and restrictions on gatherings in public and closed spaces from April 20. In a review meeting on the COVID situation in the State on Monday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that maintaining physical distance was of utmost importance and people should be careful while going to cinema theatres, convention centres, hotels and other public places.

20 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘All farmer associations will join struggle for VSP’||Karmika Karshaka Sankharavam, a meeting against the Farm Laws and Labour Code, decided to involve women in the agitation against the ‘black laws’ and vowed to wage a relentless fight until the laws were repealed. Speakers at the meeting also extended their support to the ongoing agitation against the privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). The Sankharavam was organised by Andhra Pradesh Raithu Sanghala Samanvaya Committee and A.P. Samyukta Kisan Morcha here on Monday. The speakers said that the 500 farmer associations across the country would extend their full support to the VSP agitation. The slogan — Visakha Ukku Andhrula Hakku (Visakha Steel is the right of Andhraites) will hereforth be known as ‘Visakha Steel, Citizens’ Right, they asserted. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Singh Tikait said that the farm laws were not only adversely affecting the farmers but impacting other sections as well. Corporate houses and private players would commercially exploit hunger as ultimately all food grains procured from farmers would end up in private warehouses. The farmers’ agitation would be taken to all States in a bid to build more pressure on the ‘apathetic and adamant’ Union government. Tractors should play an important role in the agitation. Similarly, the women were requested to join the agitation, he said. All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) national president Ashok Dhawale alleged that the Union government has “murdered democracy and the Parliamentary system” by taking advantage of its numerical strength in the Parliament. As many as four lakh farmers have ended their lives in the country after the BJP came to power at the Centre, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/all-farmer-associations-will-join-struggle-for-vsp/article34363217.ece

He said 1,686 patients were in COVID Care Centres and 3,665 were being treated with the help of oxygen supply and ventilators. Rumours ruled out The COVID Command and Control Centre, in a separate release, said that if a person tests positive after vaccination it would be only because of the infection and not due to vaccination. “Both Covaxin and Covishield don’t lead to a positive test result. Post-vaccination, if a person is tested and RTPCR test turns positive, it means that the person has the disease,” the release said. It suggested that fever post-vaccination is not a cause of worry and is a common reaction that could be treated with 650mg paracetamol pill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/more-than-35000-under-home-isolation-in-state/article34363661.ece

Chandrababu Naidu has squarely blamed the YSRCP government and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for the ‘prevailing pathetic condition’ with regard to the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the State. He alleged that the government was handling the second wave of the pandemic without any strategy. Participating in a seminar chaired by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on ‘COVID Spread- Responsibility of Representatives’ organised on Monday, the former Chief Minister said that it was a matter of concern that the second wave in Andhra Pradesh was high. “Andhra Pradesh ranks fifth in the country when it comes to the single-day tally of infection. The situation has become miserable. So far, 9.6 lakh people in the State have been infected by the virus so far. The State government has failed to enforce the COVID protocols. The situation was exacerbated by the government’s non-compliance with the Central guidelines on testing, tracing and tracking,” said Mr. Naidu. High positivity rate “The daily positivity rate of 14% to 20% is a matter of concern. Leadership ability emerges only in catastrophic situations,” said Mr. Naidu. The TDP president said the government and the people’s representatives should focus on the creation of better health infrastructure. “It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that paramedical personnel perform their duties on a war footing and the daily testing capacity is increased. The vaccination process should be accelerated.

20 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bogus voting: Atchannaidu dares YSRCP leaders to take oath in Tirumala||TDP State president and former Minister K. Atchannaidu has challenged the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) leadership to take an oath at the temple of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala that the YSRCP has not indulged in bogus voting in the Tirupati Lok Sabha bypoll and the TDP will accept defeat. Addressing a media conference here on Monday, he sought that the DGP, Nellore Collector and Returning Officer, Peddireddy Ramchanadra Reddy, Chevireddy Bhaskara Reddy and the Chief Minister should take an oath in Tirumala on the issue. He recalled that at the time of election notification, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had claimed that the YSRCP candidate would win with over 5 lakh majority. After the TDP leaders started campaigning in Tirupati, the party gained tremendous support. He alleged that Ministers and YSRCP leaders became jittery with the growing support to the TDP and hatched a plan to scuttle the party’s winning chances. Thousands of persons were brought from neighbouring districts to cast bogus votes in the bypoll, he alleged. They were caught red-handed but the YSRCP Ministers and leaders were trying to blame the TDP for the bogus voting, Mr. Atchannaidu alleged. He alleged that for every 10 genuine votes, 40 bogus votes were cast in the bypoll. The impostors were brought from other districts in buses and after the TDP lodged a complaint with the officials and the police, the DGP had said that 250 buses came from other districts and they were sent back. He wondered why the police sent back the buses, instead of taking the bogus voters into custody and seizing the buses. He said that the TDP had submitted proofs of the bogus voting and had even complained to the Election Commission of India (ECI), State Election Commission (SEC) and the Returning Officer but no action was taken so far. He sought that the ECI should initiate action failing which people would lose faith in democracy. The TDP leader also disputed the claim of the Chief Minister that YSRCP has the support of the people and added that if that was so, why only 64% of voters had turned up to cast their vote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bogus-voting-atchannaidu-dares-ysrcp-leaders-to-take-oath-in-tirumala/article34363756.ece

20 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||RINL supplies 400 tons of oxygen for COVID patients||Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, has supplied around 400 tonnes of liquid oxygen, last week to various destinations in Andhra Pradesh and other States. The Air Separation Plant (ASP) in the RINL has five units of oxygen extraction plants for 7.3 mtpa steel plant. Out of which three units have capacity to produce 550 tonnes per unit per day and two units have the capacity to produce 600 tonnes per unit per day. On an average, the ASP produces 2,600 tonnes of oxygen and 100 tonnes of liquid oxygen, which is used for medical purposes. Rising to the occasion of oxygen requirements for COVID patients in this pandemic crisis, the RINL has already supplied around 400 tonnes of liquid oxygen last week and last year it has supplied 8,842 tonnes of liquid oxygen, said top sources in the RINL.  Future commitment Special ramps are being erected at the railway siding in Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) jointly by the VSP and technical staff or the railways to receive the empty liquid oxygen containers and later load them on to the wagon Roll On Roll Off (RORO) trains. The ramps will allow the container lorries to move down the wagons on to the ground. They would be driven into the oxygen plant for loading and after loading they would be driven back to the siding and mount the wagon via the ramp. The special container train, which was supposed to have started in Maharashtra on Sunday evening, was delayed and is likely to start on Monday and expected to reach the VSP sometime on Tuesday, according to sources. A green corridor is created to ensure speedy movement of the oxygen special to meet medical needs of people in various parts of the country. All other trains would give passage to this train. Around 15 of the 32 tankers of the oxygen special train, are expected to be loaded at the VSP. Each tanker would be of 15 tonne capacity, according to the sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rinl-rises-to-the-occasion-to-help-covid-patients/article34363546.ece

Education alone could eradicate poverty and change their lives. None of the previous governments had reimbursed the fee arrears on such a large scale, he said. The government was committed to the education sector and had rolled out schemes such as Jagananna Goru Mudha, Amma Vodi and Vasati Deevena to ensure that no family runs into debts for pursing studies. So far, a total of Rs. 4,879 crore has been spent under Jagananna Vidya Deevena benefiting 10.88 lakh students. Previously, the money was paid to college owners. The beneficiaries could call toll-free number 1902 if they face any problem in availing themselves of the scheme. The second instalment of fees will be released in July, the third in December and the last one for 2020-21 in February next year. A sum of Rs. 4,208 crore was released towards fee reimbursement for 2019-20. Besides, dues for 2018-19 amounting to Rs. 1,880 crore were cleared. Deputy Chief Minister Dharmana Krishnadas, Ministers Adimulapu Suresh and Ch. Venu Gopala Krishna, Principal Secretaries K. Satish Chandra (higher education), G. Anantharamu (BC welfare) and G.

20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS scales grim peaks as second COVID wave rages on||Coronavirus statistics over the past week has established the fact that the second wave of the pandemic is more severe and devastating for Telangana than the first one was. From April 12 to 18, as many as 25,904 cases were recorded, which is far higher than entire wmonthly figures recorded between December last year and March 2021. And in this duration of seven days, 73 patients died of the virus. Even this number makes for the maximum number of deaths recorded in a month from January to March 2021. After a brief lull earlier this year, coronavirus cases in the State started to surge from March 9. But it was in the past week that alarm bells started ringing and people coming to terms with the fact that the second wave is truly upon us. From April 14, the cases recorded in a day surpassed the previous day’s figures, hitting a new peak. The State has breached the grim marks of 4,000 and 5,000 infections during the past week. The 5,093 cases detected on Saturday are all-time high numbers. Besides, 15 deaths were recorded on Saturday which was also the highest number of fatalities since the pandemic outbreak. On Saturday, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said that cases are poised to increase further and advised people to take all precautions such as wearing masks in public places, maintaining social distancing and practising hand hygiene.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-scales-grim-peaks-as-second-covid-wave-rages-on/article34363522.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||City hospitals full to the brim as COVID surge continues||The health care facilities in the twin cities are facing an impending crisis situation with COVID-designated Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) in Gachibowli and over a dozen corporate hospitals declaring all the beds in Intensive Care Units (ICU) full on Monday. Although the official health bulletin issued quoting Sunday’s data said that in Gandhi Hospital, out of the 500 ICU beds with ventilator, 338 were occupied and 162 are vacant, the real picture is more dire, top health officials revealed on condition of anonymity. Of the 1,000 beds with oxygen facility, 202 are occupied and 798 vacant but “filling up fast”. Critical cases in these wards cannot be shifted to the ICUs as they are already filled to capacity. Similarly, in TIMS, all the 137 ICU beds are full even if the bulletin claimed 82 were occupied and 55 vacant. These will be full by tonight is the official estimate, pointing towards the grim situation. Leading corporate hospitals too are overstretched unable to provide ICU beds. “There has been acute shortage of COVID positive beds at our hospital for the past one week. There have been no additional discharges so we are turning away COVID patients due to the non-availability of beds,” a top representative shared. Yet another top executive of another hospital said the “situation is so bad that the beds in casualty and emergency wings are teeming with COVID-positive patients waiting for beds in the ICU and other private rooms. In fact, there is a waiting list of COVID positive patients waiting for beds,” he said. Top government officials lamented that “critical” cases were being discharged from the corporate hospitals against medical advice and being sent to Gandhi and TIMS Hospitals. “Death rates are rising because patients in precarious condition are being brought in ambulances to these two hospitals. Alarmingly, we are only expecting the situation to deteriorate in the next few days,” they fear. Fast depleting oxygen stocks in the private hospitals is making them panic and critical patients are being hurriedly being discharged to avoid the high casualties in their own facilities. “This is forcing families of the patients to rush them to Gandhi and other government facilities,” they claimed and added that the situation in the districts is equally bad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/city-hospitals-full-to-the-brim-as-covid-surge-continues/article34363534.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Tough task on hand for major parties in fray for 7 ULB polls||Leaders of major political parties in the fray for April 30 elections to the Municipal Corporations of Warangal and Khammam and five other Municipalities have a plenty of work on their hands for the next three days to convince the aspirants other than official candidates to withdraw their nominations and make them support the official nominees. With the completion of filing of nomination papers on April 18, the major political parties have turned their focus on finalising the electoral alliances with the friendly parties and ensuring that there is no split in the voter support for the party by making the party aspirants other than the official candidates withdraw from the fray. Unlike the elections to Assembly and even the GHMC where every constituency and ward, respectively, would have votes running into lakhs, the elections to other urban local bodies (ULBs) in the State would be tricky with every ward having a smaller electorate of running only into thousands. Stakes would be even higher with every vote turning crucial, unless a candidate has a clear support compared to his/her rivals. “The number of aspirants for ward members’ posts is higher than that for Mayor or Chairperson posts since the election to the two key posts is held indirectly as the aspirants for the latter posts need to be elected to the former posts first. That’s the reason why 1,314 aspirants from Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) have filed their papers for 248 ward members seats in the seven ULBs,” a senior party leader considered close to the leadership said. The competition for party tickets, even for the ward members’ posts, is also high in BJP and Congress, as 619 and 584 aspirants, respectively, have filed their papers in the seven ULBs knowing well that only 248 or lesser number in the event of alliance with friendly parties would get the party nomination. Aspirants from the CPI, CPI (M), TDP and AIMIM have also filed papers for some wards in some ULBs – not all. It is understood that an electoral alliance between TRS and CPI is almost finalised for Khammam Municipal Corporation and a deal is likely to be clinched between Congress and Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS). On the other hand, Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) and Jana Sena Party (JSP) have also decided work together in the elections to seven ULBs. “Unlike in GHMC, some independents having good name in the area also pose a threat to the chances of candidates of major parties and we have to tackle them too,” the TRS leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tough-task-on-hand-for-major-parties-in-fray-for-7-ulb-polls/article34363531.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Testing for COVID-19 infection, a test of patience||Testing positive for COVID-19 is a less traumatic experience for citizens in Telangana, than being able to get tested at all. Not all the testing centres here are equipped with the RTPCR kits which are considered the touchstone tests for determining the infection. Instead, at several government designated COVID-19 testing centres, only the Rapid Antigen tests are performed, which if negative, need to be supported by RTPCR test for final confirmation. While only area hospitals and above have the RTPCR tests, they too are available only in limited numbers, and labyrinthine queues are a major determent. With the number of people seeking tests spiralling, and the number of tests per day remaining static, the pile-up of the pending tests has been worsening by the day. “I visited for two consecutive days, but could not get tested due to the heavy crowd. With fever above 100 degrees and dysentery, I was unable to wait that long under the hot sun,” said P. Satya Murthy, a patient visiting the Vanasthalipuram Area Hospital. A predominantly large number of people who can afford the test are depending on private laboratories instead. While there are only 20 labs in government institutions, private labs are more numerous at 60. Rapid antigen testing is done at all Primary Health Centres and Urban Primary Health Centres too, but even these are limited in number. “I went to the PHC in Balapur to get the rapid test done, and was told that they were being given only 150 test kits per day, and that they had been fully booked for two days. My Aadhaar number and phone number were collected and I have been asked to visit after two days,” said P.Srinivas, a patient. Those resorting to private labs are not any luckier. With an influx of patients, the labs are unable to cater to the demand. Home sample collection requests are being rejected, as the patients seeking tests are far outnumbering the capacity of the labs. “We have been asked by the lab to stop home sample collection for a day, as there have been pile up of samples. We are informing patients beforehand that the results can be expected only after 48 hours, due to heavy pendency,” shared a representative offering home sample collection services on behalf of a private lab, on the condition of anonymity. There has been a 600 to 700 per cent spike in the demand for the tests over the past 10 days, said Anirudh from Health Analytix, another agency offering home sample collection service. The requests have gone up from about 600 per day earlier to 3,500 to 4,000 now, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/testing-for-covid-19-infection-a-test-of-patience/article34363542.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Is TS shying away from giving exact data?||Under-reporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Telangana is again the topic of discussion among highly placed officials in the government and the medical fraternity. The same issue was the centre of focus last year too. Though officials in the top levels are tight-lipped about the scale of under-reporting, they have confirmed that the numbers are higher than what is being presented in the daily media bulletins issued by the State Health department. Several officers that The Hindu contacted spoke on the condition of anonymity even as they admitted that the condition in the State was turning worse by the day. Some even compared Telangana to neighbouring Maharashtra and Gujarat in terms of the sharp spike in the number of coronavirus infections. Senior officers at the State level have even instructed district-level officers to refrain from issuing health bulletins, so that there is no conflict between the State government’s daily COVID-19 bulletin and district-level updates. “We have been given targets for how many tests are to be carried out, and test results are being monitored regularly by officials in Hyderabad. Online reports on the State’s official website and the daily State bulletin are differing in numbers, but I don’t want to get into it,” said a senior officer. Another official said that the numbers being reported by the government in the health bulletin are not the actual numbers, and that the figures were way higher. “I don’t want to reveal the exact numbers but they are much higher than what the media is told. This under-reporting is detrimental to the State, since Telangana cannot ask the Centre for the actual support required unless it reveals actual numbers,” the official said. ‘Avoiding panic’ One reason most officials attributed to this under-reporting is that the government wishes to avoid a panic amongst the public. However, officials also questioned this logic, since under-reporting might also lead to lax behaviour on the part of the public, whereas reporting the actual numbers can make people aware of how grim the situation is.  As another marker of how serious the COVID-19 situation in Telangana is, deaths at the State-run Gandhi Hospital were in double digits. While the health bulletin was showing daily deaths across the State to be near single digits until four days ago, the actual numbers are closer to 70 per day at Gandhi Hospital itself, a senior IAS officer closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation in the State said. When the same issue was pointed out last year, officials said that a committee which audits deaths evaluates reasons for the mortality. Though a person who got COVID-19 died, deaths were attributed to other health complications such as heart attack, stating that was the reason for the death and not COVID-19. The officer said that most of the districts in the State have already ran out of oxygen cylinders. “There is a severe shortage of oxygen cylinders, including in Hyderabad,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/is-government-fudging-data/article34363536.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Alarm bells ringing in State over impending oxygen shortage||Private hospital doctors, oxygen distributors and members of voluntary organisations have sounded caution over an impending medical oxygen shortage in the State. If cases were to further increase and more liquid oxygen is not supplied, they said it could lead to a huge shortage of the crucial resource in the coming days. Private hospital doctors said at least two small-scale hospitals, which ran out of medical oxygen, asked COVID-19 patients to be shifted to other medical facilities. “There were around 100 patients put together,” said a doctor. However, Health department officials maintain that there is no dearth of oxygen in government hospitals. An oxygen distributor said they used to supply around 30 cylinders of 7.1 cubic meter capacity a day to hospitals prior to the second wave of the pandemic. “Now, we are supplying 80-90 cylinders a day. We get oxygen from filling stations and they too are running short of it. If more of it is not supplied to the State, there could be a big problem. We did not expect such huge demand for medical oxygen,” said the distributor on the condition of anonymity. Trustee of Helping Hand Foundation, Mujtaba Askari said they have around 150 cylinders and are finding it hard to refill those. “Our staff went to a distributor on Sunday noon with a truckload of cylinders. By the time our turn came at around 8 p.m., we were told that there is no more oxygen. On Monday, we had to get the cylinders filled at multiple stations,” Mr Askari said. Requests pouring in He added that they are getting at least 100 calls a day from people requesting oxygen cylinders. “A majority of them are in home isolation. We counselled and asked them to get admitted to government hospitals. But some among the callers were family members of patients. Private hospitals have asked them to arrange for oxygen on their own. If there were to be more severe cases, oxygen shortage will increase,” he said. There is every possibility of a rise in severe cases as senior officials of the Health department have warned. Sources in the Health department said that they have requested the Centre to increase the supply from current 250 tonnes to 400 tonnes per day. “Out State is attached to get liquid oxygen from Bellary (Karnataka), one place in Odisha and another place. In case of corporate hospitals, their method of relying on oxygen cylinders will not serve the purpose. Last year, they were asked to install liquid oxygen tank so that there is no dearth of it. But only three to four of them have installed it,” sources said. Kiran Madhala, the head of Critical Care at Government Medical College in Nizamabad, said that according to World Health Organisation, medical help is needed when oxygen saturation levels fall below 94. “Taking oxygen at home is not suggested as doctors consider a lot of factors before deciding whether and how much oxygen is needed. However, people in home isolation have to monitor their oxygen saturation levels regularly. In Happy Hypoxia stage, people would look normal, face no discomfort but the saturation levels go down,” Dr Kiran said.  A majority of patients are in home isolation. Private hospitals have asked their families to arrange for oxygen on their own.

On Saturday, 5,093 cases had been recorded. This dip comes in the backdrop of fewer tests than usual, as has been the norm on weekends. On Sunday, 83,809 samples were examined as against the usual 1 lakh to 1.2 lakh tests being conducted daily since the past week with last Tuesday, which coincided with Ugadi, also being an exception. Though cases detected were low, fatalities remained high with 14 patients succumbing to the infectious disease. This is the second highest number of deaths in a day recorded multiple times since the outbreak last year. The death toll has reached 1,838. 100-plus cases Of the 33 districts in the State, 13 recorded more than 100 cases. The highest of 705 were from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation region, 363 from Medchal-Malkajgiri, 360 from Nizamabad, 336 from Rangareddy and 264 from Sangareddy, according to a media bulletin issued by the State Health department.

20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Ensure timely garbage clearance, GHMC officials told||Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration & Urban Development, Arvind Kumar has directed the GHMC officials to re-start the COVID-19 control room in the headquarters to share with citizens, the information related to the disease and the action against it. During a review meeting on Monday with senior officials of the GHMC, Mr. Arvind Kumar has issued instructions for 24x7 functioning of the control room monitored by senior officials. Nodel team A special nodal team should be established to address the needs of citizens with regard to COVID-19, and to give suggestions to them. He asked the zonal and deputy commissioners to take up inspections of government and private hospitals to ensure that the bio-waste being generated in large scale is being disposed of as per the rules. Face masks being thrown by the citizens on the roads too come under the definition of bio-waste, he observed, and asked officials to work in mission mode as they did last year in control of the first wave of COVID-19. Taking serious note of the sanitation issues in the city, Mr. Arvind Kumar said officials will not be spared for their laxity in sanitation-related activities. In view of the upcoming monsoons, the roads should be kept free of garbage to prevent communicable diseases, he said. Conveying Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s instructions, the Principal Secretary asked the Engineering, Health and Sanitation staff of every circle to share the responsibilities of the garbage clearance. Field inspections He asked the Deputy Commissioners and AMHOs of each circle to conduct field inspections before 6 a.m. daily, and monitor the sanitation activities. Severe action will be initiated against officials who do not fall in line, he warned. He also asked officials to penalise the “irresponsible” citizens who throw garbage on the roads despite several warnings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ensure-timely-garbage-clearance-ghmc-officials-told/article34363543.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Minister wants stringent steps to check spread of COVID-19||Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao exhorted the officials and elected representatives at the district, mandal and village levels to take stringent measures to check the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the areas under their respective jurisdictions. The Minister conducted a video conference with officials and elected representatives at different levels on the novel Coronavirus and asked them to prepare roadmap of works to check the spread of the virus. Though the second wave of the virus is less severe, it is spreading at a rapid pace, he said. The district, mandal and village administrations should take steps to make wearing masks mandatory and impose fine of Rs. 1,000 each on those violating the rule. Steps should be taken to ensure that all people above 45 years are vaccinated and people should be educated to maintain physical distance. The members of the self-help groups should be roped into the control measures and DWACRA groups should be asked to prepare masks for use in public places, he said. As a precautionary measure, Sodium Hypochlorite should be sprayed in all public places and fogging should be taken up on a regular basis. Steps should simultaneously be taken to check the spread of mosquitoes. With the summer season setting in, officials should focus on effective functioning of drinking water supply related infrastructure like overhead service reservoirs, water supply pipelines and public taps. Chlorination of drinking water sources should be a regular affair and sanitation drives for separately segregating dry and wet wastes should become regular feature at the grass roots level. Drinking water facility should be provided to workers engaged in works under the rural employment guarantee act and they should be provided with ORS sachets wherever necessary. Adequate care should be taken to ensure that works are carried out in the mornings and workers were given rest during the afternoons, he added.  District, mandal and village administrations should take steps to make wearing masks mandatory and impose fine of Rs. 1,000 each on those violating the rule.

20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Do you want people to become sitting ducks?’||Describing the affidavit filed by State government in COVID-19 related PIL petitions as “wishy and washy and disappointing”, Telangana High Court on Monday asked if it was contending for the post of COVID-19 positive topper in the country. “We are very unhappy with your affidavit as it does not contain any of the details like measures to check footfall in cinema halls and other public gathering places,” a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said. Expressing dissatisfaction with Advocate General B.S. Prasad’s reply that the State government geared up to tackle the situation, the bench passed over the matter to hear the pleas after lunch break. When the AG said the government was following the Centre’s guidelines on COVID-19, the CJ corrected him stating that Centre had said the States can formulate their own instructions on the issue. “What are you going to make of the people of the State….sitting ducks..?” the CJ remarked. The bench said the government was harping on checking international passengers but was “beautifully silent” on its measures controlling persons entering State through bus-stations, railway stations and through private vehicles. The CJ specifically wanted to know if the government had issued any circulars to check footfall at cinema halls, banquet halls, malls and public places witnessing large congregations of people. Noting that “it was a desperate situation and required desperate action by the State”, the CJ said “sorry for being tough but it question of life and death of people”. Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy asked the AG if the government had any problem in restricting the number of people thronging pubs and bars. “Please state if the government wants to close them or not,” the judge said. The judge also sought the government’s response over hospitals not admitting persons, who tested positive for coronavirus, unless condition of the latter was critical.  Comprehensive directions  Bring down occupancy in film theatres to 50% or one third of capacity. Get tabulated figures of Rapid Antigen Tests and RT-PCR tests done for past one week. Plans about curbing entry of people from neighbouring States witnessing high COVID-19 incidence. Steps to monitor people entering State through private vehicles, buses and railway stations. Issue directions for quarantining persons returning to State after attending Kumbh Mela. Appointment of nodal officers in COVID-19 designated hospitals to provide key information about availability of doctors, beds and medicines. Publicising info on micro-containment zones on government website and updating details regularly. Plans about arranging food on wheels to families totally affected by COVID-9. Bring down time taken for RT-PCR test results. Completion of setting up of RT-PCR test centres in 14 districts in next four weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/do-you-want-people-to-become-sitting-ducks/article34363549.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Vaccine doses arrive, but are far from enough||After a day’s delay, Telangana received 2.7 lakh doses of COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday night. However, sources said it is not sufficient to meet the demand. “We are getting vaccines on day to day basis. The 2.7 lakh doses do not match the requirement,” a source said. The immunisation programme was not held on Sunday due to unavailability of doses. Officials said the drive was resumed on Monday with whatever jabs were available. Many people complained that their second dose appointment was postponed yet again. After the Centre announced its decision to open up vaccination for everyone above 18 years of age from May 1, people are wondering if there were sufficient doses to inoculate such a large population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/vaccine-doses-arrive-but-are-far-from-enough/article34363526.ece

Abhishek Reddy of Telangana High Court on Monday declined to pass directions staying the ongoing elections to the municipal corporations of Warangal and Khammam and the municipalities of Achampet, Nakrekal, Siddipet, Jadcherla and Kothur. Congress leader Mohd. Shabbir Ali filed a petition seeking to stall the elections to be held on April 30 in the backdrop of the surge in COVID-19 positive cases in the State. After hearing the contentions of the petitioner’s counsel, the judge said no stay order can be granted in the matter. The judge however issued notices before admission to Telangana government, State Election Commission and others. He directed the SEC to consider the representation of Shabbir Ali on the matter and take a call on it. The writ petition was posted to May 7 for next hearing. By then, elections to all the seven Urban Local Bodies would be over. In another writ petition with near similar content, the judge dismissed an interim application seeking suspension of election to Warangal Municipal Corporation. The petition was filed by Warangal DCC president N. Rajender Reddy. With the refusal to pass stay order in both the pleas, the way is cleared for conducting polls to the seven ULBs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/high-court-declines-stay/article34363532.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Engineers body wants Discom to cancel transfers in deviation of rules||Telangana Electricity Engineers’ Association (TEEA) has alleged deviation of guidelines in the transfer of certain certain engineers and others effected recently in Southern Power Distribution Company of Telangana Ltd (TSSPDCL) as they were posted from one focal post to another. In a letter addressed to the Chairman and Managing Director of the Southern Discom (TSSPDCL), secretary general of the association A. Rameshwaraiah Shetty alleged that some transfers were selectively considered favouring a section, although several genuine requests for transfer on medical and other grounds were not considered. “Requesting the Chairman and Managing Director to cancel all such irregular transfers effected in deviation of guidelines as the orders deprive chances to some members working in the non-focal posts now. Such transfers demotivate the members and also promote lobbying. There is a need to follow transparent procedure without any discrimination as the recent transfers deny equal opportunities to those working continuously in non-focal posts”, the TEEA functionary said in the letter. Mr. Shetty said cancellation of the transfer orders issued in deviation of guidelines in the larger interests of the engineers community and to address the prevailing unrest among them with corrective action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/engineers-body-wants-discom-to-cancel-transfers-in-deviation-of-rules/article34363704.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Dont hold paddy at purchase centres’||Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation (TSCSC) chairman M. Srinivas Reddy has instructed the managers (functionaries) of paddy procurement centres not to allow stockpiling of paddy purchased and move it to rice mills on regular basis keeping in mind the chances of untimely rains during summer. He also asked the officials on Monday not to delay the payment for the paddy procured by crediting the amount to bank accounts of farmers concerned. For the purpose, the details of farmers who sell paddy have to be entered in the online procurement management system (OPMS), he said. Of the 6,700 procurement centres proposed for the yasangi (rabi) season, 1,377 centres were opened so far in 16 districts as the arrival of stocks was yet to gain momentum. A majority (744) of the centres were opened in Nizamabad, Suryapet, Nalgonda, Kamareddy and Khammam districts and a total of 1.65 lakh tonnes of paddy was purchased in the five districts so far. Mr. Reddy said the district administration concerned would open the procurement centres as and when required based on the arrival of the produce as the farmers were required to dry the paddy to reduce the moisture content to a maximum of 17% after harvesting the crop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dont-hold-paddy-at-purchase-centres/article34363547.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KTR dares Bandi Sanjay to get national project status to KLIP||Minister for Municipal Administration and IT K. Taraka Rama Rao has dared BJP State president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar to get national project status to the Kaleshwaram and Palamuru Rangareddy lift irrigation projects in the State. “What has the Karimnagar MP done for his parliamentary constituency during the last two years. Did he get any additional funds to his constituency?” he questioned and alleged that Mr. Sanjay Kumar was known only for indulging in cheap politics by abusing Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and playing the religious sentiment. Challenging the BJP leader and the Centre to compete with the TRS in the developmental works, he suggested that the BJP MP should get national highways, Navodaya schools and additional funds for the development of the constituency. He , along with Manakondur legislator Rasamayi Balakishan, participated in various developmental programmes at Illanthakunta mandal in Rajanna Sircilla district on Monday. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Rama Rao said that the BJP, which had accidentally won from Dubbak Assembly segment, had failed to win from the two MLC seats in the State. Predicting that the TRS would win with a thumping majority from Nagarjunasagar byelections, he said that the BJP candidate would lose his deposit. He also exuded confidence that the TRS would win a majority in the elections to all the seven ULBs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-dares-bandi-sanjay-to-get-national-project-status-to-klip/article34363552.ece
20 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP slams State govt. for ‘inaction’||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday slammed the TRS government for “not taking steps to deal with the current shortage of drugs like Remidesvir, oxygen supply to hospitals and shortage of beds to treat COVID-19 patients” in both government and private healthcare facilities. Party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar found fault with Health Minister Eatala Rajender blaming the Centre for the “shortages” and accused the government of “incompetence” in handling the production and distribution of the essential commodities necessary during the raging second wave of the pandemic. “Has the government conducted a single review meeting at the level of the Chief Minister to decide on how to handle the current emergency situation? There is no action against those selling drugs at high prices in the black market,” he charged. The government healthcare facilities are running short of personnel, infrastructure and funds to take care of the rising cases, said the BJP leader. Vaccine hesitancy among the population is also because the top leadership has not bothered to allay the fears of the people with effective communication. Senior leader K. Laxman also said priority should be on enhancing bed capacity and pressing more personnel into service. Meanwhile, Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy, who took the second dose of Covishield on Monday, urged citizens aged 45 years and above to take available vaccines against COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-slams-state-govt-for-inaction/article34363529.ece
20 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Death toll reaches 7 in Shamshabad road accident||With the death of another person, the toll in Sunday’s Shamshabad road accident rose to seven on Monday. The victim, Bhoodan (25), a brick kiln worker from Odisha, succumbed to injuries at a private hospital. Police said that the lorry driver suddenly swerved to the left to avoid hitting a car coming in the opposite direction. The car, which was at fault, was driven by Cyberabad police constable, Giri, allegedly under the influence of alcohol. Giri worked at Madhapur police station and was going towards Shamshabad. Giri along with home guard Sangameshwar and their friend Mallesh, went to Yadadri for darshan, and while returning, they consumed alcohol in a layout near Shamshabad, and were going back home when the accident took place around 5.40 p.m. Shamshabad DCP N Prakash Reddy said that soon after the accident, the trio fled from the spot, but were caught in the midnight. While Sangameshwar’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 150 mg/100ml, Mallesh’s was over 100 mg/100 ml. “By the time Giri was caught, his BAC level was negative, so his blood samples were collected and are sent to the forensic laboratory for examination,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/death-toll-reaches-7-in-road-accident/article34363537.ece

The employees unions are worried over the rising cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the State as also the temporary Secretariat premises.

Employees’ representatives claimed that four persons succumbed to the virus in the past three days and there are apprehensions that more would contract COVID-19 if physical attendance continues to be mandatory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/secretariat-staff-keen-to-work-from-home/article34363538.ece
20 April 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||More beds at District Hospital||The sudden spike in fresh cases of COVID-19 in Khammam district has prompted the district health authorities to upgrade the COVID-19 ward at the District Headquarters Hospital by adding 80 additional beds. The isolation ward now has a total 320 beds, including 240 oxygen-supported beds. As many as 119 COVID-19 patients are undergoing treatment at the isolation ward in the hospital. The old undivided Khammam district on Sunday recorded a major spike in COVID-19 cases with more than 500 fresh coronavirus infections, including 400 in Khammam and 125 in Bhadradri-Kothagudem being reported from both the districts, sources said. Two elderly women died due to suspected COVID-19 in Wyra town on Sunday and the pandemic reportedly claimed the lives of four persons in Khammam in a single day on Sunday. According to unconfirmed reports, Bhadradri-Kothagudem district witnessed the highest single day spike of 364 COVID-19 cases so far this year, on Monday. The authorities have ramped up efforts to strengthen the isolation wards and quarantine facilities to meet any exigency. A State-run quarantine facility was inaugurated by District Medical and Health Officer Malathi near the Polytechnic College in Raghunadhapalem mandal in Khammam district on Monday. The COVID-19 vaccination drive resumed on Monday after a one-day break on account of shortage of the vaccines. However, the second doses were administered at the three designated centres at the District Headquarters Hospital in Khammam. Meanwhile, Minority Welfare Department Secretary Ahmed Nadeem, General Observer for the Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) elections, on Monday reviewed the arrangements to ensure smooth conduct of the ensuing KMC election on April 30 in adherence to the COVID-19 safety norms.

20 April 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Second wave straining health infrastructure||The second wave of COVID-19 has been slowly, but surely, slipping out of hands. People are left to fend for themselves in some places, while at few places people are completely careless and paying scant attention to the impending danger. On the other hand, the work pressure on medical staff is increasing beyond limits. At Kangti and other areas of the district, several cases are reportedly being treated by registered medical practitioners (RMPs), the locally available and affordable healthcare responders in rural areas. “Many in my relatives’ families got positive and they were treated by an RMP. In two cases, he sent the patients to Hyderabad and Bidar. While one patient died at Hyderabad, the patient referred to Bidar survived,” said one Panduranga Rao from Narayankhed. The increasing costs at private hospitals ranging up to more than Rs. 5 lakh are forcing patients to depend on RMPs.  Awareness campaign This has come to the notice of the district administration and officials are trying to create awareness among public not to depend on RMPs. Recently, a person infected with coronavirus was admitted to a corporate hospital for treatment and the family members so far spent more than Rs. 13 lakh and he has not yet recovered. However, the government facilities are heavy in demand, for instance, the case of Indiranagar Urban Health Centre located in the district headquarters. With the limited staff they are both vaccinating people as well as conducting tests. Though they are attending to more patients than their targeted numbers, people are not patient enough to wait in the long queues as there is no shade or drinking water available. Heavy rush is being witnessed at every vaccination centre with vaccination resuming after a one-day break. People are also coming for coronavirus testing voluntarily and bringing their children as well.  Number of deaths As on Sunday, there were 232 cases in Sangareddy district and all of them are in home isolation and the total number of people in home isolation stands at 1,905. So far, 74 deaths were reported due to COVID-19 in the district and all of them died in the first wave of the pandemic. District Medical and Health Officer Gayatri Devi claimed that no deaths took place in the second wave so far. Though two deaths were reported due to coronavirus in the district, officials are not confirming them. In case of Medak district, it is reported that 14 deaths took place due to the virus. “In 95 % cases the patients need only basic treatment like drinking hot water and taking paracetamol and vitamin tablets. Patient has to get CT scan to check the level of lung infection, which is a costly affair for many in rural areas, for getting admitted in hospital. The facility is not available even at many government hospitals,” said a doctor on condition of anonymity. “The number of patients getting admitted has almost doubled. Those who are neglecting initial symptoms are at a huge risk. We have saved a 93-year-old patient who was admitted in time,” said Sridhar, doctor at Shree Balaji Medicover Hospitals, adding that once lungs are infected it will impact the health of other organs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/second-wave-straining-health-infrastructure/article34363554.ece

20 April 2021||GHAZIABAD,||Hindon crematorium struggles after e-furnace stops working||The Hindon cremation ground in Ghaziabad is struggling to handle the surge in bodies of suspected COVID-19 patients after the electric furnace, which has recently been operating around the clock, temporarily stopped functioning on Friday. Since then, the wait time for electric cremation has gone up to at least three hours. Some families were forced to carry out the last rites of their loved ones on footpaths. Discrepancy in figures Though the Ghaziabad district administration claimed there were only two COVID-related deaths in the city on Sunday, the employees at the crematorium said they had handled around 40 bodies daily for the past few days. Vikas, operator of the electric crematorium, said the furnace has been fixed but it takes two hours for one body to be processed, and there is only one shade available for another body in queue. “We have issued tokens and approximate time to remaining bodies because they cannot remain in the hot weather for long,” said Mr Vikas. The Ghaziabad district administration said it is planning to instal one more furnace to meet the demand. “We have ordered regular sanitisation at the crematorium area and temporary parking has been developed. We have deployed employees at the site to take care of the facilities. The electric crematorium has been repaired but it has its functioning capacity,” said a senior official with the district administration. To take the pressure off the furnace, the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation has constructed nine platforms at the crematorium site. But they are lying unused as they are not facing the “right direction”. “The platforms were constructed in a hurry without consultation with the priest at Hindon. The platforms are located in the wrong direction and under a Peepal tree, which is considered inauspicious for performing last rites,” said Sagar Kumar, a caretaker at the crematorium. “Around 12-18 bodies would come here daily, but there has been a sudden surge. From April 15-18, 180 bodies were cremated at Hindon. Due to scarcity of space, people have been forced to cremate bodies on footpaths,” said Mr. Kumar. Vineet Singh, who lives in Surya Nagar, said he visited the crematorium on Sunday to perform the last rites of his father-in-law who died of COVID-19. There was no facility for cremation as per COVID protocols. The body was cremated on an open platform as there was a wait time of over three hours. “The employees at Hindon said they have no option and they cannot hold the body as they have to send back the ambulance to transport another body. We had no option and the body was cremated in the open,” he said.

20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Migrant workers scramble to leave the Capital... again||Within hours of the six-day lockdown being announced by the Delhi government, migrant workers were seen leaving the Capital in hordes using whatever means of transport they could find at Anand Vihar ISBT. Many of them feared a possible extension of the curfew beyond April 26. Ashok Pal, a resident of Lakhimpur Kheri, said the ordeal he and his family faced during the 2020 lockdown is still fresh. He returned to Delhi only around four months ago to resume work. However, fearing a new lockdown, he is leaving the city with his family again. ‘Curfew may extend’ “First they [the Delhi government] announced a lockdown at night, then on the weekends and now for six days. By any logic, the duration of the lockdown will keep increasing. Last time, we didn’t even have food to eat; it was a dark time and I don’t want to put my family and myself through the same thing again,” complained Shalabh Kumar, a construction worker, from Prayagraj as he waited in a serpentine queue at a ticket booking counter at Anand Vihar ISBT. Migrant workers complained that government buses are overcrowded and private buses operators are overcharging. But there are many passengers who agreed to pay double the amount in order to get seats. Policemen deployed at the terminal instructed bus operators not to overcrowd buses as operators are charging double for the seat and half the amount if passengers travel on roof of the bus. Kiran Kushwaha, a resident of Allahabad, who was waiting with her two children for her husband at Anand Vihar bus stop, said, “My husband has gone to arrange bus tickets, we will leave the city today. If we don’t get tickets then we will look for some other option but will leave the city.” “Last time there was no milk and food for children but this time we won’t fall for ‘empty’ promise just to suffer,” said Ms. Kiran. Bhola Prasad from Patna said last year’s national lockdown to contain the pandemic had taught him not to trust governments. “No one helped people like us, who dig a well every day to be able to drink from it. We were left to beg for food,” he said. ‘Never trust govts.’ “But while that taught me to trust the goodness of a few strangers in the city, I do not trust any government — whether the Central government or the State government– whether Delhi or Bihar. They will make any kind of announcement leaving us to fend for ourselves and our families,” he complained, adding that he did not mind paying “almost double” the usual price of a bus ticket. The police deployed personnel for crowd and traffic management at Anand Vihar railway station and bus stop. A senior officer said that there is no ban on inter-State travel. They are asking people to maintain social distancing and wear mask while boarding train or buses.

20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Burying 15 bodies a day at Delhi Gate cemetery’||With the number of bodies increasing by the day, third-generation grave digger at Delhi Gate cemetery has written to committee members asking them to allow more space to bury COVID-19-infected bodies. Running out of space Mohammed Shamim, gravedigger at Jadid Qabristan Ahle Islam, said that he had written to the members around a week ago, stating that he is falling short on space. “I am burying at least 15 bodies a day for the last few days.

He said that he along with others have buried nearly 1,000 bodies since the beginning of the pandemic and are now falling short of space. “I am barely managing. It’s only been a year so I can’t dig the graves of others just yet,” he said. Reflecting on the gravity of the situation, he said that last year, they had received a maximum of 18 bodies and this time, so far, they have received 20 bodies on a single day. “And going by the numbers, it seems that it’s only going to increase. Hence, we need the space,” he said. Shamim has asked for 1.5 acres of additional space to ease the situation.

20 April 2021||New Delhi,||Police rescue ‘lonely’ elderly COVID patient||An octogenarian struggling with poor health and suspected of being infected with COVID-19 was taken to the hospital by the Delhi Police on Sunday. Living alone at his central Delhi house, 80-year-old Murlidhar Tahiliani, who served as an under secretary at Ministry of Home Affairs, suffered breathlessness on Sunday morning. His 23-year-old tenant saw him visibly facing respiratory problems and shivering, and called up Mr. Tahiliani’s friend and his daughter. “Uncle had been ill for the last 10 days. He had fever, and for the last five-six days was only taking water,” he said. Mr. Tahiliani had made the tenant read two pages pasted outside his house. One with important numbers and another which read: “My body may be given to Delhi Police for further necessary action and disposal. No chautha or uthala to be performed, except telephonically, just for courtesy sake”. Mr. Tahiliani’s daughter Gitika called the police after which Constable Raju Ram and two of his colleagues reached the house to rescue the elderly man. “He was reluctant to come down. I told him that we are only taking him for medication and then will bring him back,” the officer said. They took Mr. Tahiliani to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. ‘He is stable now’ Constable Raju said they were able to secure a bed after a lot of difficulty. Mr. Tahiliani is stable now, the officer said. Two-three days ago, Mr. Raju also provided assistance to a woman living alone and infected with the virus. A few media reports said the elderly man was allegedly abandoned by his family due to the fear of contracting COVID-19. Ms. Gitika told The Hindu she was furious about how the incident was being played out on social media. “I made over 150 calls to several authorities for help,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/police-rescue-lonely-elderly-covid-patient/article34363259.ece
20 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Congress, Left parties seek relief for workers||The Left parties wrote to Chief Minster Arvind Kejriwal on Monday asking him to consider restarting last year’s schemes of direct cash transfers, distribution of 35 kg free foodgrains and community kitchens/food distribution to needy households as well as migrant workers. The parties the measures would prevent the mass exodus of migrant workers that was witnessed in Delhi last year after the nationwide lockdown was announced. The parties also assured that they would cooperate with the State government in fighting the pandemic. ‘Ineffective tactics’ The Delhi Congress, meanwhile, pointed out that Mr. Kejriwal was appealing to migrant workers not to leave the Capital during the week-long lockdown, without announcing any monetary relief package for them. The party questioned as to how Mr. Kejriwal expected them to stay in Delhi without jobs. “Migrant workers cannot afford treatment without income. Delhi hospitals are bursting at their seams with COVID-19 patients. They have nowhere to go if they fall ill,” the party said. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said the Delhi government’s “ineffective tactics” to fight the pandemic were exposed as labourers have started to leave the city once again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/congress-left-parties-seek-relief-for-workers/article34363266.ece

20 April 2021||Mumbai,||People urged to take six-minute walk test to check health status||As Maharashtra battles with the pandemic amid a shortage of oxygen at many places, the State Health Department has advised citizens to check the functioning of lungs by taking a six-minute walk test. District administrations have been directed to create awareness of the test which can be conducted inside house and by those with symptoms of COVID-19. As per the directions, an individual with novel coronavirus symptoms will have to check their oxygen level by using an oxymeter before taking the test. Then the individual will have to walk for six straight minutes, without a pause, on an even surface with the oxymeter on the finger. After six minutes, if the oxygen level does not go down the individual will be considered healthy. “There is no need to worry even if the oxygen level dips by 1% or 2%. In this case, this exercise should be carried out twice a day to keep a vigil,” an official said. He added that if the oxygen level drops below 93 or by 3% or the individual suffers from breathlessness then the person is advised to get admitted to hospital. The test is not advised for those suffering from asthma. Also, the citizens above 60 years can run this test by walking for three minutes instead of six. Dr. Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, Health Department, in a meeting with district administrations suggested that awareness be created of the test. “It will help detect oxygen deficiency in individuals and may help admit them in hospitals at the right time,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/people-urged-to-take-six-minute-walk-test-to-check-health-status/article34363186.ece
20 April 2021||Mumbai,||‘CM may decide on strict lockdown in next 2 days’||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to decide on a strict lockdown in the next two days as the present restrictions are not yielding the desired results to curb COVID-19, State minister Vijay Wadettiwar said on Monday. Speaking to reporters, the Relief and Rehabilitation Minister also said the State government will study the lockdown imposed by the Delhi government before taking any decision. “The ongoing curfew is not helping (in containing the spread of COVID-19) in the way it was expected. A decision is expected in connection with a strict lockdown in a day or two. The Chief Minister will take a call after consulting others,” he said. Mr. Wadettiwar claimed that traders and shopkeepers had earlier opposed the imposition of a lockdown, but now they are in favour of such a measure. The minister said his department is studying the Delhi lockdown. “We will take information on how trains and essential services are allowed there (in Delhi) before arriving at any decision,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cm-may-decide-on-strict-lockdown-in-next-2-days/article34363185.ece

20 April 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Train with seven tankers leaves for Visakhapatnam to get oxygen||For the first time, the Central Railway (CR) has started an oxygen express for getting liquid medical oxygen meant for the treatment of COVID-19 patients across Maharashtra. A roll-on-rail-off (RoRo) train carrying seven empty tanker trucks on board left Kalamboli goods yard around 8 p.m. on Monday for Visakhapatnam after Transport Minister Anil Parab flagged it off. Mr. Parab said the tankers were expected to return in four days with 100 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen. “We have a proper plan to distribute it across the State. Wherever the need is more, it will be supplied on priority. Carrying the oxygen on road is fraught with risks. So for the first time, we are trying to transport it via rail by preparing a green corridor. Depending on its success, we will increase the number of tankers next time,” the minister said. Since Monday morning, Panvel Regional Transport Officer Gajanan Thombare and CR officials had been running checks to ensure the tankers had all the required technicalities. “Around 10 tankers were meant to be sent but due to the height issue, three were rejected. The height has to be around 3.30 metre and to match this criterion, air from tyres was released. Since there is no weight limitation, we managed to procure the tankers with weight of 15 tonnes each,” Mr. Thombare said. CR officials said a team from the Mumbai Division had built a ramp within 24 hours at Kalamboli goods yard to facilitate loading and unloading of tanker trucks from flat wagons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/train-with-seven-tankers-leaves-for-visakhapatnam-to-get-oxygen/article34363188.ece
20 April 2021||New Delhi,||Only 58 ICU beds left, hospitals turning away COVID patients||When 24-year-old Asma placed her hand on her father’s forehead around 7 p.m. on Monday, he asked her if they got a bed at a city hospital. Her father, who tested positive for COVID-19, is kept temporarily at the emergency ward of the hospital. “Yes, we are going,” Ms. Asha muttered but she is yet to find a bed for him, even after 10 hours of searching. COVID-19 positive and suspected patients were being turned away from even bigger hospitals in the city on Monday as beds were full in many, including LNJP Hospital — the largest Delhi government-run hospital. Only 58 ICU beds were vacant in the city as of 9.30 p.m. on Monday and even many of them were not available when calls were made to the hospitals. Also, just 16.9% of the total 19,461 hospital beds were vacant at the same time. In the city, 79 COVID-19 hospitals did not have a single bed by Monday night, government data showed. Many smaller hospitals were also full and they were getting dozens of calls daily for admission. Asma with brother Asad, 21, and sister Ela, 26, had left their house in Indirapuram at 10 a.m. on Monday to look for a bed when their father developed breathlessness. “First, we went to Shanti Gopal Hospital where they gave him oxygen and asked us to go to a bigger hospital. Then we went to Yashoda Hospital and Max Hospital, but both denied us admission saying that there were no beds,” Ms. Asad said. At 2 p.m., they reached Fortis Hospital in Okhla where doctors said COVID beds were full but took him into the emergency temporarily. “The hospital kept asking us to take the patient to a COVID hospital with a ventilator, but we couldn’t find any despite searching for hours,” she said. At the emergency, their father breathed with the help of a BiPAP machine. Till 9 p.m., they had not found any ICU bed in the city. At Holy Family Hospital, Mini, was trying to get her father admitted but was turned away. “We came here in the morning and they took him into the emergency, but they did not give us a bed. I have tried every hospital I could but there is no bed anywhere. I’m going back home for time being,” she said. Her father breathed with the help of an oxygen cylinder inside the ambulance. “There are no beds available. We don’t even have space to walk inside the ICU,” a doctor said. At Safdarjung Hospital also, all 219 hospital beds were occupied, as per a government website. Outside the COVID-19 block, family members of a pregnant woman, who is COVID-19 positive, complained that she was not getting water and food properly on many days. At Metro Hospital, a smaller hospital with 30 COVID-19 beds also all beds were occupied.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/only-58-icu-beds-left-hospitals-turning-away-covid-patients/article34363177.ece
20 April 2021||New Delhi,||Crowds seen at markets, liquor stores in panic buying spree||The liquor stores in the city saw huge crowds on Monday after the announcement of a six-day lockdown. At some stores, the customers formed queues, but at most others, there were no social distancing norms in place. At the markets too, a larger than normal rush was seen, as customers made a last-minute dash to stock up before the lockdown enforcement. Even though shops selling essential supplies and medicines will be allowed to remain open, people queued up saying that commuting would be a problem during the week and that they prefer to buy in advance. At Khanna Market, there was a frenzy of shoppers in the evening. “Once the lockdown starts, it gets very difficult to move around as you are always being questioned. It is easier to buy things all at once. Based on last year’s experience, we know that things run out of stock soon,” said Shiven Nagar. Vinod Giri, Director General, Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) claimed that the crowd at stores and markets was a panic reaction from the public, driven by their memory of lockdown extensions last year. He suggested steps to reassure the public by allowing home delivery of liquor as was introduced in Maharashtra and urged the Delhi government to think of such steps. The restaurant industry that has supported the curbs by the government to curtail their in-house dining service due to rising number of cases said that the new curfew regulations don’t change anything as far as the restaurant industry is concerned. “As partners with the Delhi government in this fight against the pandemic, we once again request them to kindly smoothen and expedite the process to issue e-passes for our teams. We are sure that clear directions to the law enforcing agencies will ensure that our workers, who are also frontline warriors, are not subjected to any undue harassment by the law enforcing authorities,” said the National Restaurants Association of India. The association said home delivery, which is just a minuscule part of the overall business is currently the only avenue available and therefore, very critical.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/crowds-seen-at-markets-liquor-stores-in-panic-buying-spree/article34363180.ece
20 April 2021||new delhi,||Samaritans lend a helping hand amid unprecedented infections||Amid an unprecedented surge in COVID-19 cases, some samaritans across the Delhi-NCR region have either formed communities or taken it upon themselves to help out those in need for food, medicine, or simply transport. On April 17, Noida-based social activist Kiran Verma took to his Twitter handle and Facebook page to tell everyone that he owned “a humble car in good condition and completely sanitised”. However, that modest declaration of ownership wasn't the crux of his social media post. “If any person, (willing to #DonateBlood or plasma) is finding it difficult to travel around NCR for blood donation. OR don’t have access to good food, I promise to drop you safe (with a smiling face) at a blood bank or provide food at your doorstep [sic.],” said the founder of blood donation initiative ‘Simply Blood. In the last two days, Mr. Verma said he has delivered food to eight families and medicines to another six. “On Sunday, I also took a person from Faridabad to Shalimar Bagh who wanted to donate plasma.” Mr. Verma is not the only one who is helping out people in need. A group of young men formed ‘Tav Prasad Sewa Society’, a Delhi-based non profit, in July last year with the common aim of helping out those in need. The team of seven has been offering free oxygen cylinders, oximeters and thermometers at seven centres across Delhi. “We have bought oxygen cylinders for this purpose only. Earlier we thought of charging some security money from people who are completely strangers but seeing the condition and demand, we provide oxygen whenever and wherever we can,” said Raman Jit Singh of Tav Prasad Sewa Society. The group has also been responding to the unrelenting demand for plasma donors by making a list of people who have been treated for COVID-19 a month earlier and are willing to donate plasma. “So far we have helped 350 people who needed plasma for their treatment,” Mr. Singh said. Home-cooked food Another struggle which home quarantined COVID-19 patients have to overcome is that of food. To overcome that, a group of over 150 home chefs have come together with design professional Anupriya Singh to provide people with delectable home-cooked food at bare minimum charges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/samaritans-lend-a-helping-hand-amid-unprecedented-infections/article34363174.ece
20 April 2021||New Delhi,||Will utilise lockdown to arrange oxygen: CM||The COVID-19 situation in the Capital was “very critical” with the daily load of thousands of cases having stretched the health system and put it under “great stress”, said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday. Following a meeting with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to review circumstances revolving around the pandemic, Mr. Kejriwal announced a six-day lockdown – between 10 p.m. on Monday and 5 a.m. on April 26. “In the six days that we are taking from you, we would arrange for a large number of beds in Delhi. The Central government is helping us too, for this, we are very thankful. We will also utilise this lockdown to arrange for oxygen and medicines. We would fight this together and surely win,” he also said. CM’s appeal to migrants He also issued an appeal to migrant workers to choose against travelling home, seeking to assure them that they would be taken care of despite the curbs on daily activities. “In the last 24 hours, approximately 23,500 new cases have come up. Prior to that, around 25,500 cases came to light. The number of beds in the Delhi hospitals is falling short. There is a shortage of oxygen as well. We are falling short of medicines, especially Remdesivir,” he said. “I had a meeting with the L-G and we felt that Delhi’s healthcare system would not be able to take in more patients on such a large scale. If we do not impose a lockdown now, we might face a tragedy. We do not want Delhi to face such a situation where patients are lying on the corridors or losing their life on the streets, at any cost. After reviewing the entire situation, your government feels that it is pertinent to impose a lockdown in Delhi for a few days,” he also said. According to the government, essential service providers such as doctors, police personnel, the media and students going for exams will be allowed on the production of ID cards or admit cards. So will pregnant women, ill patients and those heading to COVID vaccination centres. An e-pass will be required for movement by grocery shop employees, food and e-commerce delivery personnel. Religious places will be allowed to open but not allowed to have visitors. Those heading to weddings, where gatherings will be capped at 50 people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/will-utilise-lockdown-to-arrange-oxygen-cm/article34363183.ece
20 April 2021||New Delhi,||BJP seeks White Paper on COVID situation from govt.||The BJP Opposition on Monday demanded that the Delhi government come out with a White Paper on the COVID situation in the Capital and enumerate what steps it took in the last one year to deal with the crisis arising out of the spread of the virus in the city. Accusing the AAP of “still indulging in petty politics” and finger-pointing when the situation in Delhi was so bad, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said instead of putting their complete focus on Delhi, AAP leaders were accusing the BJP of wrongdoing baselessly and shamefully. “This is the reason that COVID has spread so widely in Delhi. There is little or no concern for Delhiites or to deal with the crisis but instead it is about escaping responsibility and pointing towards the BJP for all the wrongs this State government has committed,” Mr. Bidhuri alleged. “We want to know from the Kejriwal government how many ventilator beds were increased in Delhi in the last one year? How many new ICU beds were added?” he asked. Last year too, he also said, it was the Central government and the private hospitals which had helped the Delhi government come out of the COVID crisis. The Centre Central Government had, this time also, the LOP said, extended a “big helping hand” to the Delhi government with the DRDO under the Defense Ministry having started a 250-bed hospital which had started functioning and the Railways had made a provision for 1,200 beds in 75 rail coaches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-seeks-white-paper-on-covid-situation-from-govt/article34363175.ece
20 April 2021||New Delhi,||File affidavits on availability of beds in city hospitals: HC||Observing that “the healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”, the Delhi High Court on Monday ordered the Centre and city government to give details on number of beds with or without ventilators and oxygen support. A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli directed the Centre and Delhi government to file affidavits by Tuesday disclosing hospital-wise availability of beds for COVID-19 patients here. ‘Continue O2 supply’  The court also directed the firm Inox, which used to supply oxygen to Delhi hospitals, to honour its contract and continue the supply immediately. The High Court’s direction came after it was told that the firm had stopped oxygen supply to Delhi. The court observed that both the Centre and Delhi government “failed miserably” on the migrant crisis in last year’s lockdown and lessons are required to be learnt from it. The Bench said it has been seeing reports about migrant labourers going back. With imposition of curfew, these daily wagers are again faced with a grim reality, the Bench added. It directed the Delhi government to utilise funds from the Building and other Construction Workers Act to provide food to daily wagers at their work sites and to utilise the service of contractors who used to prepare mid-day meals in schools. The court remarked that the migrant workers were left on their own or to good Samaritans. In view of the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the court revived a disposed of public interest litigation (PIL) related to COVID-19 testing and infrastructure. The court remarked that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and the pandemic is raging with much greater intensity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/file-affidavits-on-availability-of-beds-in-city-hospitals-hc/article34363169.ece

While the total case tally has now reached 38,98,262, the cumulative recoveries stand at 31,59,240 with 2.21 lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours. “Of a total 2,40,75,811 laboratory samples tested thus far, 38,98,262 (with the average case positivity rising to 16.19%) have returned positive with over 2.21 lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said, adding that the State’s case fatality rate had incrementally declined to 1.56%. Pune district reported more than 9,500 new cases to take its total case tally to 7,35,378. As per the State Health Department figures, six deaths were reported as the death toll went up to 8,824. According to district authorities, the active case tally crossed 1.03 lakh while the fatality count has surpassed 11,500. Mumbai recorded 7,381 fresh cases, taking its total tally to 5,86,867 of whom 85,321 are active. As many as 58 fatalities took the city’s death toll to 12,412. Nagpur district in Vidarbha registered more than 6,700 cases as its total cases touched 3,38,620 of whom 76,961 are active. Eleven deaths pushed the toll to 4,510. Satara in western Maharashtra witnessed another heightened spike of 1,175 cases and 12 deaths as its total case tally rose to 82,833 of whom 13,398 are active while the death toll climbed to 2,024. Osmanabad in Marathwada added 605 new cases to take its total tally to 30,922 of whom 5,260 are active. As many as 19 deaths took the fatality toll to 722. Nanded district logged 21 deaths and more than 1,300 cases as its death toll reached 1,231 while its total case tally went up to 70,551 of whom 13,497 are active. Ahmednagar reported a sharp fatality surge of 39 deaths and more than 3,000 cases as its death toll rose to 1,555 and the total tally climbed to 1,36,913 of whom 19,983 are active. Nashik in north Maharashtra recorded more than 3,800 fresh cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-reports-58924-new-cases-52412-recoveries/article34363190.ece
20 April 2021||Moscow,||Navalny sent to prison hospital in Russia||Russia’s penitentiary service on Monday said it was transferring ailing Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to prison hospital, as the EU warned it would hold Moscow “responsible” for the state of his health. The U.S. on Sunday threatened Russia with “consequences” if President Vladimir Putin’s major domestic opponent — who launched a hunger strike three weeks ago — dies in jail, with Mr. Navalny’s private doctors warning at the weekend he could pass away at “any minute”. Russia’s prison authorities, which have barred Mr. Navalny’s own medical team from visiting him, said its doctors had decided to move him to a medical facility on the premises of another penal colony outside Moscow. But the authorities insisted the anti-corruption campaigner’s condition was “satisfactory”, and said he was taking vitamin supplements as part of medical treatment. Fears over Mr. Navalny’s fate have added more fuel to soaring tensions between Moscow and the West over a build-up of Russian troops along the border with Ukraine and a spiralling diplomatic row with EU member state the Czech Republic. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc held the Russian authorities “responsible for the health situation of Navalny” as Foreign Ministers from its 27 nations held virtual talks. Mr. Borrell called Mr. Navalny’s condition “very worrisome” and repeated demands that Moscow allows his chosen team of doctors to inspect him. Lithuania’s Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis pushed further, saying the bloc should prepare “a humanitarian mission” to fly him out of Russia for treatment. Kremlin dismiss outcry “If the international community does not respond, the regime’s opposition leader will be sent silently to his death,” Mr. Landsbergis said. The Kremlin dismissed the outcry from foreign leaders over Mr. Navalny’s condition. “The health of convicts in the Russia Federation cannot and should not be a topic concerning them,” said Mr. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Mr. Navalny, 44, was arrested in Russia in January after returning from treatment in Germany for a near-fatal nerve agent poisoning he says was carried out by Moscow — accusations denied by Mr. Putin’s administration. Sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for embezzlement, he began a hunger strike on March 31 demanding medical treatment for back pain and numbness to his hands and legs. The EU in October sanctioned six Russian officials over the Novichok nerve agent attack on Mr. Navalny, and in February sanctioned another four individuals over his arrest and sentencing.  Mr. Navalny’s supporters have called for a major protest across Russia on Wednesday to demand his release, hours after a state-of-the-nation address by Mr. Putin. Police warned people not to demonstrate, saying officers would take “all necessary measures to maintain law and order”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/navalny-sent-to-prison-hospital-in-russia/article34362865.ece
20 April 2021||Lahore,||Radical Pakistan party frees 11 police hostages||Eleven Pakistani police officers seized by supporters of a radical Islamist group as part of their campaign to get the French Ambassador expelled have been released, officials said on Monday. The officers were taken as hostages on Sunday by supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) during violent protests in Lahore. Video circulating on social media — and confirmed unofficially by police as genuine — showed some of them bloodied and bruised, with bandages around their heads. Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the police had been released early on Monday after “negotiations” with the TLP, which the government banned last week after effectively labelling it a terrorist organisation. The officers had been held at a TLP mosque stronghold in Lahore, which is now packed with supporters and surrounded by police. “Negotiations have been started with TLP; the first round completed successfully,” said Mr. Ahmed in a video on Twitter. “They have released 11 policemen who were made hostages.” He said a second round of negotiations would take place later on Monday, although it is not clear what they will discuss. Previously the TLP had set an April 20 deadline for the expulsion of the French Ambassador. The group has been behind an anti-France campaign for months since President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of Charlie Hebdo magazine to republish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammed — an act deemed blasphemous by many Muslims. Protests paralyse cities Last week the Embassy in Pakistan advised its nationals to leave the country — a call that appears to have gone largely unheeded. “The TLP people have gone inside the Mosque and the police have also stepped back,” said Mr. Ahmed. “Hopefully, the rest of the issues will be settled in the second round.” Rioting has rocked the country for the past week since the leader of the TLP was detained in Lahore after calling for a march on the capital. The protests have paralysed cities and led to the deaths of six policemen. TLP leaders say several of the party’s supporters were killed in Sunday’s clashes. “We won’t bury them until the French ambassador is kicked out,” Allama Muhammad Shafiq Amini, a TLP leader in the city, said. Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government has struggled to bring TLP to heel over the years, but this week announced an outright ban against the group — effectively labelling it a terrorist outfit. Still, on Saturday he suggested the party hadn’t been banned for its ideology, but rather its methods. “Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our govt. only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers,” he tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/radical-pakistan-party-frees-11-police-hostages/article34362875.ece
20 April 2021||Washington,||NASA Mars helicopter makes first flight on another planet||NASA successfully flew its tiny helicopter Ingenuity on Mars early on Monday, the first powered flight on another planet and a feat a top engineer called “our Wright brothers’ moment.” At 3:34 a.m. Eastern Time (0734 GMT), the 1.8 kg rotorcraft lifted off, hovered 10 feet above the Martian surface, then came back to rest after 39.1 seconds. Data and images from the autonomous flight were transmitted 278 million km back to Earth where they were received by NASA’s array of ground antennas and processed more than three hours later. Engineers were tensely watching their screens at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where the mission had been designed and planned for the past six years. They broke into applause as one of them read off a checklist of tasks Ingenuity had achieved and concluded: “Ingenuity has performed its first flight — the first flight of a powered aircraft on another planet.” Ingenuity quickly sent back a black-and-white image from its downward pointing navigation camera, showing its bug-like shadow cast on the surface. Then came a choppy colour video from the Perseverance rover showing Ingenuity on the ground, in flight. “We’ve been talking so long about our Wright brothers’ moment on Mars, and here it is,” said lead engineer MiMi Aung. The first powered flight on Earth was achieved by the Wright brothers in 1903 in North Carolina. A piece of fabric from that plane has been tucked inside Ingenuity in honour of that feat. NASA had originally planned the flight for April 11 but postponed it over a software issue that was identified during a planned high-speed test of the aircraft’s rotors. The issue was resolved with a software update and tweak in coding. Tech demonstration Ingenuity travelled to Mars attached to the underside of Perseverance, which touched down on the planet on February 18 on a mission to search for signs of extraterrestrial life. Ingenuity’s goal, by contrast, is to demonstrate its technology works, and it won’t contribute to Perseverance’s science goals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/nasa-mars-helicopter-makes-first-flight-on-another-planet/article34362881.ece
20 April 2021||Berlin,||Iran nuclear talks enter ‘drafting stage’||High-level talks in Vienna aimed at bringing the U.S. back into the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran are moving ahead with experts working on drafting proposals this week, but a solution remains “far away,” Russia’s delegate said on Monday. The U.S. unilaterally left the agreement, which promises Iran economic incentives in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, in 2018 under then President Donald Trump, who said it needed to be renegotiated and imposed crippling sanctions. In response, Iran has steadily been violating the restrictions set by the deal, by enriching uranium far past the purity allowed and stockpiling vastly larger quantities, in a thus-far unsuccessful effort to force the other countries involved to provide economic relief that would offset the American sanctions. U.S. President Joe Biden wants to return Washington to the deal, and Iran has been negotiating with the five remaining powers — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — for the past two weeks on how that might take place. Diplomats from the world powers have been shuttling between the Iranian delegation and an American one, which is also in Vienna but not talking directly with the Iranian side. Two expert groups have been brainstorming solutions to the two major issues: The rollback of American sanctions on one hand, and Iran’s return to compliance on the other. Now, said Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov, “we can note with satisfaction that the negotiations (are) entering the drafting stage.” “Practical solutions are still far away, but we have moved from general words to agreeing on specific steps towards the goal,” he wrote on Twitter.  “Overall, we may be, and hopefully are on a path of rapprochement,” German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told reporters in Berlin. “But there are still many, many open questions,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-nuclear-talks-enter-drafting-stage/article34362870.ece
20 April 2021||Havana,||Cuba gets new leader as Raul Castro retires||Cuba marked the end of an era on Monday with the transfer of power from the Castro clan, in charge for six decades, to the communist country’s first-ever civilian leader, Miguel Diaz-Canel. As Raul Castro, 89, enters retirement, he handed the all-powerful position of first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba to Mr. Diaz-Canel, 60, already Cuba’s president since 2018. “April 19, an historic day,” tweeted the new leader, lauding the PCC’s “founding and guiding” generation for handing over the reins. Mr. Diaz-Canel’s election at a party congress, though pre-determined, marks a watershed for the country of 11.2 million people, many of whom have known no leader other than a Castro. Fidel Castro, still revered as the country’s father and saviour, led the country from 1959 to 2006, when he fell ill and his brother Raul took over. Fidel Castro died in 2016. Mr. Diaz-Canel and some other members of the new PCC executive were born after the revolution led by the Castro siblings in the 1950s, leading in 1959 to the overthrow of dictator Fulgencio Batista. The PCC congress was held 60 years after Fidel Castro declared Cuba a socialist state, setting up decades of conflict with the United States, which has had sanctions against the country since 1962. It also marked six decades since the failed Bay of Pigs invasion by anti-revolutionary Cuban exiles, backed by the CIA. ‘Irrevocable’ socialism The change at the top is not expected to yield any major policy shifts. Mr. Diaz-Canel, a suit-and-tie wearing, tech-savvy Beatles fan, remains a staunch party disciple. And a new Constitution passed in May 2019 made it clear that the country’s commitment to socialism was “irrevocable.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/cuba-gets-new-leader-as-last-castro-retires/article34362868.ece
20 April 2021||Berlin,||Greens name Baerbock as candidate to succeed Merkel||Germany’s Green party on Monday named its co-chair Annalena Baerbock as their candidate to succeed Angela Merkel, throwing down the gauntlet to the Chancellor’s conservatives who were locked in increasingly vicious infighting for her crown. “Both of us want the job, but in the end, only one can do it. So today is the moment to say that the Greens’ first Chancellor candidate will be Annalena Baerbock,” said the party’s joint co-chairman Robert Habeck. Ms. Baerbock, 40, is the first Chancellor candidate ever nominated by the Greens. Yet with the party polling in second place behind Ms. Merkel’s divided conservatives, the Greens now have a chance of becoming the biggest party and taking the chancellery. “Today, we begin a new chapter for our party and — if we do well — for our country,” she said. “I am standing for renewal, others will stand for the status quo,” she said, adding that “climate change is the biggest task of my generation”. A former trampolining ace who studied international law at the London School of Economics, she has never held a government role. As a teenager, she took part in trampoline competitions, winning many medals. The sport taught her to “be brave”, she has said. But the mother of two and trained lawyer has surged in popularity, using the media spotlight on the pandemic to criticise the government for not prioritising children during the crisis, while laying out her own proposals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/greens-name-baerbock-as-candidate-to-succeed-merkel/article34362872.ece
20 April 2021||Washington,||Biden pressed on emissions goal||When President Joe Biden convenes a virtual climate summit on Thursday, he faces a vexing task: how to put forward a nonbinding but symbolic goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that will have a tangible impact on climate change efforts not only in the U.S. but throughout the world. The emissions target, eagerly awaited by all sides of the climate debate, will signal how aggressively Mr. Biden wants to move on climate change. The target Mr. Biden chooses “is setting the tone for the level of ambition and the pace of emission reductions over the next decade,″ said Kate Larsen, a former White House adviser. Scientists, environmental groups and even business leaders are calling on Mr. Biden to set a target that would cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030. The 50% target would nearly double the nation’s previous commitment and require dramatic changes in the power and transportation sectors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-pressed-on-emissions-goal/article34362866.ece
20 April 2021||Paris,||France ‘enabled’ 1994 Rwanda genocide: report||The French government bears “significant” responsibility for “enabling a foreseeable genocide,” a report commissioned by the Rwandan government concludes about France’s role before and during the horror in which an estimated 8,00,000 people were slaughtered in 1994. The report comes amid efforts by Rwanda to document the role of French authorities before, during, and after the genocide, part of the steps taken by France’s President Emmanuel Macron to improve relations with the central African country. The 600-page report says that France “did nothing to stop” the massacres, in April and May 1994, and in the years after the genocide tried to cover up its role and even offered protection to some perpetrators. It concludes that in years leading up to the genocide, former French President Francois Mitterrand and his administration had knowledge of preparations for the massacres — yet kept supporting the government of then-Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana despite the “warning signs.” “The French government was neither blind nor unconscious about the foreseeable genocide,” it stressed. The report comes after a French report, commissioned by Mr. Macron, concluded that French authorities had been “blind” to the preparations for genocide and then reacted too slowly to appreciate the extent of the killings and to respond to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/france-enabled-1994-rwanda-genocide-report/article34362876.ece
20 April 2021||KASHGAR,||Probe China over Xinjiang crimes: HRW||A human rights group appealed to the United Nations on Monday to investigate allegations China’s government is committing crimes against humanity in the Xinjiang region. Human Rights Watch cited reports of the mass detention of Muslims, a crackdown on religious practices and other measures against minorities in the northwestern region. It said they amount to crimes against humanity as defined by the treaty that established the International Criminal Court. China is not a member of the court and could use its veto power as a permanent UN Security Council member to block action against Chinese officials, Human Rights Watch said in a report. However, the group said the UN Human Rights Commission should create a body to investigate the charges, identify those responsible and provide a road map to hold them accountable. More than 1 million people have been confined to camps in Xinjiang, according to foreign governments and researchers. Authorities there are accused of imposing forced labor and birth controls. The Chinese government rejects complaints of abuses, saying the camps are for job training to support economic development and combat radicalism. The government is pressing foreign clothing and shoe brands to reverse decisions to stop using cotton from Xinjiang due to reports of possible forced labour there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/probe-china-over-xinjiang-crimes-hrw/article34362873.ece
20 April 2021||Strasbourg,||Saudi activist wins top Europe rights award||Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul was awarded a top European rights prize on Monday in recognition of her fight for women’s rights in the kingdom, including her efforts to end a ban on women driving. The Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize, named after the former Czech dissident and later President, is awarded annually for civil society action in defence of human rights by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). Ms. Hathloul “is one of the leaders of the Saudi feminist movement, having campaigned to end the male guardianship system, as well as the Saudi ban on women driving, and for greater protection for women facing abuse in the Kingdom,” PACE said in a statement. Ms. Hathloul, 31, was detained in May 2018 with about a dozen other female activists — just weeks before the ban on women driving was lifted. Last December, a court handed Ms. Hathloul a prison term of five years and eight months on charges of terrorism-related crimes, but a partially suspended sentence — and time already served — led to her early release in February. She remains on probation and is barred from leaving Saudi Arabia for five years. In March, she lost a court appeal against the sentence and the restrictions imposed against her, including the travel ban. “International support is the only way we can expose the injustices in my country and protect the victims,” her sister Lina said as she accepted the prize and its €60,000 at a virtual ceremony. “For years now, the Saudi regime has been trying to tarnish her image, to erase any support for her, and to make her forgotten. But the more time passes, the more Loujain proves to the world how incredibly brave, resilient and attached to her values she is,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/saudi-activist-wins-top-europe-rights-award/article34362878.ece
20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Protecting children in the age of AI||We are now living among history’s very first “AI” generation. From the Alexas they converse with, to their robot playmates, to the YouTube wormholes they disappear into, the children and adolescents of today are born into a world increasingly powered by virtual reality and artificial intelligence (AI). AI is not only changing what humans can do, it is shaping our behaviours, our preferences, our perceptions of the world and of ourselves. Older people still remember life before AI and the digital world — our references, anchors and pole stars pre-date the fourth Industrial Revolution. Not so for the millions of children and adolescents who were born into it. What does this mean for them, and for us — their parents and guardians? The task ahead  Doubleimperatives — this would mean getting all children on-line and creating child-safe digital spaces One of the most pressing concerns is that not everyone can tap into the opportunities offered by this transformation. According to UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), as many as two-thirds of the world’s children do not have access to the Internet at home. In addition to closing the digital divide, we need to better protect children and adolescents online; but how does one childproof AI? How do we encourage and support the tremendous good AI can do for children’s growth and development, while simultaneously mitigating the harm? And how do we equip children and young people with the knowledge, tools and awareness to protect themselves? In the old-fashioned physical world, we evolved norms and standards to protect children. For instance, there are policies and protocols for a child travelling alone as an unaccompanied minor. Parents are understandably reluctant to let their children be photographed by the media, and in many countries, news outlets blur children’s faces to protect them. Where are these protections online? The virtual world is full of unsupervised “vacations” and “playgrounds” — with other children and, potentially, less-than-scrupulous adults, sometimes posing anonymously as children. While video gaming and chat forums like Fortnite: Battle Royale, to name one popular example, offer an online space for children to socialise with their friends, multiple reports identify such virtual playgrounds as “honeypots” for child predators. Short of banning screen time entirely, parents are hard-pressed to keep tabs on just what their children are doing online, and with whom. With online homework, this has become even more difficult. Right to freedom of attention It does not help that the AI systems driving many video games and social networks are designed to keep children hooked, both through algorithms and gimmicks like “streaks”, “likes”, infinite scroll, etc. Even if this is an ancillary consequence of the underlying business model, the damage is done — children, from a tender age through adolescence, are becoming digitally addicted. Similarly, right when children and youth are forming their initial views of the world, they are being sucked into virtual deep space, including the universe of fake news, conspiracy theories, hype, hubris, online bullying, hate speech and the likes. With every click and scroll, AI is sorting them into tribes, and feeding them a steady diet of specially customised tribal cuisine. All this is thrown at our children just when they are starting to try to make sense of who they are and the world they live in; right when it is so important to help them understand and appreciate different perspectives, preferences, beliefs and customs, to build bridges of understanding and empathy and goodwill. Harvesting, algorithmic bias Other insidious pitfalls also lie in the path of the Generation AI child. Today, many AI toys come pre-programmed with their own personality and voice. They can offer playful and creative opportunities for children, with some even promoting enhanced literacy, social skills and language development. However, they also listen to and observe our children, soaking up their data, and with no framework to govern its use. Some of these AI toys even perform facial recognition of children and toddlers. Germany banned Cayla, an Internet-connected doll, because of concerns it could be hacked and used to spy on children. Yet, most countries do not yet have the legal framework in place to ban such toys. Finally, in the field of education, AI can and is being used in fabulous ways to tailor learning materials and pedagogical approaches to the child’s needs — such as intelligent tutoring systems, tailored curriculum plans, and imaginative virtual reality instruction, offering rich and engaging interactive learning experiences that can improve educational outcomes. But algorithms can also both amplify existing problems with education systems and introduce new challenges — when the pandemic caused the usual tests to be cancelled in the United Kingdom and by the International Baccalaureate board, for instance, the algorithms that served as a fallback meant thousands of students lost out on college admissions and scholarships. And unless the educational and performance data on children is kept confidential and anonymous, it can inadvertently typecast or brand children, harming their future opportunities. Rights, protections So, how do we balance the tremendous good AI can do for children, while keeping their unique vulnerabilities topmost in our preoccupations, mitigating inadvertent harm and misuse? The next phase of the fourth Industrial Revolution must include an overwhelming push to extend Internet access to all children. Governments, the private sector, civil society, parents and children must push hard for this now, before AI further deepens the pre-existing inequalities and creates its own disparities. And on mitigating on-line harms, we need a multi-pronged action plan: we need legal and technological safeguards; we need greater awareness among parents, guardians and children on how AI works behind the scenes; we need tools, like trustworthy certification and rating systems, to enable sound choices on safe AI apps; we need to ban anonymous accounts; we need enforceable ethical principles of non-discrimination and fairness embedded in the policy and design of AI systems — we need “do no harm” risk assessments for all algorithms that interact with children or their data. In short, we need safe online spaces for children, without algorithmic manipulation and with restricted profiling and data collection. And we need online tools (and an online culture) that helps prevent addiction, that promotes attention-building skills, that expands children’s horizons, understanding and appreciation for diverse perspectives, and that builds their social emotional learning capabilities. Key first step In February, in a landmark decision, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child adopted General Comment 25, on implementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child and fulfilling all children’s rights in the digital environment. This is an important first step on the long road ahead. The Government of India has put in place strong policies to protect the rights and well-being of children, including a legislative framework that includes the Right to Education. Laws and policies to prevent a range of abuses and violence, such as the National Policy for Children (2013), can be extended for children in a digital space. But much more needs to be done, here in India and around the world. And in this interconnected world, the more we can agree upon multilaterally and by multi-stakeholder groups, the easier it may be to implement nationally and locally. Just as India proactively helped shape the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and gave the world the principle of Ahimsa, it could also galvanise the international community around, ensuring an ethical AI for Generation AI.

20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||India and Russia look for a reset||It was clear from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s ‘working visit’ to India two weeks ago that India-Russia relations are not quite the flavour of the season. Mr. Lavrov’s principal objective was to prepare the ground for the visit of President Vladimir Putin later this year. The break in 2020, after 20 annual summits, had provoked speculation, partly flowing from Mr. Lavrov’s criticism last year of a U.S.-led Indo-Pacific policy, drawing India into “anti-China games” and undermining the India-Russia partnership. A few weeks earlier, Mr. Putin had extolled the vibrancy of Russia-China defence cooperation. These remarks encouraged the advocacy for a shift of India’s foreign policy away from a weak and China-tethered Russia and towards the U.S. Same narrative The joint media appearance of Mr. Lavrov and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar did not change the narrative. They said their talks were warm, comprehensive and productive; they mentioned the time-tested friendship, energy projects, defence cooperation and Russian support for India’s manned space programme. They glossed over their divergent perspectives on Afghanistan. Phrases like “identical or similar views” did not carry much conviction. Much more eloquent than fine words was the fact that, for the first time in all his visits to India, Mr. Lavrov could not meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Jaishankar said he conveyed the Indian perspective on the Indo-Pacific and Mr. Lavrov said they discussed the Asia-Pacific. “Indo-Pacific” continues to stick in Russian throats. India insists that its Indo-Pacific initiatives seek a cooperative order, that the Quad dialogue (of India, Japan, Australia and the U.S.) is not the nucleus of a politico-military alliance, and that it never subscribed to the Trumpian posture (now under review by the Biden administration) of military confrontation with China. A $1 billion Indian line of credit for projects in the Russian Far East and activation of a Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor were announced when Mr. Modi and Mr. Putin met in 2019. The message was that India’s effort to restrain Chinese aggression is compatible with Russia’s vision of a Eurasian partnership. Russia remains unconvinced, either because it feels India’s words do not match its actions or because of its close ties with China. As India-China tensions have grown, so have India’s concerns about Russia’s China embrace, encompassing close political, economic and defence cooperation (Russia accounted for 77% of China’s arms imports in 2016-20). India’s apprehensions about their technology- and intelligence-sharing were heightened by Mr. Putin’s remark that he would not rule out a future Russia-China military alliance. It is not clear whether he was stating a conviction, reassuring China or warning India and/or the West. Mr. Lavrov said in Delhi that Russia-China relations, though very close, are not “aimed at establishing a military alliance”. Mr. Modi would like this confirmation from the ultimate maker of Russian policy, when he meets Mr. Putin. He may also hear why Russia cannot see the logic of India’s Indo-Pacific actions. Mr. Lavrov visited Pakistan directly after India — the first time a Russian Minister has done so. He received red-carpet treatment and met the Army Chief and the Prime Minister. He confirmed that Russia would strengthen Pakistan’s “counter-terrorism capability” — a euphemism used by the U.S. earlier for its weapons supplies to Pakistan. Russia is now Pakistan’s second largest defence supplier, accounting for 6.6% of its arms imports in 2016-20. Their cooperation includes joint “counter-terrorism” drills and sharing perspectives on military tactics and strategic doctrines. At the same time, Russia remains a major supplier of cutting-edge military technologies to India. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) records that Russia supplied 49% of India’s arms imports in 2016-20. The proportion has been falling, as India diversifies its imports. Despite this, India’s second largest supplier, France, had only an 18% share. SIPRI estimates that recent orders for Russian arms could boost future import figures. This is a reality check. Defence cooperation is not a transactional exchange. Sharing of technologies and strategies is underpinned by a mutual commitment to protection of confidentiality. Sustainable defence cooperation is based on a credible assurance that what is transferred to our adversaries will not blunt the effectiveness of our weapons systems. In this already complex mix, the American sanctions legislation, CAATSA (Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act), adds an external layer of complexity. The criticality of geography in geopolitics is often underestimated. The Eurasian landmass to India’s north is dominated by Russia and China. Strategic and security interests in Central Asia, West Asia and Afghanistan dictate our engagement with the region and the connectivity projects linking it, like the International North-South Transport Corridor through Iran (that was discussed with Mr. Lavrov). India cannot vacate this space to a Russia-China condominium (with Pakistan in tow), without potentially grave security consequences. The China angle The Modi-Putin summit will tackle the “irritants” and, as before, will probably announce that perspectives have been reconciled. But such annual assertions do not convince the political, official, business, media and academic circles in the two countries, which have to sustain a major partnership. The relationship has to be located in a broader geopolitical context. The principal element in this is the drive for superpower status of a powerful, assertive China. It is self-evident that the U.S., as the pre-eminent superpower, seeks to retard this process. In a deviation from classical geopolitical strategy, the U.S. is taking on both China and Russia (which is the lesser power, despite its military power and energy dominance), thereby driving the two together and arguably accelerating the move to bipolarity. Even so, the differentials in military, economic and political power across countries may complicate the emergence of two clear poles of the Cold War variety. A let-up in the Western hostility to Russia could add to the complexity, if Mr. Putin’s Russia takes the opportunity to loosen the Chinese embrace and position itself as a pole in the multipolar world. India has to explore the space within these processes to maximise its global influence by steering clear of alliances and retaining autonomy of policy. The partnership with Russia will not have the salience of past decades, but will remain important for our continental interests and defence capability. The depth of the relationship will depend on the willingness and capacity of both countries to show mutual sensitivity to core security concerns. P.S.

20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The ordinance route is bad, repromulgation worse||The central government has repromulgated the ordinance that establishes a commission for air quality management in the National Capital Region, or the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020 (https://bit.ly/3duZmHW). This raises questions about the practice of issuing ordinances to make law, and that of re-issuing ordinances without getting them ratified by Parliament. The Constitution permits the central and State governments to make laws when Parliament (or the State Legislature) is not in session. As law making is a legislative function, this power is provided for urgent requirements, and the law thus made has an automatic expiry date. The Constitution states that the ordinance will lapse at the end of six weeks from the time Parliament (or the State Legislature) next meets. In the Constituent Assembly, while there was a discussion on how long the ordinance could remain valid (with some members asking for it to lapse within four weeks of promulgation as that would be sufficient time to call an urgent session of Parliament), no one raised the possibility of an ordinance to be re-promulgated. Perhaps such an eventuality was beyond their imagination. What the data show Whereas an ordinance was originally conceived as an emergency provision, it was used fairly regularly. In the 1950s, central ordinances were issued at an average of 7.1 per year. The number peaked in the 1990s at 19.6 per year, and declined to 7.9 per year in the 2010s. The last couple of years has seen a spike, 16 in 2019, 15 in 2020, and four till now this year (https://bit.ly/3go9YKf). State governments also used this provision very often. The issue was brought up in the Supreme Court through a writ petition by D.C. Wadhwa, a professor of economics, who discovered this fact when he was researching land tenures. He found out that Bihar had issued 256 ordinances between 1967 and 1981, of which 69 were repromulgated several times, including 11 which were kept alive for more than 10 years. A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in 1986, ruled that repromulgation of ordinances was contrary to the Constitutional scheme. It said, “it would most certainly be a colourable exercise of power for the Government to ignore the Legislature and to repromulgate the Ordinance and thus to continue to regulate the life and liberty of the citizens through Ordinance made by the Executive. Such a stratagem would be repugnant to the constitutional scheme as it would enable the Executive to transgress its constitutional limitation in the matter of law making in an emergent situation and to covertly and indirectly arrogate to itself the law making function of the Legislature (https://bit.ly/3mXEaxc).” Interestingly, the Court pointed out that there was not a single instance of the President (i.e., the central government) repromulgating an ordinance. The judgment did not stop the practice. Instead, the Centre also started to follow the lead of Bihar. For example, in 2013 and 2014, the Securities Laws (Amendment) ordinance was promulgated three times. Similarly, an ordinance to amend the Land Acquisition Act was issued in December 2014, and repromulgated twice – in April and May 2015 (https://bit.ly/32svBkM). An unconstitutional practice The matter came up again in the Supreme Court, and in January 2017, a seven-judge Constitution Bench declared this practice to be unconstitutional. The judgment concluded that, “Re-promulgation of ordinances is a fraud on the Constitution and a subversion of democratic legislative processes (https://bit.ly/3sq95Du).” Even this judgment has been ignored. The Indian Medical Council Amendment Ordinance was issued in September 2018, and reissued in January 2019, as it was passed by only one House of Parliament in the intervening session. The current case of the Commission for Air Quality Management is even more egregious. While the ordinance of October 2020 was laid in Parliament on the first day of the recent Budget Session, a Bill to replace it was not introduced. However, the ordinance has been repromulgated now (https://bit.ly/32uEiuC). States have also been using the ordinance route to enact laws. For example, in 2020, Kerala issued 81 ordinances, while Karnataka issued 24 and Maharashtra 21. Kerala has also repromulgated ordinances: one ordinance to set up a Kerala University of Digital Sciences, Innovation and Technology has been promulgated five times between January 2020 and February 2021 (https://bit.ly/2Q6zglJ). Onus on legislatures, courts The legal position is clear, and has been elucidated by constitution Benches of the Supreme Court. Ordinances are to tackle exigencies when the legislature is not in session, and expire at the end of six weeks of the next meeting of the legislature. This time period is given for the legislature to decide whether such a law is warranted. Repromulgation is not permitted as that would be a usurpation of legislative power by the executive. As governments, both at the Centre and States, are violating this principle, the legislatures and the courts should check the practice. That is what separation of powers and the concept of checks and balances means. By not checking this practice, the other two organs are also abdicating their responsibility to the Constitution. M.R.

20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Sharing the burden of care||The resilience of national health services is characterised by their ability to respond appropriately to epidemics, pandemics and disasters. There has been a consistent failure in India to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in the second wave. It is the responsibility of the state to first prevent the spread of a pandemic, failing which it needs to be extra vigilant in order to prevent every death from the disease. It is unfortunate that people are dying not because of inadequate solutions (technology and knowledge) for dealing with the virus but due to inadequate access (economic, physical and others) to that knowledge and technology. This is serious injustice. A nation will face several challenges if it wants to improve an otherwise ailing health system: poor infrastructure, inadequate staff, and so on. How can we turn even the worst crisis into a sustainable opportunity? Two approaches There are two possibilities that exist in strengthening curative care for COVID-19. The first is a reactive approach, which is what is carried out by most of the State governments. This is done by transforming a few of the well-performing facilities at the tertiary level into state-of-the art COVID-19 hospitals. However, this comes at a cost: people are not be able to get their routine hospital services from these tertiary facilities. At the primary level, most of the facilities created were temporary structures. They were created by hiring buildings and open spaces as COVID-19 treatment centres providing only beds. This approach of providing beds without adequate infrastructure was extensively critiqued for its inability to cater to the needs of patients in real-time situations. A slightly modified approach was to create first line treatment centres. Most of these facilities were a failure due to their inability to build trust among people as COVID-19 treatment centres. Most of them were shut down when the cases went down. The second possibility, less tried out, is to equip the functional facilities of government health services at the secondary level and convert them into exclusive COVID-19 care centres. These could be used to treat those patients who don’t need ICU support. As the three-tier structure of health services in India envisages, a community health centre (CHC) can potentially become a fulcrum on which the entire health system can bank on, especially during a crisis. A CHC is supposed to cover a population of 80,000-1,00,000 in rural areas. A CHC is supposed to have 30 beds with at least four specialty services and is expected to function as a first referral unit for curative care services referred from primary health centres (PHCs). Sadly, several States have failed to develop this facility. Many CHCs are grossly underdeveloped. Over 5,000 CHCs exist in rural areas, and can they can add 50,000-75,000 beds if 10-15 beds are added in each. This facility can be strengthened to address COVID-19-specific treatment needs (primary and secondary) of the rural population, especially in States with an increasing case load and poor health infrastructure like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Feasible and sustainable solution This can be a more feasible solution as specialists for this facility can be directed from district hospitals or medical colleges and the numbers can be managed for four-six CHCs under each district. This can be a sustainable solution as already there is a certain level of trust and functionality built into these centres as treatment centres. They have the potential to become centres for sample collection and vaccine delivery too. These CHCs can also easily be converted into independent standalone centres for COVID-19 treatment. After the pandemic ends, they can be converted into normal secondary-level facilities that cater to other needs. This can substantially reduce the overload faced by tertiary facilities as more than the severity of the disease, it is inadequate access to timely treatment that results in several deaths. It is always possible to strengthen the PHCs nearby to cater to the needs of people for other curative care services. For urban areas too, there is a need to develop peripheral hospitals at the secondary level within the government sector (100-150 bedded facility for every 3 lakh population), which can cater to the needs of the population during COVID-19 times. Instead of placing 500 and 1,000 beds in playgrounds and parking lots, it is important to expand beds which are effectively integrated into the existing health services. Only then will infrastructure facilities be good enough to provide effective care. This can build trust among people and contribute to strengthening health services in the long term.

20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||A huge, costly mistake||A river project which remained a pipe dream for more than three decades after it was first mooted may now become a reality. Last month, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and the Centre signed a tripartite agreement to transfer “surplus” water from the Ken basin in M.P. to the “deficit” Betwa basin in U.P. The Ken-Betwa project is part of the national river linking project which proposes to connect 14 Himalayan and 16 peninsular rivers with 30 canals and 3,000 reservoirs in order to irrigate 87 million hectares of land. It has the status of a national project, as the Centre will contribute 90% of the cost. It is India’s first river linking project and will take eight years to complete. First mooted in the 1980s, the Ken-Betwa project was taken up seriously only during former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s regime. Since then, former Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti has been the torch-bearer of the project. The project, the government says, will enhance the irrigation potential of the water-starved Bundelkhand region in U.P. and M.P., facilitate groundwater recharge and reduce the occurrence of floods. According to the Memorandum of Agreement signed, the to-be-built Daudhan dam is expected to irrigate nearly 6,00,000 hectares in four districts in M.P. and 2,51,000 hectares in four districts in U.P. and provide drinking water supply to 41 lakh people in M.P. and 21 lakh in U.P. Environmental concerns However, the excitement of planners and politicians about this project, which costs Rs. 37,611 crore (2018 figure), is reportedly missing on the ground. The people of the region who are going to be affected by the project seem resigned to their fate. In public hearings held in the past, they were divided on political lines and also worried about the loss of the ecosystem and displacement. The project was on the drawing board for years mainly due to environmental concerns. Of the 12,500 hectares of land to get submerged by the project, more than 9,000 ha are categorised as forest land. The submergence area includes a critically important section of the Panna Tiger Reserve. The Reserve is considered as a shining example of conservation after it successfully improved the tiger and vulture populations. Echoing the concerns of environmentalists, Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote to Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar asking him not to implement the project. She said “around 40% of the area of the tiger reserve will be irretrievably damaged” if the project is implemented. Also, the project may destroy about 7.2 lakh trees. South Asia Network on Dams, River and People convener Himanshu Thakkar fears that this will affect rainfall in the already parched region. Cost and benefit The claims of Ken having surplus water may be unrealistic as the river is not perennial — in the past sometimes, it has slowed to a trickle. Another difficulty will be that the Ken flows 60-70 feet lower than the Betwa and at least 30% of the 103 MW power generated will be used for pumping the water up. The Union Ministry and the National Water Development Agency, which is entrusted with the project, have some issues to sort out. These include getting clearance from the Central Empowered Committee of the Supreme Court, which had raised concerns about the project. The cost-benefits calculations of the project also don’t take into consideration the environmental and social impacts. Thus, the benefits do not seem certain and are far outweighed by the costs on the environment. It is surprising that alternatives such as water-conservation and water-harvesting methods without building a dam haven’t been seriously considered in the region. Large-scale solutions such as this are not always viable and the best. Given the serious doubts about the benefits of the project and the monumental toll that it would have on the ecosystem, including on carefully preserved wildlife, the Ken-Betwa project seems like a huge, costly mistake.

20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Saving lives||After painfully negotiating numerous hurdles during the first wave that peaked in mid-September last year, India appears to have learnt little as a more ferocious second wave is ravaging the country. Precious time was wasted before critical facilities began to be scaled up to meet the demands of the second wave that is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, leading to health-care facilities being overwhelmed; the number of deaths shows a sharp growth of 10.2%. A mad scramble for hospital beds, oxygen, medicines, vaccines and even a quick funeral are witnessed in many cities. If the mindless rush for convalescent plasma and hydroxychloroquine even in the absence of any evidence of benefit was seen last year, there is now hysteria to get remdesivir for hospitalised patients, leading to drug shortages. Though a small trial did show that the drug shortened the time to recovery, the World Health Organization’s large Solidarity trial found no evidence of its benefit in reducing mortality, initiation of ventilation or substantial reduction in the time to recovery. Being an intravenous injection, remdesivir can be administered only in hospital settings, and any benefit might be seen only in moderately sick patients. Due to an acute shortage of beds, the disease in most patients is often severe at the time of admission. The Health Ministry’s July 2020 COVID-19 clinical management protocol does suggest that remdesivir may be considered in patients with moderate disease. But steroids such as dexamethasone may be better at helping patients on oxygen support or on ventilator support from progressing to respiratory failure and death. The first wave in India and elsewhere clearly highlighted the weaknesses in health delivery. Yet, nearly a year after hospitals were stretched beyond capacity and beds and medical oxygen supplies were in short supply, no attempts have been made either by State or Union governments to significantly augment medical oxygen supplies. According to reports, the Union government took eight months to initiate steps to build oxygen generation plants that will reduce the reliance on pressurised liquid oxygen. Of the 162 plants approved, only 33 have been installed, the Health Ministry tweeted. Large buildings converted into temporary hospitals, without necessary oxygen supplies to individual beds and sufficient care workers, can at best serve as isolation centres. Despite private health facilities playing only a minor role in treating COVID-19 patients last year, NITI Aayog in a 2021 report sees it as a priority to get private players to invest and expand in Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations. With the virus unlikely to be eliminated in the near future, being better prepared with vaccines and health-care facilities will be a prudent way to save lives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/saving-lives/article34362848.ece
20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Vulnerability reminder||The U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel’s reported decision to allow fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi’s extradition to India, three years after state-owned Punjab National Bank admitted it had been defrauded to the tune of over Rs. 14,000 crore, serves as a reminder of the urgent need to address the banking system’s vulnerability to fraud. India’s lenders have had to contend not only with a sizeable share of sour loans but also a growing number and cumulative value of frauds. The RBI noted in its latest Annual Report, in August last year, that the total number of cases of fraud (minimum size of Rs. 1 lakh) at banks and financial institutions rose 28% by volume and surged 159%, or more than 2.5 times, by value to Rs. 1.85-lakh crore in the 12 months ended March 31, 2020. While the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have likely slowed the cognisance of frauds since then, the trend from the preceding years is deeply troubling from multiple perspectives. With frauds mainly occurring in the loan portfolio, the RBI observed that there was “a concentration of large value frauds, with the top 50 credit-related frauds constituting 76% of the total amount”. Also, despite the central bank having created a framework to facilitate the prevention, if not early detection and prompt reporting of such frauds, the average lag in detecting these transactions was 24 months during 2019-20. And most disturbing was the RBI’s finding that in cases of sizeable fraud, where the sum involved exceeded Rs. 100 crore, the average lag was 63 months, or more than five years. While the public sector banks (PSBs) have had to bear the brunt of the hit from fraudulent borrowing — they accounted for an almost 80% share in 2019-20 — the private sector lenders outpaced their peers both in terms of number of cases and the increase in value of frauds. Even granting that fraud at a single private lender skewed the increase in cumulative value of transactions that year, a fivefold surge in value to Rs. 34, 211 crore was on the back of a 34% jump in the number of fraud cases at these banks while the PSBs suffered only a 24% increase. These facts are especially germane when one considers that the government has been on mission mode in trying to expedite consolidation among the PSBs and is ultimately looking at opening up the sector as a whole to greater private sector participation. With the RBI lamenting the ‘weak implementation of early warning signals’, non-detection of signals during internal audits and non-cooperation of borrowers during forensic audits as being among the key factors leading to delayed detection of fraud, the impending concentration of risk in fewer lenders is far from reassuring. The fallen jeweller’s case is only the symptom of a deeper malady. The RBI as industry regulator needs to walk the talk and ensure tighter oversight. Any laxity threatens overall financial stability.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/vulnerability-reminder/article34362849.ece
20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Mr. Gandhi as Prophet?||“New India” is somewhat concerned at the growing tendency to deify Mr. Gandhi. Our contemporary may not believe it, but it is possible that Mr. Gandhi himself, who lacks the self-assertiveness necessary to all true latter-day prophets, is quite as much concerned at that tendency. Nevertheless human nature being what it is, men are always apt to reverence a perfection to which they may aspire but cannot attain. The gospel preached by Mr. Gandhi is one so closely attuned to the Indian temperament and traditions that his modern attempt to translate it into our society and politics is regarded as something infinitely higher than a mere political weapon. Thus side by side with the political aspect of the movement there evolves another which is not concerned so much with Mr. Gandhi’s ends as with his methods. His fearless insistence for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, his untiring emphasis of the vital importance of non-violence in thought and deed and last but not the least his condemnation of the materialistic outlook upon life which has crept like a canker upon India’s mentality are in themselves themes sufficiently inspiring to arouse the enthusiasm of a people who have not yet outgrown their heritage of a certain other worldliness in their mental vision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mr-gandhi-as-prophet/article34362856.ece

The country’s largest carmaker MSI said auto sales were correlated closely with economic growth and also — being a discretionary purchase — with consumer sentiment. “The COVID-19 situation... is obviously a negative for customer sentiment and thus has an... impact on sales,” MSI executive director (Sales and Marketing) Shashank Srivastava said.. Lockdowns made it physically impossible to deliver cars; but, even the deterioration in the COVID-19 situation without lockdowns also psychologically dents consumer propensity to buy, he noted. Toyota Kirloskar Motor senior VP Naveen Soni acknowledged that localised restrictions have hit order flow and delivery schedules. “We will be able to access trends and define numbers only by the end of the month depending on the severity and [extent] of the restrictions. As of date, we have had a good number of pending orders that had to be carried forward from the month of February and March to April. Therefore, we are striving to meet customer demand in spite of local restrictions and lockdowns,” he noted. On manufacturing operations, Mr. Soni said the company continued to cautiously proceed with vehicle production. “Our immediate focus is to streamline the demand and supply processes with more accuracy and manage production, along with faster deliveries, [thus] reducing delivery time,” he added. The well-being of employees as well as dealer and supplier staff are sacrosanct, he said, adding that the automaker had already reintroduced monitoring systems which were in place including submission of a self-declaration health form. “As responsible corporates, we are continuously monitoring the situation carefully and will take accurate actions, as and when required. More importantly, this time we have precious lessons from last year to learn, unlearn and reflect upon,” he noted. ‘Shut showrooms’ Honda Cars India said it was keeping a close watch on the emerging situation. “Lockdown and weekend curfews will impact sales as showrooms will be shut in some of the markets. We are currently assessing and taking feedback from various cities about its extent,” Honda Cars India senior VP and director (Marketing and Sales) Rajesh Goel noted.

20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Moeen and Jadeja trap Royals in a web of spin||The calm M.S. Dhoni, captaining Chennai Super Kings for a momentous 200th occasion, rang in the changes and cut the angles on the field much like a wizard, as his side crushed Rajasthan Royals by 45 runs at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium on Monday. Dhoni and CSK were in control when Rajasthan, pursuing 189, lost the plot in this IPL clash on a pitch that offered some purchase for the spinners. Ravindra Jadeja and Moeen Ali struck body blows. In fact, Jadeja’s dream ball triggered RR’s decline. Decisive strike Jos Buttler can innovate and create and the cheeky dabs and the reverse sweeps were on view. The Englishman was on 49 when Jadeja bamboozled him with a delivery that pitched on leg and hit middle-and-off. Jadeja struck again in the same over, sliding one into the left-hander Shivam Dube and trapping him in front. CSK made further inroads. Moeen Ali consumed the left-hander David Miller on the sweep. The off-spinner struck again when he had the high value Chris Morris caught at deep mid-wicket. It was all over for RR. Earlier left-arm swing bowler Sam Curran dented Royals early dismissing Manan Vohra and Sanju Samson with short-pitched deliveries. CSK made 188 for nine after being inserted and, astonishingly, the highest score was Faf du Plessis’ 33. CSK made 46 in the first six PowerPlay overs and smashed 61, despite losing wickets, in the last five. Quick runs Curran and Dwayne Bravo added crucial quick runs in the end. The intrepid Curran slashed Chetan Sakariya for a six. And Bravo, who struck some brave blows, concluded the innings with a rousing six over long-on off the innings’ last ball from Mustafizur Rahman. Earlier, Ruturaj Gaikwad’s dry run continued as he was done in canny Mustafizur’s change of pace after CSK was asked to take first strike. du Plessis, batting with panache, danced down to strike Jaydev Unadkat for maximum. A stunning blow. However, fellow South African Morris bowled one outside off-stump and du Plessis, charging, slashed fatally. The easy-hitting Moeen soon swung Mustafizur and pulled Morris for sixes before miscuing a short ball from leg-spinner Rahul Tewatia. CSK pushed on. Ambati Rayudu waded into Tewatia with footwork and timing. The innings once again hit a roadblock when Rayudu hit a back of a length ball from Sakariya to be held at the cover-point fence. Sakariya struck again when Suresh Raina, attempting to switch gears, drove the bowler straight to mid-off. CSK eventually put together a combative score in Dhoni’s 200th match as its captain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/moeen-and-jadeja-trap-royals-in-web-of-spin/article34362952.ece
20 April 2021||Guatemala City,||All eyes on archers Atanu and Deepika||All eyes will be on the newly-wed archery couple of Atanu Das and Deepika Kumari as India will look to make up for lost time caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the World Cup Stage 1 which begins here on Tuesday. It has been more than 18 months since the last circuit trophies were awarded at the World Cup Final in Moscow. The World Cup Stage 1 will be the first global event since the pandemic forced the cancellation of the international calendar in 2020. Long wait For the Indians, the wait was longer as they last took part in a World Cup back in the stage 4 circuit in Berlin in July 2019. Thus, they would look to shake off the rustiness and get back to rhythm. In the absence of Asian heavyweights Korea, China, Chinese Taipei and Turkey, the Indian archers led by Atanu and Deepika would look to a strong performance in the build-up to the Tokyo Olympics. Without the big Asian teams, it will be a battle of supremacy between the American and European nations, while the Indians would also hope to make a mark, especially in the mixed and team events. First real test Having already secured the Olympic quota, it would be the first real test for the trio of Atanu, Pravin Jadhav and veteran Tarundeep Rai. In the women’s section, India has got individual Olympic quota through former World No. 1 Deepika who, along with Ankita Bhakat and Komalika Bari, would look to the much-needed exposure ahead of the final qualification in Paris. Realistically, it’s the women’s team and the mixed pair team which can win medals in the absence of the fancied compound team which was withdrawn. The national federation pulled out the compound team of Abhishek Verma and Jyothi Surekha just before its departure after coach Gaurav Sharma tested positive. The coach was isolated at the SAI Sonepat camp while the team left for Delhi airport, but the federation disallowed its entry to “ensure safety” of the recurve archers. The next day, it came to light that the coach had a “false positive” report in his second test, but by then the damage had already been done. Around 150 archers from across the globe will vie for top honours in the World Cup first stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/all-eyes-on-archers-atanu-and-deepika/article34362842.ece
20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Daunting Mumbai roadblock looms for Delhi||Shikhar Dhawan and Prithvi Shaw are in red-hot form at the top of Delhi Capitals’ batting order. As are Mumbai Indians’ Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah, arguably the IPL’s best pace combination. Their face-off may well decide Tuesday’s game — a repeat of last year’s final. Although both teams have wasted little time in getting off the blocks, notching up two wins each in three games so far, DC will know that MI, perhaps the best-oiled outfit in the IPL, has its measure. Rohit Sharma’s men came out on top in all four of their meetings last season — twice in the league and twice in the playoffs. MI is also better acquainted with the conditions at the M.A. Chidamabaram Stadium, where it has played its three games so far, while it will be DC’s first match in Chennai this year. It will help DC if its openers can continue their form from Sunday. Interestingly, both have strong ties with Mumbai — while Dhawan opened for MI in the IPL’s early years, Shaw is a product of Mumbai’s stable of batsmanship. If the duo can weather the Boult-Bumrah storm and let captain Rishabh Pant go after spin twins Rahul Chahar and Krunal Pandya, DC’s chances of finally finding a way past MI will improve. If DC includes Anrich Nortje in the XI, it will also be a direct clash between the two fearsome pace combinations. After all, the Rabada-Nortje combine tallied a whopping 52 wickets in IPL-13, the same as Boult and Bumrah’s joint total. MI has most things covered, but it still has not solved the third-pacer riddle. Neither Marco Jansen nor Adam Milne, both of whom have been handed MI debuts, has looked effective so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/daunting-mumbai-roadblock-looms-for-delhi/article34362963.ece
20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Fleming says Moeen adds all-round value||Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming is happy with the way Moeen Ali has brought value to the side, adding that the team missed an all-rounder like him last year. “He is adding an all-round aspect to our game which we lacked last year. “His contribution today [Monday] was just what we were looking for. We are absolutely happy with the way he has started,” said Fleming. “He has been impressive and the way he is playing at No. 3 has been instrumental in us getting good scores,” added the former New Zealand skipper. Despite another failure, Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson said he would continue to play aggressively. “IPL demands risk-taking. When I succeeded I took a lot of risks and that is why I scored a 100 (in the first match). “I don’t want to restrict my shots. I am willing to accept a few failures on the way, but at the same time, I will look to contribute to my team’s victories in the coming matches,” said Samson.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fleming-says-moeen-adds-all-round-value/article34363429.ece
20 April 2021||KOCHI,||KSEB in final after dramatic comeback||Down 0-3 shortly after the hour mark, former champion KSEB bounced back brilliantly and defeated Royal Basco FC 8-6 via the tie-breaker to enter the final of the seventh Ramco Kerala Premier League here on Monday. KSEB and Basco were level 3-3 at the end of the regulation period in the first semifinal with all the six goals coming in the second-half. Basco frequently used the left flank to advance, probably realising that KSEB’s right-back Muhammed Parokkottil was uncomfortable in that position. And it clicked for Malappuram’s Basco as its first two goals came from the left flank. Basco took the lead through an own goal from KSEB’s Muhammed Uvais in the 54th and within the next nine minutes, it had added two more. But KSEB found its saviour through C. Jacob, who scored twice, and later Nijo Gilbert converted a penalty in the injury period to level the score after M. Viknesh was brought down by Basco defender T.C. Fahad inside the box. Earlier, Basco forward Abdu Raheem messed a penalty in the first-half injury time and it proved costly in the end. In Sunday's final at Kochi, KSEB will meet Gokulam Kerala FC which Kerala United FC 4-2 via the tie-breaker in the other semifinal. The two were goalless at the end of the regular period in the second semifinal at Thrissur’s Corporation Stadium.  The results (semifinals): KSEB, Tvm 8 (C. Jacob 65 & 85, Nijo Gilbert 90+1 penalty; Nijo Gilbert, Arun Suresh, Muhammed Uvais, Jinesh Dominic, Eldhose George in tie-breaker) bt Royal Basco, Mlp 6 (Muhammed Uvais 54-og, C.

20 April 2021||MUMBAI,||Shaw sizzles with the sidearm as well||After working with coaches Prashant Shetty and Pravin Amre on playing close to the body — a technical flaw that haunted him during the 2020 Indian Premier League (IPL) and the following tour of Australia — Prithvi Shaw amassed a whopping 827 runs while leading Mumbai to the Vijay Hazare Trophy title in February. But contrary to the run-feast in the matches, Shaw hardly batted in the nets during the championship. Instead, he kept on bowling with a sidearm — the scoop that is used for offering throwdowns in the nets — in every practice session. Amazing achievement “Everyone needed me doing the sidearm thing. I am very good at it. I feel all the batsmen were quite happy to see me bowl at them for hours together. It was a good tournament and an amazing achievement for everyone.” More than his skills with the sidearm, Shaw has impressed one and all in his new avatar as an opener. The initial phase of IPL 2021 has given a glimpse that he is ready to translate his domestic form into the league. “After coming back from Australia, I was a bit worried about my batting. But I worked hard and doing well in Vijay Hazare (made me confident). I didn’t have too much practice before the IPL but I managed well,” Shaw said and added he was making the most of the practice sessions with “Ricky sir” (head coach) and “Pravin sir” (assistant coach Amre). If Shaw continues to sizzle with the willow, don’t be surprised if Delhi Capitals batsmen force him to use the sidearm during the nets.

20 April 2021||April 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The ultimate face-off||While Shalini Kantayya was working on Coded Bias for two years, she would be asked at social gatherings what her projet du jour was. The filmmaker would often find it hard to explain the complexities of technologies with controversial biases, powered by Artificial Intelligence, so she would simply say ‘I’m working on a film about racist robots’. Over a video call with MetroPlus from her home in Brooklyn, New York, Kantayya laughs as she recalls these moments. Switching to a more serious and urgent tone she says, “We are living in an era where it is absolutely necessary for the public to understand complex science and how these systems work. Data rights are the unfinished business of the civil rights movement.” Documentary Coded Bias , currently streaming on Netflix, is making waves for its narrative around the troubling intersections of Artificial Intelligence, facial recognition and racial bias. It is packed with compelling plot twists around the future of a surveillance state. Kantayya has let researchers Joy Buolamwini, Deborah Raji, Meredith Broussard, Cathy O’Neil, Zeynep Tufekci, Safiya Noble, Timnit Gebru, and Virginia Eubanks, all women of minority communities, explain the concept. Kantayya says working with these academics has been “incredibly humbling”. Her driving force to make the film lies in the opening scenes of Coded Bias, where Buolamwini, as a young grad student, tries to get the camera to recognise her face. It registers a blank, white mask while not registering her face. Large parts of the film were shot in the United Kingdom where facial recognition is openly used by governments. Freedom rights group Big Brother Watch features in Coded Bias as group director Silkie Carlo speaks against the privacy breaches and how racial profiling has been contentious for thousands of immigrant families. In one scene, a black 14-year-old is flanked by authorities and fingerprinted, having been marked by a facial recognition system. Big Brother Watch intervenes with the authorities who, in turn, justify the flawed system. The filmmaker, whose family comes from Madurai, is well aware of the ‘dark skin obsession’ across offline spaces. “I realised this is not a technology that is being beta tested on a shelf somewhere in a laboratory. This was tech being sold to the FBI, immigration officials, and being deployed by law enforcement departments across the US with no one we had elected.” She, like millions of others, is aghast at how this became a government oversight. “Law enforcement bodies all over the world are picking up the tools of authoritarian states with no democratic rule that would protect our civil rights. This is frightening to me that, as we trust these systems, we could roll back on these civil rights that help make society more equal.” Making it accessible Kantayya is aware she is not a technologist — in fact, this helped her. “Anyone challenging the system has felt like an imposter thinking ‘I didn’t go to MIT or Harvard, who am I to talk about these issues?’ When it comes to technologies such as AI or facial recognition, all of the knowledge and power is in the hands of a few. These technologies dovetail with almost every freedom we enjoy in democracies.” Through Coded Bias, she learned how there is no power like that of big tech. “Three years ago I didn’t even know what an algorithm was,” she admits. “Everything I knew about AI came through the imagination of Steven Spielberg or Stanley Kubrick; I think my ‘street cred’ comes from being a sci-fi fanatic. I didn’t understand what facial recognition really was, how algorithms work or how Machine Learning, AIs and algorithms were gatekeepers of opportunity until I discovered Joy’s work. They were gatekeepers in that they decide who gets hired, who gets healthcare and who gets scrutiny.” Kantayya elaborates on the implicit trust populations have in these enigmatic technologies. “They have not been vetted for gender bias or racial bias, for whether or not they can cause harm to people, or even for some shared standard of accuracy outside of a company that stands to benefit economically.” The director particularly enjoyed condensing complex sciences into two-minute sound bytes for the lay-person, while ensuring it is all visually stimulating. Kantayya drew on the visual language of science fiction which is what she knows best. “It was important that the science had integrity, distilled in a way that was easily accessible and digestible by audiences while holding relevance for their lives, instead of remaining abstract.” She concludes that Coded Bias reveals that where there is more education and dialogue around these technologies, policy is quick to be implemented. She hopes audiences watch Coded Bias to not just understand these technologies better but also consider big tech companies and governments accountable. “I hope this is the movie that pulls a chair out for all of us and gives us a seat at the table, because these systems influence all of our lives and opportunities.” The film reminds people that, at the end of the day, human beings create these technologies and, in turn, these technologies perpetuate the creators’ biases.  Festival favourite   Coded Bias premiered at Sundance Film Festival in January 2020 where it was nominated for ‘US Documentary Grand Jury Prize’ among other awards at numerous other film festivals. This year it won‘Best Director’ and ‘Grand Jury Prize for Transparency’ at the Social Impact Media Awards, and ‘Prize of OMCT (World Organisation Against Torture)’ at the International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights. It is not Kantayya’s first tech-based documentary. Kantayya, who is also an environmental activist, has directed projects about big tech and clean energy: Catching The Sun (2015) and Breakthrough (2016), a National Geographic series.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-ultimate-face-off/article34363003.ece

20 April 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||COVID patients scramble for beds in western Odisha||Bibek Meher’s search for a COVID bed for his father finally ended after 16 hours when he got one at a private hospital in Bhubaneswar. On April 13, when his father’s oxygen level dipped at Kantabanji in Odisha’s Balangir district, he and his mother scrambled for a bed. He had to inquire at four hospitals during a 600-km restless travel in four western Odisha districts, with his father in an ambulance. He could have easily availed a bed at a government hospital, but there was perhaps lack of centralised information regarding the availability of COVID-19 bed for public. Though the struggle for hospital bed was not bad as it is in States like Delhi, Maharashtra or Chhattisgarh, confusion prevails among relatives of COVID-19 patients in western Odisha where spike in daily cases was higher than many coastal districts. “I had found a bed for my father as the situation was not that bad five days ago. With situation rapidly deteriorating, I found many people being turned away here,” said Mr. Meher at the private hospital. In western Odisha’s Sambalpur district, Newton Roy, a journalist, said his mother-in-law (65) was turned away at Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Burla, due to unavailability of bed on Monday. “Beds at all private hospitals are occupied. If condition of my mother-in-law worsens, we have no idea where to go,” said Mr. Roy. Those who are fortunate to have availed beds in special COVID-19 hospitals in Bhubaneswar, are anxious too. “I had taken admission in a government-sponsored private hospital in Bhubaneswar. No doctor or nurse turned up even after ten hours. Though my husband is 79-year-old and I am 74, I pleaded before hospital authorities to send us home,” said Sandhya Das, who is recuperating in home isolation. Their son Nishikant Das, who had flown from Hyderabad to take care of his ageing parents, tested positive too. “Private hospitals, where one expects better services, do not have bed,” said Mr. Das. Disturbing reports were emanating from western Odisha. People were seen lying in hospital verandahs and inside car on hospital campus for accessing oxygen in Balangir. The situation in Sundargarh is equally horrifying. Patients were lying on hospital floors. Odisha on Monday reported the highest-ever single-day figure, with 4,445 cases. It surpassed previous highest daily spike of 4,356 reported on September 26 last. The Odisha government, however, said there was neither shortage of hospital beds nor oxygen. As per official information available till Sunday, 1,576 patients were occupying beds, with 9,008 being the total number of general beds. It constituted 17.50% bed occupancy. Similarly, of 2,018 total beds in ICUs, 424 were occupied. Only 59 (7.54%) of 782 ventilators were in use. “We are ramping up COVID-19 beds. The special hospitals, which were created last year, are being made functional. The bed strength will go up by four to five times,” said Niranjan Mishra, State Director of Public Health. There are 11,381 active cases in seven out of 30 districts . Active cases in these western Odisha districts – Sundargarh, Jharsuguda, Bargarh, Sambalpur, Balangir, Nuapada and Kalahandi – constitute 46.32% of the State’s total active cases. Health experts said the situation was rapidly deteriorating in western pockets and its impact would soon be felt on the health infrastructure. Unless the State government immediately ramps up beds for COVID-19, there would be chaos, they pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/covid-patients-scramble-for-beds-in-western-odisha/article34363165.ece

20 April 2021||Agartala,||Tripura begins shifting of Mizoram Bru refugees||Shifting of Mizoram Bru refugees for permanent settlement at various places in Tripura started on Monday. The first batch of 515 refugees was moved out of the camps in north Tripura district and sent to two places for their settlement in Dhalai district. The process of settlement of some 35,000 Brus is taking place to respect a quadripartite accord signed in New Delhi on January 16 last year. The accord was signed in presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah after a meeting with the representatives of the refugees, the Tripura and the Mizoram governments. The Home Ministry had accepted a proposal by Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb and the State’s royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarman to rehabilitate them in the State to end over-two-decade-old impasse. The Tripura government selected 16 places spread over four districts for their settlement. The State government also constituted four committees to oversee settlement arrangements. It earlier notified the refugees as its permanent citizens. The refugees, who have been residing in makeshift camps in Kanchanpur in north Tripura since 1997, constantly refused to return home, citing threats to life and repression. They fled Mizoram amid ethnic tension and Mizo hardline groups always opposed their repatriation attempts. North district Deputy Collector and Magistrate Animesh Das said the first batch was provided settlement in Haduklapura and Duklai villages in Dhalai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/tripura-begins-shifting-of-mizoram-bru-refugees/article34363162.ece
