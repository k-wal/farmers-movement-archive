13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||As cases surge, panel approves Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine||Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine — Sputnik V — has been recommended for emergency use authorisation in India following a meeting of the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on Monday, The Hindu has confirmed. If approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), Sputnik-V would be the third vaccine to be made available in India after Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.  The Hindu had reported, on April 4, that this vaccine was likely to be cleared for public use within 7-10 days. The recommendation comes amid the recent record surge of fresh COVID cases — the highest since the beginning of the pandemic last year. India has also on Monday reported a total of 948 cases with the U.K., South Africa and Brazil variants of the virus, according to the Health Ministry. Sputnik V, developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, claims to be one of the three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90%.  “The vaccine’s efficacy is confirmed at 91.6% based on the analysis of data on 19,866 volunteers, who received both the first and second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine or placebo at the final control point of 78 confirmed COVID-19 cases,” noted the information released on the vaccine’s official website. RDIF to produce shots It adds that the vaccine supplies for the global market will be produced by the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) international partners in India, Brazil, China, South Korea and other countries. While Dr. Reddy’s will market the vaccine in India, RDIF has tied up with other Indian companies — Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech — to produce 850 million doses of Sputnik V in the country every year. “RDIF jointly with partners and manufacturers is ramping up the production of Sputnik V. The cost of one dose of the vaccine for international markets is less than $10 (Sputnik V is a two dose vaccine). The (freeze-dried form) of the vaccine can be stored at a temperature of +2 to +8 degrees Celsius, which allows for easy distribution worldwide, including hard-to-reach regions,” noted the website.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/as-cases-surge-sec-approves-russias-sputnik-v-vaccine/article34307030.ece
13 April 2021||MANGALURU,||Eight members of ‘TB Gang’ arrested||The Central Crime Branch and the Mangaluru Rural Police have arrested eight accused involved in murder, dacoity, assault and extortion cases registered in the city, Udupi and Bengaluru police limits. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar gave the names of the accused as Tauseer (29) of Marnamikatte, Tasleem (27) of Farangipet, Mohammed Jainuddin (24) of Bantwal, Mohammed Arafat (29) of Farangipet, Nasir Hussain (29), Mohammed Rafiq (37), Unnaiz (26) and Mohammed Safan (25), all four from Bantwal. Mr. Kumar told reporters here on Monday that these accused were members of a gang run by Tauseer and Bathish, who is now in Saudi Arabia. This was called the “TB (Tauseer Bathish) Gang”. They were mainly involved in extortion and money recovery cases. They were also accused in murder, attempt to murder and cattle theft cases. On Sunday, they returned from Bengaluru after failing to confront Ziyad, a resident of the BC Road and now working in Bengaluru, who had failed to return Rs. 12 lakh taken from Safan. The accused parked their car near Parari of Uaibettu and planned to rob people of their valuables on the Mangaluru-Moodbidri stretch of the National Highway. The CCB and the Mangaluru Rural Police received a tip-off and arrested them. Two machetes, three sharp weapons, eight mobile phones, five monkey caps and three packets of chilli powder were recovered from their vehicle, Mr. Kumar said. Among the cases that the accused were involved included an assault on Naushad (30) as he came out of a hospital in Falnir where his father-in-law had been admitted in November 2020. This was as per Bathish’s instructions, Mr. Kumar said. The arrested persons had, after a failed dacoity attempt at a house in Dhamasthala last year, killed a pet dog at the house when it started barking. The accused were involved in the murder of Jiya and Fayaz in Bantwal Rural Police limits in 2017. “We have launched a search for more persons, including the one who acted as a middleman in money recovery cases,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/eight-members-of-tb-gang-arrested/article34307667.ece
13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sensex, rupee slip on fear of pandemic; inflation surges||The BSE Sensex tanked 1,708 points or 3.44% driven by the fear of fresh pandemic effects, taking the rupee past the Rs. 75 mark against the dollar on a manic Monday for the economy, even as inflation surged further in March and industrial output collapsed sharply in February as per official data. India’s retail inflation accelerated to 5.52% in March 2021 from 5.03% in February, with urban areas recording a high 6.52% inflation. The Consumer Food Price Index hardened to 4.94% from 3.87% in February, with urban India seeing a much higher surge of 6.64% in food inflation. Industrial output, meanwhile, fell for the second successive month in February, contracting by 3.6%, suggesting that the recovery is still shaky, economists said. “On a discouraging note, infrastructure and construction goods recorded a contraction of 4.7% in February, after having displayed an uninterrupted expansion since August 2020. Consumer non-durables output has shrunk in three of the last four months, suggesting that sentiment remains weak at the bottom of the pyramid,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA. Retail inflation through 2020-21 was the highest in the last seven years at 6.2%, said Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Research and Ratings. “Rising retail inflation and falling wage growth is a double whammy for consumption demand, which even otherwise is under pressure.” Higher fuel prices due to a combination of higher crude prices and elevated excise duties pushed transport and communication inflation to 12.5%, the highest since the current inflation index series began, Mr. Pant said. Among services, household goods and services inflation hit a 10-month high while recreation and amusement services touched a 9-month high. While some relief is expected in April’s inflation numbers, as base effects from last year’s national lockdown kick in, the uptick in inflation is expected to resume thereafter, Ms. Nayar reckoned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sensex-rupee-slip-on-fear-of-pandemic-inflation-surges/article34307034.ece

13 April 2021||IMPHAL,||Manipur CM unhappy over poor response to vaccination||Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren has expressed his displeasure over the lukewarm response from the people to the government’s appeal to get themselves vaccinated against COVID-19. He said, “All passengers coming to Manipur by air or road have to undergo COVID-19 testing. Officials are deployed at the Imphal international airport. Some passengers were found to be COVID-19 positive. The people should give overwhelming response to the call of the government”. Mr. Biren was the first to be inoculated during the ‘tika utsav’ drive in Imphal on Sunday. He said that the media should give the medical history of patients who have got the jab. No shortage Unlike some other States, Manipur was not facing a vaccine shortage. Mr. Biren said, “There are about 6 lakh people in Manipur who are above 60 years of age, However about 2,000 people in this age bracket were inoculated. There are about 8 lakh people below the age group 45. But just a negligible people turned up for vaccine jabs”. Police sources said that a staggering amount was collected everyday as fines for violating the standard operating procedures. Very few people use face masks and observe other preventive measures. Health officials say that a steady spike is being reported in Manipur after a lull.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/manipur-cm-unhappy-over-poor-response-to-vaccination/article34307225.ece
13 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Rising COVID-19 cases, bus strike affect Ugadi travel||The eve of Ugadi would every year see a huge movement of people to their hometowns to celebrate the festival. But the ongoing bus strike and an exponential surge in COVID-19 cases have had a telling impact, with travel relatively muted even on Monday. The movement appeared to be more among those with their own vehicles. Though traffic was more than usual, it was less compared to previous years. Even though over 3,000 buses of the road transport corporations (RTCs) made trips on Monday, the passenger volumes were not at expected levels. “The crowd is far thinner than expected,” admitted Shivayogi C. Kalasad, managing director, KSRTC. Seats vacant S. Nataraj Sharma, chairman, Karnataka State Travel Operators Association, said private buses that usually see demand peak during the festival season, often leading to surge pricing, had most seats vacant despite running at usual fares. Wide publicity for the bus strike has also scared off many from making travel plans. Mallamma, who works as a domestic help in the city, usually went to her village in Kalaburagi district for Ugadi, but not this time. “I was not sure if I would get a bus. Also, surge in cases in Bengaluru has created fear in the village and we may not be welcome now,” she said. However, Monday evening saw longer queues at most toll gates leading out of the city, indicating many left in their own vehicles. “The traffic is more than usual, but far less compared to festival eves from previous years,” said a toll booth operator from Devanahalli.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rising-covid-19-cases-bus-strike-affect-ugadi-travel/article34307484.ece
13 April 2021||MYSURU,||Heli-tourism is a publicity stunt, says Pratap Simha||Environmentalists in the city have found an unlikely ally in Mysuru MP Pratap Simha who has come down on the heli-tourism project and dubbed it a publicity stunt. Mr. Simha and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah too find themselves sharing similar views on the project as the latter tweeted opposing it and urged the government to scrap it. “The decision of @BJP4Karnataka gov to destroy ecology around Lalith Mahal for heli tourism is disastrous. I strongly condemn the decision and urge @BSYBJP to immediately scrap the project,” Mr. Siddaramaiah tweeted. Mr. Simha on Monday inspected the proposed site for the helipads opposite the Lalitha Mahal project which is being strongly advocatedby Minister for Tourism C.P. Yogeshwar. He said the concept was nebulous and devoid of any vision or even a business, or a revenue model.The project would be opposed at all costs and he would not allow the felling of trees in an area where there was already another helipad (belonging to the Wadiyars) and could be leased or rented, said Mr. Simha. If need be, the Mysuru airport could be utilised but there was no need to cut hundreds of trees for a hazy idea, he added. The MP said he had instructed the Forest Department in Mysuru not to permit the felling of trees. Mr. Simha said in case Mr. Yogeshwar had a model in mind he should discuss it with the stakeholders and bring it to the notice of the district in-charge Minister S.T. Somashekar. “But so far this has not been discussed and he (Mr. Yogeshwar) is moving about uttering heli-tourism where ever he goes,” Mr. Simha said. Airing his strong disdain for the project, Mr. Simha said helicopter rides providing an aerial view of Mysuru during Dasara was popular. But efforts to bring tourists from Bengaluru to Mysuru by flights during Dasara had failed in the past. “And now who would want to fly from Mysuru to Karwar or any other destination in a chopper and at what cost?” Mr. Simha questioned. The Centre had provided adequate funds for tourism development and crores of rupees was released for destination improvements in Karwar and other places in the State. But not even a fraction of the funds released by the Centre had been properly utilised and now there was this hoopla over heli-tourism, Mr. Simha added. “The Mysuru-Bengaluru highway was being expanded to a 10-lane road which will reduce the commuting time to a little more than an hour and there was already flights operating out of Mysuru to key destinations in the State. If need be, we can strive to improve flight connectivity and bring more cities and towns in the State and link it with Mysuru under UDAN but what is the need for a heli-tourism?” he questioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/heli-tourism-is-a-publicity-stunt-says-pratap-simha/article34307296.ece
13 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||State imposes minimal curbs to check COVID-19 resurgence||The government on Monday imposed minimal curbs on everyday life in a bid to flatten the rising curve of COVID-19 infections. The police would proactively impose the mask mandate and ensure social distancing in public spaces. The administration restricted indoor dining to less than half the seating capacity. Hotels should down shutters at 9 p.m. It was unclear whether the new time constraint applied to bars, which close at 11 p.m. Open-air and indoor gatherings should not number more than 200 and 100, attendees respectively. The government has warned against communal feasting and suggested that organisers supply guests with parcelled meals instead. Supermarkets should not hold retail events that tend to attract large crowds. Chief Secretary V.P. Joy chaired a meeting of top law enforcement, health, and revenue officials to take a call on the character, scope, and intensity of the likely curbs. Onus on States The Central government had ruled that a total lockdown was not the panacea for retarding the pace of infections. However, it had stressed that States had considerable latitude in imposing brakes on life, travel, retail, indoor dining, sporting, and social activities to slow down the resurgence. An official said the government had to walk a tight rope between reining in the flare-up and keeping the economy ticking. It had to convince people to shed their complacency and realise the pandemic had not run its course in Kerala. The election season had contributed to the summer surge in new cases. District administrations could issue further guidelines or impose higher restrictions as the ground situation demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-imposes-minimal-curbs-to-check-covid-19-resurgence/article34307184.ece
13 April 2021||NEW DELHI/ Kolkata,||EC slaps 24-hour ban on Mamata’s election campaign||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Monday banned West Bengal Chief Minister and All-India Trinamool Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee from campaigning for 24 hours till 8 p.m. on Tuesday after finding her allegations against the Central forces and appeal to minority voters to be violations of the model code of conduct (MCC). The EC had issued notices to Ms. Banerjee on April 7 and April 8 in this regard. In its April 7 notice, the EC cited Ms. Banerjee as asking minority voters not to divide their votes after being swayed by “the devil ( shaitaan ) person” who had taken money from the BJP. The EC said Ms. Banerjee had replied to the notice by saying that she had not sought to influence the voters on religious lines and had spoken in favour of religious harmony. The EC, however, said Ms. Banerjee had “selectively chosen parts of her speech” in her reply to the notice. In its April 8 notice, the EC cited a speech by Ms. Banerjee in Cooch Behar on April 7 asking women to “gherao” Central Armed Police Force personnel if they “create disturbances”. In her reply to the notice, the CM said she had called on voters to democratically protest when anyone, including CAPFs, tried to obstruct their right to vote. In its order on Monday, the EC said Ms. Banerjee raised allegations against the CAPFs in her reply as well. It said Ms. Banerjee had violated provisions of the MCC, the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the IPC. “To protest against the undemocratic and unconstitutional decision of the ECI, I will sit on dharna tomorrow at Gandhi Murti, Kolkata, from 12 noon,” Ms. Banerjee said on Monday. She was scheduled to address four rallies (two in Nadia and two in North 24 Parganas) on Tuesday, which was also the last day of campaign for the fifth phase of elections in the State. A section of political observers feel that the development may have implications on the outcome of the West Bengal Assembly polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ec-slaps-24-hour-ban-on-mamatas-election-campaign/article34307028.ece
13 April 2021||CHITTOOR,||Tension in Tirupati after stones hurled at Naidu||Tension prevailed in Tirupati on Monday night when some unidentified persons resorted to hurling stones at TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu while he was addressing the people from atop a campaign vehicle at Krishnapuram Tana junction. Two TDP activists, including a woman, received minor injuries in the incident. As part of his campaign for the Tirupati Lok Sabha bypoll, Mr. Naidu launched a brief walkathon that passed through Nethaji Road, before addressing the gathering at Krishnapuram Tana junction around 6.45 p.m. Unidentified people reportedly started hurling stone at Mr. Naidu first and then at the people gathered there. Mr. Naidu blamed the YSR Congress Party leaders for the incident as the TDP activists raised slogans against Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. An injured TDP activist was made to board the campaign vehicle and address the gathering. Mr. Naidu said, “Where are the police? I am under Z plus security category. If I have no security, what about you (common man)?” The TDP president said that he would protest till the culprits were arrested. Mr Naidu, TDP leaders K. Atchannaidu, Galla Jayadev, K. Rammohan Naidu, Tirupati Lok Sabha bypoll candidate Panabaka Lakshmi, alighted from the campaign vehicle and squatted on the junction. The police tried to convince Mr. Naidu, but in vain. The police and National Security Guards surrounded the protesting leaders. In view of the tense situation, Mr. Naidu and the party leaders then reached the office of the Tirupati Urban SP and staged a protest there. The shopkeepers downed their shutters anticipating troubles. Earlier in the day, Mr. Naidu said that people of Tirupati should decide whether they wanted ‘rowdyism’ or ‘development’. “If the people of Tirupati ignore their voting rights, it will put their safety in jeopardy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tension-in-tirupati-after-stones-hurled-at-naidu/article34307787.ece
13 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Do your dharma, ignore criticism, Jagan tells volunteers||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has literally saluted the village and ward volunteers for their commendable and selfless services in delivering the government’s welfare schemes at the people’s doorstep. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy honoured them with Seva Mitra, Seva Ratna and Seva Vajra awards on the eve of Ugadi, at the ‘Volunteerlaku Vandanam’ programme at Poranki on Monday. Mr. Jagan said, “I salute you heartily. You are rendering selfless service and effectively delivering the government’s welfare schemes right at the people’s doorstep.” The volunteers responded with loud applause to every word he uttered even as he announced that the felicitation to the volunteers would be an annual event hereafter. ‘Need recognition’ The volunteers were great soldiers with a great heart, who understood the people’s concerns. They were now being treated as a member of each family under his or her cluster. The blessings of the people alone would not suffice and they require recognition from the government, he said adding that the government was spending Rs. 228.74 crore in the form of awards. Mr. Jagan said, however, was quick to remind that the volunteers should recognise that they were doing service but not a job. They have to bear in mind that ‘service to humans is service to god’ and carry out their tasks in a disciplined manner. “The Opposition and yellow media are slinging mud on the volunteers’ system. Don’t feel bad about such baseless criticism. The volunteers are rendering selfless and immaculate services. Do your dharma and then leave it to god,” he said. Cash prizes of Rs. 10,000, Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 30,000 will be given to Seva Mitra (2,18,115 volunteers), Seva Ratna (4,000) and Seva Vajra (875) awardees respectively along with certificates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/do-your-dharma-ignore-criticism-jagan-tells-volunteers/article34307020.ece
13 April 2021||B. Madhu Gopal,||New taxi track at Vizag airport to be launched by month-end||The new parallel taxi track (N 5), constructed at the Visakhapatnam International Airport, is expected to be commissioned by the end of this month. The track will help in increasing the number of flight movements (landing and take off) by two an hour. Though the construction of N 5 taxi track was completed in November 2019, it could not be commissioned immediately as there were several procedural issues to be followed. These included safety inspections by various agencies and sending information on the new track to airports across the globe. The subsequent lockdown and restrictions on the movement of flights due to COVID-19 resulted in further delays. “The safety team from the Southern Region of Airports Authority of India (AAI) has given its clearance after inspection and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has given its security clearance, the Indian Navy has given operational clearance and other clearances have already been obtained. The parking provided to different aircraft at the airport has to be published and sent to all airports,” Airport Director M. Raja Kishore told The Hindu . “Once the information is published and sent to different airports, the aircraft can start using N 5 taxi track to reach the parking bays. The ‘L’ shaped N 5 track facilitates quick movement of the aircraft to the parking bays. The existing N 3 and N 4 are located perpendicular to the runway. On commissioning of N 5, the operational efficiency of the airport will improve considerably. The flight movements, which are 80 a day, at present can be increased up to 120 a day, depending on the demand,” he said. The AAI has spent Rs. 23 crore on construction of N 5 and six additional parking bays at the airport. “As many as 12 big aircraft can be parked at the airport now. In addition to this, four smaller aircraft can also be parked at the old terminal building. We are hoping that a few airline operators would plan late night arrivals and early morning departures from the city. IndiGo has shown interest, in the past, in utilising the night parking facility,” said the Airport Director. “The works undertaken as part of linear expansion of the terminal building are in advanced stage of completion and it is expected to be ready by June-end,” Mr. Raja Kishore added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/new-taxi-track-at-vizag-airport-to-be-launched-by-month-end/article34307728.ece
13 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Amid rising cases, Palaniswami places thrust on vaccination||With cases of COVID-19 rising in Tamil Nadu, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday sought to give a thrust to vaccination by appealing to all those eligible to get the jab without hesitation. He also called for increased and aggressive testing, with a target of at least 90,000 RT-PCR tests a day and results within 24 hours, contact tracing of at least 25 to 30 persons for every case, and increasing the number of fever camps. “All those eligible for vaccination should take the vaccines,” he said while chairing a meeting of medical and public health experts at the Secretariat to review the COVID-19 scenario. The meeting was held after getting approval from the Election Commission of India as the model code of conduct for the Assembly election is still in force. The State received over 54.85 lakh vials of vaccine from the Centre till April 11, and more than 37.8 lakh people had been vaccinated. All frontline workers, including government employees, should get the jab within two weeks, he said. Factories, offices, markets and apartments must contact the respective local bodies and district administrations for organising vaccination drives, he added. Apart from frontline workers (aged above 18) and personnel of the Health, Police, Revenue and local bodies/Rural Development Departments, members of the public aged above 45 must opt for vaccination, an official press release said. The government said it was essential that those working in cinema halls, vegetable and fruit markets, shops and commercial complexes opt for vaccination. The proprietors of such places must ensure strict compliance with the Standard Operating Procedures, it added. Urging the people not to step out of their houses unless it was absolutely essential, the government reiterated the need to wear face masks, maintain a distance of six feet and wash hands with soap at regular intervals to keep COVID-19 at bay. Mr. Palaniswami instructed officials to declare the areas where fresh cases were reported as micro-containment zones and establish COVID Care Centres or hospitals, depending on the need. Ventilators, high-flow nasal cannula, medicines and personal protective equipment were to be kept ready, he said. The Chief Minister said health, local body, police and revenue officials must penalise those violating the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act, 1939 (Rs. 17.92 crore had been collected from 16.37 lakh people till April 10). “All government and private hospitals should strictly follow the Standard Treatment Protocol issued to reduce deaths due to COVID-19,” he said. Citing deaths, including that of the Congress’s Srivilliputhur candidate, he said the people must learn from them and not take the situation lightly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/amid-rising-cases-palaniswami-places-thrust-on-vaccination/article34307078.ece

13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. bars meals on short haul flights||With COVID-19 cases on the rise across the country, the Ministry of Civil Aviation on Monday barred airlines from serving in-flight meals for flights shorter than two hours. On long flights, airlines must ensure that passengers seated on adjacent seats are served food in a staggered manner. The order comes into effect on April 15. “The passengers would be informed of the above practices before the start of the catering services by way of passenger announcements,” the order said. The government had imposed similar curbs last year. When domestic flights resumed on May 25, 2020 after a gap of two months, the government had restricted meal service but this was later lifted. In the recent past, the government has issued a slew of guidelines in order to ensure strict compliance with COVID-19 protocols and instructed airlines to place passengers who flout norms on the no-fly list, and asked airports to impose fines. The latest order comes at a time when air travel demand has registered a decline. An analysis of daily figures of passenger departures released by the Ministry of Civil Aviation shows a 28% decline over the past two weeks — dropping from 2.83 lakh departures on March 27 to 2.04 lakh on April 8. “Travel industry is seeing correction of 10%-15% due to the second wave of COVID as a few airports have made it mandatory to carry negative RT-PCR reports,” said Prashant Pitti, whole-time director of travel booking website EaseMyTrip.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-bars-meals-on-short-haul-flights/article34307079.ece

Mr. Sharma mentioned the petition, without explicitly referring to the details, before a Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde. The petition has made Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the first respondent, followed by Sushen Mohan Gupta, Defsys Solutions Private Ltd., Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd., the Centre and the CBI in that order. The petition urged the court to order the registration of an FIR under various offences such as cheating and criminal breach of trust and sections under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Official Secrets Act. It urged the court to issue “appropriate writ direction for cancelling/quashing agreement of September 23, 2016 for the purchase of 36 Rafale jet fighters from Dassault France for being hit by fraud, corruption and offence under the Official Secrets Act and to recover entire advanced money with penalty and to blacklist Dassault”. Mr. Sharma said the first four respondents should be prosecuted. “To prosecute them under the supervision of this court coupled with further direction to issue appropriate writ for quashing inter-government agreement of September 2016, which was the outcome of bribe/corruption,” the petition said. “The September 2016 deal was signed by the Defence Ministers of India and France and called ‘Rafale deal’,” the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-consider-listing-plea-on-rafale-deal-after-two-weeks/article34306943.ece
13 April 2021||Kolkata,||Trinamool insulting SC community: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who addressed multiple election rallies in West Bengal on Monday, accused the Trinamool Congress leadership of insulting the Scheduled Castes community in the State. Addressing a public meeting in Bardhaman town, Mr. Modi alleged that a senior Trinamool leader had called members of the Scheduled Castes “beggars”. “ Didi has neither condemned such remarks nor has she sought any apology,” he said. He added that no Trinamool leader could have made such a comment without the knowledge of the Chief Minister. Mr. Modi said, “Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s soul is hurt by the insult hurled at Scheduled Castes.” “You have committed biggest mistake, biggest sin, by insulting Dalits,” he said. Mr. Modi’s remarks were directed at Trinamool leader Sujata Khan Mondal. Later in the day, speaking in Kalyani, Mr. Modi raised the issue of his recent visit to Orakandi in Bangladesh, the birthplace of Harichand Thakur, the founder of the Matua sect. “When I visited Orakandi, a priest of Matua sect said that I was the first Prime Minister to visit the birthplace of Harichand Thakur,” Mr. Modi said, adding that the appeasement politics of Ms. Banerjee had hurt the interests of the Matuas and the Namasudras. The BJP was committed to granting citizenship and justice to the refugees, he said. Matuas are Hindu refugees from Bangladesh who are settled in the districts of North 24 Parganas and Nadia. ‘Innings over’ Reiterating the claims of a BJP sweep in the earlier phases of the election, Mr. Modi said the people of Nandigram had “clean bowled” Ms. Banerjee and that “her innings was over”. He added that the people of West Bengal had also understood the game plan of Ms. Banerjee that she wanted to hand over control to her nephew. “The people have asked the entire team of Didi to leave the field in the first four phases of polls,” Mr. Modi said. “The reality of West Bengal is that it is game over for Didi ,” Mr. Modi repeated. In a meeting in Barasat, Mr. Modi accused the Trinamool of corruption and “cut money”. He also said that votes for the BJP would ensure that each farmer get Rs. 18,000 which is pending under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and benefits under the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Elections in Bardhaman, Nadia and North 24 Parganas districts, where Prime Minister addressed public meetings on Monday, are scheduled in the fifth phase on April 17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-insulting-sc-community-pm/article34306966.ece

13 April 2021||Haridwar,||Amid surge, lakhs take dip in Ganga||Amid the rising coronavirus cases nationwide, a sea of saffron-clad seers and ash-smeared Nagas converged at Har Ki Pauri in Haridwar for a holy dip in the Ganga during the secondshahi snanof the Kumbh Mela on Monday. Led by their mahamandaleshwaras , the sadhus from different akhadas took out shobha yatras through the main thoroughfare of the pilgrimage city to gather at Brahma Kund, Har Ki Pauri for the sh ahi snan— or the royal bath — on Somvati Amavasya. Marching barefoot, the seers took a dip in the river as they were showered with flower petals from helicopters arranged by the Uttarakhand government. Few wear masks Masks were not worn by a large proportion and physical distancing appeared impossible in an event in which, according to the mela administration, over 17 lakh people had taken a dip in the river in the first few hours up to 10 a.m. Mela inspector general Sanjay Gunjyal said 100% compliance with COVID-19 norms was not possible with such a large crowd of seers converging on the ghats, but efforts were on to ensure that everyone adhered to them. While Har Ki Pauri, considered the holiest of the ghats, was reserved for the akhadas from 7 a.m. onwards, common people took the dip at the other ghats of the Ganga, revered by millions as a goddess.  Former King of Nepal Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah, on his maiden visit to Haridwar, was among the devotees who took a bath in the river. It was the second shahi snan during the ongoing Kumbh Mela, which has been limited to just one month due to COVID-19 spike. The last ‘royal bath’ was conducted on the occasion of Mahashivratri on March 11.    More than 20,000 police and para military personnel kept an eye over the mela area spread over 600 hectares.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-surge-lakhs-take-dip-in-ganga/article34306977.ece
13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Give emergency nod to all vaccine candidates: Sonia||Congress president Sonia Gandhi urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to allow emergency approval to all vaccine candidates and open vaccinations to people on the basis of “need and exposure instead of age”. Ms. Gandhi, who wrote the letter after interacting with Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States last week, flagged concerns regarding the availability of the vaccines with State governments. At a separate press conference, the Congress said at least 30 crore of India’s population had co-morbidities like hypertension, diabetes and other lifestyle diseases, and asked the Modi government to give a timeline by when these vulnerable groups would be vaccinated. Party spokesperson Ajoy Kumar said though Mr. Modi and his Ministers were expected to set up a ‘war room’ to tackle the second wave of COVID, “they were busy in the battle for Bengal”. On a day when Centre approved Russian vaccine, Sputinik, the Congress launched an online campaign for “vaccination for all”. “While it will be necessary on the one hand to substantially ramp up our domestic production capacity, it will also be prudent to allow emergency use authorisation of all the vaccine candidates that have the required clearances, without any further delay. Accordingly, with enhanced availability, categories eligible for vaccination should be expanded on the basis of need and exposure rather than just age,” Ms. Gandhi wrote to the Prime Minister. As States talked about travel restrictions, closures and lockdowns, Ms. Gandhi appealed to Mr. Modi to consider putting in place a scheme for guaranteed minimum monthly income of Rs. 6,000 for every eligible family.  Rahul’s call Earlier in the day, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “The country needs vaccines against coronavirus. You also raise your voice for this — everyone has the right to have a safe life. Speak up for vaccination for all”. Sharing a video, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted, “Because the vaccine is for everyone. Because the government should pay more attention to the public than organising events. Because everyone has the right to know where the PM Care funds are being spent. Because instead of exporting the vaccine, the government should focus on vaccinating every citizen”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/give-emergency-nod-to-all-vaccine-candidates-sonia/article34306979.ece
13 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘Northeast citizens faced racial discrimination amid pandemic’||A study commissioned by the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) on racial discrimination and hate crimes against people from the northeastern States found that the “northeast India seamlessly fits [an] Indian’s imagination of a Chinese person”. The study found that 78% of the people from the region who were interviewed believed that physical appearance was the most important reason for prejudice against them. The study said amid the COVID-19 outbreak last year, people from the region “faced an increased number of acts of hate and prejudices against them”. A series of attacks were reported in various parts of the country, where people from the region were “harassed, abused, and traumatised” and were disparagingly called ‘Coronavirus’, the study said.  The Hindu accessed the findings of the unpublished report. The Centre for Criminology and Victimology at the National Law University (NLU), Delhi, conducted the study under the aegis of the ICSSR, Delhi, on the prevalence of hate crimes against the people of the region in six metropolitan cities — Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Around 1,200 people, mostly women from Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura were interviewed for the research. The study’s associate is Dr. Garima Paul of the NLU. ‘Deep-rooted prejudice’ G.S. Bajpai, chairperson of the Centre, said the majority of those interviewed faced discrimination when it came to renting accommodation, visiting a restaurant and even while finding transportation. “Most of them faced problems while renting a house, even in restaurants they faced issues forcing them to eat mostly in eateries run by people from their communities,” Prof. Bajpai said. “These issues cannot be solved by policing alone,” he added. The study quoted a 2020 report from the Right and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) that found a significant upsurge in acts of racial discrimination against people from the region. It mentioned 22 reported cases of racial discrimination or hate crimes between February and March 25, 2020. “The highest number of incidents were reported from Mumbai (44.7%). Interestingly, 78% of the northeast people believed that physical appearance was the most important reason for prejudice against them. It appears as if the northeast India seamlessly fits Indian’s imagination of a Chinese person,” the report said. Offensive and abusive language were reported to be most common across all the six cities. Mumbai recorded the highest offensive and abusive language related crime (74%), followed by Chennai (72%), Pune (67.3%), Delhi (64%), Hyderabad (48.7%) and Bengaluru (43.3%). More than 60% of the persons who were interviewed said their studies and work were seriously hampered by such experiences. “The most pervasive reasons behind hate crime incidents against the northeastern people as per our data analysis were public attitude and insensitivity (44.5%). The incidence of non-reporting of the incidents was as high as 32.3%. As many as 34% of persons faced a common issue of refusal to file FIR by the police. The fear of hate crime was experienced to be particularly high in Chennai (74%),” the study said. It said the M.P. Bezbaruah Committee in 2014 recommended amendments to the IPC by creating new offences under Section 153C and 509A to to deal with comments, gestures and acts intended to insult a member of a particular racial group. “It also suggested to make such offences as ‘gender-neutral’, ‘cognizable’ and ‘non-bailable’ with imprisonment extendable up to three years or five years with fine, respectively. The Supreme Court in Karma Dorji & Others vs Union of India & Others (2014) made several recommendations for the prevention and monitoring of racial hatred and violence. Though, not much seems to have been done in this regard,” said the study. Earlier in December 2020, a report by the Nagaland government said the stranded State residents were subjected to “racism and harassment” in the wake of the March 24, 2020 nationwide lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/northeast-citizens-faced-bias-amid-pandemic/article34307032.ece

13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Dalit groups, farm unions clash over Ambedkar event||Tensions are brewing between some Dalit groups and protesting farm unions. The latest trigger is the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s plans to block Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s from unveiling a statue of B.R. Ambedkar on his birth anniversary on April 14. On Monday, the All India Ambedkar Mahasabha (AIAM) said that “no one will be allowed to prevent celebration of Ambedkar Jayanti”. The AIAM is a platform of Dalit groups who agitated against the amendment to the SC/ST Atrocities Act in 2018. “It has come to our knowledge that miscreant elements plan to stall Ambedkar Jayanti Program (like Republic Day), in the name of Kisan Andolan and thereby pitting Kisans against the Dalits. We sincerely request the Kisan leaders to keep an eye on such miscreants and urge them to join the Ambedkar Jayanti celebrations across the country,” said AIAM chairman Ashok Bharti, in a statement on Monday. On its part, the SKM reiterated the solidarity of farmers and Dalits, and emphasised that they are “not opposing the unveiling of the statue of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. Except for the Chief Minister, if anyone else unveils this statue, the farmers have no objection.” “Those who mocked the Constitution have no right to unveil the statue of Baba Saheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar,” said Rakesh Tikait, who heads a major faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dalit-groups-farm-unions-clash-over-ambedkar-event/article34306955.ece
13 April 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata seeks ban on Ghosh for Sitalkuchi remark||A war of words over the Sitalkuchi firing continued to rage on Monday. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee assured the voters that she would not spare those responsible for the firing and urged the Election Commission of India to ban State BJP president Dilip Ghosh. Mr. Ghosh had warned on Sunday of more “Siltakuchi-like incidents” if the “bad boys of Trinamool Congress” did not abide by the law. “State BJP president is saying Central forces should open fire... Do they have anything in their heads? Those who speak about opening fire should be banned,” the Chief Minister said at a public meeting on Monday. Trinamool leader Abhishek Banerjee also played a recording of Mr. Ghosh’s speech at a rally in north Bengal, and said several BJP leaders had made statements that the forces should shoot to kill. Five persons died in two separate incidents of firing at Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar district on April 10 when polling was under way at the Assembly constituency. At a public meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi blamed Ms. Banerjee for the violence which led to “mothers losing their sons” in Cooch Behar. “The entire thing was planned by Home Minister Amit Shah and the Prime Minister was aware of the situation,” Ms. Banerjee retorted. Former State BJP president Rahul Sinha, who is contesting the polls from Habra in North 24 Parganas, said there was “no big issue if eight instead of four people were killed and those killed were terrorists trying to disrupt the polling process”. “Will you vote for those firing upon the people or for those working for the people,” Ms. Banerjee asked at another rally, urging the people to reply to the bullets with ballot. The Trinamool also lodged a formal complaint with the office of the Chief Electoral Officer against the remarks made by Mr. Ghosh. A delegation comprising senior leaders of the Samyukta Morcha also visited the office of the Chief Electoral Officer and raised concerns about the deaths at Sitalkuchi. The delegation led by Left Front chairperson Biman Bose also demanded action against Mr. Ghosh. Mr. Bose expressed surprise that there was no video evidence of the security forces being attacked, or their weapons being snatched, as claimed by the Election Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-seeks-ban-on-ghosh-for-sitalkuchi-remark/article34306964.ece
13 April 2021||Kalimpong/Dhupguri,||NRC will have no impact on Gurkhas, says Amit Shah||Seeking to allay fears created among the people of the hills by the “lies” of the Trinamool Congress, Union Home Minister Amit Shah asserted on Monday that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) will have no impact on the Gurkhas. Mr. Shah, during an address after a roadshow in Kalimpong, said as long as the Narendra Modi-led BJP government was there at the Centre, no Gurkha would be harmed. “NRC has not yet been implemented, but whenever it is done, not a single Gurkha will be asked to leave,” he said. “The Trinamool Congress is lying about the possible fallout of NRC on the Gurkhas in order to create fear among them,” he said. Noting that Darjeeling and Kalimpong had suffered atrocities for long, Mr. Shah claimed that in 1986, more than 1,200 Gurkhas had lost their lives, but they did not get justice. The Home Minister also alleged that the Mamata Banerjee government had also been responsible for the death of many Gurkhas in recent times. “We will form an SIT and send those responsible for the wrongdoings behind bars,” Mr. Shah said amid chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Jai Gurkha’. Darjeeling and its adjoining areas were rocked by movements and protests, which at times turned violent, in favour of a separate Gorkhaland in 1986 and in 2017. Later, addressing a rally in the Dhupguri Assembly constituency, Mr. Shah declared that the BJP was ahead in 92 of the 135 seats that went to the polls in the first four phases of the West Bengal Assembly election. He also asked people to give a grand farewell to Ms. Banerjee by ensuring that the saffron party wins over 200 seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nrc-will-have-no-impact-on-gurkhas-says-amit-shah/article34306970.ece

13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC dismisses plea to convert INS Viraat into a museum||The dismantling of INS Viraat , the Navy’s decommissioned aircraft carrier, will continue with the Supreme Court refusing to intervene on behalf of a private firm which wanted to turn the vessel into a maritime museum-cum-adventure centre. “Somebody has already paid the money for the ship. The ship has been sold to the respondent (a ship-breaker called Shree Ram Group in Gujarat),” Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde addressed the petitioner, Envitech Marine Consultants Private Limited, represented by Vishnukant Sharma and Rupali Vishnukant Sharma. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, for Shree Ram Group, said the Bombay High Court had allowed Envitech to approach the Ministry of Defence with their proposal. But the government had maintained a non-committal tone in the High Court and asked Envitech to approach the Shree Ram Group with a proposal to re-purchase the ship. “The HC had allowed you to make a representation and the government has refused. You have not challenged the rejection,” Chief Justice Bobde told Ms. Sharma, dismissing the petition. On February 10, the court had ordered a stay on the process of dismantling the ship at an Alang yard in Gujarat. The carrier was bought by Shree Ram Group in a bid. The 67-year-old iconic warship was towed to the breaking yard after over a three-decade service in the Indian Navy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-dismisses-plea-to-convert-ins-viraat-into-a-museum/article34306950.ece

13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||French Foreign Affairs Minister arriving today||The French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean-Yves Le Drian, will visit India from April 13 to 15, the Embassy of France announced on Monday. Mr. Le Drian will hold talks with his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, and participate in the Raisina Dialogue. The ministerial talks are expected to focus on “all aspects of the bilateral strategic partnership” covering joint ventures in the Indo-Pacific and cooperation at the UN Security Council where India has completed the first three months of its stint as a non-permanent member. Cautious approach Despite close strategic partnership between the two sides, India in recent weeks has adopted a cautious approach at the UNSC. India has participated in the “Arria-formula” meetings, the consultation among the 15 members of the UNSC over conflict zones and other contentious issues, while expressing reservations about the format of the meeting. On March 8, India, Russia and China were the only three countries that did not sponsor the meeting on “women, peace and security”. The meeting was sponsored by other 12 members including France. Two similar meetings on the issue of Crimea held on March 12 and 17 also tested India’s multilateral diplomacy as the issue was sensitive from the Russian point of view. India’s cautious position comes from the understanding that the “Arria-formula” meetings have been “misused” in the past by the biggest global players. The visit comes just over a week after a three-part investigative series by French media outlet, Mediapart revealed, based on French anti-corruption agency audit, how French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation had paid €1 million to an Indian company owned by a middleman, Sushen Gupta, in connection with the €7.87 bn Rafale deal between India and France in 2016. Mr. Gupta is already being investigated for another defence deal in India. It said French anti-corruption authorities made no serious attempts to investigate the angle of corruption and favouritism surrounding the Rafale deal. The articles also detailed how Mr. Gupta obtained crucial documents on the Indian negotiating team involved in the Rafale deal and supplied them to Dassault Aviation. Deliveries of the Rafale jets are currently under way and the Indian Air Force has so far received 14 of the 36 jets. Mr. Le Drian and Mr. Jaishankar will be joined by Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne at the Raisina Dialogue which has emerged as the biggest diplomatic lecture series of India. He will also hold talks with Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar during his stay here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/french-foreign-affairs-minister-arriving-today/article34306948.ece

13 April 2021||Pune,||‘Maharashtra moving to lockdown tyranny’||Criticising the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for allegedly mismanaging the COVID-19 situation in Maharashtra, former Chief Minister and Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said the State was moving from a democracy to “lockdown tyranny”. At a campaign rally for the BJP candidate in the Pandharpur-Mangalwedha Assembly bypoll, he said the MVA’s ineffectual handling of the situation and its ham-fisted actions had brought the State to its present crisis. “Today, Maharashtra has the highest number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities in the country. This is the situation of despair that this government has plunged Maharashtra into,” he said. He accused the government of playing an ‘on-off game’ of imposing lockdowns and unlocking them in a bid to keep the rapidly spreading virus at bay. The State is shifting from lokshahi (democracy) to lock shahi (tyranny of the lockdown), Mr. Fadnavis said. “Yes, a lockdown is needed to break the virus chain. But the Maharashtra government does not realise that those who lose their livelihoods ought to be given at least some relief from the government coffers. Neighbouring States like Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have helped the common man and farmers during the pandemic period by waiving electricity bills and granting concessions,” Mr. Fadnavis said, alleging that the Thackeray government was worse than the moneylenders. He stated that during the pandemic period last year, the State government not only did not provide financial assistance to farmers but collected power bills instead of waiving them off. The BJP has been demanding that the State government give a relief package of Rs. 5,000 per person for workers and labourers in Maharashtra’s unorganised sector in the event a lockdown is finally declared. With the State reporting average daily spikes of 55,000 cases and 300 deaths each day, Mr. Thackeray and other senior Ministers like Health Minister Rajesh Tope have hinted at an imminent lockdown as the only solution to rein in the contagion. To this end, the Chief Minister, since last week has been holding a series of meetings, including at least two all-party discussions in which Mr. Fadnavis among others had participated. Following the tightening of norms and the weekend lockdown, representatives of a number of traders’ associations and smaller businesses had conferred with Mr. Fadnavis, complaining that the curbs had acutely hit their business. On Sunday, Mr. Thackeray held a meeting with the State task force on COVID-19, many of whom have recommended at least a two-week lockdown in wake of the nearly four-fold rise in cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-moving-to-lockdown-tyranny/article34306980.ece

RDIF to produce shots It adds that the vaccine supplies for the global market will be produced by the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) international partners in India, Brazil, China, South Korea and other countries. While Dr. Reddy’s will market the vaccine in India, RDIF has tied up with other Indian companies — Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech — to produce 850 million doses of Sputnik V in the country every year. “RDIF jointly with partners and manufacturers is ramping up the production of Sputnik V. The cost of one dose of the vaccine for international markets is less than $10 (Sputnik V is a two dose vaccine). The (freeze-dried form) of the vaccine can be stored at a temperature of +2 to +8 degrees Celsius, which allows for easy distribution worldwide, including hard-to-reach regions,” noted the website.

In the recent past, the government has issued a slew of guidelines in order to ensure strict compliance with COVID-19 protocols and instructed airlines to place passengers who flout norms on the no-fly list, and asked airports to impose fines. The latest order comes at a time when air travel demand has registered a decline. An analysis of daily figures of passenger departures released by the Ministry of Civil Aviation shows a 28% decline over the past two weeks — dropping from 2.83 lakh departures on March 27 to 2.04 lakh on April 8. “Travel industry is seeing correction of 10%-15% due to the second wave of COVID as a few airports have made it mandatory to carry negative RT-PCR reports,” said Prashant Pitti, whole-time director of travel booking website EaseMyTrip.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-bars-meals-on-short-haul-flights/article34307480.ece
13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||EC slaps 24-hour ban on Mamata Banerjee||In its April 8 notice, the EC cited a speech by Ms. Banerjee in Cooch Behar on April 7 asking women to “gherao” Central Armed Police Force personnel if they “create disturbances”. In her reply to the notice, the Chief Minister said she had called on voters to democratically protest when anyone, including CAPFs, tried to obstruct their right to vote. “Gherao is one of the democratic ways of registering public protest and accepted and there is no reason why gherao should be considered as illegal...I have only emphasised that voters should exercise their franchise in a free and fair manner and that intimidation of the electorate, by any external force whatsoever (including CAPF), will not be tolerated,” she said in her reply. However, the EC again said Ms. Banerjee had left out “key parts of her speech, perhaps due to selective amnesia”. In its order on Monday, the EC said Ms. Banerjee had raised allegations against CAPFs in her reply as well. The EC said it had considered the matter carefully and was of the view that Ms. Banerjee had violated provisions of the MCC, the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and the Indian Penal Code by making “highly insinuating and provocative remarks laden with serious potential of breakdown of law & order and thereby adversely affecting the election process”. Condemning the statements, the EC warned the Chief Minister to stop using such statements in public while the MCC is in force and banned her from campaigning for 24 hours from 8pm on Monday. The EC’s ban comes in the middle of polling in the eight-phase West Bengal elections, with phase five on April 17. On dharna Responding to the EC ban, Ms. Banerjee said she will sit on dharna in protest against the order. “To protest against the undemocratic and unconstitutional decision of the Election Commission of India, I will sit on dharna tomorrow at Gandhi Murti, Kolkata from 12 noon,” Ms. Banerjee said on Monday. The Chief Minister was scheduled to address four rallies (two in Nadia and two in North 24 Parganas) on Tuesday, which was also the last day of campaign for the fifth phase of elections in the State. 45 Assembly seats will go to polls on the fifth phase of polling on April 17. Reacting sharply to the development senior Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’ Brien said that April 12 was a “BLACK DAY in our democracy”. “EC stands for Extremely Compromised,” he said. A section of political observers feel that the development may have implications on the outcome of the West Bengal Assembly polls. Four phases of elections on 159 Assembly seats are yet to be held in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ec-slaps-24-hour-ban-on-mamata-banerjee/article34306957.ece

Retail inflation through 2020-21 was the highest in the last seven years at 6.2%, said Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Research and Ratings. “Rising retail inflation and falling wage growth is a double whammy for consumption demand, which even otherwise is under pressure.” Higher fuel prices due to a combination of higher crude prices and elevated excise duties pushed transport and communication inflation to 12.5%, the highest since the current inflation index series began, Mr. Pant said. Among services, household goods and services inflation hit a 10-month high while recreation and amusement services touched a 9-month high. While some relief is expected in April’s inflation numbers, as base effects from last year’s national lockdown kick in, the uptick in inflation is expected to resume thereafter, Ms. Nayar reckoned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sensex-and-rupee-slip-on-fear-of-pandemic/article34307481.ece

During an online hearing, the Bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath expressed displeasure with “certain policies” of the State government regarding the tackling of the pandemic amid an increase in cases and deaths and told Advocate General Kamal Trivedi that corrections were required. “We are in the third phase. It is so steep and galloping that the government never envisioned it. If you apply for a test, you will get a report after several days. It takes around seven days to get the RT-PCR report,” Chief Justice Vikram Nath remarked. In fact, the Chief Justice himself initiated the fresh suo motu petition on Sunday. The court was particularly concerned about the shortage of Remdesivir injections and long queues of kin of patients outside the hospitals to procure injection vials. The Advocate-General briefed the court about the steps taken by the government while suggesting that media reports were “overhyping” the situation. “After hearing you, we are mesmerised and feel that we have unnecessarily taken cognisance, but the situation is quite grim,” the Bench said. Following the court’s tough stand, the government late on Monday evening announced a range of measures to fight the pandemic. These include restricting staff attendance to 50% at offices and commercial establishments. Only 50 persons would be allowed at marriages.

A Bench led by Justice Rohinton Nariman declared the writ petition as “absolutely frivolous”. The court imposed Rs. 50,000 as costs on Mr. Rizwi. He has to pay the amount to the legal aid services authorities. “Do you really want to argue the petition,” Justice Nariman asked the lawyer. The latter sought “two minutes” to present his case.

In his petition, Mr. Rizwi said these verses were employed to justify acts of terror on “non-believers” and civilians. “On account of the versus of Holy Koran (more particularly described in the writ petition), the religion of Islam is drifting away from its basic tenets with a fast pace and nowadays is identified with violent behaviour, militancy, fundamentalism, extremism and terrorism,” the petition had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-dismisses-plea-to-scrap-26-verses-from-the-koran/article34306951.ece

He also called for increased and aggressive testing, with a target of at least 90,000 RT-PCR tests a day and results within 24 hours, contact tracing of at least 25 to 30 persons for every case, and increasing the number of fever camps. “All those eligible for vaccination should take the vaccines,” he said while chairing a meeting of medical and public health experts at the Secretariat to review the COVID-19 scenario. The meeting was held after approval from the Election Commission of India as the model code of conduct for election is still in force. The State received over 54.85 lakh vials of vaccine from the Centre till April 11, and more than 37.8 lakh people had been vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tamil-nadu-cm-places-thrust-on-vaccination/article34307684.ece
13 April 2021||B. Tilak ChandarMadurai,TAMIL NADU||HC quashes criminal proceedings against three DMK functionaries||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has quashed criminal proceedings against three DMK functionaries pending before trial courts in Dindigul and Virudhunagar districts. The DMK members had made remarks on the personal life of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. The court was hearing separate petitions filed by Aarur Senthamilan who sought to quash the proceedings pending before Dindigul court and that of Kuttus Gurusamy and Illa Pugalenthi who sought to quash the proceedings pending before the Srivilliputtur court in Virudhunagar district. In both the cases, the Public Prosecutor filed a private complaint against the petitioners and sanction for prosecution was obtained as per Section 199 (4) CrPC. The petitioners argued that the public prosecutor was not competent to file the private complaint on behalf of the Chief Minister. The entire speech was with regard to the personal life of the former Chief Minister and not with the reference to the discharge of any public function. As per Section 199 (2) CrPC, the public prosecutor can file a complaint for defamation only if it was in connection with the discharge of duties of a public servant in connection with the affairs of the State. The complaint was filed out of political vendetta, they said. Justice G. Ilangovan observed that the text of the speeches showed that it was not in good taste. The speeches were made in connection with the private life of, and not in connection with the discharge of duties in the capacity of Chief Minister. Relying on Supreme Court and Madras High Court judgements, the judge observed that if at all a private complaint was to be filed, it ought to have been filed only by the affected party - the former Chief Minister. The office of the Public Prosecutor cannot be engaged for this purpose, the judge said and quashed the trial court proceedings against the DMK functionaries.  A private complaint ought to be filed only by the affected party and not the PP Madras HC Judge||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-quashes-criminal-proceedings-against-three-dmk-functionaries/article34307089.ece
13 April 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||RTC employees take to streets, threaten to ‘beg’ on Ugadi||The striking Road Transport Corporation (RTC) employees took to the streets on Monday in many cities, with their family members, including small children in several cases, demanding implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission. The striking workers have announced that they will symbolically “beg on the streets” on Ugadi festival on Tuesday as the government had “unfairly” not paid their March salaries.  Protesting employees and family members were taken into custody in several districts, including Bengaluru, for violating COVID-19 protocols that have explicitly banned all protests. While a KSRTC employee attempted suicide in Hassan by consuming poison, family members of striking workers assaulted and forcefully made drivers making trips alight buses in three instances, for which cases have been booked. Nine KSRTC buses were stoned in Hassan, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, and Kolar districts on Monday. The government continued to take punitive measures. As announced on Sunday, RTCs released the March salary to only 10,430 of the nearly 1.3 lakh workforce, who did not go on strike, withholding pay of striking workers. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, speaking at Basavakalyan where he has been campaigning for the bypoll, said the government would take more stringent measures and would not pay salaries to employees who were absent from duty. “It is both morally and legally wrong to withhold salaries for days we have worked. The government is being vindictive. They are dismissing trainees and probationers, even as they have now begun targeting senior employees over the age of 50,” rued R. Chandrashekhar, president, KSRTC Employees’ League. “The BJP that claims to speak for the Hindu cause, is punishing lakhs of households by not paying salaries due to them on the eve of Ugadi. So, our employees and their families will beg on the streets on Tuesday to symbolically state this is what RTC employees have been reduced to,” Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, honorary president of the league, said. Pay salaries: DKS On the eve of Ugadi, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar appealed to the State government to pay March salary to all employees of road transport corporations. The government withheld the salary to those who have not reported to work. “The government should at least have the courtesy to hold a meeting with striking employees’ leaders today or tomorrow to resolve the issue amicably,” Mr. Shivakumar said. Citing COVID-19 norms, the government was curtailing the rights of protesting employees by detaining them. “Why did the government allow holding political rallies for byelections then?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rtc-employees-take-to-streets-threaten-to-beg-on-ugadi/article34306988.ece
13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Half of semi-wholesale shops in Koyambedu allowed to work||As a precautionary measure to control the spread of COVID-19 and to avoid crowding, the Koyambedu Market Management Committee has introduced a system wherein about 50% of the semi-wholesale and retail shops will be allowed to function on a rotational basis. Half the 1,800 vegetable and fruit retail outlets in the market have been allowed to operate on alternate days on an odd-even basis as per their shop number. Officials of the management committee said this was being implemented as a temporary solution to reduce the impact of the new COVID-19 restrictions on traders and also to prevent crowding. However, discussions are on to implement permanent measures. Announcements about the new arrangements and COVID-19 precautions are being made constantly in the market. Semi-wholesalers said they sourced 30% less produce from neighbouring districts as only half the shops would operate. As the market reopened on Monday after a holiday, there was demand for vegetables, and some were priced higher by Rs. 5 to Rs. 10 a kg. Tomatoes were among the few vegetables that were cheap. Members of the Koyambedu Semi-wholesale Traders’ Welfare Association noted that this arrangement would be more agreeable for business, compared with a complete shutdown. Some of them had informed their regular customers to approach shops that were open on a particular day and not lose out on business. Meanwhile, the Federation of All Associations of the KWMC Periyar Vegetable Market have submitted representations to the Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary and the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, requesting the authorities to keep the market open as it would affect farmers and traders attached to the 3,500 shops and 40,000 labourers. Some of their demands include that decisions pertaining to the market must be taken in consultation with the traders, checking of vehicles arriving from other States, an increased presence of police personnel to regulate traffic, allowing vaccination for those aged above 18 years and allotment of more parking space around the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/half-of-semi-wholesale-shops-in-koyambedu-allowed-to-work/article34307532.ece

13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Indian Bank to alert on dues on daily basis from June||From June, Indian Bank will send alerts daily to customers reminding them to pay their overdue amount. Till now, such alerts were sent once in a month. “As per change in the bank’s policy, loan accounts will be flagged as NPA on a daily basis instead of month-end flagging from June 2021. Pay your dues on or before the due date to avoid classification as overdue borrower (SMA/NPA) /penalties/negative credit score. Contact your home branch,” Indian Bank said in a recent notification to customers. SMA is a special mention account and it gets triggered if an equated monthly instalment has not been paid for the month. When such payments are not made for 90 days, the account becomes an non-performing asset (NPA). A senior official from Indian Bank said the notification had been issued based on the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) guidelines. He pointed out that alerts would henceforth be sent on a daily basis when payment dates were missed, just like mobile companies do and the bank had sent an early notification on this so that the customers were prepared and it did not come as a surprise. In a notification on September 14, 2020, the RBI instructed banks to automate their income recognition, asset classification and provisioning processes. System upgradation To ensure the completeness and integrity of the automated asset classification, provisioning calculation and income recognition processes, banks were advised to put in place or upgrade their systems to conform to the guidelines by June 30, 2021, the notification said. All borrower accounts, including temporary overdrafts, irrespective of size, sector or types of limits, would be covered in the automated IT-based system for asset classification, upgrade, and provisioning processes. Banks’ investments will also be covered under the system, the RBI said. It pointed out that the system-based asset classification would be an ongoing exercise for both downgrade and upgrade of accounts, and banks should ensure that the asset classification status was updated as part of the day-end process. Consumer activist T. Sadagopan said while such alerts were welcome, what was required was detailed instructions to customers on how such automated systems would work.  When such payments are not made for 90 days, the account becomes a non-performing asset||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/indian-bank-to-alert-on-dues-on-daily-basis-from-june/article34307084.ece
13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cases more than doubled in 18 districts||Eighteen of the 37 districts in Tamil Nadu witnessed an increase of over 100% in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the past week, when compared with the preceding one. Of the 18 districts, Thoothukudi saw a growth of 336% — the highest in the State. While 132 cases were reported there from March 30 to April 5, it more than quadrupled to 576 cases last week. Dharmapuri was another district that saw a similar growth. The new cases increased from 73 to 316. With cases increasing at a steeper rate in the last week than the rate witnessed during a similar phase during the first wave of COVID-19 cases in Tamil Nadu, analysis shows that cases are also becoming geographically widespread. As the map accompanying this article shows, only a few districts in the central region and Ramanathapuram district reported less than 200 cases in the past week. However, even in some of these districts, the rate of increase appeared to be high. In the week from March 30 to April 5, only eight districts reported over 500 cases. Last week, their number increased to 18. Barring Perambalur, which reported 26 cases, all other districts reported cases in three digits this past week. The districts with major cities expectedly had more cases. In the week preceding the last one, apart from Chennai, Chengalpattu and Coimbatore, only Tiruvallur reported more than 1,000 cases. Last week, Tiruchi, Madurai, Kancheepuram, and Tiruppur joined the list. While Chennai continued to report the highest number of cases (12,107 last week), Coimbatore and Chengalpattu reported more than 3,000 cases in the past week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cases-more-than-doubled-in-18-districts/article34307116.ece

Alagiri said. Mr. Alagiri said Andhra Pradesh had increased the financial assistance to fishermen from Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 10,000 during the ban period. In a statement, Mr. Alagiri said the current ban between April and June was unscientific and the months between October and December coincing with the northeast monsoon on the east coast was ideal for such a ban. He said the fishing ban this year must be reduced to 45 days from 61 days considering the fact that fishermen could not venture into the sea for nearly 135 days last year on account of COVID -19 restrictions. “Due to the COVID-19 lockdown last year, fishermen could not go to sea. Following that, due to the fishing ban, they could not go fishing again. They were unable to go to sea for their livelihood last year, for nearly 135 days. Taking this into account, the current ban should be reduced to 45 days,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alagiri-moots-several-proposals-to-give-relief-to-fishermen/article34307086.ece
13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Yet another cruel year for folk artistes in Tamil Nadu||Hopes of folk artistes in the southern districts of good earnings during summer festivals ( kodai ) in temples have been shattered again this year after the State government announced a ban on festivals in view of the spike in COVID-19 cases. They lost their livelihood in 2020 and are not sure how to overcome difficulties this season. “I received advance to perform in several temples. Now, one by one all of them have cancelled. We do not know how to make a living,” said nagaswaram player and naiyandi melam artiste Panakudi Siva. Unlike others, folk artistes depend on summer festivals that take place during March, April, May and the first week of June, corresponding with the Tamil months of Panguni , Chithirai and Vaikasi , to make a living. Since festivals last year were cancelled, most artistes were asked to perform this year at the same temples. “We are losing opportunities this year too. I had concerts almost till the end of June because many temples were organising festivals but now they may not take place,” said Mr. Siva. “The festival cannot be extended beyond these months because of the monsoon,” he added. On Monday, folk artistes in Kanniyakumari, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar districts submitted a memorandum to Collectors, requesting them to make alternative arrangements for their livelihood. Naiyandimelam , kaniyaan koothu , karagam and thappu artistes came with their instruments to submit the memorandum.  “The district administration should allow temple festivals to be held in a low-key manner. We are ready to adhere to safety measures,” kaniyaan koothu artiste V. Muthuperumal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/yet-another-cruel-year-for-folk-artistes-in-tamil-nadu/article34307114.ece
13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccine fest on; workplace interventions taken up||With the COVID-19 vaccination festival or ‘Tika Utsav’, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, under way across the State, the Health Department is planning to intensify vaccination efforts from April 14. Among the initiatives being carried out are workplace interventions for employees aged above 45. Officials of the Health Department said a camp held at a hospital in Avadi for industrial workers had received good response. “We spoke with the Industries Secretary, who has assigned officials of the District Industries Centre to coordinate with us. There is no shortage of vaccines, and we are going by three to five days’ stock availability. The Central government will also continue to supply the vaccines,” an official said. In Madurai district, the vaccination festival was organised by the Public Health Department. An official said those aged above 45 were encouraged to get vaccinated at primary health centres and government hospitals. Special camps were organised at various workplaces to vaccinate those eligible. A total of 39 employees of Indian Oil Corporation Limited and 127 members of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board were vaccinated. Amma Unavagam workers aged above 45 were also vaccinated, he added. Tiruchi Collector S. Divyadharshini, who held a meeting with the heads of various departments on Monday, instructed them to ensure that all government officials and employees above 45 years of age get vaccinated during the three-day vaccine festival, beginning on Tuesday. A senior official of the Health Department said elaborate arrangements had been made at government hospitals in the district to accelerate the vaccination drive during the festival. Similarly, private hospitals had also been asked to set up special counters to vaccinate those above 45 years of age. The Coimbatore Corporation on Monday launched a mobile vaccination drive by deploying vehicles to inoculate people at their workplaces or houses. Launching the drive at the Corporation head office in Town Hall, Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian said the civic body’s target was to vaccinate at least 10,000 people a day. This was in addition to the 150-200 people being vaccinated at the urban primary health centres. The Corporation had deployed three vehicles each in the North and East zones and two each in the West, South and Central zones, sources said. On Monday, a total of 1,63,935 people — 88,210 aged 45 to 59 with co-morbidities, 62,106 senior citizens, 9,526 frontline workers and 4,093 healthcare workers — got vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccine-fest-on-workplace-interventions-taken-up/article34307123.ece
13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||3-member convener panel constituted for Anna University||A three-member convener committee has been constituted to oversee day-to-day affairs of Anna University in the absence of a Vice-Chancellor. V-C M.K. Surappa’s tenure ended on April 11. It is learnt that Mr. Surappa visited the Governor-Chancellor on Monday and thanked him for the opportunity to serve the institution. After this, Mr. Surappa convened a virtual syndicate meeting, in which the members of the convener committee were appointed. The committee comprises Higher Education Secretary Apoorva, who will be the convener, Additional Chief Secretary to the Government Hans Raj Verma, who holds full additional charge of the Information and Technology Department, and syndicate member and Chairperson of the Information and Communication Engineering Department at the University, Ranjani Parthasarathi. The committee will conduct the affairs of the University until the next V-C assumes charge. Violation of resolution The constitution of the convener committee of Anna University has come as a surprise to the faculty. For several weeks, the buzz in the University was that Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa would be allowed to continue until the next V-C was appointed. Until Monday, there was no indication if Governor-Chancellor Banwarilal Purohit would indeed follow the precedent he set in the case of Alagappa and Bharathidasan University. However, soon after returning from Raj Bhavan, Mr. Surappa convened a virtual syndicate meeting and the committee was constituted. A source said, “It all happened online.” The three-member convener committee has two bureaucrats, who are also ex-officio members of the syndicate. The third member is a professor from the University. University faculty point out that the composition is against the resolution passed by the Syndicate in its 241st meeting held on October 6, 2016. According to the resolution, which The Hindu has accessed, the committee will comprise the Higher Education Secretary, the ex-officio member of the syndicate who will be the convener; the Commissioner/Director of the Directorate of Technical Education, also a syndicate ex-officio member, and the seniormost professor in the University. The Higher Education Secretary will be the chairman of the committee. “DoTE Commissioner was chosen as it is a technical University,” an official explained. University faculty said the same composition for the committee had been followed ever since a V-C began to be appointed. “During a brief period in 2016, the Higher Education Secretaries and the DoTE Commissioners were being shifted frequently. This was the reason the syndicate passed a resolution providing the designation of the members who will be in the committee,” a University official explained. However, the present committee has violated the very resolution the University had approved. In the place of the DoTE commissioner, Hans Raj Verma, the Secretary of the Information Technology Department, has been included. Also, the senior-most professor, in this case L. Suganthi, professor in the Department of Management Studies, at the College of Engineering, Guindy, was bypassed and Ranjani Parthasarathi, chairperson of Information and Communication Engineering, who is much younger, has been included, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/three-member-convener-panel-constituted-for-anna-university/article34307083.ece

13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||International Day for Street Children observed||Observing the International Day for Street Children, children from shelters and pavement dwelling communities came together to participate in debates, group discussions, street theatre and dance performances facilitated by Karunalaya, an NGO working with street children. Based on the discussions between the children who participated on the theme ‘Respect Us, Listen to Us, Protect Us’, a list of demands were drawn up focusing on the need for access to healthcare, sanitation, housing, identity documents and education for street communities. Street children from places around the city, including Barracks Street, Walltax Road, Moore Street and Kannappar Thidal, participated in the event, which was inaugurated by S. John Bosco, president, Karunalaya. “We need a safe place to stay and while the government is facilitating housing projects in many of our areas, our families are seldom allotted homes there. We need to be given housing in the area where we stay so that the livelihood of our parents does not get affected,” the children said in their demands. They further highlighted the need for better common toilet facilities which are kept open round-the-clock, access to clean drinking water and protection for children on the streets who are often vulnerable to abuse. Paul Sunder Singh, founder and director, Karunalaya, said among the issues highlighted were how many street children attending primary and elementary schools remained without any sort of access to education and learning throughout the COVID-19 pandemic due to the closure of regular classes in schools. “Senior students have been able to remain in touch with their schools and teachers at some level but for the younger children, there will be a huge learning gap,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/international-day-for-street-children-observed/article34307514.ece

In a statement, he alleged that the PMK and the Vanniyar community were being defamed in the double murders that happened at Soganur in Arakkonam district a few days ago. Two youth belonging to the Scheduled Castes had died in the clash. Lack of decency Dr. Ramadoss said the DMK and its allies claimed that political rivalry during the election and caste discrimination were the reasons for the murder when facts were to the contrary. While condemning the murders and seeking action against the accused, he disapproved giving it a caste and political colour for political gain. “This is political indecency,” he said. The victims and the accused (belonging to the Vanniyar community) had been “friends for a long time”, he said contending that the crime happened as a result of a scuffle between them after a drinking session. The deceased and the accused did not belong to the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi or the PMK respectively, he said. According to him, the media and the DMK and its allies did not condemn certain crimes committed by the VCK cadre or “by gangs that pursue women romantically for gain”. He said the new organisation would counter malicious propaganda against the Vanniyars. Earlier, on Saturday, PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss had, in a video message, condemned the crime and accused VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan of politicising it. He claimed that the educated did not stand with Mr. Thirumavalavan. Following this, social media was abuzz with tweets and posts by a host of personalities in solidarity with the VCK leader. ‘Sanatanist ideology’ Mr. Thirumavalavan had reacted by saying, “To differentiate people as educated and uneducated is the consequence of Sanatanist ideology. To use the word uneducated is an expression of arrogance. They are those denied the chance to be educated. That does not make them lowly.” Thanking those who expressed solidarity, he said, “The best education is one which equips people with humanity and equality.”  The PMK and the Vanniyar community were being defamed in the double murders that happened in Arakkonam district||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-to-float-propaganda-outfit/article34307087.ece

13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Security stepped up after Sri Lanka’s ban on terror groups||Security has been intensified at airports with international arrivals and those in the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu, following an alert on the possible infiltration of religious fundamentalists from Sri Lanka. The threat was perceived immediately after Sri Lanka initiated the process of banning 11 terrorist groups, including the Al-Qaeda and ISIS. In a note to all Commissioners/Superintendents of Police, State Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy said the proscribing of 11 terror outfits in the island nation could have repercussions in India, and more specifically in Tamil Nadu. Members of the outlawed organisations were extremists or terrorists trained to thrive in the underground and the likely asylum of most cadre was Tamil Nadu, considering its geographical proximity and willing patronage, he said. Pointing to the likelihood of illegal immigration of religious fundamentalists from Sri Lanka by air or sea, Mr. Tripathy said fishing boats could also ferry extremists across the Bay of Bengal. While local sympathisers might facilitate logistics for their travel, the extremists, after finding shelter in the State, might continue to indulge in nefarious activities against Sri Lanka from Indian soil, he said. The DGP directed senior police officers to step up the intelligence machinery and intensify surveillance across the State. Acting on recommendations of a high-level committee constituted to go into the background of the 2019 Easter Sunday suicide attacks that left 270 people, including 11 Indians, dead, the Sri Lankan government decided to proscribe 11 extremist groups, police sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/security-stepped-up-after-sri-lankas-ban-on-terror-groups/article34307118.ece
13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Varsity’s convener panel violates its own syndicate resolution||The constitution of the convener committee of Anna University has come as a surprise to the faculty. For several weeks, the buzz in the University was that Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa would be allowed to continue until the next V-C was appointed. Until Monday, there was no indication if Governor-Chancellor Banwarilal Purohit would indeed follow the precedent he set in the case of Alagappa and Bharathidasan University. However, soon after returning from Raj Bhavan, Mr. Surappa convened a virtual syndicate meeting and the committee was constituted. A source said, “It all happened online.” The three-member convener committee has two bureaucrats, who are also ex-officio members of the syndicate. The third member is a professor from the University. University faculty point out that the composition is against the resolution passed by the Syndicate in its 241st meeting held on October 6, 2016. According to the resolution, which The Hindu has accessed, the committee will comprise the Higher Education Secretary, the ex-officio member of the syndicate who will be the convener; the Commissioner/Director of the Directorate of Technical Education, also a syndicate ex-officio member, and the seniormost professor in the University. The Higher Education Secretary will be the chairman of the committee. “DoTE Commissioner was chosen as it is a technical University,” an official explained. University faculty said the same composition for the committee had been followed ever since a V-C began to be appointed. “During a brief period in 2016, the Higher Education Secretaries and the DoTE Commissioners were being shifted frequently. This was the reason the syndicate passed a resolution providing the designation of the members who will be in the committee,” a University official explained. Violations However, the present committee has violated the very resolution the University had approved. In the place of the DoTE commissioner, Hans Raj Verma, the Secretary of the Information Technology Department, has been included. Also, the seniormost professor, in this case L. Suganthi, professor in the Department of Management Studies, at the College of Engineering, Guindy, was bypassed and Ranjani Parthasarathi, chairperson of Information and Communication Engineering, who is much younger, has been included, sources said.  In 2016, the Higher Education Secretaries and the DoTE Commissioners were being shifted frequently. So the syndicate passed a resolution providing designation for the members who will be in the committee University official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varsitys-convener-panel-violates-its-own-syndicate-resolution/article34307721.ece
13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Metro smartcards will soon be sold by retailers, eateries||In a few weeks, smartcards of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) will be available in a few retail outlets and restaurants in the city. In an attempt to get more people to start using the smartcard system, CMRL has planned to distribute the cards to a few outlets. According to officials of CMRL, this is an attempt to increase the number of people travelling on the system. “As a start, we have identified several restaurants and retail outlets that are willing to accept our cards. We want to give about 2,000-2,500 cards initially and gauge the response. We will also give them a small commission for selling the cards. We have to see how this initiative works and if it turns out to be successful, we can reach out to more outlets in future,” an official said. Apart from this, they are also planning to send out staff in stations to persuade commuters to buy smartcards. CMRL gets about 80,000 passengers on average and officials are looking at various ways to see how the footfalls can be increased to at least 1 lakh. Considering the rising number of COVID-19 cases, sources said it was going to be a difficult target to achieve. They said while this move may help, the ideal thing would be for the State government to bring in a single card system where a commuter can use these cards in buses, malls and retail outlets or restaurants. “Then, commuters will use these cards to pay everywhere. This was the idea when smartcards were mooted initially. Then, MTC bus stops should be shifted close to stations so that commuters can walk from point to point without hassle,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metro-smartcards-will-soon-be-sold-by-retailers-eateries/article34307518.ece

The Additional Chief Secretary, Finance Government, Government of Tamil Nadu, had a meeting on April 8 to re-sensitise the procedures to be followed by banks to contain the spread of the virus. Non-adherence was punishable under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act, 1939, the SLBC said. All customers and others (including staff members) visiting bank branches should wear masks and bank branches should ensure that there was no over-crowding of customers, especially in closed rooms/halls. The SLBC also told banks to arrange for vaccination for eligible staff members and Lead District Managers to take up with the respective district administration the arrangements for the move. It also told banks to display the amount of penalty that would be levied on those violating procedures. T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public and Preventive Medicine, Chennai, in his recent letter to the SLBC had said the heads of institutions/bank managers should be held accountable for any SOP violation by customers/staff members. Crowd control Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Bank Employees Federation, affiliated to All India Bank Employees Association, on Monday wrote to the SLBC that the standard operating procedures were hardly being followed and bank branches were not able to control the crowd.

13 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No surprises from 22 seats this election||Twenty-two Assembly constituencies, where bypolls were held two years ago, have stuck to the norm of witnessing a lower percentage of votes polled in a general election (the April 6 Assembly poll) than in a byelection. In the last 15 years, the turnout in byelections has been exceptionally high. To cite a few examples, Pennagaram in Dharmapuri district recorded 84.9% polling in March 2010 and Yercaud in Salem district recorded 89.1% in December 2013. Reasons cited Several factors were cited for the trend, including intense political mobilisation by the principal parties of the State. This time, the presence of former Higher Education Minister and AMMK nominee P. Palaniappan in Pappireddipatti of Dharmapuri district and BJP vice-president K. Annamalai in Aravakurichi of Karur was not sufficient to make the two constituencies exceptions to the rule, though in both places, the turnout was a little over 80% — 82.15% in the former and 81.92% in the latter. In 2019, when the byelections were held along with the Lok Sabha poll, the turnout was at least two percentage points higher than it was this time, with 84.9% in Pappireddipatti and 83.97% in Aravakurichi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-surprises-from-22-seats-this-election/article34307119.ece

The police suspect that he could have been murdered at a nearby MRTS station and dumped here and that it could have been a case of poisoning. A few youngsters claimed that they spotted the decomposed body in November when they had gone there to smoke ganja. So, the murder could have taken place a few weeks before November, the police said.

At the end of the first day’s drive, the civic body vaccinated 6,429 persons. Launching the drive at the Corporation head office in Town Hall, Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian said the civic body’s target was to vaccinate at least 10,000 persons a day. This was in addition to the 150 to 200 people who get vaccinated at the urban primary health centres. The Corporation had deployed three vehicles each in North and East zones and two each in West, South and Central zones, said sources, adding that it had deployed more vehicles in two zones because of the concentration of industries and with the objective of vaccinating as many workers as possible. Mr. Pandian said that starting Monday evening or Tuesday morning, the Corporation would strictly enforce the rule to prevent overcrowding in offices, commercial establishments and other places. It would ask commercial establishments to regulate the entry of customers. Likewise, it was engaged in talks with traders in vegetable markets and other places to bring back the odd-even opening of shops, where one set of shops would function on odd days and the rest on even days. Likewise, the Corporation, after discussion with the District Collector would also look at closing its parks, newly developed lake fronts and a few other places to prevent overcrowding of people.  On the vaccination drive, the Commissioner further said that the Corporation would establish zone-wise control rooms with phone numbers for companies, factories or residents welfare associations to reach the control room concerned for vaccination. It was important that the city’s residents strictly followed all the COVID-19 safety guidelines. The prevalence of COVID-19 positive cases was not alarming in Coimbatore. The daily positive cases seen as a percentage of the city’s population showed that the city was as any other municipal corporation in the State, Mr. Pandian added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-corporation-launches-mobile-vaccination-drive/article34307540.ece

The Andhra Pradesh High Court had directed an inquiry into the transcript to find out the authenticity or genuineness of the conversation contained in a pen drive. “...We are of the view that the direction by the High Court calling for a report from Justice R.V. Raveendran need not be allowed to continue. We order accordingly,” the court said. During the hearing, prominent members of the Supreme Court Bar like senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Vipin Nair had sought a thorough probe into the chat. “We are of the view that the High Court ought not to have embarked on any other enquiry in the matter, except to the maintainability of the PIL at the instance of the writ petitioner and the conversation dated July 20, 2020 filed before the High Court as well, as the enquiry report sought was only with the above purpose,” the apex court said. It clarified that it had neither entered into the merits of the writ petition (pending before HC), nor was it expressing any opinion on the maintainability of the PIL.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-need-to-probe-justice-eswaraiah-whatsapp-chat-sc/article34306997.ece
13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||Centre agrees to hear PIL on at-risk airports||The Ministry of Civil Aviation agreed in the Supreme Court on Monday to hear a PIL petitioner who wants the installation of the Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) in at-risk airports, more importantly in table-top airports in Kozhikode and Mangaluru. Appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati said the Ministry is “willing to hear the petitioner on the issue involved... She further states that they will convene a meeting for the purpose within two months”. “Instead of objecting to his suggestion, why don’t you think about implementing it... Some of these airports, like Mangaluru, are very dangerous for flight passengers,” Chief Justice Bobde said. In an earlier hearing the court had visualised aloud the horror and tragedy of an air crash while hearing a petition filed by advocate Rajen Mehta, through advocate Shohit Chaudhary, alleging “deliberate omission” on the part of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to install the fail-safe system to stop an aircraft from overshooting runways at vulnerable airports. “A crash is something horrible... People are trapped inside the flight. Even the site of a crash is horrible,” Chief Justice Bobde had said. Mr. Mehta has said the EMAS could have averted the tragic Mangaluru crash of 2010 and the recent one in Kozhikode. Timely installation could have saved lives and crores of rupees. The petition said EMAS was installed in approximately 125 airports across the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-agrees-to-hear-pil-on-at-risk-airports/article34306998.ece
13 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Aadhaar not mandatory for COVID-19 vaccination, says L-G||The number of persons vaccinated against COVID-19 crossed the one-lakh mark in the Union Territory as the “Tika Utsav”, the special vaccination drive organised nation-wide, entered the second day on Monday. In addition to the 96,388 persons vaccinated through regular modes to date, over 7,000 beneficiaries over 45 years of age had taken the first shot on Day One of the vaccine festival on Sunday. Meanwhile, Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan told newsmen after a high-level review meeting, that the Aadhaar card would not be mandatory for getting vaccinated. Beneficiaries could get vaccinated on producing any valid photo identity document, Ms. Soundararajan said. In an order shortly thereafter, T. Arun, Health Secretary, said the public could get the benefit of COVID-19 vaccination by producing any of the following seven documents — Aadhaar, electoral photo identity card, passport, driving licence, PAN card, NPR smart card or pension documents with photograph. Pointing out that no one had so far reported side effects post-vaccination, the Lt. Governor appealed to everyone over 45 years of age to utilise the opportunity to get vaccinated in the remaining days of the special four-day campaign. Adequate stocks “We have adequate stocks to vaccinate over 1.1 lakh more beneficiaries,” she said. Officials participating in the review meeting had recommended various measures to improve immunisation, testing, treatment and isolation facilities. The Police Department had also provided inputs on reducing crowding at public places, especially markets. “We are not simply imposing a fine on those not wearing masks but educating them and providing violators with a mask,” she said. “Ideally, compliance with safety norms should be voluntary,” she said. The police will assist organisers to implement distancing at religious or wedding ceremonies. Ms. Soundararajan, who also inspected vaccination camps at Lakshminarayana Medical College and the Seventh Day Adventist Higher secondary School, added that the ‘Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat' Insurance card was also being provided to the BPL family members at these vaccine camps. Calling upon all sections of society to help thwart the second wave of COVID-19, the Lt Governor said that a team of six officers have been deputed to take necessary measures to curb the spread of the virus. The core team is being supported by several others, including NGOs and frontline workers. The Raj Nivas is also having a weekly review of the situation on Thursday, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aadhaar-not-mandatory-for-covid-19-vaccination-says-l-g/article34307725.ece
13 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||NABARD aid for rural projects swells to Rs. 395 crore||The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has so far sanctioned a cumulative amount of Rs. 395 crore for 69 projects under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) segment. Of the 69 projects, 25 have been completed with the sanctioned funds. Forty four projects are under way involving RIDF loan of Rs. 234 crore, of which Rs. 84 crore has been released, a NABARD official said. The RIDF loans cover various vital rural infrastructure projects, like rural roads and bridges, irrigation, schools and drinking water. Though the fund was set up during 1995-96 with the objective of providing low cost fund support to the State/Union Territories to facilitate quick completion of on-going rural infrastructure projects, it was only later that the Union Territory of Puducherry got on board. According to a NABARD official, during 2020-21, NABARD had sanctioned projects to the tune of Rs. 55.35 crore for improvement and strengthening of 12 rural roads and Rs. 10 lakh for provision of basic minimum infrastructure to the existing open air weekly shandy (Haat) at Madagadipet. In Puducherry, Puduvai Bharatiar Grama Bank has been extended financial support for promoting 3,000 JLGs over a period of three years. Efforts have been made to leverage technology to bring qualitative change in Self Help Group Bank Linkage Programme (SHG-BLP) and transparency in SHG book-keeping through E- Shakti by digitising their data and updating the same on real time basis. E-Shakti was piloted by NABARD in the Union Territory in 2016 through Puducherry Rural Livelihood Mission (PSRLM) and subsequently by Puduvai Bharatiar Grama Bank and M.S.Swaminathan Foundation. As on date, 3,899 SHGs have been on-boarded. Under the “My Pad My Right” initiative focused on livelihoods and menstruation hygiene among rural women, a sanitary napkin-making machine has been provided free of cost to an SHG group in Karaikal. Besides, four sanitation literacy campaigns had been held in Panithittu, Ramanathapuram, Sorapet and Pandian Nagar villages in Puducherry during October. As part of the Livelihood and Enterprise Development Programme (LEDP), NABARD had supported one LEDP on dry fish processing and value addition in Karaikal district with a sanction of Rs. 3.99 lakh for training 90 Self Help Group women. During 2020-21, NABARD had extended refinance assistance of Rs. 178.50 crore to the Puduvai Bharatiar Grama Bank, conducted 20 village-level programmes at various places in Puducherry for SHGs/JLGs to raise awareness on the importance of savings, availing credit from banks, proper utilisation of loans availed, prompt repayment of the loan and setting up of micro units and sanctioned Rs. 15 lakh to the Puducherry State Cooperative Bank Ltd. for purchasing a mobile van fitted with ATM for creating awareness on digital and financial literacy, officials said.

13 April 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Three-phase supply for farm connections hit by low voltage||The three-phase power supply for farm connections has run into low voltage problems in some areas in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts from the start of this month. After polling concluded on April 6, power supply to farm connections in some rural pockets, such as areas served by rural feeders around Kumbakonam and Orathanadu taluks, started suffering low voltage problems though a 24-hour power supply was being maintained by the Tangedco. Pointing out that fluctuations or low voltage in the power supply would damage agriculture pump sets, the secretary, Thanjavur District Cavuery Farmers Protection Association, Sundara Vimalanathan urged the Tangedco officials to ensure power supply was maintained in appropriate voltage in order to avoid damages to the submersible agriculture pumps. Otherwise it would end up in farmers spending more than Rs. 10,000 to repair the damaged pumps, he added. Claiming that low voltage problems were not rampant in Tiruvarur district, the president, Thamizhaga Vivasayigal Nalasangam, Tiruvarur, G. Sethuraman said farmers in Tiruvarur district have tilled their lands for summer cultivation and a few farmers having lift irrigation facilities had already taken up transplantation. A progressive farmer, Ramachandran of Orathanadu suggested that power supply at correct voltage can be ensured for at least 18 to 20 hours a day by adopting a turn system in distribution, if the technical problems in the feeder system causing low voltage could not be rectified on a war footing, Meanwhile, senior officials in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts said that low voltage problem did exist in some parts. Pointing out that necessary steps had been initiated to step-up the voltage, the officials said that around 65,000 live farm power connections exist in Thanjavur district and around 21,000 in Tiruvarur district. Meanwhile, M. H. Jawahirullah, leader of Manithaneya Makkal Katchi and DMK candidate for the Papanasam Assembly Constituency, has claimed that the farmers who had taken up early ‘kuruvai’ cultivation in about one lakh acres of land in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts trusting the election assurance given by the Chief Minister, Edappadi K.Palaniswami that 24-hours power supply would be provided to farm connections, have found themselves in a piquant situation. They were unable to maintain the necessary water level in the fields as the 24-hour three-phase power supply had been suspended after the polling, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/three-phase-supply-for-farm-connections-hit-by-low-voltage/article34307090.ece

13 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Bank manager’s suicide turns spotlight on stressful work||Ramesh (name changed), a branch manager of a public sector bank, has now almost lost track of the number of targets he has to meet. In addition to the traditional banking duties, he is supposed to hit the target on a variety of government schemes, the distribution of FASTags for vehicles, and profit targets from the sale of third party products, including insurance schemes and mutual funds. Following the suicide of K.S. Swapna, manager of the Thokkilangadi branch of Canara Bank last week, citing stressful working conditions, banking unions have yet again taken up an issue which has been a constant concern. The mergers of public sector banks, the push towards privatisation, lack of enough employees and new recruitments, and harassment from higher-ups have led to a situation wherein officer-level employees spend much of the day at office. Problems after mergers Speaking to The Hindu , C.J. Nandakumar, president of the Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI), says that the entire workload and responsibility land on the branch managers and officers. “Bank mergers have led to a lot of complications. For instance, counters of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank now function inside the Bank of Baroda. After the merger of Syndicate and Canara banks, the Thokkilangadi branch is one of those which will be rationalised, a euphemism for closing down. Even these branches which are to be closed have to follow these strict targets. Because the software systems are still not fully integrated after mergers, they are not even able to serve the original customers,” says Mr. Nandakumar. After a long recruitment freeze till 2010, the public sector banks began new intakes, when young engineering graduates joined the sector, who were then able to get quick promotions. But many of them do not get adequate training to handle the responsibilities of a managerial post. Officer-level posts do not have fixed working hours, and this affects their work-life balance, says C.D. Josson, State general secretary of the All India Bank Employees’ Association. Blamed for NPAs The unions point out how the successive governments have washed their hands of the responsibility of rising Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), through huge loans for corporates, with the blame resting entirely on the banks. There has been a push to generate income through sale of third party products, including mutual funds, with stringent targets, the burden of which falls on the manager. Some managers talk of increment cuts for not meeting housing loan targets. The progressive weakening of the unions and the co-opting of some of them by the management have worsened the situation. “In the past two years, there have been several cases of suicides of officer-level employees. In Kerala, there was the case of an employee in the Guruvayur branch of Corporation Bank last year,” says Aneesh Pattazhy of the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation. ‘Have to live with it’ S. Adikesavan, a top bank executive, says banks should help managers cope with stress through scientific stress management training and if needed, encourage them to seek medical help. “I am saddened by Swapna’s suicide. But stress at the workplace is a part of life of bank managers. The stigma associated with seeking professional help for depression, low feelings is the main issue.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bank-managers-suicide-turns-spotlight-on-stressful-work/article34306992.ece
13 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Remdesivir shortage hits private hospitals in Tiruchi||At a time when private hospitals in Tiruchi and its peripheries are overflowing with patients showing symptoms of COVID-19 infection, some of them have reported a shortage of Remdesivir, a widely used drug, in the treatment. Many private hospitals authorised to treat COVID-19 infection have started seeing several patients with the symptoms of the infection from the first week of April. The number of patients getting admitted to private hospitals in the city has tripled over the last few days. According to sources, the Health Department has permitted about 18 private hospitals, a few of them corporate, in Tiruchi, Manapparai and a few other towns in the district, to treat COVID-19 patients. Around 200 beds with oxygen facilities were earmarked for treating them. Except for a few beds in small hospitals, most COVID-19 wards in the hospitals were fully occupied and some hospitals have to turn away fresh cases. Many patients have no option but to seek the services of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). There are instances of relatives of the patients approaching influential persons to get recommendations for admission in private hospitals. “We were made to visit at least five hospitals in the city for admitting two of my aged relatives with COVID-19 symptoms. We finally managed to get them admitted in a city hospital with a strong recommendation,” says a close relative of the patients belonging to a residential colony near Tiruchi Airport. What is turning out to be agonising for some patients is the reported short supply of Remdesivir drug in private hospitals. Some hospitals admit that they could not get the drug from the dealers and the retail medical stores for the last 36 to 48 hours. In the absence of the drug, private hospitals invariably refer the patients to the MGMGH. However, they continue the treatment for the patients with mild symptoms with other standard drugs. “There is a shortage of Remdesivir in the market. Our efforts to source the drug from leading dealers have failed. It is not available in the neighbouring cities as well. Hope, the problem will be solved in a few days,” says S. Sethuraman, former president, Indian Medical Association, Tiruchi chapter. When contacted Joint Director of Health Services S.Lakshmi said sufficient stock was available in the government hospitals in Tiruchi district. If needed private hospitals could get the drug through the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation, she said.  Sufficient stock is available at government hospitals.

13 April 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Folk artistes in a fix||With the State Government banning temple festivals owing to the second wave of COVID-19, the livelihood of folk artistes is hit hard as they have lost their “job season”. “Even when many of us were expecting the Tamil months of Masi, Panguni, Chithirai and Vaikasi to keep us engaged in temple festivals to repay the loans we had got in the last year’s lockdown, the restrictions have come at the worst time,” said K. Alagesan, president of Virudhunagar district Drama, Folk Artists. Most of the temple festivals are held in these four Tamil months and the folk artistes make most of their earnings in that season. “In the rest of the months, we take part in other functions and festivals which are less in number,” he added. “We know no other job and the livelihood for our family depends entirely on performances,” he added. Stating that the Rs. 1,000 assistance given last year by the Department of Art and Culture to the folk artistes was nowhere matching to the loss of income for a whole year, Mr. Alagesan said that if only the the temple festivals were allowed their livelihood could be ensured. “The Government should give exemptions to the folk artistes to perform with 50% attendance. Otherwise an assistance of Rs. 10,00 to the folk artists,” a memorandum given to Virudhunagar Collector, R. Kannan said. Virudhunagar district has got around 4,000 folk artistes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/folk-artistes-in-a-fix/article34307133.ece

Tirunelveli district, which recorded 261 new cases between April 10 and 11, is witnessing increasing admissions to hospitals.

Poompuhar Shipping Corporation personnel posted there did not carry thermal scanner. After the visitors were asked to wear life jackets heaped in a basket, they were allowed to board the crowded ferry. “There is no measure in place to sanitise the used life jackets. No one is bothered about physical distancing during the brief sail to the memorial as officials do not press tourists to strictly follow COVID-19 norms,” said P. Bala Ganesan, a visitor from Thoothukudi. Photos showing the crowded boats were sent to Collector M. Aravind through WhatsApp and he warned Corporation staff to adhere to COVID-19 norms. Mr. Aravind had a meeting with heads of educational institutions on Monday to brief them about the situation prevailing in the district and the need for strictly following the norms.

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Worsening plight: folk artistes flash SOS to State government||Rural folk artistes, who are staring at uncertainty after cancellation of temple festivals across the State in the wake of the pandemic, have sent SOS to the government as they are the verge of losing their income for the second successive year. Festivals organised in temples between April and August give opportunities to karagam , oyil , parai , thappu , poikkaal kuthirai , devaraattam , paavai kooththu , Kaniyaan kooththu , villupaattu , theru kooththu , nagaswaram , naiyaandi melam , thavil artistes. Hence, they wait in great anticipation for the season every year. The income earned during the five months helps feed their families during the rest of the year. They also have to use a part of the money to repay loans. When the lockdown was promulgated in March last, the folk artistes lost their revenue as festivals were banned in places of worship, where celebrations were curtailed and held behind the doors without devotees. “Since temple celebrations were cancelled, folk artistes were not booked last year and we lost all revenue. We had to borrow to feed our families. Even as we were getting ready for this festive season with the hope of repaying our debts, COVID-19 again threatens to dislodge our livelihood as temple celebrations have been cancelled due to the pandemic. If we lose our revenue this year too, our families will get wiped out,” said ‘Thevarkulam’ Mariappan, treasurer of Tirunelveli District Rural Folk Artistes Welfare Association. He, along with other rural folk artistes, submitted a petition at the Collectorate on Monday. When the State Government gave Rs. 2,000 as pandemic relief to the rural folk artistes last year following the lockdown, it was given only to those who had registered their names with the welfare board. “Hence, the Tamil Nadu Government should adopt the families of rural folk artistes until this crisis is over and use them for creating COVID-19 awareness among the public,” said S. Jegajeevan, director of ‘Thoothukudi Thamizh Panpaadu Maembatttu Maiyam’. He also said the government should stand guarantor for loans availed by the folk artistes from private and public sector financial firms. “Some of our artistes cannot even repair their instruments due to poverty… So the government should help them.” Before submitting their petitions, the rural folk artistes performed for a while on the Collectorate premises. Similar petitions were submitted at Tenkasi and Kanniyakumari Collectorates.  Even as we were getting ready for this festive season, the pandemic again threatens to dislodge our liveliood ‘Thevarkulam’ Mariappan Treasurer, Tirunelveli District Rural Folk Artistes Welfare Association||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/worsening-plight-folk-artistes-flash-sos-to-state-government/article34307781.ece

13 April 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Balachandra Jarkiholi says he will join campaign for Mangala Angadi||BJP MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi, who had stayed away from campaigning following the sexual harassment allegation against his brother and former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, has announced that he will campaign for the BJP candidate Mangala Angadi in the Lok Sabha byelections. “I request all of you to work for the BJP candidate and ensure her victory,’’ he appealed to his followers and party leaders from Arabavi Assembly constituency that he represents. He was speaking at a meeting of his supporters at Sri Basaveshwar Bhavan in Gokak. “We should all see that the Jarkiholi family’s vote bank remains intact. Our votes should not scatter and go to any other candidate. We should work sincerely with a single focus that the BJP nominee wins,” he said. His elder brother Satish Jarkiholi is fighting the bypolls as a Congress nominee. He assured his voters of Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi joining the campaign for the BJP in a few days. “He is not well. He is resting at home as he had contracted COVID-19. Once he is declared free from the virus, he will join our campaign efforts,’’ he said. He said that the BJP would organise two rallies in Gokak and Arabavi on Wednesday. The Belagavi parliamentary seat is considered a strong base of the BJP. Suresh Angadi won successive elections here from 2004. “We should work hard to uphold this reputation,” he said. He recalled that Suresh Angadi had got a lead of over 60,000 votes in Gokak and 55,000 votes in Arabavi. “We should see that Mangala Angadi gets even higher leads,” he said. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi asked party workers to show the real strength of the BJP in Belagavi district. He asked them to highlight the good work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Suresh Angadi in their campaign. He asked workers to go door to door during campaigning. Other leaders Umesh Katti, Eeranna Kadadi, Anna Saheb Jolle also spoke. The senior leaders preferred not to raise the controversy around the CD allegedly featuring Ramesh Jarkiholi. Earlier, at the Sambra airport, Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi said that there was no clash among the brothers over their political leanings. “There is enough clarity in the family about such issues. We will campaign for our party, irrespective of the fact that our own brother is the Congress candidate,’’ he said. He said that he would not react to controversial issues such as the CD incident or the allegations of corruption made by Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal against the Chief Minister. “We should avoid talking about such issues. Our present focus is the bypolls,” he said. “We have a team of lawyers working on the CD case. We have left it to them,” he said. “I was preoccupied with other work for 15 days. That is why I could not campaign. Now I am here and we will sincerely work towards the victory of Mangala Angadi. If Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa comes here for campaigning, I will join him,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/balachandra-jarkiholi-says-he-will-join-campaign-for-mangala-angadi/article34307170.ece

Prasanna H.M., president of PHANA, said that in addition to the 50% beds under the government quota, there would be another 30% reserved for COVID-19 patients under the private quota. “We have told the government that they can take over the beds in a phased manner as and when the beds currently occupied are vacant,” he said. Dr. Sudhakar also said that private hospitals have been urged to set up COVID-19 Care Centres in hotels so that people who have mild and moderate symptoms can be admitted in hotels if they wanted to do so. “We need to make judicious use of the hospital beds. Patients without symptoms and with mild symptoms will be isolated in hotels and care centres. Only patients with severe conditions will be treated in hospitals,” he said. Remdesivir Meanwhile, private hospitals have been asked to furnish the details of the quantity of Remdesivir they need. The State government has decided to supply it through the Karnataka State Drugs Logistics and Warehousing Society at government rates. The Minister also took stock of oxygen and oxygen generators that would be needed in hospitals. “We want to ensure that there is no dearth of oxygen in hospitals. If needed, we will also speak to the Industries Department and divert industrial oxygen to hospitals,” he said. Dr. Sudhakar, however, ruled out a lockdown because of the second wave of COVID-19 infections. “We are not a position to take such a harsh step. We want to educate people to take up COVID-19 prevention methods,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pvt-hospitals-to-reserve-50-of-beds-under-govt-quota/article34307313.ece
13 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||PWD trifurcation confusion continues||In March, V.K. Gupta, an executive engineer with the Public Works Department, was transferred to the Water Resources Department. But soon, he was sent back, and currently is languishing without a post. Like Mr. Gupta, PWD sources said, there are at least 150 engineers in all cadres in a state of limbo. They are people who did not pick any particular department when the government trifurcated human resources from the Public Works Department to Irrigation, and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Departments. With this, the State government’s attempt to address the four-decade-old vexed issue of trifurcation is nowhere near solved. While engineers such as Mr. Gupta have not had any posting since the option window to choose among the departments has closed, engineers who have chosen to stay back with the PWD (that was the mother department), have now outnumbered the cadre strength. While the RDPR department has enough engineers, the Water Resources, and Rural Water Supply and Sanitation scheme have no takers and face a shortage. One of the reasons for confusion, sources pointed out, was that engineers feared their promotion avenues would diminish if they move out. Also, several engineers, who provided their consent, have been allocated departments other than what they chose. They are expected to approach the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal, which will only add to the confusion. Adding to the anxiety among those who have not provided consent is the publication of a seniority list for promoting engineers in the Water Resources Department even before sharing of human resources with the departmental promotion committee. Junior engineers are slated to receive promotion even though senior engineers are still languishing in PWD. While the PWD had remained a mother department and operated a common seniority list till 2016, issues began to crop up with the recruitment of engineers directly in the Water Resources Department in 2003. Engineers appointed in 2009 in the Water Resources Department have been promoted in 2019. In 2016, the RDPR appointed engineers separately, and they were also promoted in 2018. At a meeting attended by secretaries of all three departments under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, in March, it was also felt that the departments have seen improper allocation and are not balanced. One more window to provide options is expected shortly. Little public interest “This exercise is being done with very little public interest. Unfortunately, in recruitment, postings and promotions, both money avenues are the only focus,” a senior PWD officer rued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pwd-trifurcation-confusion-continues/article34307323.ece
13 April 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Hike in fertilizer prices will neutralise cushion of MSPs’||The sharp increase in prices of fertilizers is expected to add to the agrarian crisis in the State where farmers are already reeling under distress due to lack of scientific pricing mechanism for their crops, said agriculture economist and former chairman of Karnataka Agriculture Prices Commission (KAPC) T.N. Prakash Kammaradi. It is the first time in the history of the country that fertilizer prices have seen a hike of nearly 58%, accounting for an increase of Rs. 1,400 a quintal. Dr. Kammaradi, who had commissioned studies related to cost of production for various crops in Karnataka in his capacity as KAPC chairman, said increase in fertilizers’ cost would almost neutralise the cushion being provided by minimum support prices with respect to a few crops, including paddy. Citing an example, he said the “paid out costs”, which include not just cost of production but also rental value of land and family labour, is already much higher than the revenues earned by farmers with respect to several crops, including paddy. According to him, the cost of production of paddy on one acre is Rs. 37,578 of which the fertilizers alone cost Rs. 7,314 as there is a requirement of about 400 kg. Of this, the DAP and NPK, which have seen hike in prices, account for 50% of quantity. This would mean there would be a jump of about Rs. 2,800 to Rs. 3,000 per acre of paddy. Pointing out that farmers get 27 to 28 quintals of paddy per acre on an average, he says, production cost would go up by a minimum of Rs. 100 per quintal of paddy. With actual paid out cost of paddy already high at Rs. 52,453 per acre, the present fertilizer price hike would only increase the financial burden and make cultivation of various crops almost financially unviable despite MSPs, he argued. Similarly, the growers of elakki variety of banana spend about Rs. 16,429 per acre of plantation on fertilizers alone. Now, these expenses would increase, he pointed out. Same was the case of cotton where 333 kg of fertilisers is used per one acre. Even vegetable and fruits growers have been hit hard. According to an estimate, 290 kg of fertilizers is required for growing tomato on one acre of land while 505 kg of fertilizers is needed for growing dry chillies on one acre. Even dairy farmers, who are struggling since milk procurement prices were reduced on account of COVID-19, are expected to be hit hard as a majority are dependent on fertilizers for cultivation of fodder. Dr. Kammaradi argued for restoring full quantum of subsidy that was being given for fertilisers to bail them out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hike-in-fertilizer-prices-will-neutralise-cushion-of-msps/article34307329.ece
13 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Citizens allege shortage of testing kits in PHCs||With the spike in the number of COVID-19 cases in Karnataka, the State government has decided to ramp up testing. But a few citizens who went to get tested at Primary Health Centres [PHCs] in Bengaluru alleged that the centres had run out of testing kits. A 34-year-old man, who went to get tested in Rajarajeshwarinagar zone, said, “I developed fever and wanted to get tested for COVID-19 so that I do not spread the infection to others in my house. I went to three PHCs in our zone. The first two said they had no testing kit. I got a test done in the third centre and the result was positive. I could have avoided the trouble of running around and coming in contact with other people if I could have given my swab for testing at the first PHC,” he said. Sridhar S., who wanted to get a Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) at a PHC in Malleswaram, was told he could get only an RT PCR test. The staff pointed out that the RAT was only for emergency cases and for patients who had Influenza-like Symptoms or Severe Acute Respiratory Infection [SARI]. However, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials ruled out any shortage and said that they have stock of over 2 lakh testing kits. Rajendra Cholan P., Special Commissioner (Health), BBMP said that they have been conducting 67,000 tests every day over the last two weeks and denied any shortage. Doctors and nurses working in government-run healthcare establishments said while there may not be a shortage in the city, the distribution is a matter of concern. “Many PHCs have started mobile testing centres. When our teams head out to apartment complexes and markets, we do not have staff or kits at the hospital and are unable to take swabs for testing of people who walk in,” said a doctor who works in a PHC in south Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/citizens-allege-shortage-of-testing-kits-in-phcs/article34307498.ece

13 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC notice on fresh litigation by medical students on compulsory govt. service||The High Court of Karnataka on Monday ordered issue of notice to the State, Centre, and the National Medical Commission on a petition filed by a group of medical students questioning the legality of the Karnataka Compulsory Service by Candidates Completed Medical Courses Act, 2012, which mandates one compulsory government service. Justice R. Devdas passed the order on a petition filed by Sharanya Mohan and 43 others, who have now completed MBBS course from Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Medical College and Hospital, Bengaluru. Though the High Court in August 2019 upheld the constitutional validity of the Act, the petitioners contended that the law on compulsory government service cannot continue to operate after the Central government notified the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, which came into force in September 2019. Pointing out that the apex court had asked the Central government to frame a uniform policy on compulsory government service as many States had no such service and about 11 States had compulsory service period for different years, the petitioner said State cannot impose such service as such a power now vested only with the NMC. The petitioners questioned the notification issued by the Directorate of Medical Education asking medical colleges, including the college from which the petitioners completed their course, to withhold all original documents of students who have completed the course to enable them to undergo one-year compulsory service. Pointing out that documents are important to apply for the graduate National Eligibility-Cum-Entrance to joint postgraduate medical courses, the petitioners said that denying their documents is contrary to the law and deprives their right to opt for higher education. Meanwhile, the government counsel told the court that no counselling has been scheduled for posting the petitioners for compulsory government service and instruction was being issued to release their marks cards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-on-fresh-litigation-by-medical-students-on-compulsory-govt-service/article34307326.ece

13 April 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Fulfill demands, say transport employees||KSRTC employees and their family members staged a protest in Hassan urging the State government to fulfil their demands. Women and children took part in the dharna carrying plates and cups. They gathered at Hemavathi Statue Circle and marched to the Deputy Commissioner’s office, raising slogans. The protesters said that the pay they had been getting all these years was insufficient to meet basic needs. Many could not afford higher education for their children. They also expressed anger over the KSRTC’s disciplinary action against some employees who led the protests. They wanted the transfer and suspension of the employees withdrawn. Hospitalised Phalaksha, a driver-cum-driver of Hassan depot, attempted to end his life by consuming poison during the protest. He was taken to Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences. The doctors said he was out of danger. Even as he was being taken to the hospital, he told media that he was not worried about his death, but the demands of the employees should be fulfilled. The KSRTC officials have filed cases against three people who led the protests in Hassan on Sunday and Monday. They have been accused of inciting protests against the corporation. Former Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Revanna has asked KSRTC employees to return to work. “If they wanted a hike in salary, they should have protested on their own, without the support of middlemen. If they had come to us during the legislature session, we would have raised their issue in the Assembly”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fulfill-demands-say-transport-employees/article34307306.ece

13 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Gangubai Hangal Museum broken open||Shocked by his own daughter and son-in-law’s act of breaking open the museum containing the prized possessions of legendary Hindustani vocalist Gangubai Hangal, her son and nonagenarian Baburao Hangal has sought status quo to be maintained with regard to the museum which he wants to hand over to the government for maintenance. Addressing an urgent press conference here on Monday night along with his son Arun Hangal and another daughter Madhavi Joshi (grandchildren of Gangubai Hangal), Mr. Baburao Hangal said that he was pained over the development in which his daughter Anita (Vaishnavi) Talakad along with her husband Mahesh Talakad had broken open the doors of Gangubai Hangal Museum of Music set up by her son late Manoj Hangal at Ganga Lahari (residence of Gangubai Hangal) in Hubballi. Mr. Baburao Hangal said that he and his brother Narayanrao were the legal heirs to the property, where the museum was set up to showcase the prized possessions of his mother, the doyenne of Hindustani classical music. “However, without my knowledge they have broken open the lock of the museum and have taken possession of the collections. What has hurt us is that nothing was discussed with us and I was shocked looking at the present condition of the museum,” he said in a choked voice. “We all have emotional attachment with Ajji’s (Gangubai Hangal) awards, certificates, photographs and other musical instruments collected from across the country by my elder brother Manoj, who was passionate about music. Due to my father’s health issue, I had taken him to Bengaluru for treatment and we had locked the museum after making it secure. Now, it has been broken open and we don’t know what has happened to the rare exhibits,” Mr. Arun Hangal said. Ms. Madhavi Joshi said that while she paid visits to Ganga Lahari once a month or two, she never touched the museum as it was locked and because she knew that her father was emotionally attached to it. “He has a story to tell about each one of the exhibits in the museum. Today morning, he couldn’t control his tears on seeing the present state of the museum. He just couldn’t control his tears,” she said. Mr. Baburao Hangal and Mr. Arun Hangal said that Ms. Anita and Mr. Mahesh Talakad probably had wanted to make use of Gangubai Hangal’s name for commercial purposes, to which they were opposed. “We want status quo maintained. Yesterday, under police escort, we visited the house and museum and after a lengthy and heated talk, it was agreed that status quo would be maintained and the keys would be handed over to us by 6 p.m. today (Monday). However, nothing has happened so far. If there is no development by tomorrow, we will formally lodge a complaint,” they said. To a query, Mr. Baburao Hangal said that his younger brother [Narayanrao (87)] were in agreement to the proposal of handing over the museum to the government, but his daughter [Anita] and her husband [Mahesh Talakad] had forcibly taken possession of the museum which, he said, should be handed back to the legal heirs. “By indulging in such an act, they have insulted the legacy of my mother Gangubai Hangal,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gangubai-hangal-museum-broken-open/article34307176.ece

Meanwhile, in response to the call given by the KSRTC Employees League, the employees family members took part in agitations at various places across the districts of North Karnataka on Monday. The family members, especially women and children, came out in good numbers, armed with thaalis and spoons, to register their protest against what they said government’s apathy. In Hubballi, the family members of the transport staff staged a protest outside their staff quarters on Gokul Road. In Dharwad, several women took part in a dharna organised by the staff federation’s Dharwad district unit. Jail bharo Speaking at the agitation site, honorary president of North Western Karnataka Transport Employees Federation Pandurang Neeralakeri said that the federation would launch a Jail Bharo on Tuesday, condemning the State government’s decision to not hold talks with the striking employees. Instead of resolving the issue, the government was taking anti-labour steps such as threatening them with termination and transfer. To protest against this, it had been decided to launch the Jail Bharo, he said. He said that the employees would stage a demonstration in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office at 10.30 a.m. and then, take out padayatra to Dharwad Central Prison seeking arrest. Mr. Neeralakeri said that the family members of transport employees too would participate in the agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/families-of-transport-employees-stage-protest-in-several-districts/article34307178.ece

Somashekhar said that the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah would make a few more holes in it to ensure that the ship sank quickly. Addressing a press conference in Kalaburagi on Sunday, he said that party leaders deliberately made D.K. Shivakumar the chief of Congress unit in the State to ensure that the party collapsed under his leadership. “Mr. Siddaramaiah has said that the BJP under B.S. Yediyurappa was a sinking ship. The fact, however, is that the Congress is sinking ship for which Mr. Shivakumar was deliberately made the captain. Mr. Siddaramaiah is longing to making a few more holes in the bottom of that ship to ensure that it sank quickly. We don’t do anything to damage the Congress. There are many in their party to do that job,” he said. Disciplinary action To a question on BJP’s national general secretary Arun Singh’s recent warning of action to dismiss MLA Basangouda Patil Yatnal from the party for his continued attack on Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Mr. Somashekhar justified it stating that crossing limits would naturally attract disciplinary action. “One should work within the framework of the party. One has to face disciplinary action when one crosses the limits. It is applicable to Mr. Yatnal also. The party’s national leadership would look into the matter,” Mr. Somashekhar said. When asked about the crisis-ridden Kalaburagi-Yadgir DCC Bank, Mr. Somashekhar said that the government had given Rs. 10 crore share amount and was ready to offer all possible assistance to revive the bank. “The present governing body of the bank is working well and loans of about Rs. 187 crore have been recovered. Our government is committed to reviving 21 DCC banks, including the one in Kalaburagi. We have set a target of lending around Rs. 20,000 crore to 30 lakh farmers this year,” he said. Ministers B.S. Anand Singh, B.C. Patil, Shivaram Hebbar and Murugesh Nirani were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-ensuring-cong-ship-sinks-quickly/article34307180.ece

Mangaluru City Corporation has leased out for 30 years its land where the new market building has been built for the Urban Development Authority. Neither the MUDA nor the city corporation earned revenue from it for the last two financial years. The building has a built-up area of 84,891.45 sq ft. The MUDA had invested Rs. 12.63 crore on the project by availing itself of Rs. 4.30 crore as bank loan. It spent Rs. 8.33 crore from its fund. The six-storeyed building has provision for 122 stalls. Of these, at the time of inauguration, 31 were reserved for fish vendors, eight for selling chicken and 68 for other purposes. There are 15 units which can be used as offices. An official said that 69 cars and 40 two-wheelers could be parked in the basement and lower ground floors. Basement parking has been designed for parking vehicles of owners of offices. MUDA Commissioner G.T. Dinesh Kumar told The Hindu that the authority had floated bids twice inviting those interested to avail themselves of stalls/office space in the building on rental basis. But the response was poor probably due to high rentals. The authority will have to fix rentals as per government norms. The MUDA has now worked out revised rentals to attract offices/customers and the bids will be invited on this basis for the third time by this month-end. It has also been planned to rent out office space for select government departments which are now functioning on rental basis in private buildings in the city. Asked whether the MUDA or the city corporation will manage the market, he said that for the time being, MUDA will manage it and the authority will ensure that the market building will no longer remains unoccupied. Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyasa Kamath said that if the city corporation will have to manage the market, it will have to pay the fund invested by the MUDA. At present, the city corporation is facing a funds crunch. Other funds cannot be diverted to make payment to the MUDA. A solution will be worked out within a month, he said. MUDA Chairman Ravishankar Mijar said that steps are being taken to make the market functional. Meanwhile, Mr. Khader said that he felt that the city corporation will have to manage the market and not MUDA as many issues, including issuing licence, which will come up while managing a market will be related to the city corporation. Returning the investment to MUDA should not become a problem for the city corporation, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-urwa-market-remains-unoccupied/article34307672.ece

Jagadeesha urged them to ensure all senior citizens receive vaccine against COVID-19. In a video posted on his Facebook account, Mr. Jagadeesha said that public programmes should not be organised when COVID-19 positive cases were surging. “If public programmes are held, it is better you do not attend them,” he said. People should continue to wear masks, follow social distancing and maintain hand hygiene. Mr. Jagadeesha said that there has been slackness in getting senior citizens vaccinated. With vaccine, elderly persons will get great relief from infection taking serious turn. “We should not be careless in this regard. We lost 192 senior citizens last year. We should not lose the elderly in this wave,” he said and called upon youngsters to visit houses in their respective areas to ensure that all elderly person are vaccinated. Though the COVID-19 situation in Udupi was under control, people should continue to strictly adhere to appropriate behaviour to prevent the infection from going out of control, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/people-in-udupi-told-to-ensure-all-senior-citizens-are-vaccinated/article34307677.ece

13 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Don’t flout norms: DC||The death audit of COVID-19 patients in Mysuru has revealed that the patients died of complications after being shifted to other hospitals by some private hospitals here in violation of standard procedures. Disclosing this here on Monday, Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri told the private hospitals not to admit patients if they cannot treat critically-ill patients. In case of an admission, the patients should be referred to other equipped private hospitals or K.R. Hospital before their condition worsens. She warned some private hospitals during a meeting here that the district administration will take the matter seriously if deaths continue to happen because of the violation of treatment protocols by them. While referring serious patients to other hospitals, the history of treatment, investigations done and other recommendations should be sent to other hospitals along with the case file. It takes time for hospitals to decide about the line of treatment of critically-ill patients soon after admission and sometimes the situation goes beyond their control, resulting in deaths. Such things should not happen, she advised. Ms. Sindhuri said the audit must be prepared within 48 hours of the death. This will help in assessing the cause and accordingly take measures. The hospitals must report deaths on the same day. “If doctors get accurate information, the death audit could be prepared precisely with all analysis. The death could be due to COVID-19 or co-morbidities. The hospitals must also document whether the patient was vaccinated.” The Deputy Commissioner particularly warned a private hospital which shifted a serious patient to another hospital without proper referral. Moreover, none of the hospital representatives attended the meeting convened by her on Monday. “We have taken this negligence very seriously,” Ms. Sindhuri told the meeting which had representatives from various hospitals. Ms. Sindhuri said three deaths had been reported in February, 25 in March and 30 so far in April. This has become a cause for concern besides 10 deaths reported on a single day. The deaths are more due to shifting of patients to other hospitals at the last minute. Meanwhile, the daily case load in Mysuru has continued to surge exponentially with the cases crossing the 300-mark, the highest since the beginning of this year, on Monday. A total of 362 cases reported on Monday has triggered unease among the healthcare workers because of the rapid spread of the contagion. Out of 362 cases, 294 are the contacts of the infected. Also, the number of active cases is inching closer to the 2,000-mark. The active cases stood at 1,960 on Monday with 249 patients admitted in the 250-bed district hospital and 659 in private hospitals. As many as 554 patients are under home isolation. Three deaths were reported on Monday and all of them are SARI patients, aged above 60 years. With this the death toll has risen to 1086. A total of 303 patients were discharged on Monday. Mysuru’s ICU beds are also filling up fast as 29 patients are currently being treated in the COVID-19 intensive care units (ICUs). About 100 beds are available in ICUs of government-run and private hospitals. The number of patients in ICUs in other districts: Mandya (13), Kodagu (3), Chamarajanagar (4).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dont-flout-norms-dc/article34307300.ece
13 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||More KSRTC staff return to work||Even as the agitation by the employees of road transport corporations remains unresolved with the State government and the striking staff sticking to their guns, more employees of KSRTC in Mysuru rural and urban divisions are reporting to work, restoring the services ahead of Ugadi festival. As on Monday, about 425 employees out of 3,000 employees in Mysuru rural division have returned to their respective duties, helping the division to restore 20 per cent of services. KSRTC Mysuru divisional controller K.H. Srinivas confirmed to The Hindu that 425-430 employees have returned to work. “By Wednesday or Thursday, more number of employees will report to their duties making way for the restoration of services on a majority of routes. However, until the services are restored fully, the private operators’ services will be utilised.” Out of 550 buses of Mysuru rural division, about 100 plus have hit the road. Passengers’ numbers are, however, falling with uncertainty in the services. Warning pays off Sources in the KSRTC said the government’s warning of salary cut is said to be the main reason for the employees reporting back to work. Another reason is the government’s tough stand and not inviting the leaders for talks though the strike has entered its 6th day. Three trainee employees were removed after they did not report to work, according to KSRTC officials. In the urban division, as many as 800 employees have returned to work, restoring nearly 300 schedules in Mysuru city. Divisional Controller S.P. Nagaraj said the urban division has about 2,000 employees and nearly 45 per cent of the staff have withdrawn from the strike.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/more-ksrtc-staff-return-to-work/article34307301.ece
13 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Initiative to produce chemical-free jaggery||The Bengaluru-based local commerce platform eSamudaay and JSS Rural Incubation Skill and Development Centre (JSS RISDC) will collaborate to work with local entrepreneurs and farmers in Chamarajanagar to produce chemical-free jaggery. This is part of an initiative to give thrust to rural entrepreneurship with digital and technological intervention and to scale up local businesses and generate employment. eSamudaay and JSS RISDC have identified the producers and intend to restore the traditional jaggery production units called aalemanes . A release said there were more than 100 aalemanes situated in and around Chamarajanagar district and most of them used techniques that were unsafe, unhygienic, labour intensive, and also chemicals that may be harmful when consumed. The objective of the new initiative is to not only restore the jaggery-producing units, but also ensure that the produce is chemical-free as there is a demand for such jaggery in the market. It will also help bring in the best practices and help producers connect with wholesalers and retailers, the release stated. In the run-up to the initiative, JSS RISDC conducted a two-week workshop with these aalemane operators and formulated an action plan. The plan entails the removal of chemicals from the production process, process automation for better safety and hygiene, and product innovation to make it suitable for urban consumers. eSamudaay, along with SolutionBuggy, an AI-enabled technology platform, will develop the best practices and bring in experts to help jaggery producers innovate and sell their products to wider and discerning markets, the release added. eSamudaay will also help with go-to market strategies for these products, and sample orders of over 200 kg have already been received for these chemical-free jaggery bars. As production increases, eSamudaay will connect these producers with merchants and grocers in its network. Future plans include identification of more producer circles such as jackfruit, arecanut and fish within the next one year, the press release stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/initiative-to-produce-chemical-free-jaggery/article34307309.ece
13 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Mysuru tops in giving life-saving shots||After registering an extraordinary achievement of 126% in vaccination against COVID-19 on Saturday, Mysuru has continued to top the State in vaccination coverage, ahead of Bengaluru. Though short of the target and also below Saturday’s record jabs, the district achieved 70% coverage on Sunday, which also happened to be the highest in the State. As against the target of vaccinating 25,050 persons, Mysuru gave the shot to 17,510 on Sunday. Mysuru has been steadily expanding its vaccination coverage and topping the State as part of its battle against the pandemic since doctors and experts believe that immunisation is the best way to minimise complications in case of an infection spread. Supporting the view, Chamarajanagar Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi, who tested positive recently despite taking two doses of the vaccine and is currently under home isolation, said, during a Facebook Live programme on Monday, that vaccine certainly reduces severity. He cited his own case and said he was on the path to recovery after a mild infection. With Mysuru not having adequate ICU beds for COVID-19 patients, many doctors have strongly recommended vaccination, especially among those with comorbidities, and to all the eligible populations. This will, in a way, minimise pressure on hospitals, doctors and the nursing staff, who have been working since last year against the pandemic and saving lives. The current wave is turning out to be more contagious than the previous one going by the caseload, they argue. Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute Director and Dean C.P. Nanjaraj said, “In some cases, infection has been found to be spreading much faster, affecting the lungs and worsening the immune system. Unlike last year, we have a vaccine now and all those eligible must take it for protecting themselves from the disease. It minimises complications and the chances of ICU admission.” Already, 29 patients in Mysuru are in the ICU. In the government set-up, K.R. Hospital has 20 ICU beds while 16 are in the district hospital. Including the private hospitals, the total number of ICU beds available for attending to the seriously ill is around 100. District Vector-Borne Diseases Control Officer Chidambar said a majority of positive cases being reported in Mysuru in the past few days were among the youth. They have mild-to-moderate symptoms and many are being treated under home isolation.  Targets Barring Mysuru and Chickballapur districts, none of the districts in the State on Sunday crossed 45% in vaccination coverage. Chickballapur achieved 49% of the target on Sunday. Surprisingly, the coverage was far lower on Sunday when compared to Saturday. Mysuru exceeded its target on Saturday and vaccinated 31,613 persons, as against the target of 25,050. It was followed by Belagavi with 71% coverage. On Saturday, 2,65,151 persons were vaccinated in the State, while the number of Sunday was 1,19,829. Sources in the Health Department said the coverage was lower on Sunday as it was a holiday and also a festival was approaching. The coverage is expected to improve after Wednesday with new stocks of vaccine awaited on the same day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-tops-in-giving-life-saving-shots/article34307315.ece
13 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||A project to showcase Mysuru’s lesser-known heritage||A new concept to expose the wider culture of Mysuru that goes beyond Dasara and showcasing the city’s built and natural heritage, promoting it as a centre for contemporary cultural activities, is in the offing. It is in the nascent stages still, and though the district administration was keen to get the concept in place this year, the pandemic and the second wave of the COVID-19 put paid to the initiative. However, project consultants are at it and the authorities plan to reach out to the public and experts in various fields for suggestions. The Mysuru Beinnale (as it is termed for now) entails showcasing the art and culture in the existing heritage buildings of the city and invoking the historic cosmopolitan legacy of Mysuru. Taking a cue from the Kochi-Muziris Biennale in Kerala, the plan is to host events of large and diverse varieties to a range of audiences with common interests to enable visitors to grasp the overall culture of Mysuru and experience the lesser-known aspects and architecture of the city. “We were keen to get the concept started, but it is still in the planning stage because of the pandemic. It can help showcase the diverse range of Mysuru’s architecture and help in their conservation as well,” said Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri during an interaction with presspersons here last week. The activities proposed include seminars, book launches, and hands-on learning experiences at different venues across the city, as opposed to Dasara which takes place in the heart of the city. G.N. Heritage Matters, an architectural consultant firm which has made a presentation, opines that it will boost tourism without causing large expenditure on new attractions. The events will utilise the existing cultural resources of the city to create a new experience for visitors, and the expenditure will only be to develop management plans that aid in the execution of the event. According to the firm, a direct fallout of the initiative will be a reinvigoration of the derelict and unused structures through adaptive reuse so as to breathe new life into old structures.  The broad themes identified include the culture of Mysuru (showcasing the traditions unique to the region), Indian classical dance and music (which can be held at different venues in the city), art and architecture (showcasing the unique buildings of Mysuru that have heritage value), yoga, Ayurveda, and literature. The sites The sites for these have been divided into ‘the academic’, ‘the touristic’, and ‘the ecological’. The inventory of buildings and sites covers the three broad themes and includes some of the landmark buildings, parks and lakes of Mysuru, including Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion, Crawford Hall, Oriental Research Institute, Cheluvamba Mansion, the DC’s office, Ursu Boarding School, Kukkarahalli Lake, Krishnaraja Boulevard, Town Hall, railway station, Gun House, Kuppanna Park, Dufferin Clock Tower, and Gandhi Square. The ecological sites cover the Administrative Training Institute campus, Karanji Lake, Lalitha Mahal Palace and its surroundings, among others.  We were keen to get the concept started, but it is still in the planning stage because of the pandemic. It can help showcase the diverse range of Mysuru’s architecture and help in their conservation as well Rohini Sindhuri , Deputy Commissioner, Mysuru||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-project-to-showcase-mysurus-lesser-known-heritage/article34307318.ece

The money for it will come from public donations that have poured in. The daily wager’s painstakingly-built library, over 10 years, being destroyed in a fire had attracted huge public sympathy. A decision to entrust the task of building the library to City Library Authority was taken at a joint meeting of officials of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA), and Department of Public Libraries after a visit to the spot on Monday evening. Deputy Director of Public Libraries, Mysuru, Manjunath said the cost of constructing the library will be borne by donations made by different individuals and organisations. Mr. Ishaq will be made a special invitee to the City Library Authority and a portion of the library will be named as “Mr. Ishaq corner.” Funds deposited Mr. Manjunath said the officials had a discussion with Mr. Ishaq, who has agreed to voluntarily hand over the money contributed by different individuals and organisations for the construction of the library building. The funds will be deposited in an escrow account. Meanwhile, an online fundraiser campaign for extending financial support to Mr. Ishaq’s library collected more than Rs. 20 lakh in 48 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/public-donations-to-help-rebuild-ishaqs-library/article34307330.ece
13 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Tree felling: public hearing on April 23||The Forest Department will conduct a public hearing on April 23 to seek objections to the felling of 150 trees to pave way for a proposed helipad near Lalitha Mahal Palace. The hearing will be held at Aranya Bhavan, Ashokapuram from 11 a.m. and the public can file their objections, if any. Objections could also be submitted through email so as to reach the authorities before 11 a.m. on April 23. The email address is dcfmdm@gmail.com The written objections may also be sent to the Assistant Conservator of Forest, Mysuru Division, Aranya Bhavan, Ist floor, Ashokapuram, 6th Cross, Mysuru – 570008. Not to lower guard Environmentalists in the city who have launched an agitation to save the trees have decided to intensify their efforts and explore legal options. Reacting to Monday’s development wherein the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Mysuru MP Pratap Simha have questioned the heli-tourism project, the environmentalists said they welcome their views but will not lower their guard. An online petition to save trees at Lalitha Mahal Palace has gone viral underlining the public mood against it and has garnered over 67,000 signatures to stir up opposition for the project. Speaking to The Hindu , Bhamy V. Shenoy, who is one among the activists, said though the views of Mr. Simha and Mr. Siddaramaiah are welcome it could be more of a political power play at work. “Their opposition to the project is more due to political differences than environmental concern’’, he added. The apprehensions also stem from the fact that Mr. Simha has pushed for projects that were environmentally inimical such as the railway line project and a new highway to Kodagu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tree-felling-public-hearing-on-april-23/article34307302.ece
13 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Tobacco farmer deaths were avoidable’||Terming the reported suicide by two tobacco farmers in Hunsur recently “tragic” and “avoidable”, the Anti-Tobacco Forum (ATF), Mysuru, has contended that suicides by gullible farmers could have been averted had the authorities taken steps to implement the recommendations of international bodies, including the creation of a corpus for hand-holding debt-ridden tobacco farmers. In a press statement, ATF convener Vasanthkumar Mysoremath cited the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) Sustainable Goals by 2030 and said the countries producing tobacco should create a corpus for helping debt-ridden farmers to clear their loans as a one-time measure, subject to the surrender of licences and their barns. The ATF was responding to the reported suicide by two tobacco farmers in Hunsur, who ended their lives unable to clear their dues after the price of tobacco and other crops they were growing crashed. In order to meet the aspirations of the UNDP’s Sustainable Goals by 2030, Mr. Mysoremath also said that countries like India, which were signatories to the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, should consider achieving the same by 2025 itself by declaring an annual reduction of 20% in crop size and area of cultivation of tobacco, refusing to procure illegally grown tobacco, stopping subsidising tobacco cultivation, and tightening the screws on illicit trading of local and foreign brands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tobacco-farmer-deaths-were-avoidable/article34307316.ece

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Apartment associations get proactive on testing, vaccination||As the number of COVID-19 cases witnesses a steady rise, apartment associations have been proactively taking measures to tackle the second wave, including organising testing and vaccination camps in their premises. Anjali Menon, president of Aristocrat Apartments’ Association in Kasturinagar, said that most of the residents who had tested positive were primary contacts of those who had COVID-19. “There has been no case of community transmission within the apartment complex. We are doing what we can at the micro level to limit the exposure of our residents by requesting them to curtail their movement, apart from ensuring COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and other protocols are adhered to,” she said. R. Rajagopalan, association member of L&T South City in Arakere, said residents of the community of 1,998 flats are not allowed to sit on benches in open spaces, let alone congregate. “Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we have restricted the number of people using passenger lifts at a time to two, and service lifts to three. However, following the second wave, people’s movements have reduced drastically. We have now tied up with HOPCOMS to have a mobile kiosk selling fruits and vegetables twice a week,” he said. Ajay Ramachandran from the association of Tata Aquila Heights, an apartment complex in Jalahalli, said that the association was coordinating with a private hospital for vaccination of all eligible housekeeping staff and security personnel. “While we cannot control or restrict residents from going to work or travelling, we do have some control over the service staff, who are also vulnerable as they move across the community. The best defence now is to get as many people vaccinated as soon as possible,” he said. The Bangalore Apartments’ Federation, an umbrella organisation of 932 associations in the city, has been working with private hospitals and the BBMP to organise testing camps and vaccination session sites. Vikram Rai from BAF said the campaign for testing and vaccination camps started a week ago. “For testing camps, we are coordinating with the BBMP. We have mapped private hospitals and are pairing them with various apartments. While close to 100 associations have requested vaccination camps, as many as 52 have requested testing camps. This is important for not just early detection, but also the right kind of intervention,” he said. BAF had sought data from member associations on the number of active cases in the respective communities. “According to responses received from around 105 associations, there are 380 cases in 25,000 flats. This indicates a case density of 1.5 cases per 100 households in apartment complexes,” he said and added that BAF was encouraging members to provide data on case load in their respective communities.

The Centre had provided adequate funds for tourism development and crores of rupees was released for destination improvements in Karwar and other places in the State. But not even a fraction of the funds released by the Central government had been properly utilised and now there was this hoopla over heli-tourism, Mr. Simha pointed out. “The Mysuru-Bengaluru highway was being expanded to a 10-lane road which will reduce the commuting time to a little more than an hour and there was already flights operating out of Mysuru to key destinations in the State. If need be, we can strive to improve flight connectivity and bring more cities and towns in the State and link it with Mysuru under UDAN but what is the need for heli-tourism?” he questioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/heli-tourism-is-a-publicity-stunt/article34307304.ece

The heads of the BBMP and the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (Bescom) have filed an affidavit in this regard during the hearing of a Public Interest Litigation petition, filed by G.B. Athri, a retired Wing Commander of the Indian Air Force. Taking the affidavits of Chief Commissioner of the BBMP and the Managing Director of Bescom on record, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj made it clear that the court would consider appointing an agency to identify transformers posing danger to the public in case of any delay in creation of a coordination committee and taking effective steps by the committee. The BBMP and the Bescom have proposed to set up a coordination panel on the suggestion of the High Court of Karnataka that both the agencies should evolve a scheme to permit installation of electricity transformers on footpaths without compromising the safety of pedestrians. The Bescom told the bench that it is prepared to relocate transformers if the local authority points out specific installations required to be relocated and suggested an infrastructure corridor for installing electricity supply equipment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-bescom-to-set-up-coordination-committee-for-installing-transformers/article34307493.ece

Speaking at a press meet, he said only 20% buses operating on long-distance routes by KSRTC earn profit. Rest operate under “no-profit no-loss” terms as RTCs provides connectivity to remote areas, which private operators do not touch. RTCs with 1.2 lakh employees were striking work for the second time in the present BJP regime. More than one crore people commute daily in RTC buses and about 52 lakh travel only in BMTC buses in Bengaluru, Mr. Reddy said. The BJP government and union leaders should be amenable to holding talks to find a solution, he said. RTCs won 345 awards both national and international, and won awards for excellence in service for six consecutive years from the BJP government at the Centre, he said, and opposed any move to privatise the entity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/80-rtc-buses-run-on-no-profit-no-loss-terms/article34307327.ece

Although Abhilash was immediately taken to the General Hospital, Alappuzha, his life could not be saved. The police said that the deceased was a history-sheeter.

A large portion of the Thodupuzha-Puliyanmala road in Cheruthoni town was washed away in the flood. But the the bridge, constructed by Canadian engineers as part of the Idukki dam, remained intact despite being battered by rocks and debris in the floods. Now, it has been decided to construct a new bridge and a row has erupted over its alignment. An association of traders there has opposed the change of alignment by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). According to the association, the construction of the new bridge will divide the town and there are no approach roads to it. The District Collector has convened an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue. The NHAI has launched the work on the bridge, estimated to cost Rs. 23 crore. Merchants’ association Cheruthoni unit president Jose Kuzhikandam said the new alignment of the bridge would deny access to almost 30 shops and there would be no connectivity to the Thadiyampadu route. It is being alleged that the NHAI had deviated from the initial alignment. NHAI stance NHAI assistant executive engineer Rex Felix said there was no change in the alignment. “The new bridge would be above the flood level of the river and 8.5 metres above the present bridge,” he said. He said the new bridge would not make the shops inaccessible. “Some people are misleading the public,” he said.  The NHAI has launched the work on the bridge, estimated to cost Rs. 23 crore||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/furore-over-new-bridge-at-cheruthoni/article34307192.ece
13 April 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Accused falsely implicated in Mansoor case: Jayarajan||Kannur district secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) M.V. Jayarajan on Monday said those named as accused in the Mansoor murder case were falsely implicated. Speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of a peace march organised by the party at Kadavathoor in Panoor here on Tuesday, he said the list was prepared according to statements given by Indian Union Muslim League workers. Muslim Youth League worker Mansoor, 22, a resident of Chokli Pullukkara, was killed in a clash around 8 p.m. on April 6, election day. The police have named 11 persons, supposedly CPI(M) workers, as accused in the case. Mr. Jayarajan said the second accused Ratheesh Kooloth, who allegedly committed suicide, was not involved in the case. He could have committed suicide as League workers had assaulted him and attempted to falsely implicate him in the case. He said Ratheesh’s mother had lodged a complaint with the District Police Chief claiming that her son was beaten up by IUML workers. She had also alleged that her son was wrongly accused in the case and that he could no longer stay at home. He said League workers caused the death of Ratheesh by unjustly naming him as accused in the case. Polling day The CPI(M) leader said Left Democratic Front workers were beaten up at booth 150 at Pullukkara on the polling day. After polling, Shinos, an LDF worker who had been arrested in connection with the case, was abducted by League workers. LDF workers had to rush in there to save him. Death of Mansoor was an unfortunate one related to an incident during polling. He said the police should conduct a thorough investigation. Even those who were not there at the time of the incident had also been charged. The CPI(M) was not against arresting the real culprits. If CPI(M) workers were involved, let them also be arrested, he added. Mr. Jayarajan said five CPI(M) workers had been killed in the past six months in the State. It was not the policy of the Left to retaliate. Alleging that the United Democratic Front was promoting violence, he criticised the front for boycotting the recent peace meeting held in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/accused-falsely-implicated-in-mansoor-case-jayarajan/article34307196.ece
13 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||COVID curbs to be tightened||The next two to three weeks are crucial for the district in managing COVID-19 and the restrictions imposed by the State government will be enforced strictly, District Collector S. Suhas said in an online briefing on Monday. The progression of cases in the district was a cause for concern, he said. He said that the entire week from March 29 to April 4 had seen 2,024 new cases, a figure that the district was now seeing in about two days. The test positivity rate (TPR) in the same week was 4.1%, but on Sunday, the district saw a TPR of 8.79%, which was twice the figure from the first week of April. Of the 214 ICUs in the district (88 in government facilities and 126 in private ones), 90 were occupied by both COVID and non-COCID patients. Of the 126 ventilators, 25 were occupied. ICUs were currently seeing 30% occupancy, but if the situation worsened, there could be issues, the Collector said. So far, 5,79,129 doses of the vaccine had been administered. Of this, 4,97,624 people had taken the first dose, and 75,509 the second dose. Among people over the age of 45 years, 3,79,700 doses were given. This was about 35% of the targeted coverage of 11,76,350 people over 45 years in the district. He urged people to follow restrictions imposed by the State government, including that of limiting participants in indoor functions to 100 people and in outdoor functions to 200, and taking food packets home instead of serving food at the venue of a function. He also appealed to restaurants to follow the restriction of allowing only 50% occupancy. “To prevent crowding in hospitals, people must use online consultation as far as possible. “The transport department will be given directions to prevent overcrowding in buses. Social distancing must be maintained at the beach. If cases increase more restrictions will be necessary,” the Collector said. He also appealed to people not to step out after 9 p.m., though a night curfew was not in place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-curbs-to-be-tightened/article34307636.ece
13 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Corpn. standing panel chiefs leave ruling LDF red-faced||The ruling LDF in the Kochi Corporation has found itself on a sticky wicket after being forced to accommodate two of its standing committee chairmen, who openly campaigned against the CPI(M) candidate in the Kochi constituency in the Assembly polls. Health standing committee chairman T.K. Ashraf and town planning standing committee chairman J. Sanilmon, who are part of the LDF regime, embarrassed the ruling coalition after they campaigned for Tony Chammany, UDF candidate and former Mayor. The duo led the campaign against K.J. Maxy, sitting MLA and CPI(M) candidate from the constituency, alleging that the legislator had failed to address the development needs of West Kochi, especially Mattancherry. Mr. Ashraf and Mr. Sanilmon, who enjoy popular support in their respective divisions, had won the civic polls as Independent candidates after breaking away from the Indian Union Muslim League and the Congress respectively. Every vote counts in the constituency, which Mr. Maxy had won by a margin of just 1,086 votes in 2016, and it is to be seen how far the two local leaders could influence the poll outcome in Kochi. Support necessary Despite campaigning against its candidate, the CPI(M)-led coalition in the corporation council could not act against the two councillors, as their support was inevitable for the party to continue in power. The LDF, which has 34 members in the council, returned to power after a gap of 10 years by roping in Mr. Ashraf and Mr. Sanilmon and making them chairmen of health and town planning standing committees. “We decided to campaign for the UDF in Kochi, as Mr. Maxy had failed to address issues that required his attention,” said Mr. Ashraf. The legislator could not find a solution to drinking water shortage, lack of transport facilities, and other pressing needs of the West Kochi area. However, the CPI(M)-led civic administration had been addressing the development needs of the city in an effective manner. Hence the support for the LDF in the council, explained Mr. Ashraf. Mr. Sanilmon said the people of Kochi constituency longed for a change, and that Mr. Chammany was the ideal choice. “I will continue to support the LDF in the council for its good work and till the front needs my backing,” he said. Independents Responding to the developments, Mayor M. Anilkumar said there was no question of political embarrassment, as the duo were elected as Independent candidates, who could take any political decision of their choice. Though Mr. Asharaf’s support was sought for Mr. Maxy, he refused to budge. However, he pledged his support for the LDF for a stable civic administration, Mr. Anilkumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-standing-panel-chiefs-leave-ruling-ldf-red-faced/article34307646.ece

Having already helped build three houses in the last five years, both financially and in terms of labour, the students led by their programme officer A. Ambily have now busied themselves in mobilising funds by selling scrap for a fourth house that is under construction in Poothrikka panchayat. “We also sell a multipurpose solution we have made while visiting households for collecting scrap, the proceeds from which also go into the building of the new house estimated to cost over Rs. 5 lakh. Hopefully, the shortfall can be made up through sponsorships both in cash and kind,” said Ms. Ambily. The NSS volunteers took up the construction of the first house at Valakam panchayat in 2016 as part of their community work after coming across a media report on the plight of one of their schoolmates whose house used to get fully submerged during monsoon. “It was the toughest assignment, as our volunteers had to toil physically since the site was inaccessible,” said Ms. Ambily. The decision to take up construction projects is often an emotional one. The hope is that they will somehow manage it with the help of kind-hearted people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nss-volunteers-on-mission-mode/article34307642.ece

While participants enjoy the thrill and challenge it poses, viewers gather to witness the kayaks negotiate the cascading waters. The Cochin Paddle Club has been spearheading the training programmes in whitewater kayaking like rescue technique, river running and rolling practice. “The activity is getting popular with even school students getting trained in the Muvattupuzha river. Many of them, including me, began with whitewater rafting that is popular in many tourist destinations in northern India, and graduated to whitewater kayaking,” says Nommy Paul, trainer, who has participated in international kayaking events. It is also a life-time hobby. The Kerala Adventure Tourism Promotion Society and the Kerala Kayaking and Canoeing Association are helping popularise this activity in Muvattupuzha river. “Foreign participants who visit Kerala are often amazed at whitewater kayaking being still in its infancy in Kerala, despite the State having 44 rivers and a 560-km of coastline. The monsoons are the best season for this in Kerala since water bodies get good river streams then. Even otherwise, water bodies here have warm waters during much of the year. This is unlike in much of the West when one has to wait for glaciers to melt. Still, it needed an Italian national who participated in MRF to discover Kerala’s potential,” Mr. Paul said. “Kerala must take the plunge into such adventure activities to attract more tourists and enthusiasts. Sadly, only 6% of people in Kerala know open-water swimming, so much so that even youth had to be rescued in huge metal vessels in chest-deep water during the 2018 floods. Incidents like drowning can be prevented if people learn swimming, venture into unfamiliar waters after wearing protective gear and if they are not in an intoxicated condition,” he said. “The fear and risk can be mitigated once trainees master the escape tricks. There are plenty of opportunities in the adventure activity,” said Anna Naveen, whose two school and college-going daughters recently joined the training programme. Siby Mathai of Cochin Paddle Club said that watersports had as many medals in the Olympics as athletics. It was apt for Kerala which had pleasant waters since cycling, running enthusiasts encounter traffic, air pollution, bad road conditions and even stray dogs. Many medical professionals, chartered accountants and entrepreneurs had taken to whitewater kayaking. This would, in the long run, help overcome the fear of water and develop love for water, deterring people from using water bodies as a space to dump garbage, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/muvattupuzha-emerges-as-whitewater-kayaking-hub/article34307640.ece

He is also a bicycle and nature enthusiast. Founder of Routes of Change, a non-profit organisation, he has been using just his muscles and some wind to journey over 40,000 km around the planet, during the past five-and-a-half years. “No trains. No automobiles. Not even an elevator. I’m not anti-motor, nor do I think I am saving the planet. What I am doing is inspiring the public and students at presentations and connecting with local non-profit organisations to share their stories and raise support for them. I don’t pretend to be a hero or have all the answers to our problems but I do think I am part of the solution, and more importantly, I think we are all part of the solution. It is time we acknowledged our immense power to influence and change the world around us. It is fun and exciting to take control of that power. Join the Routes of Change community and let us make epic things happen,” says 38-year-old Mr. Pukonen in his website. Having begun his journey from Toronto in 2015, he relied on a host of non-motorised commuting options, from canoes and kayaks to bicycles. Cycling expedition He bicycled to Kochi in December 2020 from Nepal. Before that, he sailed across the Pacific Ocean, from San Francisco to Hong Kong. “Being a filmmaker, I also write about and document my journeys.” While in Kochi, he took care of Sundowner — a yacht that was berthed at the marina. Its owner was stuck in Australia during the pandemic. Mr. Pukonen spent considerable time every day, tending to the yacht which was in pretty rough shape. A local mechanic sometimes pitched in with help. The consummate adventurist signed off with this message: “There is no substitute for a simple, frugal life, which leaves minimal carbon footprint. The biggest single thing must be to grow one’s own food.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/globe-trotting-seafarer-sails-off-from-kochi-marina/article34307631.ece

A pollinator garden and herb garden at the park were also inaugurated on Monday by actor Mammootty. Speaking at the event, Mayor M.

He said that a gazebo at the park would be a permanent venue for Arts Space Kochi (ASK), the Kochi Corporation's project to promote art and cultural performances in public spaces. Mr. Mammootty lauded the fact that the public space had remained a park for so long, and had not been converted into a space for any other use.

13 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Muslim women can get divorce under personal law, says HC||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has held that the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act did not do away with the practice of extrajudicial divorces available to Muslim women under Section 2 of the Shariat Act. The Bench comprising Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque and Justice C.S. Dias observed that the intention of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act was to extend judicial divorce to all Muslim women irrespective of the schools they follow. Section 2 of the Shariat Act recognized the personal law and dissolution of marriages without court’s intervention via ‘talaq,’ ‘illa,’ ‘zihar,’ ‘lian,’ ‘khula,’ ‘mubaraat’ etc. The court said there were four major forms of dissolution of marriages as recognized under Islamic law and protected under the Shariat Act at the instance of the wife. They were Talaq-e-tafwiz , Khula, Mubara’at, and Faskh. Under the Shariat Act, Muslim women retained the right of all modes of extrajudicial divorce recognized under their personal law, except Faskh. Faskh was a form of judicial divorce effected through the intervention of a court at the instance of wife. The Bench observed that modes of extrajudicial divorce as referred in Section 2 of the Shariat Act of 1937 remain untouched by the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act. The Act never intended to do away with the practice of extrajudicial divorce otherwise available to a Muslim woman. Verdict overruled The court also overruled a single judge’s verdict which held that Muslim woman could only resort to divorces under the provisions of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act and had no right to invoke the provision of their personal law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/muslim-women-can-get-divorce-under-personal-law-says-hc/article34307272.ece
13 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Kochi hotel owner threatened of abduction by party organisers||The organisers of a party scheduled at a hotel in Fort Kochi on Sunday had even threatened the hotel owner with abduction if the disc jokey (DJ) was not allowed to perform, it has emerged. The Customs (Preventive) Department had alerted the hotel owner about the event and asked him not to allow it. He asked the event manager to call off the party, triggering the threat. The DJ gave the agencies the slip during raids on alleged rave parties at four premium hotels on Saturday midnight. The entire episode, however, throws light on the nefarious ways of holding rave parties. “We came to know that the organisers were in a very violent mood when the hotel owner confronted them,” said Customs sources. The authorities said the DJ was known for his psychedelic music. Officials said the parties were meticulously organised. It was found that a few rooms in the hotel were rented out to drug users. “Around 10 persons packed into these rooms. This is where hotels have a role to play. They should not allow more than the permitted number of persons in any room,” a Customs official said. The raids at three hotels led to the recovery of psychotropic substances, including MDMA and certain unidentified pills suspected to be of psychotropic nature and dried ganja. Besides, an apparatus for smoking ganja was recovered from six youths. The raids followed intelligence received by the Customs Headquarters Preventive Unit that a five-star hotel in Kochi would be hosting a DJ party to be attended by drug peddlers and youths. Soon, it emerged that three other star hotels would also be conducting DJ parties. Subsequently, an anti-narcotic search team was formed by officers of Customs (Preventive) and the State Excise Department. Customs sniffer dog Edmond was also brought in from Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hotel-owner-was-threatened-with-abduction/article34307649.ece
13 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Agencies to turn on the heat on rave parties||The Customs (Preventive) and State Excise Department are all set to turn on the heat on rave parties while warning hotels hosting such events to fall in line and cooperate or face the music. After arresting four persons, including a disc jokey (DJ), following a string of coordinated raids simultaneously conducted on Saturday midnight at five premium hotels in Kochi and seizing high-end synthetic drugs, the agencies have chalked out a multi-pronged strategy to stem the flow of drugs and check rave parties. NDPS Act Customs sources said directions had been issued to hoteliers to keep out elements with history of cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and not to rent out space to them. “In short, those with such antecedents will be denied entry to all star hotels in the city, and hotels have been warned that renting out space for illegal parties infested with drugs makes them vulnerable to charges under Section 25 of the NDPS Act,” they added. The intention is to rein in rave parties without stepping on the revenue of hotels. Plans are also afoot to infiltrate parties held in premium hotels with plainclothesmen and also to elicit information from regular party hoppers. “During the raids conducted on Saturday, rave party organisers had blown drugs from the floor where they were being held to avoid detection, while some managed to escape exploiting multiple entries to the party hall or even jumping off from even the height of the second floor. We will plug such loopholes in our future moves,” the sources said. T.A. Ashok Kumar, Deputy Excise Commissioner, Ernakulam, said the agency would keep an eye on parties and will conduct raids if they were found suspicious. Getting hooked “We strongly suspect that these parties are being held by drug pushers also to build their clientèle. Such parties are usually separated by months, and if a participant is introduced to a premium synthetic drug and gets hooked, he or she might approach the organisers even outside such parties,” he added. The officer said most participants were below the age of 25 and urged their families to check out on them if they frequently stayed out late into the night. Tracing the origin of synthetic drugs mostly to Goa and Bengaluru, the agencies said even foreigners were involved in their supply.  We strongly suspect that these parties are being held by drug pushers also to build their clientèle. Such parties are usually separated by monthsT.A.

Kamanees of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) special court read out the charges against the accused in the case, which was probed by the agency. The allegations were that five activists of the CPI(Maoist), a proscribed forum, formed an unlawful assembly with deadly weapons, including an AK-47 rifle and other self-loading rifles, and trespassed into the house of a civil police officer (CPO), A.B. Pramod, at Vellamunda in Wayanad. The accused threatened to kill the CPO asked him to resign from his job and stop helping the police in its anti-Maoist operations.

13 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Uncertainty marks launch of second lot of e-autos||The ambitious plan to launch the second lot of e-autos in the city, especially in the Kochi metro’s feeder routes, has run into rough weather, with neither government agencies nor manufacturers of e-autos readying recharging points or battery-swapping stations. Even worse, only half-a-dozen of around 20 e-autos that were launched with much fanfare in 2018 at metro stations are operable, said sources in Ernakulam District Autorickshaw Drivers Cooperative Society. This is in stark contrast with Kozhikode where over 150 e-autos are operating, despite opposition from drivers of conventional autorickshaws. The cooperative society, which was formed to bring approximately 15,000 autos that operate in the Greater Kochi area under one banner, is keen to introduce 100 e-autos by the end of May. But it has not been able to place a purchase order with either of the two manufacturers that were shortlisted, it is learnt. “One of the firms specialises in fixed battery technology [where the battery comes with a warranty], and the other has a battery-swap system [whereby drained-out batteries can be swapped with fully-recharged ones made available at select kiosks],” said Binu Varghese, secretary, Autorickshaw Drivers Union (AITUC). But neither firm has committed to installing recharging stations or battery-swap infrastructure. “In this situation, civic and government agencies must come forward to ready recharging stations. Such an initiative will help, especially since Kochi, which hosted an electric vehicle summit two years ago, is set to host the national urban mobility summit in October,” he added. An e-auto can operate 120 km if it is fully recharged in three hours. The energy cost will be as low as Rs. 70 for operating this distance. The swap system, although more convenient, is relatively costlier. “The cooperative society has constraints in readying recharging or battery-swap infra. BPCL, which had readied swap infra at select fuel retail outlets, must take initiative in this regard. It is sad that the fuel major has not done so, although autos revived their operation in October 2020 after the lockdown. Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) too must play its part, since a robust feeder system will improve ridership in the Kochi metro. That e-autos do not cause air and sound pollution and are much easier and smoother to drive than petrol, diesel and CNG autos, must be taken into account,” Mr. Varghese said. AuSa app The uncertainty over introducing e-autos and the pandemic also affected the full-fledged launch of AuSa auto ride app, which the Cooperative Society readied with technical help from a city-based firm. Ernakulam District Residents Associations Apex Council (EDRAAC), KMRL, police, and the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) recently trained 110 auto drivers in Aluva in the technical aspects of the app and operating the Kochi metro’s feeder services. Another 150 drivers will be trained shortly. The app will be launched subsequently, official sources said. Meanwhile, sources in KMRL said the introduction of the second lot of e-autos did not take place since batteries that were readied as part of the swap system ran out of charge and became beyond repair owing to the lockdown, affecting the project’s financial viability.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/uncertainty-marks-launch-of-second-lot-of-e-autos/article34307195.ece

Shyam, Betty and another person whose identity is not yet known were the other accused. The grievously hurt victim remains admitted in a hospital. The assault was allegedly an act of vendetta for having prompted another person assaulted by the same gang to report the incident to the police. K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) had formed a special investigation squad to flush out the accused who had gone into hiding. The squad had arrested two other persons on the charge of helping the accused to abscond. A team led by Kalady Inspector B. Santhosh, sub inspectors Prashanth B. Nair and Abhijith, assistant sub inspector Abdul Sathar, and senior civil police officer Anilkumar made the arrests.

A team from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had visited the crash site and inspected the copter on Sunday evening before giving clearance for its shifting to the airport. The copter carrying UAE-based businessman and chairman of LuLu Group M.A. Yusuf Ali, his wife, and crew had crash-landed on the plot right next to the Panangad police station on Sunday morning. None was injured in the incident. “The leaves of the copter were removed, and it was lifted onto the back of a lorry using a crane before it was shifted to the airport. An internal inquiry by LuLu Group has been ruled out, since it will be of little help as any such probe will involve technicalities, which domain experts alone can make sense of,” said a spokesperson of the group. The copter is being kept at a hangar at the airport being used by a company engaged for running the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility of the airport. Airport sources said a probe by the DGCA was under way. Yusuf Ali stable Meanwhile, Mr. Ali returned to Abu Dhabi on a flight sent for him by the royal family there. The businessman and wife are said to be very stable. The copter had crash-landed reportedly owing to technical snags. The pilot and others walked through hip-deep water, helped by local residents and were taken to the hospital. Mr. Ali and others had boarded the copter that bore the logo of his group from his residence at Kochu Kadavanthra to call on a relative who was admitted at a nearby hospital. It was slated to land on the Fisheries Ground at Panangad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/copter-shifted-from-crash-site-to-airport/article34307202.ece

The district has the highest number of cases for the second day. The daily test positivity rate was 17.89% when 5,743 samples were examined. According to the District Medical Officer, there were 993 cases of local transmission of the infection and the source of 14 others was not known. Kozhikode Corporation accounted for 507 locally acquired infections, Vadakara 41, and Koyilandy 36. A total of 425 people recovered from the infection and the active caseload surged to 7,182. Immunisation drive COVID vaccination camps will now be held regularly within local body limits and more first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) will be opened across the district in the coming days. According to sources in the district administration, the camps will be held in the Kozhikode Corporation area on Sundays and in municipalities on Mondays. The grama panchayats in Kozhikode taluk will be covered on Tuesdays, those in Thamarassery taluk on Thursdays, Vadakara taluk on Fridays and Koyilandy taluks on Saturdays. District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao told heads of local bodies during an online meeting that steps should be taken to avoid a lockdown. All the police stations would have a patrolling team led by an official not less than the rank of a sub inspector to monitor the compliance with protocol. Hospital beds A release said there were 3,499 beds in 21 hospitals in the district to treat the infected persons. At present, 1,874 beds were empty. Four government hospitals are designated for COVID treatment and 137 of the 297 beds are available. In 17 private hospitals, 1,737 of the 3,202 beds are vacant. Thirty-six ICUs with ventilators too are vacant. Of the total 59 ventilators, 33 are available. Care centres The district has 355 COVID care centres, 342 institutional quarantine centres and 13 paid quarantine centres. Koyilandy taluk has 93 COVID care centres, Kozhikode 138, Thamarassery 50, and Vadakara 74. Mr. Rao has directed all the local bodies with a high incidence of infection to immediately start FLTCs. Those with hotspots should have FLTCs with at least 1,000 beds. The Health Department is learnt to be taking steps to provide treatment for those in home isolation and people admitted to FLTCs as a majority of the infected are asymptomatic. Meanwhile, the district administration took over vehicles from government, semi-government, and cooperative institutions under the Disaster Management Act for COVID containment steps.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cases-cross-1000-mark-for-second-consecutive-day/article34307211.ece

They are not digressive or inflammatory, though. During polls “Where were you at the time of elections..?” now dominates the list of satirical queries that the trollers raised. Though the biting comments are often countered with witty replies, the policemen behind the awareness social media posters are grappling with the situation to prove their point with justifications, arguments, and claims. The cops post matching memes to fend off the virtual teasing. “To be frank, the corona virus was on leave during election time. It may go on leave again on May 2,” said one of the active trollers who posted his satiric notes on the Kozhikode City Police page. Another critic claims that the police have been showing a subservient attitude in enforcing the COVID protocol for politicians. He also feels that the fine for protocol violation is only an annoyance for the public. A majority of the commentators are of the view that the police have “miserably failed” to monitor the COVID-19 situation despite frequent warnings issued by the Health Department authorities and medical experts. The enforcement squads have been forgetful of the risky atmosphere throughout the election time, which can never be compensated with a delayed action, they argue. Citizens’ responsibility At the same time, the policemen who monitor the Facebook page are of the view that responsible citizens will voluntarily cooperate with the guidelines and ensure their safety considering the more demanding situation. People who do not care about personal responsibilities but call upon the police to do everything are living in fools’ paradise, they remark. Officials who are part of the social media awareness campaigns of the police in the city also point out that they take all comments positively and give friendly replies to maximum number of people to foster a healthy online interaction. The biggest advantage of trolls is that it kindles heated discussions and draws the attention of more people to the original message, they observe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/trollers-taunt-police-over-covid-advice/article34307213.ece

T. Zakir Hussain, chairman, Pathanamthitta municipality, said a note had been handed over to the district administration seeking its intervention in restoring the multi-sports arena by dismantling the three helipads. The cost of the restoration works, according to him, should be borne by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had organised the Prime Minister’s event. “Prior to the Prime Minister’s arrival, the stadium was allotted to the BJP as advised by the district administration under a strict condition that it be restored at the earliest. Electric poles removed Besides erecting the helipads on the playground, several electric poles were removed to pave way for the safe landing of choppers while the athletic track too sustained major damage,” said Mr. Hussain. According to Mr. Hussain, the decision with regard to approach the district administration was made in view of the impending uncertainty over a time-bound restoration of the public infrastructure. “We had indeed approached the authorities with this demand immediately after the Prime Minister’s visit but were asked to wait till the elections were over. Now that the elections are over, but they are yet act upon our condition,” Mr.Hussain added. The Prime Minister landed in the stadium on April 2 afternoon as part of attending an election campaign in Konni. Assistance assured After landing here, the Prime Minister proceeded to Pramadam, venue of his election campaign, by road and returned from here to Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu. Meanwhile, the BJP leadership said the issue had come to its notice and assured all assistance in reinstating the space. As the Prime Minister’s event was a political event, the BJP is committed to bearing the cost of restoring the stadium, said Ashokan Kulanada, president of the BJP district unit. Located at the heart of Pathanamthitta, the municipal stadium here witnessed several VIP arrivals including that of former Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi and V.P. Singh, in the past. Inordinate delay The inordinate delay in restoring the stadium after each VIP visit always triggered political debates in the municipal council and it was in this backdrop that the municipality, during a meeting of its council in 2007-08, decided against handing over the venue for such purposes.

Coming on the back of a bleak, pandemic-hit year, the trading community in the market is worried the COVID-19 resurgence is primed to rob them of yet another festive shopping period. Usual scene Usually teeming with customers on the days preceding such festivals, the Kothuval street, the KK Road, and the Sabapathy Kovil street witnessed dull activity on Monday with the vegetable and fruits stalls attracting few buyers and vehicles traversing the narrow roads with ease. Any hopes of sales picking up later by evening also turned to dust with a heavy downpour and gusty winds sending people indoors. “Just when we thought we were past the worst, the pandemic has returned to haunt us again,” says Krishnan, who has been running a vegetable retail stall in the market for over three decades. According to him, many traders stocked vegetables including the kani vellari ( golden cucumber), an indispensable part of the auspicious Vishu Kani well in advance, anticipating brisk business. “However, the last few days have not shown any encouraging signs yet. Fearing the possibility of crowding here, some of our frequent customers may have opted for shops nearer to their homes,” he said. Irshad, a vegetable vendor at the KK Market, believes the purchasing capacity of the people could also have fallen with many losing their jobs or suffering salary cuts since the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in many opting for low-key celebrations. Prices While the prices of perishables usually rise during such festivals, they have witnessed an unprecedented dip during the last few days. Sivan, who runs SN Vegetables in Chala, pointed out the price of shallots that had touched Rs. 130 per kg few months ago has fallen to Rs. 40 per kg. Likewise, onions sold for Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 in the retail market. While some traders sell the kani vellari for Rs. 25 per kg during the Vishu season, few others offer them at a lowly Rs. 10. The price of vellarikka (cucumber) also fell by a half from Rs. 30 to Rs. 15, while pumpkins costed Rs. 15 per kg, a marked fall from its rates ranging from Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 during Vishu the previous years. Contrastingly, the price of garlic increased from Rs. 60 per kg to touch Rs. 90 per kg. The prices of banana varieties remained largely stable. While the njalipoovan costed Rs. 40 per kg, palayankodan , nendran and robusta fetched Rs. 25, Rs. 40 and Rs. 20 respectively. The trading community hoped for a marked turnaround of fortunes on Tuesday, but fear restrictions imposed by the police to prevent crowding to play spoilsport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chala-devoid-of-vishu-shopping-fervour/article34307263.ece

In each of the 100 wards, the respective councillors led the clean-up drive on the first day. After COVID outbreak Though the civic body had carried out the clean-up activities in the Amayizhanjan canal after the COVID-19 outbreak, the canal was again filled with mounds of predominantly plastic waste.

The Corporation had put up fencing in some places and CCTV cameras too to stop this. However, most of the cameras that were installed years ago are not working at present. The plastic waste that will be removed from here will be cleaned and segregated. Mounds of mud were also removed from the drains near the New Theatre area. Over the following days, waste will be removed from the public places and the stormwater drains and canals cleared up to ease the flow of flood water. Special drive A special clean-up drive is also being organised to clear up the entire stretch of the Amayizhanjan canal. Ms. Rajendran has requested the city residents to ensure that no waste is dumped in public and that everyone makes use of the systems put in place by the Corporation for waste management at source.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-launches-pre-monsoon-cleaning/article34307768.ece

13 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||50% of city’s longest flyover completed||Overcoming many hurdles, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has completed 50% work of the upcoming 2.7-km four-lane flyover at Kazhakuttam for hassle-free entry to Technopark and through traffic from the NH 66 to the NH66 bypass extending to Karode on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. The NHAI, which had set April 2021 as the target for completing the flyover being executed as a standalone project under Engineering Procurement Construction mode, is bracing forward to finish works by October. “As many as 25 of the total 60 slabs and 57 of the total 61 piers of the flyover were completed by April first week and we hope to achieve the revised target,” a top official of the NHAI told The Hindu . Four piers The remaining four piers will be completed by the EPC contractor in the coming two to three weeks. The flyover, to be the longest in the State capital on commissioning, is coming up on piers, each 30 metre apart. The pillars coming up in the median along the four-lane NH 66 will have a diameter of four metre and the main carriageway for the road users will be 21 metre. The NHAI is relieved, as a major hurdle has been overcome with the demolishing a 11KV tower, opposite Technopark of the KSEB, carrying the extra high tension line and on laying underground cables in the one km stretch. The NHAI had provided Rs. 1.3 crore for laying the power cable of the KSEB. With the demolishing of the six-metre high tower, the authorities are hoping to expedite the remaining works in the initial 1.7 km from Technopark to Kazhakuttam of the flyover. Drains The drains had been completed and the works of the service road was in full swing. The KSEB’s poles need to be shifted to allow traffic to move along. “We have approached the police for regulating the traffic via the service road to expedite the works and to help the EPC contractor undertake the work 24 hours,” he added. Such a traffic diversion will facilitate the movement of trucks and cranes swiftly for completing the remaining works of the piers and slabs. Moreover, it has been pointed out that it will enable the EPC contractor to undertake works during the monsoon. The project got delayed over acquiring land on the stretch from Kazhakuttam to the CSI Mission Hospital for a Right of Way of 45 metre for the flyover. The Kochi-based Cherian Varkey Construction Company that had been executing the Rs. 195-crore work since April 5, 2019, had continued with work during the lockdown.

With the demand increasing, the dairy cooperative is balancing the supply with consignments from the milk-surplus Malabar region and States such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Sales in the capital city and suburbs have risen from approximately 2.06 lakh litres in the pre-summer months to 2.20 lakh litres during March and April. Milk procurement in the district has experienced a dip due to the shortage of green fodder during the summer. Milk procurement from farmers in the district stands at 1.55 lakh litres at present. The rest is being met through milk ‘imports’ from outside the district. “The demand for milk has risen during the summer months. At the same time, we are not facing a shortage. We are meeting the demand-supply gap with consignments from the Malabar region that has surplus milk and also Tamil Nadu and Karnataka that too has a surplus at the moment,” an official of the Thiruvananthapuram Regional Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union (TRCMPU), one of three Milma regional unions, said. Three types TRCMPU currently sells three milk types—the yellow sachet double toned milk (1.5% fat), the blue sachet toned milk (3% fat), and the new green sachet (4.5%) milk introduced last year. The sale of the latter stands at around 15,000 litres per day. Statewide, Milma had recently enhanced the subsidy on its cattle feed by Rs. 30 to Rs. 100 per bag.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/milk-sales-up-in-capital/article34307268.ece

An official said the government had to walk a tight rope between reining in the flare-up and keeping the economy ticking. It had to convince people to shed their complacency and realise the pandemic had not run its course in Kerala. The election season had contributed to the summer surge in new cases. District administrations could issue further guidelines or impose higher restrictions as the ground situation demanded. The police had reportedly argued against sweeping restrictions. They have appealed for limiting curbs to pandemic hotspots. A law enforcer said the public seemed to resent the attempt to restrict mobility and regulate trade.

Fifteen students from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are staying in a single room in the cellar of a hostel after they were thrown out of the hostel for not paying the fee. The parents are not in a position to pay the fee as they depended on the State government’s scholarship sanctioned to them. Magbul Jan, hailing from Hindupur, told The Hindu at the Collector office on Monday that her daughter Ms. Rubiya Khanam had got admitted to Davao Medical School Foundation INC. at Davavo University in the Philippines and applied for the State government’s scholarship. She got the E-Pass also, but the amount was not being released despite the sanction for the past one year. “The total cost of the MBBS education at the university was supposed to be Rs. 30 lakh for the entire study period and out of that we were promised Rs. 10 lakh scholarship before the pandemic broke out, and the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government had enhanced the amount to Rs. 15 lakh later. However, about 560 such students were still waiting for the release of the money,” she said. About 160 students from Andhra Pradesh had applied under the Minority Welfare Department and the others under the Economically Backward Classes and the BC quota, she explained. Hit by pandemic Engaged in textile and sari business in Hindupur, they were confident of raising Rs. 20 lakh over the five-year period. “However, the pandemic and the lockdown broke our back as business has slumped from Rs. 11,000 a day to Rs. 1,500,” Ms. Jan said. “We wanted to raise funds by mortgaging our house, but couldn’t do even that as it is an old house with no municipal permissions built before my marriage,” she added. Ms. Magbul came to the Collectorate to urge the Collector for the scholarship amount or permission to sell her kidney to raise the funds. “I am in a desperate situation as I cannot see my daughter suffer in inhuman conditions, living in a single room along with 14 others with just one bathroom to share,” she bemoaned. “The front desk at Spandana does not give a receipt as it is COVID time and the District Collector is busy addressing a large gathering of volunteers and I cannot meet him,” she lamented. “I am not sure if my grievance will be taken up or if it will reach the District Collector. I had met him once in the past, but no action has been taken so far,” she said. Many suffering Another person, Prasada Reddy, had sent his son to the United Kingdom for engineering education and is now raising loans mortgaging his wife’s gold to pay for his son’s studies as he is yet to get the scholarship amount. His wife had gone all the way to the Chief Minister’s office on a scooter from Hindupur, last year, but was not allowed to meet him.

Warning given They reportedly warned him against taking up the plantation drive in what they claimed as their “podu land”, before letting him off, the sources added. Sources in the Forest Department said trenches had been dug and the final arrangements were under way to take up the plantation drive on the Chintaguppa forest land under the CAMPA. Efforts were under way to retrieve all the identified encroached forest land and take up afforestation activities in the Bhadrachalam division, sources said. Cases registered Based on a complaint by Chintaguppa forest beat officer Rajesh, the Dummugudem police registered cases against more than 10 villagers of Chintaguppa under different sections of the Indian Penal Code on various charges, such as obstructing the forest staff from discharging their designated duties and trying to attack them. A video of the Chintaguppa incident went viral on social media, following which the higher officials initiated a detailed inquiry into the incident to identify the persons who were involved in the alleged attack on the forest beat officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tribals-thrash-telangana-forest-officer/article34306994.ece
13 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Tika Utsav’ to be one-day event in Chittoor||Chittoor district COVID Vaccination Special Officer M. Sireesha said that they had to cut down ‘Tika Utsav’, a four-day vaccination festival, due to shortage of vaccine doses. The programme would be undertaken all over the district only on April 14, for which more than 50,000 doses has been kept ready. “There might be some delay in arrival of vaccine doses for now, but each and every person in the district would be covered as per schedules, with current focus on those aged 45 and above,” she said. Meanwhile, the district on Monday recorded as many as 654 COVID cases, showing a slight decline compared to the figures of the last two days which added to 1,459. Though the district police administration has stepped up efforts to enforce the facemask rule at all vulnerable areas, particularly targeting the border towns and villages adjoining Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the success rate is perceived to be around below 50%. Masks distributed In order to intensify the campaign, Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar launched distribution of masks to the public at several places under Chittoor municipal corporation limits. Public Relations Officer (District Police Office) Nayeem Baig said that police personnel in all mandals in Madanapalle, Palamaner, Chittoor and Puttur sub-divisions had started imposing hefty fines on the public violating the facemask rule. This campaign would be further intensified, he said. District Collector M. Hari Narayanan held an emergency meeting with the medical and health department officials at Tirupati on Monday to take stock of the COVID situation in Tirupati and Chittoor municipal corporations. He instructed all medical and paramedical staff to be ready to resume COVID duties once again. The Collector said over 3,500 beds have been kept ready at both government and private facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tika-utsav-to-be-one-day-event-in-chittoor/article34307741.ece

Chandrababu Naidu that the YSRCP was behind the stone-pelting at him during a public meeting in Tirupati. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy alleged TDP leaders engineered the incident hoping to win the election in Tirupati by indulging in mudslinging at the YSRCP.

13 April 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Only 4% of Polavaram evacuees rehabilitated’||Lawyers, SC and ST rights activists and tribal people led by the Indian Association of Lawyers (IAL) on Monday claimed that the rehabilitation and resettlement of only 4% of the oustees of Polavaram irrigation project have been completed, despite the government’s plan to complete the construction of the project by the year-end. In a media conference held here, IAL State executive member Ainavarapu Suryanarayana said said that about 53% of the total 5.8 lakh the Polavaram project oustees are tribals. “By April, only 4,000 of the more than 1.5 lakh affected families have been rehabilitated. The Andhra Pradesh High Court has mandated the completion of the rehabilitation and resettlement process on par with the construction of the project. However, the State government appears to be preparing to force the oustees to leave their habitation without compensating them,” said Mr. Suryanarayana. Polavaram Nirvasithula Hakkula Porata Committee convener A. Veerabhadra Reddy said that the construction work on the project site should be stopped until thousands of tribal families were rehabilitated. “We never opposed the project. We only appeal to the government to provide the oustees the assured compensation,” he said. "The successive Central and State governments never set any deadline to complete the rehabilitation and resettlement process. However, they always focus on completing the project within the deadline, throwing tribals out of the project sites,” said Mr. Veerabhadra Reddy. East Godavari District SC&ST Vigilance and Monitoring Committee member Aithabattula Rameswara Rao said that the State and the Centre should own the responsibility of ensuring financial and social security to the evacuees as per the existing laws. “However, such an initiate is yet to be seen in over a decade,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/only-4-of-polavaram-evacuees-rehabilitated/article34307703.ece

Holding a roadshow in Gudur on Monday, Dr. Chinta Mohan said the promised public sector port remained a non-starter as the ruling BJP at the Centre and the ruling YSR Congress Party in the State remained indifferent to the cause to favour a private port player. The opposition Telugu Desam Party also did a disservice to the State’s cause when it was in power, alleged the former Union Minister. The Congress party candidate for the Tirupati Lok Sabha byelection asserted that he would leave no stone unturned to anchor the major port as it was imperative for the development of the backward region. All sections of people were fed up with the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Jagan Mohan Reddy government in the State, which competed with each other in imposing hefty taxes on petrol, diesel, cooking gas and other essential commodities making the lives of the common people miserable on one hand, and currying favours with the big corporate firms on the other he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/will-make-dugarajapatnam-port-project-a-reality-chinta/article34307692.ece
13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||No need to probe WhatsApp chats of Justice Eswaraiah: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday found no reason for an inquiry into a WhatsApp chat between retired Andhra High Court judge, Justice V. Eswaraiah, and a suspended judicial officer about alleged benami transactions in the Amaravati land scam case. A Bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan and R. Subhash Reddy said the High Court order for an inquiry by retired apex court judge, Justice R.V. Raveendran, was unwarranted as Justice Eswaraiah himself had admitted to having had the conversation. The Andhra Pradesh High Court had directed an inquiry into the transcript to find out the authenticity or genuineness of the conversation contained in a pen drive. “...We are of the view that the direction by the High Court calling for a report from Justice R.V. Raveendran need not be allowed to continue. We order accordingly,” the court said. During the hearing, prominent members of the Supreme Court Bar like senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Vipin Nair had sought a thorough probe into the chat. “We are of the view that the High Court ought not to have embarked on any other enquiry in the matter, except to the maintainability of the PIL at the instance of the writ petitioner and the conversation dated July 20, 2020 filed before the High Court as well, as the enquiry report sought was only with the above purpose,” the apex court said. It clarified that it had neither entered into the merits of the writ petition (pending before HC), nor was it expressing any opinion on the maintainability of the PIL.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-need-to-probe-whatsapp-chats-of-justice-eswaraiah-sc/article34307712.ece
13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||SC judge recuses from Maudany bail hearing||Supreme Court judge, Justice V. Ramasubramanian, recused himself on Monday from hearing a plea by PDP leader Abdul Nazir Maudany to relax his bail condition and permit him to stay in his hometown in Kerala till the pendency of the trial in the 2008 Bengaluru bomb blast case, in which he is an accused. The Bench, headed by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde, and including Justice A.S. Bopanna, adjourned the hearing. Justice Ramasubramanian recollected in court that he had appeared for Maudany, presently represented by senior advocate Jayant Bhushan and advocate Haris Neeraj, before the Madras High Court several years ago. The CJI had orally remarked that Maudany was a “dangerous man” in the previous hearing. In 2014, the court had granted Maudany bail on the ground that he had already undergone judicial custody for four years since August 2010 and was suffering from various health ailments. The Supreme Court’s bail came after the Karnataka authorities had undertaken to complete the trial within four months from November 14, 2014. “More than six years have elapsed and the trial has still not been concluded. The trial was protracted on account of the lethargic attitude of the respondent (State of Karnataka). The case before the trial court is crawling at a snail’s pace and the progress of the trial was hampered on several occasions due to various reasons such as recall and re-examination of witnesses, transfer of special public prosecutor thrice, transfer of presiding officer thrice and now on account of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic,” Maudany’s present application said. The prosecution miserably failed to adhere to the schedule of the trial fixed earlier, it said. “On many occasions the trial was delayed, even scuttled due to the inability of bringing the witnesses on time,” it said. “He has spent 11 years in jail since arrest and seven years under conditional bail,” the application said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sc-judge-recuses-from-maudany-bail-hearing/article34307000.ece
13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Election for 3 Kerala RS seats on April 30||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Monday announced that polls to three Rajya Sabha seats from Kerala, which it had earlier scheduled for April 12 but later put off, would take place on April 30. The Kerala High Court had earlier on Monday directed the commission to complete the elections before May 2. The ECI had on March 17 announced elections to fill the three seats being vacated due to the retirement of MPs Abdul Wahab, K.K. Ragesh and Vayalar Ravi on April 21. “However, on the eve of the date on which the Notification was to be issued, the Commission received a reference from the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India, wherein a question of constitutional propriety was raised,” the ECI said in a statement on Monday. Elections to the Kerala Assembly were held on April 6 and results would be announced on May 2. The ECI decided to keep the notification in abeyance to examine the issue. Notification today On Monday, the ECI said it had decided to hold the elections, with the notification for polls to be issued on Tuesday, the last date for making nominations on April 20, the last date for withdrawal of candidature on April 23 and polling and counting of votes on April 30. HC directive to ECI Special Correspondent writes from Kochi: The High Court on Monday ordered the ECI to take expeditious steps to compete the election process before May 2. Justice P.V. Asha observed that “when the commission itself has admitted that it is duty-bound to conduct the election and complete the process at the earliest, it is only appropriate that it takes expeditious steps to complete the election before another electorate comes into existence on May 2, 2021.” The court added that the commission, which was fully aware of its duty conferred under Article 324 of the Constitution, had to expedite the proceedings to see to it that the representation in the Upper House from Kerala was always in full swing and to avoid a situation where the nomination was made by the existing Assembly and voting by another Assembly. ‘Not any date’ The court noted that once the counting for the Assembly polls was over and on declaration by the returning officer, there would be another electorate. It could have been avoided if the election was held as scheduled before May 2, the counting date. The fact that it was up to the commission to fix the schedule of the election would not mean that the commission could fix any date. It was incumbent on the commission to act fairly and legally as Article 324 was “geared to the accomplishment of free and fair elections expeditiously”. The court issued the directives while disposing of writ petitions by the Kerala Legislative Assembly Secretary and S. Sarma, CPI(M) MLA, challenging the commission’s decision to keep in abeyance the election process for the three vacancies from the State in the Rajya Sabha. EC’s version The Election Commission had submitted that the elections would be held during the tenure of the present Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/election-for-3-kerala-rs-seats-on-april-30/article34306995.ece
13 April 2021||ONGOLE/NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Tika Utsav’ damp squib in South Coastal A.P.||The ambitious ‘vaccination festival’ remained a non-starter on Monday even as two more persons succumbed to the infection in SPSR Nellore district taking the death toll in South Coastal region to 1,112. No person was vaccinated on the second day of the ‘Tika Utsav’ following delay in replenishment of vaccine stocks by the Centre. The health authorities had zero vaccine stocks on Monday when the number of active cases shot up to 3,353 in the districts of SPSR Nellore and Prakasam.

Allaying the fears of the people who are awaiting their turn to take the jab, the Minister said vaccination would be a continuous process and all persons above aged above 45 would be covered on a saturation basis. “The drive will be undertaken vigorously from April 14 by setting up session sites in all the village secretariats,” said Prakasam District Collector P. Bhaskar. ‘Stocks latest by Tuesday’ Prakasam District Medical and Health Officer P. Ratnavalli said the district administration expected 50,000 to 60,000 doses of vaccine latest by Tuesday. Taking note of the spurt in new cases, she said while those with mild symptoms would be put in home isolation, those experiencing severe symptoms would be hospitalised. As many as 352 persons tested positive for the disease in the region in a span of 24 hours. While SPSR Nellore district accounted for 1,848 active cases, Prakasam accounted for 1,305 cases, according to a health bulletin released by the State government.

13 April 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||For the second day in a row, district goes without vaccines||For the second day in a row, the district has gone without the vaccination drive. The stock for both the variants of vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — is learnt to have dried out and there will be no vaccination on Tuesday, primarily due to ‘no stock’ and secondly being a holiday on the occasion of Ugadi (Telugu New Year). It is learnt that the State might receive about three lakh vials by Tuesday, and each district may get around 30,000 vials. But health experts say that it will not be sufficient. “And when it concerns the district, if 30,000 inoculation per day is the target, then we should have at least sufficient number of vials for one lakh jabs, over a period of three days,” said District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar. Each 5 ml vial of the vaccine has 10 doses in total. And, once opened, all 10 doses have to be consumed within four hours. Health experts say that the second wave is on and the variants appear to spread much faster than the earlier one. This is the time we need to vaccinate more number of people and the manufacturers need to rise to the occasion. Doctors in the Health Department and KGH say that the Union government should speed up the distribution of Russia’s Sputnik V and also fast-track Johnson and Johnson single-dose vaccine trial. 400 new cases, 1 death For the second day in a row, the COVID-19 cases crossed the 400-mark. In the last 24 hours, the district recorded 404 new cases taking the total tally to 65,674. The active cases have also gone up to 2,846. With one more death, the total toll has gone up to 559.

TTD Health Officer R.R. Reddy, under whose aegis the rallies were organised in Tirumala and Tirupati, appealed to the devotees not to carry either plastic water bottles while trekking along the footpaths or throw the plastic waste on the ghat roads. Two teams have already been pressed into service to educate trekking pilgrims, and to clear the plastic waste. Dr. Reddy said that the TTD had already set up 88 Jalaprasadams (RO plants) units for the benefit of pilgrims after the imposition of a ban on the use of plastic in January last year. About 4.4 lakh litres of purified water is made available through these units and devotees can avail the free facility round-the-clock at Tirumala.

Earlier, the TTD had decided to make public all the epigraphical, astrological and mythological evidences it had collected in support of its claim on Ugadi, the Telugu New Year’s Day, on Tuesday.

13 April 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Religion takes centre stage in Tirupati bypoll||In a major deviation from the past, the Tirupati parliamentary constituency is witnessing an unusually different narrative this by-election, where the focus is not on the party’s promises or other burning issues, but the candidate’s faith. During the last couple of days, the two major parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) resorted to mudslinging on the rival candidates with regard to their religion. BJP national secretary and State co-in-charge Sunil Deodhar, whose recent tweet on Tirumala chief priest Ramana Deekshitulu raised hackles in the TTD as well as the government circles, took the next potshot by daring Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to divulge the religion of his party candidate M. Gurumoorthy. In his tweet posted on Sunday, Mr. Deodhar sought to know why Dr. Gurumoorthy had not taken Balaji darshan till now. “Is he also a Christian masking himself as a Hindu SC, like your HM? If so, then you’re cheating people & Christ too,” read his tweet. He posted another tweet showing Dr. Gurumoorthy praying at a Gudur church, with the message: “This is breach of Constitution which says Christians can’t contest from SC constituencies. You’re backstabbing SCs. BJP-JSP will fail your hidden agenda”. Following up on Monday, he tweeted a screenshot of the Facebook page of AP State Christian Youth Council president Rev. Abilash, who is also a pastor at Holy Prayer Church, Gudur (the post has since been removed), which acknowledged Dr. Gurumoorthy praying at the church on the day of filing the nomination. The BJP’s position was no better vis-a-vis posts questioning the candidate’s faith. The day the former bureaucrat from Karnataka K. Ratna Prabha was named the BJP candidate, similar posts surfaced on the social media, questioning her faith. A post accused her of practising Christianity, though her certificate showed her as Hindu SC. The controversy later subsided on its own. On Sunday, Syed Shafi Ahmed Qadari, the government-appointed Qazi, stoked controversy by holding a meeting of Muthavalis at a Tirupati mosque, where he allegedly canvassed for the YSRCP.  Is M. Gurumoorthy also a Christian masking himself as a Hindu SC, like your HM?

With the Centre announcing lockdown on March 23 last year, and the government cancelling trains, buses and other means of transport, the labourers faced severe hardship in returning to their hometowns. Thousands of them from Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Telangana, who were working in various sectors in the State, were forced to trek their way home carrying children and belongings on shoulders in hot sun. A few of them died en route. Some video clippings being circulated in social media are reportedly adding to their worry. “As lockdown has been imposed in some parts of the neighbouring States, our family members fear that a similar situation may come here and want us to come back,” says a labourer Maghi. The Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), Vijayawada, P. Srinivas says that some people are posting clippings of rush at railway and bus stations of the last year’s lockdown period in some groups, which is creating panic among the migrants. “Indian Railways has not cancelled any trains in the wake of the second wave of COVID-19. We are running special trains to many sections,” he says. “There is no proposal to cancel trains to any State,” clarifies Vijayawada Senior Divisional Commercial Manager P. Bhaskar Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/migrants-homeward-bound-once-again-fearing-fresh-lockdown/article34307795.ece
13 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Is bickering hurting YSRCP Krishna unit?||All appear to be not well in the Krishna district unit of the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) if the exchange of taunts and jibes between the party leaders in the presence of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is any indication. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy took part in a programme ‘Volunteer laku Vandanam’ organised to honour village and ward volunteers with the Seva Mitra, the Seva Ratna and the Seva Vajra awards at Poranki, on the eve of Ugadi on Monday. Friend or foe? During the programme, Transport Minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) hinted of a distance between him and Penamaluru MLA and former Minister Kolusu Parthasarathi. The Minister recalled that they had been friends since college days. “The friendship continued after both of us entered the political arena. I used to copy the good programmes implemented by Mr. Parthasarathi in his constituency, so did he. We used to discuss the programmes announced by the Chief Minister. But of late, there is a slowdown in the process. Nevertheless, we are pals,” said Mr. Nani. Mr. Parthasarathi corroborated the lines of Mr. Nani in a way, but sought to turn the tables by saying, “Sir (Chief Minister), I am trying to be close with Mr. Nani. But, it appears he has no time to spare after he was made a Minister.” Tussle for power Earlier, Mr. Parthasarathi addressed Chief Minister Programmes convener Talasila Raghu Ram as his guru, which raised many eyebrows. Party sources say, a tussle is going on for getting the upper hand in the party district unit. It is no secret that Mr. Nani and Mr. Parthasarathi used to vie for Ministerial berths during the Chief Ministerial tenure of Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in the combined Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Parthasarathi lost the race for a Cabinet berth after YSRCP came to power in 2019 elections. He and other senior leaders such as Samineni Udaya Bhanu have been with the party since it was in the Opposition after State bifurcation in 2014.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/is-bickering-hurting-ysrcp-krishna-unit/article34307708.ece

The Kisan Rail has given a big boost to mango trade in the State,” Mr. Goutham Reddy added. He also sought the introduction of ‘Kisan Rails’ for transporting bananas and tomatoes from the State. In its message on Twitter, the South Central Railway said 220 tonnes of mango was loaded from Nuzvid. It was the first mango rake to be loaded from Nuzvid railway station after a gap of six years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mekapati-thanks-union-minister-piyush-goyal-for-kisan-rail/article34307709.ece

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||A New Year and healthier beginnings!||Eons ago, the great Indian Mathematician Bhaskaracharya formulated the lunar based Hindu calendar. As per his calculations, the first day falling on the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha) of the first month (Chaitra Masa) in the first season of the year i.e. Spring (Vasanta-Ritu) is celebrated as Ugadi, the commencement of a New Year. The word Ugadi came from yuga + aadi, yuga means era, aadi means start, the start of a new era and beginning of a new Hindu lunar calendar with a change in the moon’s orbit. Ugadi celebrates the commencement of a new year with new fruits, fresh greens, and vibrant flowers. Spring represents a fresh start to life in nature, similarly Ugadi symbolises a fresh and auspicious start to the year. As per Hindu mythology, it was on this day that Lord Brahma created the universe; implying that anything initiated on this day is bound to be bountiful and successful. Each year of the Hindu lunar calendar is given a specific name, which repeats every sixty years. This year, starting April 14, 2021, is named as ‘plava’, which is believed to be the year of wisdom and knowledge. The most significant aspect of the day in any Telugu household is having Ugadi-pachhidi. Alluding to the agricultural background of our culture, and emphasising the advent of everything new in nature, it is made of new jaggery, seasonal raw mango pieces, freshly blossomed neem flowers, salt, green chillies, and freshly harvested tamarind. The pachhidi is an insinuation that there are six basic tastes of life – the shadhruchulu, - specifically - sadness, happiness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise. The pachiddi, made with six different tastes is to remind oneself that life is a mixture of good and bad, joy and sorrow and all of them have to be treated alike.  Healthy offerings at   Syamala Dry Fruits  If the earlier year has taught us anything, it is the importance of health and hygiene. But more meaningfully, it has taught us the necessity of building up our own immunity and eating healthy. It is with precisely these two aspects, that Syamala Dry Fruits started their venture in Vizag – eating healthy nutrients and enhancing one’s immunity. With two branches in Vizag and four in Kakinada, the stores are packed with healthy, tasty and innovative products. While nuts and spices of all kinds are the mainstays, the outlets stock much more. Ranging from cleaned and hygienically packed millets to exotic premium quality genuine spices. A variety of teas, sauces, syrups, and gourmet ingredients. Dry fruit ice-creams, dry fruit milk shakes as well as innovative dry fruit snacks, sweets and tarts provide mouth-watering yet very healthy temptations. Many of the dry-fruit creations are flavoured with natural sweeteners like dates, figs and jaggery instead of refined sugar. Superior quality, reasonable prices, and a stress on genuineness of the products are the key factors that they adhere to, ensuring customer satisfaction. Start the New Year with something healthy and delicious at Syamala Dry Fruit store.  Auspicious beginnings with Sukhibhava  Ugadi heralds a new year, and is considered to be the harbinger of good fortunes and success. The day itself is considered to be very auspicious for new beginnings. Which is why many people consider making investments, especially in real estate on this day. Providing a range of properties of pick an choose from in and around Visakhapatnam is Sukhibhava, a real estate firm in Visakhapatnam. In the business for the last twenty years, Sukhibhava takes pride in helping people invest at the right time in the right area to reap high profits in return.

Comparatively low testing, which is the norm on Sundays, is believed to be the reason for detection of fewer cases. While 1,15,311 samples were examined on Saturday, only 79,027 were tested on Sunday. Results of 2,975 were awaited.  Six more patients died, pushing up the toll to 1,968.

13 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Water Board to take up door-to-door seeding of Aadhaar numbers||In order to fastpace the Aadhaar linkage for providing the 20,000 litres free water supply per month to all the eligible citizens, the State government has begun door-to-door enumeration of the consumers and seeding of their Aadhaar numbers with the water connection. While the option is open for consumers to establish Aadhaar linkage online, through Mee Seva centres, or other means, the aim of door-to-door visits is to expedite the process, officials from the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board informed. The Board has tied up with the Telangana State Technology Services Limited for carrying out the door-to-door Aadhar linkage. Accordingly, outsourced personnel have started to visit each household to collect the Aadhaar details, Property Tax Identification Number (PTIN) and phone numbers of the residents. Fingerprints of the residents are being collected using biometric devices supplied by the TSTS. “Our representatives are visiting the apartment complexes as well as individual households, to enumerate the number of families and the amount of water they are eligible to draw free of charges. This is to speed up the Aadhaar linkage process,” said an official from the Board. In case of apartment complexes, PTINs and Aadhaar details of each apartment are collected separately on the same unique Customer Account Number, for computation of 20,000 litres of water per household per month. Accordingly, if a complex has 15 flats, they will be eligible to draw a total of three lakh litres of free water per month, though government is yet to make an official statement about the same. Wherever the houses are rented out and owners’ Aadhaar details are not available, the same of the tenants are being used to seed with the CAN, officials informed. Though the city has close to 10 lakh households with non-slum domestic water connections, not even two lakh connections have been seeded with Aadhaar so far, due to which the Board has undertaken door-to-door exercise, sources informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/water-board-to-take-up-door-to-door-seeding-of-aadhaar-numbers/article34307600.ece
13 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KTR warns BJP leaders against making ‘irresponsible’ comments||TRS working president and Minister K.T. Rama Rao warned the BJP leaders against making “irresponsible” comments on Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and asserted that the ruling party can give a befitting reply to all the charges raised by the BJP. Speaking to reporters in Warangal on Monday after launching several developmental works, Mr. Rama Rao launched a broadside against the BJP leaders and its leadership for not fulfilling the promises it made ahead of elections. Instead, the BJP leaders are indulging in “cheap politics” by criticising the TRS president, he said. He recalled how the Prime Minister Narendra Mod-led government assured to give two crore jobs a year and failed to fulfil the promise in the last seven years. “Leave alone creating new jobs, the government is indulging in the sale of public sector undertakings thereby leading to huge job losses,” he said. Promises like reducing the prices of petrol and LPG cylinders based on which the BJP sought votes in 2014 polls too remained unfulfilled and the prices of these commodities are skyrocketing since the BJP came to power. The same is the situation with promises like railway coach factory in Kazipet and steel plant in Bayyaram, he said. “The BJP leaders are shamelessly making comments against the Chief Minister in spite of receiving severe drubbing in the elections. They are brainwashing youth and misleading them in the process,” he said. Mr. Rama Rao said at a time when the governments in BJP-ruled States failed to provide employment to youth, the TRS government had filled 1.32 lakh vacancies and notifications for 50,000 more jobs are in the pipeline, he said. He appealed to the youth not to take to extreme steps by believing the propaganda of the BJP and said the T-BJP and the T-Congress units owe their existence to the TRS and Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao. “Where were these parties before TRS? These leaders had no existence in the erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh,” he said. Seeking the cooperation of people in ensuring the victory of the TRS in the ensuing elections to Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation, he said the TRS government would welcome a healthy contest if the parties are prepared. “We will issue a white paper on the funds spent for the development of GWMC since the TRS took over the reins,” he said. Mr. Rama Rao recalled that the government had spent Rs. 1,589 crore as part of providing safe drinking water to all households in the corporation, and launched works worth another Rs. 900 crore. “The TRS is committed to bring metro rail services to Warangal and airport at Mamnoor,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-warns-bjp-leaders-against-making-irresponsible-comments/article34307616.ece
13 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||4.64 lakh more vaccine doses for Telangana||COVID-19 vaccine shortage in Telangana has been addressed for the next few days as it was set to receive 4.64 lakh vaccine doses on Monday night. The State was left with only 5.66 lakh doses till Saturday evening which would have lasted only three days. The vaccine shortage was flagged on Saturday. In fact, the vaccination drive was stopped temporarily at some private hospitals as the doses were not supplied to them. Officials from the State Health department said since the doses were in short supply, they gave priority to government vaccination centres by either holding back further doses to some private hospitals or gave only around 50 doses. “We also took back doses from private hospitals which were receiving only five to six beneficiaries a day. And we have asked some corporate hospitals to limit their beneficiaries to around 50. They were vaccinating around 400-500 per day,” sources in the department said. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar wrote to Union health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday stating that the State was left with only 5.66 lakh vaccine doses which would last three days at the maximum. He requested at least 30 lakh more doses of the vaccine for the State to cover the next 15 days. On Monday, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said that 4.64 doses were expected by night. The State had received 26.78 lakh doses so far. Of those, 22.50 lakh were exhausted. Around one lakh people are being given the vaccine in the State every day. On Saturday, a little over 1.5 lakh beneficiaries took the vaccine. The aim is to vaccinate two lakh persons a day. According to the daily media bulletin, 21,58,837 doses have been administered, putting the vaccine wastage at 2.77%. “Since the additional doses will be sufficient only for a few days, we would give priority to government vaccination centres,” sources in the department said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/464l-vaccine-doses-for-ts/article34307582.ece
13 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Human rights panel moved over pothole peril||The Telangana State Human Rights Commission (TSHRC) has issued a notice over a pothole after a citizen invoked the Right to Life guarantee under Article 21 of Indian Constitution. “The potholes are all over the city and causing health issues to most of the citizens’ lives since the GHMC is not paying attention. This is violating my right to life which includes right to a clean environment under Article 21 of Indian Constitution,” was the plea made by Vinay Vangala after he hurt his spine while navigating a pothole near Chandanagar. The TSHRC has asked the Chandanagar police to find the ownership of the road stretch that had the pothole due to which Mr. Vangala was injured. “…Whether they have collected any information/material to the effect whether the road on which the alleged pothole is there belongs to GHMC or State Highways and what’s the action taken so far,” says the SHRC notice to Chandanagar Police. It was around 8.30 a.m. on December 3 when Mr Vangala hurt his spine due to the pothole and had to go to hospital for treatment. “My spine got hurt due to the pothole on Gangaram main highway, Chandanagar. I had complained to Cyberabad Police to take action against the authorities concerned for negligence of duty. Since they didn’t take action, I approached HRC. Lot of people are affected directly and indirectly, physically and mentally,” says Mr. Vangala about his motivation for petitioning the TSHRC. In February, two young men lost their lives when they tried to dodge a pothole and were run over by a heavy-duty vehicle near the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station. Nationally, 2,140 persons were killed due to potholes in 2019, according to Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) data. Potholes account for nearly 2% road accidents, 2.1% road accident deaths and 1.6% of injuries. Road features more prone to road accidents include potholes and ongoing construction work. In the million-plus cities, ongoing road works/road under construction account for 3.5% of road accidents, 3.1 percent of deaths and 3.8% injuries, suggests a MORTH document.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-human-rights-commission-moved-over-pothole-peril/article34307607.ece

Tuesday will be the 30th day of the month of Shabaan. The first roza will be on Wednesday. Meanwhile, with scores of Muslims wondering whether the taraweeh (special night prayers) will be permitted in mosques, the District Minorities Development Officer Mohammed Khasim confirmed that the government has not issued any restrictions in this regard like it did last year. “The only thing that will be done is maintaining COVID-19 protocols such as physical distancing and sanitisation. I am at the Macca Masjid making arrangements for the same,” he said. Charminar legislator Mumtaz Ahmed Khan visited the Macca Masjid where he inspected Ramzan preparedness. Appealing to those visiting the mosque to take precautions, he said, “It is my humble request that those who are coming here to pray, please bring your prayer mats, wear a mask, do your ablutions at home. Inside the masjid, it is most important to maintain distance between one another. Whether the government says it or not, it is important to take care of ourselves, as the virus is spreading fast”. Mr Khan said that those trying to enter the mosque without wearing masks would be ‘strictly’ sent back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ramzan-to-begin-tomorrow/article34307589.ece

13 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS failed to stop A.P.’s RLIP: Jeevan Reddy||Senior Congress leader and MLC T. Jeevan Reddy has alleged that grave injustice is being done to combined Mahabubnagar and Nalgonda districts by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government as it is unable to stop Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP) taken up by Andhra Pradesh. He observed that A.P. Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy had taken up RLIP by showing the drawal of third tmc ft of water from Kaleshwaram project by Telangana. Although the State government was unable to completely utilise even the 2 tmc ft of water lifted every day with Kaleshwaram project, the lifting of third tmc ft works were taken up only to get commissions, Mr. Reddy said speaking to newspersons here on Monday. Stating that Telangana State was formed for its rights on river water, jobs and funds the Congress leader said the TRS was unable to stop A.P. from going ahead with RLIP taken up illegally in violation of the riparian rights of Telangana and also in violation of the tribunal allocations. The State government was not able to stop RLIP which was also in violation of A.P. Reorganisation Act. Accusing Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of failing to stop RLIP, Mr. Jeevan Reddy said the AP’s project was not only likely to deny water to combined Mahabubnagar and Nalgonda districts but would also make Telangana lose its legitimate rights over the river water share. He faulted the Chief Minister for his approval for bringing projects under the purview of the river board without any clarity over sharing of waters between Telangana and A.P. Mr. Rao had no moral right to seek votes in Nagarjunasagar as he had failed to stop the illegal project of A.P. He also faulted the Chief Minister proposed public meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Jeevan Reddy also criticised the State government for keeping the Srisailam Left Bank Canal project incomplete even seven years after formation of the State. On the announcement of Y.S. Sharmila, daughter of Chief Minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, to launch a party in Telangana the Congress leader said they would welcome it as another political party and also welcome its efforts to point out the failures of the TRS government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-failed-to-stop-aps-rlip-jeevan-reddy/article34307753.ece

13 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||No orders on pleas to stop KCR poll meet||Justice G. Sri Devi of Telangana High Court on Monday declined to pass any orders in two separate writ petitions seeking to stall ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) from holding a public meeting to be addressed on Wednesday by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhara Rao in connection with Nagarjunasagar byelection. The judge instructed the HC Registry to post the two pleas before the appropriate bench. One of the petitions was filed by an independent candidate of the byelection Dhanawawth Kiran Kumar. He sought instructions to the government and the byelection authorities to strictly enforce the guidelines issued by Election Commission of India to be followed in conduct of elections or byelections during COVID-19 time. Compliance with the guidelines would help check the spread of coronavirus, he contended. The judge sought to know from the petitioner’s counsel as to why names of the political parties violating the guidelines issued by the ECI were not mentioned in the writ petition. The political parties should have been made parties in the plea, she said describing the petition as vague and incomplete. Advocate General B.S. Prasad, appearing for the State, told the bench that political parties were conducting public meetings as part of their campaign wherever elections were held in the country. Already, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party convened public meetings in Nagarjunasagar byelection, he said. Even national leaders were participating in such election meetings, he noted. The second petition was moved by Goli Saidi Reddy and Goli Srinivas Reddy. They contended that the public meeting to be addressed by TRS supremo K. Chandrasekhar Rao was being convened in a land of theirs spread over 56 guntas. They sought directions to the authorities to stall the meeting. The judge said the file of the petition was not received by the bench and hence it could not be heard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-orders-on-pleas-to-stop-kcr-poll-meet/article34307612.ece

Mr. Sanjay participated in the bypoll campaign for his candidate Ravikumar Naik by addressing road shows in various villages of Gurrampode mandal in the district. The party chief was seen reading out details of the schemes and the allocated funds, vis-à-vis its implementation in Telangana. He said the entire administration of gram panchayats, construction of toilets, roads and lighting, the employment guarantee scheme, irrigation, among several other schemes, are being funded under schemes of the BJP-led government. “But in Telangana, they are branded differently. Even funds for graveyards are by BJP. Although the Centre made allocations for housing, the TRS government did not build any 2BHK in Nagarjunasagar,” he said. Ms. Vijayashanti also addressed people of Nagarjunasagar through her road shows. She said TRS is heavily indulging in distribution of liquor and cash in tandas to make voters insensible. She also alleged that the TRS leaders are going to the extent of telling elderly people and weaker sections of the society that welfare benefits would not reach them if a non-TRS candidate is elected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-schemes-are-being-sponsored-by-bjp-funds/article34307610.ece

13 April 2021||P Sridhar,TELANGANA||Veteran CPI(M) leader Kunja Bojji passes away||Veteran CPI (M) leader Kunja Bojji, a three-time MLA from the ST-reserved Bhadrachalam constituency, died in Telangana's temple town of Bhadrachalam on Monday morning, after a prolonged illness. He was 95. The nonagenarian tribal leader, popularly known as “Manyam Sundarayya” in the tribal heartland of Bhadrachalam Agency for his high ethical standards in public life and unimpeachable integrity, breathed his last at a private hospital in the temple town at around 9.30 a.m. on Monday. He had been suffering from age-related illness for the past few months. He scored a hat-trick win with three successive victories from the Bhadrachalam constituency in 1985, 1989 and 1994 Assembly elections in the old undivided Andhra Pradesh. Mr Bojji, a native of Adavi Venkannagudem village in V R Puram mandal of Andhra Pradesh, endeared himself with toiling masses by championing the cause of tribal people and other downtrodden sections, during his long stint as MLA of Bhadrachalam constituency. The veteran Marxist leader left behind an impeccable legacy of selfless service and simple lifestyle He lived in a semi-pucca house at his native village, which was part of the erstwhile undivided Khammam district, and travelled mostly by cycle and bus to address problems faced by tribal people in accessing drinking water, health, education and other basic amenities. In line with the core communist ideals, he gave up the house that was allotted to the MLAs in the State capital Hyderabad by the then State government in the erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh, sources said. He led several mass movements under the aegis of the CPI (M) to amplify the voices of tribal farmers, podu cultivators, tendu leaf collectors, agricultural labourers in the vast tribal region of the old undivided Andhra Pradesh. He is survived by his two sons and three daughters. His wife died due to age-related ailment two years ago. Leaders cutting across the political spectrum condoled his death. In a statement, the CPI (M) Khammam district secretary N Nageswara Rao said Mr Bojji led a simple life without own house or car, setting high standards in public life. Meanwhile, scores of people from various walks of life paid their last respects to the body of Mr Bojji kept at the CPI (M) office in Bhadrachalam late on Monday afternoon. His body was shifted to Adavi Venkannagudem in Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district in the evening. The funeral of the departed Adivasi leader will be held in his native place on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/veteran-cpim-leader-kunja-bojji-passes-away/article34307622.ece
13 April 2021||SANGAPUR (SIDDIPET DISTRICT),TELANGANA||Many oustees have no sustainable livelihood||A group of people are gathered at a makeshift roadside grocery store, run by Timirishetti Lavanya, at this 2BHK colony at Sangapur on the outskirts of Gajwel. Ms. Lavanya, like all other members of the group, is an oustee from Erravalli village in Kondapaka mandal in the district and has been temporarily accommodated here before being handed over the promised houses at Rehabilitation and Resettlement Colony at Mutrajpally. Two elderly persons — D. Rajaiah and Edla Balamallaiah — recently displaced from Erravalli are sitting on the footpath in front of the shop striking up conversation with fellow oustees. Under any other circumstances the scene might have appeared normal. However, at Sangapur 2BHK colony the biggest issue is that not one of them has a source of livelihood and no one has any idea of what future holds for them. All they can do is indulge in chit-chat to while away the time. Mr. Rajaiah has four brothers and together they had about 3.3 acres of land in Erravalli. Their land was taken over by the government for the construction of Mallannasagar and they received a compensation of nearly Rs. 20 lakh of which Rajaiah’s share was Rs. 4 lakh. That amount was spent on addressing family needs over the past few years and now he is left staring at empty pockets. The case of Mr. Balamallaih is somewhat better. He sold three acres land in the village for the project and received Rs. 18 lakh as compensation. Family needs He spent about Rs. 15 lakh and bought a housing plot of 200 square yards near Kuknoorpally. The balance was spent on other family requirements. “At Erravalli we used to work in our fields and or in the fields of neighbours. Now there is no work as our lands have been taken over by the government for the Mallannasagar project. We are living out of the compensation amount received from selling our lands. We do not know what to do and what is there in the store for us,” says Mr. Rajaiah. “We were promised permanent accommodation at Mutrajpally within one month at the time of vacating our village. We came here about three months ago and the houses are yet to be handed over. It may take few more months to go into our new houses,” said another Erravalli oustee, unwilling to be identified. Palle Raju, who was vice president of Erravalli, said that the primary allotment was over but completion of individual houses at Mutrajpally is likely to take few more weeks and added that they were making do with the temporary accommodation at Sangapur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/many-oustees-have-no-sustainable-livelihood/article34307755.ece

13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Police to submit chargesheet in Red Fort violence case soon||The Delhi police will soon submit chargesheet in the Red Fort violence case that happened on Republic Day during the farmers’ tractor rally against the new farm laws, said a senior police officer on Monday. The officer added that till date, 16 people have been arrested, including actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu. The arrested have been charged under IPC Sections like attempt to murder, rioting, damaging public property and other serious criminal offences. “We have strong electronic evidences against the accused and that is the reason none of them got bail despite several attempts. The forensic reports have been received and a few other reports are awaited,” the officer added. Another senior police officer added that their focus is to submit the chargesheet at the earliest to begin the trial in the case. “We have already announced reward of Rs. 1 lakh and Rs. 50,000 on five other accused who are still absconding. Police teams are looking for them and they will be arrested soon,” the officer added. On 26 January, more than 500 police personnel suffered injuries after being attacked by agitating farmers who took out tractor rally to protest against the Centre’s farm laws.

Mr. Sidhana is wanted in connection with the Republic Day violence during the farmers’ rally in the Capital, the police said.

He was asked about the movements of Mr. Sidhana and thereafter, was relieved with a direction to join inquiry as and when required, said the police. “The investigation is being conducted as per law and in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure,” the police added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/didnt-detain-sidhanas-cousin-illegally/article34307335.ece
13 April 2021||NewDelhi/Ghaziabad/Gurugram,||Crowds reappear at transport hubs, but not out of lockdown fear||The number of COVID-19 cases in the Capital is rising steeply again, but this time the migrant labourers are not caught in a panic even after strict measures were reintroduced in Delhi to control the spread of the virus. Though the situation has an eerie resemblance to last year, they say their predicament is not comparable to the lockdown days. Travelling to Bihar’s Begusarai district from Anand Vihar railway station, Ram Baran, a car mechanic in Faridabad, said: “We cannot get scared of the virus and live constantly in fear. Last year, I was jobless for over four months. We have already faced the worst and we are not thinking about that scenario anymore. I am going to my village to bring my daughter back. As for any lockdown in the future, we will see what happens.” Nineteen-year-old Miyaz, who was waiting at the Anand Vihar railway station, said he was on his way from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, to Bhagalpur in Bihar. “I am going to my village as my parents want to see me. Even though there are restrictions in Ahmedabad, our factory is still operational and we cannot afford to miss out again. Last year, we were forced to return to our villages when the lockdown was announced suddenly. We cannot afford to miss work and wages again,” said Mr. Miyaz. Planned visits Several workers said they were going on scheduled trips to their villages and would return to the city after a few weeks. Raju, 32, who works at a shop in Nehru Place, said: “There is some work in the village, so I am travelling to Bhagalpur. Last year, we faced hurdles during the lockdown and we were not among the ones who could travel back. Hopefully, the situation will not repeat and we will not be left without work yet again.” ‘No unusual rush’ Station Superintendent of Gurugram railway station, S.L. Meena, told The Hindu that there was no unusual rush of passengers to suggest an exodus of migrants fearing a lockdown. “We have more than the usual rush today [Monday] because of a large number of devotees reaching Gurugram from the neighbouring States for Sheetla Mata fair. But the number of devotees too is far less compared to pre-pandemic days,” said Mr. Meena. He added that the number of trains passing through the station was reduced to 46 from the 98 that plied in the pre-lockdown period, including six local trains. In the pre-lockdown period, around a dozen local trains ran on the route.  “The footfall at the railway station has drastically reduced from 60,000 a day before the outbreak to just 5,000 now. Many daily passengers on local trains lost their jobs due to the pandemic, reducing the footfall. This is why the number of passengers remains low despite some trains being restored,” he said. Inqlabi Mazdoor Kendra central committee member Shyambir Shukla said there was a sense of fear among the workers in Gurugram, but they were not planning to return to their homes since industries were still operational. “The managements of some factories have assured them that a complete lockdown-like situation was unlikely and therefore they have decided to stay on,” said Mr. Shukla. The number of passengers at the Kaushambi bus stand, which saw huge crowds of migrant workers in 2020, is swelling again. However, this time, the pandemic is just one of the factors on their mind. Many of them are heading home not because of the surge, but because of the wedding and harvest season, besides the panchayat polls in Uttar Pradesh. Caution to the wind Most of them were also not conforming to COVID-19 protocols. Buses to Azamgarh and Lucknow were crammed, despite instructions that the capacity should be just 50%. Conductors feel that as long as passengers are not standing in the aisles, the protocol is followed. Rakesh Yadav, station in-charge, said there has been a 20% rise in passengers in the last two days. “There are a number of factors and the virus is just one of them. We have enough buses and there is no pressure as of now,” he said.  Sanitiser dispensers and infrared thermometers too were absent in some places. Mr. Yadav said the arrangement existed, but was missing at that particular moment. “Conductors and passengers are advised to follow COVID-19 protocols, but some don’t,” he said. Madhuban, standing in front of a bus of Bihar State Transport Corporation, said he is rushing home to Gorakhpur to attend the upcoming panchayat polls. Nearby, Rakesh, a daily wager from Pilibhit, was languishing on the floor. “The project I was working on in Noida is over, so I am heading home. Abhi toh night curfew hai, pata nahin aage kya ho(there is a night curfew now, who knows what will happen next) ,” he wondered. ‘Drop in passengers’ At the Sahibabad railway station, the sanitiser dispenser had dried up. Station master Virendra Gupta said there has been a drop in the number of passengers in the last few days. Sanjay Kumar, senior commercial clerk, said 25 reservations used to be cancelled a day till March end, now the number has gone up to 35-40 a day. “There has been a decline in the number of non-reserved tickets as well,” he said. Lal Kuan, on the outskirts of Ghaziabad on the Aligarh-Etah-Kanpur route, which emerged as an epicentre for migrant passengers last year, has yet to see the crowd swell. But here conductors continue to fill the seats that are left vacant at Kaushambi. Again, COVID protocol is conspicuous by its absence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rush-hour-for-migrant-labourers-but-not-out-of-pandemic-fear/article34307339.ece

13 April 2021||Mumbai,||Remdesivir will not be sold through retail shops: Pawar||Maharashtra Finance Minister Ajit Pawar on Monday said Remdesivir vials will not be sold through retail shops, but provided directly to hospitals through distributors to prevent black marketing and hoarding. “Once provided directly to hospitals, only needy patients will have access to it. District Collectors will control the distribution,” said Mr. Pawar at a meeting organised to take stock of the COVID-19 situation in the State in the wake of rising cases and deaths. Mr. Pawar also said that 30% of funds from the District Planning and Development Council (DPDC) can now be used to implement measures to fight COVID-19. Divisional Commissioners will get additional rights to spend funds for facilities in acquired private hospitals. He said, “The entire State machinery is working on a war footing. We are putting enormous efforts to ensure sufficient oxygen supply to hospitals. If required, a liquid oxygen plant can be set up near hospitals. Funds can be made available through the National Health Mission, Public Health Department, State Disaster Relief Fund and DPDC.” Mr. Pawar said the government decided not to allow retail sale of Remdesivir injections owing to instances of black marketing. “We have been directed to prepare guidelines for the use of this injection. District Collectors have the right to control its distribution,” he said.  Meanwhile, the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party claimed that the State government is not connecting with private companies producing Remdesivir. Leader of Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar claimed he met officials of Group Pharma Pvt. Ltd. in Daman on Monday, which manufactures the medicine, and it was ready to provide 50,000 injections to Maharashtra. He said, “The State government and its officials are not taking the initiative to contact the company.

13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Oppn. attacks govt. over poor healthcare facilities||The BJP and the Congress on Monday hit out at the Delhi government for failing to tackle the rising COVID-19 cases in the Capital saying that its healthcare structure had once again fallen apart due to the virus. Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had always claimed that everything was under control and Delhi was fully prepared to deal with any eventuality. However, the surge in the COVID-19 infection cases in the city has exposed the false claims of the government. It has also brought into open the pathetic condition of the healthcare services and hospitals. The BJP leader said that if there was shortage of space in the hospitals, several stadiums that fall under the domain of the Delhi government should be turned into temporary hospitals to treat patients. “We demand that an all-party meeting to discuss the strategy should be called,” he said. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said that that facilities in government hospitals should be strengthened immediately. He added that the virus spread would not have been so intense had the government improved facilities in hospitals when the cases were on the decline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/oppn-attacks-govt-over-poor-healthcare-facilities/article34307232.ece
13 April 2021||New Delhi,||EDMC has signed contract worth crores with blacklisted company, alleges AAP||The AAP on Monday alleged that the BJP-ruled East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has signed a contract amounting to crores of rupees with a company which was “blacklisted” by the municipal corporation in 2010. “The company was penalised by the High Court and did not get relief from the Supreme Court and is now getting contracts very easily from the BJP-ruled civic body,” said AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said in a statement. Responding to the allegations, BJP claimed that the AAP-ruled Delhi government has multiple contracts with the same company. “AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj today accused EDMC of giving a security contract to a blacklisted company cleverly ignoring a fact that same company has security contracts of dozens of Delhi government departments,” BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said. Mr. Bharadwaj said that BJP Delhi chief Adesh Gupta should answer why a “blacklisted” company is being roped in by the EDMC. “In 2010, it was found that it takes the full amount from the government, but does not give the entire amount to security personnel,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/edmc-has-signed-contract-worth-crores-with-blacklisted-company-alleges-aap/article34307233.ece

13 April 2021||Minneapolis,||Protests erupt after U.S. police shoot dead Black man||A suburb of Minneapolis was under curfew early on Monday after U.S. police fatally shot a young Black man, sparking protests not far from where a former police officer was on trial for the murder of George Floyd. Hundreds of people gathered outside the police station in Brooklyn Center, northwest of Minneapolis, with police later firing teargas and flash bangs to disperse the crowd, according to an AFP video-journalist. Mayor Mike Elliott imposed a curfew from 1 a.m. on Monday until 6 a.m. The mother of Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, told a crowd earlier on Sunday evening that he called her to say he had been pulled over by police, local media reported. Katie Wright said she heard officers tell her son to put his phone down, and then one of the officers ended the call. Soon after, her son’s girlfriend told her he had been shot. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension confirmed to AFP it was “investigating an officer-involved shooting incident” in Brooklyn Center but declined to identify the victim. According to a statement from the Brooklyn Center Police Department, officers pulled over a driver for a traffic violation. When they discovered he had an outstanding warrant, they tried to take him into custody. He got back into his car, and one of the officers fired their weapon, striking the driver, who died at the scene.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/protests-erupt-after-us-police-shoot-dead-black-man/article34306941.ece
13 April 2021||COLOMBO,||China extends $500 mn loan to Lanka||China on Monday signed a $500 million loan agreement with Sri Lanka, in a move that Colombo hopes would boost its foreign reserves that are under severe strain since the pandemic struck last year. This is the second instalment of the $1 billion loan sought by Sri Lanka last year. The first was released in March 2020, just as the pandemic hit Sri Lanka. The approval comes a month after Sri Lanka obtained a currency swap facility from China for $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) also sanctioned Sri Lanka’s request for a $180 million loan in February. Sri Lanka already owes more than $ 5 billion to China from past loans. Speaking over telephone with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping assured Sri Lanka of “as much assistance as China’s capacity allows”, in the fight against COVID-19. Sri Lanka, like many pandemic-hit countries, is facing an acute economic crisis for over a year now, with its rupee plummeting to nearly 203 against the U.S. dollar. The country’s foreign reserves dropped to $ 4.05 billion in March this year, after its exports and tourism sector earnings, and foreign remittances dropped considerably in the last 12 months. Sri Lanka is due to repay some $ 4.5 billion of its outstanding debt this year and the government has said it is “exploring all options”. India extended a $400 million swap facility through the Reserve Bank of India, and provided a three-month rollover, but the facility was not further extended. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka settled the swap in February this year. Meanwhile, Colombo is awaiting New Delhi’s response on two requests made last year by the government. While PM Mahinda Rajapaksa sought a debt moratorium on the debt Sri Lanka owes India, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa requested Prime Minister Modi for a $ 1 billion currency swap last year. Neither request has been cleared by New Delhi as yet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-extends-500-mn-loan-to-lanka/article34306934.ece
13 April 2021||Polonnaruwa,||A grim new year for debt-trapped women||M. Champa Irangani  is in no mood to  celebrate ‘Avurudu’, or New Year, the biggest annual festival that Sri Lanka’s majority Sinhalese community observes mid-April, while Tamils celebrate the Tamil New Year around the same time. “The New Year will dawn only the day our debts are cancelled. Until then we cannot celebrate. Surely not, when so many women have died by suicide under the pressure of microfinance loans,” she says, seated with dozens of affected women who have been observing a ‘satyagraha’ off the main road in Hingurakgoda town, in Sri Lanka’s Polonnaruwa district, for a month now. Seeking relief They want their microfinance debt abolished, and an alternative source of credit that will free them from poverty, rather than worsen it. Their experience, shared by tens of thousands who have taken microfinance loans in Sri Lanka, not only counters popular claims in South Asia of microcredit alleviating poverty and empowering women, but also highlights the devastating consequences of the individualised, high-interest microfinance loans, entangling women in a pile of debt. Ms. Irangani feels especially let down since there has been no relief in over a year after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, whom she voted for, came to power pledging — among other things — to abolish their loans. Their ongoing protest is the latest against the Rajapaksa government — after the farmers’ agitations in the southern Hambantota district — from among those who backed their party in the 2019 and 2020 polls. President Rajapaksa’s astute election campaign in 2019 had two main thrusts – enhancing national security, on the heels of the Easter terror bombings that April, and improving rural livelihoods to develop the country. His poll manifesto ‘Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour’, which has since graduated to a national policy framework, promised to “ensure relief of village women falling victim from unregulated micro finance schemes”, instead offering “government-sponsored concessionary loan schemes and agricultural loans”. Ms. Irangani had reason to be hopeful. “I went all out and canvassed for their candidate in the general elections [August 2020] too, asking women in my village to back their party so our fate might change, but here we are, hearing of more and more indebted women dying by suicide [nearly 200 women, according estimates]. They simply don’t care.” The government has spoken of possible low interest loans as alternatives, but the women are not convinced yet. Drawing a circle in the air, she says: “Livelihoods have become a big zero”. If the pandemic severely affected the economy — with external sector earnings dropping, foreign reserves draining, and the rupee plummeting to 203 against the U.S. dollar — daily-waged agriculture labourers like her, who were already reeling under debt, were in for even harder times, amid growing joblessness, falling wages and uncertainty. Ms. Irangani’s “debt trap” began when she returned to Sri Lanka some years ago, after working as a domestic help in West Asia for seven years. Exhausting her meagre savings in an unexpected court battle, she resorted to a loan to survive, and soon, one loan led to another, as companies relentlessly sold easy loans at her doorstep. The lending companies had done the same with war-affected Tamil women in the north and east, who were struggling to rebuild their lives .  Exorbitant interest rates “Banks refused to give loans without any collateral security. Many families had no steady income or big lands to cultivate. At a time when children in our village were going hungry, these microfinance companies offered money,” says Priyanthika Kumari, who heads the Collective of Women Affected by Micro Finance from a cluster of more than 60 villages in the district. “There are some 1,02,000 women in Polonnaruwa district who have taken such loans.” The women paid exorbitant interest rates – 40 % to over 200 % —amid harassment from collection agents. They signed up for more loans to cope, to ensure their families can afford two decent meals. But despite regular repayments, their principal loans amounts remained undiminished, and their impoverished lives, unchanged. When they realised that their exhausting labour was never going to be enough in the face of their mounting debt, they took to the streets, much like their Tamil counterparts who repeatedly agitated during the last five years, demanding a solution to the crisis. In fact, it was their persistent calls that pressured the former Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe government to announce some targeted relief measures through the Central Bank in late 2018. Acknowledging the predatory nature of microfinance loans, the administration announced greater regulation, an interest rate cap on microfinance loans, a moratorium, and cheaper credit alternatives. But the measures proved too little, too late. “It all sounded like a dream at that time, but eventually turned out to be a mirage,” Ms. Irangani recalls. The then incumbent government did not see through the measures announced in its last leg in power. That is when President Rajapaksa made the promise, renewing the hopes of affected women. As that hope fades now, the women seated off the main road in Hingurakgoda say that if the government does not meet to their demands by the end of the month, they will launch a “fast unto death”. “We want to raise this issue nationally. We cannot afford to lose this struggle, we will not give up,” Ms. Priyanthika Kumari says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/a-grim-new-year-for-debt-trapped-women/article34306932.ece
13 April 2021||New Delhi,||Pakistan human rights icon I.A. Rehman dead||Pakistani Human rights crusader and former journalist Ibn Abdur Rehman, who won the Ramon Magsaysay award for his work on fostering India-Pakistan relations, passed away in Lahore on Monday aged 90. I.A. Rehman, as he was called, had several run-ins with the Pakistani establishment as he took a bold stand against atrocities by Pakistani forces in East Pakistan (later Bangladesh) in 1971, marital law under General Zia ul Haq and later the emergency imposed by General Pervez Musharraf, and fought for several causes, including minority rights and excesses by security forces. Announcing his death, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, where he served as Director from 1990-2008, and Secretary General from 2008-2016 called him a “titan of human rights” adding that “his integrity, conscience and compassion were unparalleled.” During that time he often raised the issue of freeing Indian fishermen and prisoners with the Pakistani government. “He was always available, and was always ready to help any Indian in need of assistance in Pakistan, and unafraid to be vocal about their problems,” Jatin Desai, who works on similar issues for Pakistani civilian prisoners in India, told The Hindu . One of the cases Mr. Rehman took up strongly was that of Hamid Ansari, a 33-year old software engineer who travelled to Pakistan in 2012 to try and meet a girl he had met online, and was arrested as “an Indian spy”. Mr. Ansari was released in 2018, in large part due to the efforts of human rights activists, including Mr. Rehman, and a young journalist Zeenat Shahzadi, who was mysteriously abducted and later detained, reportedly because of her decision to take up Mr. Ansari’s case. Indian reunited In a mercy plea to President Mamnoon Hussain in November 2017, Mr. Rehman wrote that it would be to Pakistan’s credit if it listened to humanitarian calls and “the chances of relief for Pakistani citizens in Indian prisons might improve if [the President] could remit the remaining period of Hamid’s prison term.” A year later, Mr. Ansari was released and returned to his family in Mumbai, where he lives now. “It is said that once a person leaves this world, everything stays back and only deeds go along. Rehman Saab was one of the chosen one’s who brought happiness in the dark lives of many broken houses,” Mr. Ansari said. Mr. Rehman was born in Haryana, and studied at Aligarh Muslim University before moving with his family to Pakistan in the wake of violence during Partition. He considered himself a protégé of the poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and then took to journalism, writing for an Urdu paper, and later becoming the Chief Editor of Pakistan Times in 1989. He often visited India to pursue India-Pakistan dialogue during period of tensions between the two countries, and was awarded the Ramon Magasaysay Award for Peace and International Understanding in 2004.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pakistan-human-rights-icon-ia-rehman-dead/article34306938.ece
13 April 2021||Washington,||‘REGEN-COV prevents symptomatic infection’||Regeneron will seek U.S. approval for its COVID-19 antibody cocktail as a preventative treatment after a trial showed it helped reduce the risk of symptomatic infections in households where someone else is ill, the U.S. drugmaker said on Monday. REGEN-COV, as the combination shot of casirivimab and imdevimab is called, reduced the overall risk of progressing to symptomatic COVID-19 by 31%, and by 76% after the third day. The trial also demonstrated that it shortened symptom duration and markedly lowered viral levels, Regeneron said in a statement. The drug has emergency U.S. approval for mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, and the company is hoping the latest trial convinces regulators to expand its deployment. EU regulators have voiced some support and are letting countries decide if they want to use it. Beyond reducing symptomatic infection risk, the total number of weeks patients experienced symptoms was nearly halved (45%) with REGEN-COV, and the viral burden was cut by 90%-plus, potentially helping halt the disease’s spread.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/regen-cov-prevents-symptomatic-infection/article34307479.ece

13 April 2021||Lahore,||Pak. Islamist leader held, followers clash with police||Pakistan police on Monday arrested the leader of a radical Islamist political party a day after he threatened the government with protests if it did not expel France’s Ambassador over depictions of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad. Saad Rizvi was arrested in the eastern city of Lahore to “maintain law and order,” said Ghulam Mohammad Dogar, chief of Lahore police. Rizvi called on the government to honour what he said was a commitment it made in February to his party to expel the French envoy before April 20 over the publication in France of depictions of Islam’s Prophet. The government has said that it only committed to discuss the matter in Parliament. Dogar provided no further details about the arrest, which quickly drew condemnation from Rizvi’s supporters who began gathering near the party’s main office for a protest. Clashes soon erupted in Lahore between police and Rizvi’s supporters, who were also rallying on the outskirts of the capital Islamabad, disrupting traffic and inconveniencing residents. Protesters also blocked some roads in the southern port city of Karachi and elsewhere in the country, raising fears of violence amid a surge in cases of coronavirus in Pakistan. Rizvi emerged as the leader of the Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan party in November after the sudden death of his father, Khadim Hussein Rizvi.

It is back with more family members to attack us with greater force.” This is in April 2021. These scene changes are akin to what happens in village feuds or urban brawls that feature in news reports across India. While leaders are debating whether India is experiencing a second wave or Delhi is experiencing a fourth wave, the virus is spreading rapidly across the country, helped by the more infectious variants that arrived from abroad or emerged at home as a ‘double mutant’. Changes, a year on There are several differences from the pandemic which we experienced in 2020, both in its spread and in our response. The virus affected relatively small numbers by March 2020, by the time the lockdown was announced. The long nationwide lockdown gave governments across the land time to strengthen the health system capacity, streamline administrative coordination, power up procurement and production processes for essential equipment and supplies, educate people on the dangers posed by the virus and advise personal protection measures that needed to be adopted. Release from the lockdown was phased, limiting transmission even as society gradually opened up. Large cities and neighbouring districts were more affected, with urban crowding and mobility driving the transmission. Rural areas and less developed States were mostly protected. This time, the pandemic has resurfaced in a fully open society. There was unrestricted movement, markets were crowded, domestic and international travel was brisk, election campaigns were boisterously run for local bodies and assemblies, religious gatherings received state support and cricket matches were celebrated as a joyful advertisement of return to normalcy as rest of the world was still struggling with the pandemic. Masks were mandated notionally and the public decided to follow the leaders and celebrities who disdained to wear them in public. The virus had an open road for its travel, with only the welcome arches missing. We now need to proceed beyond reflections and remonstration on what went wrong, to design and deliver a resolute response that can help us to rapidly regain control and limit the damage. This has to incorporate several strategic components, cohesively connected and collectively implemented, to have a sustained impact. They are:  First step is decentralisation Decentralise the response to district level. Knowledge of existing and evolving local conditions matters, for the design and the delivery of an effective response. Local data gathering and analysis provide real time intelligence for rapid response. Local community networks are important channels for information dissemination and for partnering the administration in implementation. We need consultative policymaking at the national level, inter-departmental planning at the State level. and data-driven decentralised decision making for situation adaptive implementation at the district level. The district collector must coordinate health-care services across all facilities in the district and be empowered to commandeer hospitals, hotels and transport facilities as needed.  Prevent super spreader events and mandate masks. Testing numbers are again being projected as the best measure of an efficient and effective response. This is incorrect. While tests are indeed an important component of the strategy, we cannot test asymptomatically infected persons and mildly symptomatic persons who do not report themselves. These constitute a very large number at any time, as we know from antibody surveys. We cannot randomly and repeatedly test large proportions of the population to detect virus presence in such potentially infective persons. Masks, if worn well and regularly in public and even in indoor gatherings, will greatly reduce risk of transmission from any infected person, known or unknown. Even the more infectious variants will be blocked by effective masks, even where physical distancing is not possible. Stop the events What is absolutely essential is preventing super spreader events. Crowding, whether indoor or outdoor, offers the virus an opportunity to seed itself among many exposed persons who then carry it elsewhere to perpetuate the chain of transmission. There should be a ban on large gatherings, for at least the next eight weeks. Travel restrictions too must be imposed during this period. The notion that all of India has acquired or will soon acquire herd immunity must be dispelled with clear messaging for some months to come.  Use smart testing and tracing, but case detection needs more. The past year has taught us that viral tests are useful but have limitations. A single RT-PCR test can miss between 30%-40% cases, due to limitations posed by swab collection, transport efficiency and laboratory competency apart from testing too early or too late during the infection when a replicating virus is not detectable.  We need to detect possible cases through household surveillance of symptomatic individuals by primary health-care teams supported by citizen volunteers. All suspect cases and household contacts must be tested. Positive cases must be isolated and provided home or hospital care depending on severity. Symptomatic but negative persons and household contacts should be re-tested three to five days later but wear masks and observe distance even at home till the re-test result too is negative and the infected person has recovered. Genomic analyses must be performed in at least 5% of test positive samples. Contact tracing, for persons from whom the case may have acquired the infection and to whom the case may have passed it on, needs to be conducted with speed and efficiency. Local networks help in early case detection and contact tracing. The use of just apps will not do.  Step up vaccine rollout Speed up vaccine rollout, recognising value and limitations. The benefit of currently available vaccines is to provide protection against severe disease, not infection per se . This information must be clearly conveyed to the public, politicians and the media so that wrong expectations of complete protection against infection do not lead to laxity in behaviour or an outcry of vaccine failure. Given this objective, available vaccines must be prioritised for vulnerable persons. Initially, the aim must be to immunise all persons above 35 years of age and all younger persons with at-risk health disorders. We must get more vaccines quickly into the supply chain by incentivising greater production volumes of already approved vaccines and waiving the requirement of a bridging trial for domestic manufacture of vaccines approved by credible international regulators, subject to submissions of full trial data to our regulators. We must train more vaccinators for delivery closer to home, stepping up daily administration rates at more centres.  Social support is key Involve people, not just instruct. Citizen engagement is critical for a successful pandemic response. Formal and informal networks that exist at the local level must be activated and supported to educate people and motivate them for adopting COVID-19-appropriate behaviours, symptom reporting, providing contact information and registering for vaccination, while providing social support to affected families. Masks can be produced at the State or district level, for free distribution to households by community-based organisations. People partnered public health must become the credo and lasting legacy of the COVID-19 campaign.  Provide empathetic social support. District authorities must identify vulnerable persons and families who may suffer hardships due to loss of income, shelter or incur high health-care costs. Proactive support must be provided from public financing, as state policy, even as philanthropy is mobilised to supplement. Children must be supported for education at home or in the neighbourhood, through voluntary agencies, to overcome the digital divide of online teaching. Social solidarity must become the soul of our pandemic response. Prof. K. Srinath Reddy, a cardiologist and epidemiologist, is President, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Not on the same page at sea||India’s strategic community was agitated last week when the USS John Paul Jones carried out a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands. Indian observers reacted with shock and dismay at what some described as an unnecessary provocation by the U.S. Navy. The disquiet in Delhi was heightened by an unusual press release by the Commander, U.S. 7th Fleet, that said the operation, which was carried out in India’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), “asserted navigational rights and freedoms... without requesting India’s prior consent”. Many saw this as political signalling by the U.S., oddly, at a time when U.S.-India relations are on a high. Different interpretations In the aftermath of the incident, the U.S. Pentagon defended the military operation off India’s waters terming it “consistent with international law”. For the U.S. Navy, FONOPs are a way of showing that the maritime claims of certain states are incompatible with international law. India’s requirement of prior consent for the passage of foreign warships through Indian EEZs, U.S. officials believe, is a violation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Articles 56 and 58,  Part V of the Law of the Sea, they point out, entitle U.S. warships to high-seas freedoms in the 200-nautical mile EEZs of another coastal state. India interprets the maritime convention differently. Indian experts note that the UNCLOS does not explicitly permit the passage of military vessels in another state’s EEZ. When it ratified the convention in 1995, New Delhi stated, “India understands that the provisions of the Convention do not authorize other States to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives without the consent of the coastal State.” This position is consistent with India’s domestic law — the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zones of India Act of 1976 — and remains unchanged. Despite disagreements over navigational freedoms, however, India and the U.S. have refrained from a public airing of differences. Indian observers have come to accept U.S. FONOPs as an instrument in Washington’s military and diplomatic toolkit that gives the U.S. Navy leverage in the contest with China in the South China Sea. U.S. officials, too, have learnt to take Indian posturing in their stride. Washington knows New Delhi’s real concern is the possibility of greater Chinese naval presence in Indian waters, in particular the threat of People’s Liberation Army Navy submarines near Indian islands. Delhi’s pronouncements on foreign military activity in Indian EEZs, they know, don’t need to be taken literally. Needless to say, U.S. FONOPs in Indian EEZs have been relatively low key, serving mainly to check a box on the U.S. Navy’s record of activity in Asia. Since 2016, the U.S. Navy has carried out three forays through Indian EEZs keeping well outside Indian territorial waters. In contrast, U.S. warships challenged excessive Chinese claims thrice in 2016, four times in 2017, six in 2018, eight in 2019, and nine in 2020. Most patrols are said to have come within 12 nautical miles of the territorial sea limit around China’s islands. Those statistics say something about the U.S. Navy’s strategic priorities in Asia. Lakshadweep: A smart choice The choice of Lakshadweep for the FONOP doesn’t seem incidental. U.S. planners are likely to have known that a U.S. naval foray close to the ‘strategic’ Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be controversial. Besides necessitating a response from New Delhi, it could have exposed a wrinkle in the relationship that both sides have so far been discreet about: the disagreement over interpretation of the UNCLOS. U.S. planners are likely to have calculated that a naval operation in the waters off Lakshadweep would be unremarkable. With maritime boundaries around the Lakshadweep more settled than the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (where straight baselines on the Western edge of the islands have in the past raised uncomfortable questions), Indian officials could even afford to ignore the operation. To guard against any misreading of intent, the U.S. Navy coupled its FONOP in Indian waters with another sail through the territorial seas of the Maldives, a country with which the U.S. signed a defence agreement in 2020. The idea, ostensibly, was to signal to China that the U.S. Navy is committed to uphold the rules-based order in the waters of opponents and partners alike. Alas, the U.S. 7th Fleet erred in releasing a press statement that set the issue ablaze. Once social media picked up the story, it took on a life of its own. Bridging the divide There are lessons for both India and the U.S. from l’affaire Lakshadweep. The U.S. must recognise that FONOPs have implications for New Delhi that go beyond the infringement of Indian jurisdiction in the near seas. Such operations normalise military activism close to India’s island territories that remain vulnerable to incursions by foreign warships. The U.S. Navy’s emphasis on navigational freedoms in the EEZs encourages other regional navies to violate India’s domestic regulations in the waters surrounding the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. U.S. hectoring on the subject isn’t acceptable as Washington is yet to ratify the UNCLOS. But New Delhi, too, must rethink its stand on freedom of navigation in the EEZs. It isn’t enough for Indian officials and commentators to say U.S. FONOPs are an act of impropriety. The reality is that India’s domestic regulation is worryingly out of sync with international law. India’s declaration of straight baselines delineating zones around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (on the Western edge), in particular, is a discrepancy that cannot be explained as a minor departure from the provisions of the UNCLOS. The U.S. Navy sail through the waters off Lakshadweep highlights a gap in the Indian and American perception of navigational freedoms, complicating an already complex domain of international maritime law. Yet it is not the betrayal of a friend that many have sought to portray the FONOP to be.

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||A second chance for Nepal’s young democracy||It can be said that the only constant in Nepali politics is ‘unpredictability’. Nepal’s democratic transition has been shaped through the efforts and sacrifices of common citizens and leaders and the expectation was that the forgotten Nepali would soon get something better than the discriminatory political culture that started way back in 2015 with the new Constitution and selective political manoeuvrings. While it was time to deepen the footprints of the key institutions of democracy, Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli succeeded in making himself a bigger institution than the Constitution and Parliament. It was never possible for Mr. Oli to grow beyond a permissible stature in a functional democracy without misinterpreted nationalism, vulnerable Presidential, federal system and flawed decision-making processes. Supported by the President Bidya Devi Bhandari, which was a surprise, Mr. Oli briskly dissolved the Lower House of the federal Parliament on December 20, 2020, which only undermined the democratic spirit and dampened the prospects of stability and equitable growth in the country even further. Even when the Supreme Court reinstated the dissolved Parliament on February 23, 2021 and disputed the legal status of Nepal Communist Party (a merged entity of Communist Party of Nepal-ML and Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre), Mr. Oli continues to survive in the new age of Nepali politics where accountability is seldom seen as a virtue. The obsession with the positioning of India and China, more so with the abolition of the monarchy, has been a survival game in Nepali politics. The tendency to raise the bogey of the “hostile” neighbour has weakened politics and has failed the idea of representing constituent interests. It would be helpful to reckon the present round of serious institutional crisis as the culmination of an accountability-free political culture and the misunderstood institutional processes — where the successes or failures of decisions are attributed to outsiders — instead of opting for probity in public life and owning the outcomes.  Constitutional provisions Among the key factors of the ongoing political stalemate in Nepal are certain rigid constitutional provisions that have made it possible for Mr. Oli to take cover behind a shield and continue, as getting into election phase or looking for the possibility of a caretaker coalition government is a very difficult proposition. Instead of incorporating the provision of a no-confidence motion in its true spirit as a multi-party democracy, Nepal gets an unusual clause (Article 100(4)) in its new Constitution that allows a no-confidence motion only two years after the formation of the government — and even this can happen only when one fourth of the total number of existing members of the House of Representatives may table a motion of no-confidence in writing that the House has no confidence in the Prime Minister. Article 100(5) is even more perplexing which necessitates the motion of no-confidence shall also indicate the name of a member proposed for the Prime Minister. Overcoming such arduous challenges is surely very tough for the three leading parties (Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre and Janata Samajbadi Party) seen in the race to bring the Oli government down. Even to exercise the choice of a no-confidence motion, two parties of these three have to be on the same front for getting the magical number of 68 Parliamentarians. With no consensus or ethical obligations among the wary political parties, the hiatus is likely to sustain itself. The three major parties opposing Mr. Oli’s continuance as the Prime Minister have 142 seats in Parliament, a number that is well sufficient to end the deadlock, enter into a post-Oli era and form a new government. However, Mr. Oli has astutely managed to outwit his political opponents both within his party and the Opposition by playing on their differences . While the Nepali Congress is facing an endemic limitation with the decision-making process, its leadership has not shown any clear temptation to explore the possibility of playing any significant role in the ongoing crucial phase in Nepali politics. The Baburam Bhattarai-led Janata Samajbadi Party was expected to be playing an active role in coalition experiments with the Maoist Centre, Nepali Congress and Madhes-based parties, however, no such action was noticed from this camp as well. Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Baburam Bhattarai and former Co-Chair with Mr. Oli in the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party formed an informal alliance with Madhav Kumar Nepal as they both wanted Mr. Oli to be unseated in the wake of his decision to dissolve the House of Representatives on December 20 and demanded his resignation. Their demands were limited only to Mr. Oli’s resignation and were not oriented toward the building of an alternate front, which gave a much needed respite to Mr. Oli. After the Supreme Court of Nepal reinstated Parliament in February this year, it came out with the next historic verdict on March 7 in which the top court had scrapped the legal status of the ruling Nepal Communist Party. This led to a formal division in the united communist alliance, besides ensuring a split in the Dahal-Nepal faction. Mr. Nepal, along with other UML leaders loyal to him, was left with no option but to return to the old party. Mr. Dahal had to revert to his old party, the Maoist Centre, even as four of its law makers defected to Mr. Oli’s UML. Mr. Dahal has also missed taking a political step, in playing safe. A way out The political muddle apart, this is no time for elections, especially with a second wave of COVID-19 infections. Nepal also stares at a lack of sufficient numbers of vaccines which has left the population vulnerable. Also, good governance cannot be ensured by a government that is caught up in survivalist compulsions. The best way forward would be in giving democracy a good chance. For now, this can be made possible by the political parties alone. They have to aspire to ensure peace, progress and stability; the easiest option would be to work towards a consensus government with all the major parties joining hands and running it collectively.

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Scaling up vaccine production||The precarious second wave of COVID-19 infections has hit India with greater ferocity than the first. Despite a year to prepare, we have been caught woefully off guard again. Multiple reports of the scarcity of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs have surfaced from different parts of the country. According to the Observer Research Foundation, till the end of March, India had produced 316 million doses of Covishield and Covaxin — the two COVID-19 vaccines in use in India. Of this, 64.5 million doses have been exported. This suggests that the issue isn’t vaccine production. Perhaps, the problem has more to do with centralised procurement, distribution, and coordination with different State governments and local authorities. Nonetheless, as India aims to inoculate more and more people it is imperative to ramp up vaccine production. Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures Covishield, has said that it can produce 100 million doses a month, up from the 50 million doses, provided it can scale up its manufacturing capacity. We discuss some of the legal means that the government could have employed last year and should employ now to scale up the production of COVID-19 vaccines. We divide these legal means into the non-intellectual property-(IP)-based and IP-based options. Non-IP-based solutions Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 empowers the government, during the outbreak of an epidemic, to take measures that it may deem necessary to prevent the outbreak or its spread. Likewise, Section 26B of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, empowers the Central government to regulate the sale, manufacture, and distribution of a drug that is essential to meet the requirements of an emergency arising due to an epidemic. Since ramping up the production of vaccines would be a necessary step in that direction, the government can direct pharmaceutical companies to loan their manufacturing capacity to the existing COVID-19 manufacturers like the SII and Bharat Biotech to boost their manufacturing capability so that more COVID-19 vaccine vials can be produced. This can be done without affecting the ability of these companies to develop and test their own vaccine candidates. IP-based solutions Under Section 100 of the Patents Act, 1970, the Central government has the power to authorise anyone (such as specific pharmaceutical companies) to use any patents or patent applications for the “purposes of government”. Under this provision, the Central government can licence specific companies to manufacture the COVID-19 vaccines. The other option is to make use of Section 92 of the Patents Act, which allows the Central government to issue a compulsory licence (a licence issued to manufacture the patented product without the consent of the patent holder) in circumstances of national emergency or extreme urgency or in case of public non-commercial use. The pandemic is a circumstance of national emergency. Thus, the Central government, under Section 92, can issue a notification in this regard. Subsequently, any company willing or directed by the government to manufacture the COVID-19 vaccine can be issued a licence. Another option available to the government, as some commentators have pointed out, is that all COVID-19 vaccine projects that are funded by the taxpayer’s money should not claim IP rights in the first place or if patents are granted, they should not be enforced. This would make the wider dissemination of research outcomes possible facilitating easy replication by other manufacturers. This can be done in the context of Covaxin that has been developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology. The government needs to explore the production capabilities of the pharmaceutical companies in the public sector to build India’s manufacturing competence. For instance, Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation, a State government public sector undertaking, can manufacture Covaxin immediately. A licence could have been issued to this entity by the government last year and we would have had higher supplies of COVID-19 vaccines this year. These legal options have been available to the government all along. The government should have used these options to build India’s manufacturing capacity, which would have placed us in a better position to fight the second wave. There is still hope and a chance to respond to this lament. Will the government listen?

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||India’s South Asian opportunity||The statement issued by the Director Generals of Military Operations of India and Pakistan, in late February, that they agree to strictly observe all agreements between the two countries, coincided with a statement made by Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan in Colombo that “our only dispute is Kashmir and it can only be resolved through dialogue.” This was later strongly endorsed by Pakistan’s Army Chief, General Qamar Bajwa. This shows that there is a growing, but unstated, realisation that neither country can wrest parts of Kashmir that each controls from the other. Rather, it is best to focus on resolving issues that blight the entire subcontinent — poverty, malnutrition and an unconscionable neglect of the young. It is a realisation that the India-Pakistan animosity hurts regionalism and South Asian growth. Economic integration A fair peace between India and Pakistan is not just good for the two states but for all the nations constituting the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Reports such as the World Bank publication titled ‘A Glass Half Full’ and others from the Asian Development Bank and the European Union conclude that there is explosive value to be derived from South Asian economic integration. While SAARC has facilitated limited collaborations among its members, it has remained a victim of India-Pakistan posturing. As External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar observed in a December 2020 interview to this newspaper: “If SAARC is a serious regionalism initiative, and [Pakistan] blocks trade and connectivity and people-to-people ties... what regionalism are we speaking of?” Now, given that the two countries have agreed to maintain ceasefire, it is time for India to seize the moment and become more South Asia-concerned and much less Pakistan-obsessed.  An economically transformed and integrated South Asian region could advantageously link up with China’s Belt and Road Initiative and even join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world’s largest trading bloc of 15 countries, accounting for 30% of its GDP, as a much valued partner. Writing in a commemorative volume in honour of the late Sri Lankan economist Saman Kelegama, Professor Selim Raihan of the University of Dhaka brings out India’s overwhelming ‘size imbalance’ in South Asia: “The shares of India in the total land area, population, and real GDP of South Asia in 2016 are 62%, 75%, and 83%, respectively. The two other big countries in South Asia are Pakistan and Bangladesh with shares in regional GDP of only 7.6% and 5.6%, respectively.” Given its size and heft, only India can take the lead in transforming a grossly under-performing region like South Asia. Collectively with a population of slightly over 1.9 billion, South Asia has a GDP (PPP) of $12 trillion. Contrast this with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Numbering nearly 700 million, ASEAN has a GDP (PPP) of around $9 trillion and a per capita income which, at $14,000 (PPP), is closing in on China, with member states like Vietnam starting to grow spectacularly. India’s moment This is the moment for India to think big and act big by ambitiously aiming to engineer a South Asian economic miracle in half the time China did. If this sounds impossible, so did China’s rise in 1972. But for that to happen, India needs to view a peace with Pakistan not as a bilateral matter, to be arrived at leisurely, if at all, but as essential and urgent, all the while viewing it as a chance of a lifetime, to dramatically transform South Asia for the better, no less.

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Salvaging strategy||India’s aggressive second wave of coronavirus infections marked by over 1,50,000 cases a day and many deaths is clearly the result of irrational exuberance early in the new year. After prematurely assuming that COVID-19 was virtually over, governments made rash decisions to allow large religious gatherings and political campaigns with little regard for disease control. The lapse is now threatening a nascent economic recovery. Rather than view the crisis as a political setback, the government should focus on a mitigation strategy that will not hobble the economy, while stopping the wildfire spread of the virus. A key intervention would be to protect the labour force through a scaling up of vaccinations in industry and workplaces. Employers must also be encouraged to retain or opt for staggered working hours and work-from-home protocols. The national vaccination strategy, however, remains inscrutable and non-transparent, since more vaccines, including WHO-approved ones, remain unavailable to Indians for unspecified reasons. Allowing all proven vaccines to be offered in cities with suitable cold chain capacity at prices comparable to European or U.S. acquisitions — typically under $20 a dose for m-RNA vaccines — would be as much a decision on the economy as on public health, making more Covishield and Covaxin doses available to priority recipients. This cannot, of course, be a silver bullet, given the big population that remains to be covered, the fast pace of virus spread enabled in part by variants and younger age groups showing symptomatic disease. At present, the social vaccine — masking, healthy distancing and public etiquette — is vitally important, more so because the health system is not equipped to handle severe disease countrywide. The scientific view of pandemic fatigue is that people see the opportunity cost of prolonged adherence to demanding restrictions as too high, considering the value of things lost. That includes access to education, meeting with loved ones, performing life rituals, and the conflict of both work and home confined to the same space. This universal experience is made worse in India by deficits in housing, mobility options and good living conditions. It is important for the government, therefore, to come up with rational activity curbs, keep them stable and incentivise people, including through financial rewards. These initiatives can lower the perception of lost opportunities and compensate workers in the affected sectors such as the travel, food and hospitality industries. This road map can be reviewed when vaccines become widely available and cases decline, although a return to a carefree past is a long way off. Political communication on the state of the pandemic lacked a clear sense of purpose during festivals and poll campaigns. Now, the COVID-19 strategy can avert costly partial or full lockdowns only with public cooperation, and that calls for building credibility and trust.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/salvaging-strategy/article34306911.ece
13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Save the deal||The Vienna talks between the remaining members of the Iran nuclear deal — China, Russia, the U.K., France, Germany and Iran — have raised hopes for the revival of the agreement from which then President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. in May 2018. After the initial round of talks, European and Iranian diplomats have said efforts to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the deal is officially called, are on “the right track”. An American delegation, led by Robert Malley, the White House special envoy for Iran, is also in Vienna, though the Americans and the Iranians would not hold direct talks. All sides agree that bringing the deal back on track is ideal, but who will blink first? The U.S. wants Iran to end its uranium enrichment and centrifuge development programmes and return to the 2015 agreement, while Tehran has demanded the U.S. lift all sanctions imposed by Mr. Trump and still enforced by President Joe Biden. The agenda at Vienna, therefore, is to produce a road map for the revival of the JCPOA by addressing these two critical issues — Iran’s nuclear enhanced programme and American sanctions. The Biden administration has displayed flexibility in its approach towards Iran. The President appointed a special envoy, ended the U.S.’s support for Saudi Arabia’s war against the Houthis, Iran-backed militants, in Yemen and promised to lift sanctions if Tehran returns to the JCPOA terms. The administration has also reportedly made an offer to Iran to release $1 billion of Iranian money frozen in South Korea as part of the sanctions in exchange for ending its 20% uranium enrichment. But a wary Iran, which was fully compliant with the agreement when Mr. Trump abandoned it and slapped back sanctions, has rejected the offer, seeking more concrete measures from the U.S. The challenge both sides are facing is a lack of time. Iran holds its presidential polls in June. If the U.S.’s best chance to address Iran’s nuclear programme is through the revival of the JCPOA, the best possibility of reviving the agreement is to do it (or at least agree on a road map) before the presidential election. There are external dangers as well. Iran-backed Shia militias in Iraq continue to target U.S. forces and bases in Iraq. The Israel-Iran shadow conflict is now being fought inside Syria and on the seas. Last week, an Iranian ship was attacked in the Red Sea. If security tensions rise in the region involving Iran and its proxies, it could derail the diplomatic efforts. The U.S. and Iran should exercise restraint, stay focused on talks and rebuild the lost trust, and take measures to get the deal back on track that would resolve the nuclear crisis in return for dismantling the sanctions regime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/save-the-deal/article34306912.ece

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||India will have 1 bn people by 2000||United Nations, April 12: U.N. experts predict that there will be more than a billion people in China by the year 1990 and more than a billion in India by 2000, when the world’s population will total almost 6.5 billion. Those and other projections by the U.N. Population Division are given in the latest issue of the monthly bulletin of Statistics, circulated here this week-end. The latest comparable U.N. estimates of actual population for mid-1969 are 740 million for China, 537 million for India and 3.552 billion for the world. The projections show that the world’s population will top four billion by 1975, nearly five billion by 1985, 5.5 billion by 1990 and six billion by 1995, and hit 6.493 billion in 2000. Between 1975 and 2000, they indicate, the population of the world’s more developed regions will go from 1.147 billion to 1.453 billion. The number of people in the Soviet Union, the world’s third most populous country with an estimated 240 million in mid-1969, is figured to increase from 235 million in 1975 to 316 million in 1990 and 329 million in 2000. The fourth-ranking United States, with an estimated 203 million people in mid-1969, is expected to have 219 million people in 1975 and 252 million in 1985, the last year of projections for industrialised western countries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/india-will-have-1-bn-people-by-2000/article34306921.ece
13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Retail inflation quickens to 5.52%||India’s industrial output fell for the second successive month in February 2021, contracting 3.6% year on year, even as retail inflation quickened to a four-month high of 5.52% in March, as per data released by the National Statistical Office on Monday. Electricity was the only sector to register positive growth of a meagre 0.1%, while manufacturing output shrank 3.7% and mining slipped 5.5%, as per the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). Revised data The IIP had contracted 0.87% in January, as per revised data, compared to a 1.6% dip estimated earlier. Final data for November 2020 was also revised upwards, with industrial output in the month shrinking 1.6% compared to a 1.9% dip estimated earlier. The base effect played a role on both the indices, said economists, as industrial output in February 2020 had hit a 16-month high, at the time, of 5.2%, while food inflation, which played a key role in driving up the overall price rise print in March, was partly bolstered by the lower price trends last year even though food prices have declined month-on-month. ‘29-month high’ “Core inflation jumped to a 29-month high of 5.96% in March 2021 from 3.95% a year ago and 5.88% in February due to demand and increase in commodity prices,” said Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research. Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA Limited, termed the core inflation near 6% as ‘unnerving’ but added that the decline in prices of vegetables such as onions as well as a reversal of the base effect was expected to dampen the food inflation to around 2-2.5% in April 2021. The IIP numbers suggest that the recovery in industrial volumes lacks conviction, she said. ‘Lacklustre production’ “The trend of recent months reinforces the view that the uptick witnessed in the months of September and October-2020 was more due to a combination of festive and pent-up demand and we are still far from witnessing a sustained recovery,” Mr. Pant said. “Growth pattern of primary and intermediate goods, two leading indicators of industrial production are pointing towards a lacklustre industrial performance in the short- to medium-run,” he stressed, adding that this would necessitate continued demand support from both the government as well as the Reserve Bank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/retail-inflation-quickens-to-552/article34306895.ece
13 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Health boost behind non-life insurers’ show in 2020-21||Rising demand for health covers, evident since COVID-19 outbreak, seems to have come as a booster shot for non-life insurers as they posted a 5.2% increase in gross direct premium underwritten for 2020-21. Comprising general insurers (all of whom deal in health insurance too), standalone health insurers and the two specialised PSU insurers (ECGC and AIC of India), the non-life segment reported Rs. 1,98,734.68 crore in gross direct premium underwritten. For 2019-20, it totalled Rs. 1,88,916.61 crore. Of this, the gross direct premium underwritten by the general insurers (25 firms) increased 3.35% to Rs. 1,69,840.05 crore. These companies between them account for more than 85% of the non-life market. In March, a busy month for insurers on account of customer rush to benefit from tax breaks available on certain covers, the general insurers’ premium increased 14.59% to Rs. 15,683.39 crore., according to flash figures released by insurance regulator IRDAI. 11% growth The stand-alone private health insurers registered Rs. 15,720.04 crore gross direct premium underwritten or 11% more than the previous fiscal. In March, the increase was as much as 41% to Rs. 2,185.05 crore. While segment-wise business figures, of the non-life insurers, for full fiscal are yet to be released, numbers upto February show general and standalone health insurers posting a 13% rise in health premium to Rs. 52,886.54 crore. Their performance has also to be seen in the context of no revision in the motor third party tariff, slow pick- up in automobile sales as also the weak economic sentiment. Up to February, motor insurance premium, one of their mainstays, was 3.83% lower at Rs. 63,268.32 crore. Of this, third-party premium at Rs. 39,067.87 crore was lower by 4.12%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/health-boost-behind-non-life-insurers-show-in-2020-21/article34306892.ece
13 April 2021||MUMBAI,||TCS Q4 net profit jumps 15%||Tata Consultancy Services on Monday reported its consolidated net profit grew 14.9% to Rs. 9,246 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared with the year earlier period. Revenue rose 9.4% to Rs. 43,705 crore. Constant currency growth was 5.9%. Net margin at 21.2% was one percentage point more than a year earlier.

For FY21, net profit grew 3.2% to Rs. 33,388 crore (excluding legal claim provision) on revenue of Rs. 1,64,177 crore, which was up 4.6%. “Our investments over the last decade in building newer capabilities, and in research and innovation, position us well for the multi-year technology services opportunity ahead,” Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD, said. “Our focus going into FY22 will be to engage with clients in their growth agenda, propelled by innovation and leverage of collective knowledge,” he added. “Our performance in Q4 caps three quarters of consistently robust performance in a pandemic year, and gives us a strong exit from FY21,” V. Ramakrishnan, CFO, said. In the quarter, BFSI rose 13.3% (year-on-year), retail and CPG fell 0.9%, life sciences and healthcare climbed 19.3% and manufacturing was up 1.3%. Growth was led by Continental Europe at 11.7%, while North America grew 5.9%, and the U.K. climbed about 1%.

13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Industry seeks vaccines for all age groups, expedited supply||The industry on Monday called for accelerated vaccine production and supply across the country and opening up vaccination for all age groups. It, however, stressed that factories and shop floors should be kept open for economic reasons. “At this juncture, the Confederation of Indian Industry [CII] calls for quick action to be taken by the Government on ‘whatever it takes’ to ramp up production, supply and distribution of vaccines,” CII president Uday Kotak said. “Strict following and enforcement of safety and hygiene protocols by all sections of society is absolutely critical,” he added. The industry body reiterated that lockdown was not a solution in the present times and requested for maintaining stringent COVID-related protocols for public places and workplaces. To control the rampant spread of infections, CII recommended that no meeting or gathering comprising more than 10 people be permitted for any purpose. “Factories and shop floors must be kept open for economic reasons so that production and supply chains are not disturbed,” it said. ‘Work from home’ should be adopted wherever possible, and in cases where it is not feasible, only one-third attendance of employees should be permitted, the CII added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/industry-seeks-vaccines-for-all-age-groups-expedited-supply/article34306901.ece
13 April 2021||MUMBAI,||Lockdown fears spook markets, Sensex falls 3.5%||Fears of the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its possible impact on the economy drove benchmark stock indices down by about 3.5% on Monday. The slump was led by a meltdown in banking and finance stocks. The S&P BSE Sensex plunged 1,707.94 or 3.44% to 47,883.38. All the 30 shares of the Sensex except for Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories closed in the red. The top three losers included IndusInd Bank (down 8.6%), Bajaj Finance (7.39%) and SBI (6.87%). The NSE Nifty 50 too plunged 524.05 points or 3.53% to 14,310.80. Top gainers were Dr. Reddy’s and Cipla. Recording its sixth straight session of loss, the rupee plunged to an almost 9-month low, depreciating 32 paise to 75.05 against the U.S. dollar at the interbank foreign exchange, dealers said. “Rising cases of COVID-19 and fear of probable lockdowns... led to a sell-off in our [stock] markets, which resulted in a huge underperformance compared to global peers,” said Ruchit Jain, senior analyst (Technical and Derivatives), Angel Broking. “We expect the rupee to weaken versus the USD as have other [emerging market] currencies, and we expect that for the next six months, the Indian economy may progress in fits and starts; the relatively slow progress of vaccination in India means that we will be slower to recover compared to the U.S.”, said R.

13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Auto sales fell 13.6% in year, grew 77% in March||Even though total domestic vehicle sales grew almost 77% in March — albeit on a lower base — on an annual basis wholesales fell 13.6% to about 1.86 crore units in FY21, data from Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) showed. Passenger vehicle wholesales more than doubled in March 2021 to over 2.9 lakh units, from a year earlier. Similarly, two-wheeler sales in the month grew 72% to more than 14.96 lakh units. Overall sales in March rose to 18.19 lakh units from 10.29 lakh units. The data did not include Tata Motors’ numbers. For FY21, passenger vehicle sales fell 2.24% to 27.11 lakh units. Commercial vehicles sales declined 20.8% to 5.68 lakh. “A deep structural slowdown in the industry even before the pandemic, combined with the impact of COVID-19 in [FY21], has pushed all vehicle segments back by many years. Recovery... will require time and effort, by all stakeholders,” said SIAM president Kenichi Ayukawa. He added there was uncertainty owing to semiconductor shortages, lockdowns and input costs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/auto-sales-fell-136-in-year-grew-77-in-march/article34306899.ece

Goals from Harmanpreet Singh (11th minute), Lalit Upadhyay (25th) and Mandeep Singh (58th) on Sunday gave the visitors a deserved triumph over Los Leones, adding three more points to the two they had claimed against the hosts in Saturday’s shoot-out, which earned them a bonus point. By virtue of this win, India, with 15 points from eight games, climbed up to fourth place in the FIH Hockey Pro League standings, moving one point ahead of Australia having played the same number of games. India, Argentina and Australia will play against each other at the forthcoming Olympics, where they have been drawn in Pool A alongside Spain, New Zealand and home favourite Japan. Argentina sits sixth in the FIH Hockey Pro League standings, with 11 points from 12 games. Excellent saves Argentina started brightly and would have been ahead had it not been for some excellent saves from India goalkeeper Krishan Bahadur Pathak, who twice denied Martin Ferreiro. Harmanpreet then converted India’s first penalty corner of the game in the 11th minute. Lalit doubled India’s lead when he showed lightning quick reactions in the second quarter, pouncing on a save from Argentina custodian Juan Vivaldi to slot home. Keeping calm The result was confirmed two minutes from the final hooter when Mandeep fired home from close range, losing his footing but keeping his composure to guide an backhand effort into the net. “I think we defended well,” said India goalkeeper Pathak, who was named Player of the Match. “They are good in defence but we created a lot of chances. We scored the goals, so that is good for us. We have to work on a lot of things, in defence, in midfield also. “We have to learn from this match.” India will next travel to Great Britain for the two-leg tie on May 8 and 9.  The result: Argentina 0 lost to India 3 (Harmanpreet Singh 11, Lalit Upadhyay 25, Mandeep Singh 58).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dominant-india-takes-argentina-to-the-cleaners/article34307075.ece
13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Rahul and Hooda lift PBKS above phenomenal Samson’s reach||Is there something in a name? Punjab Kings — unlike William Shakespeare — could well believe there is, after a dramatic four-run victory over Rajasthan Royals at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Monday night. The team known as Kings XI Punjab until last season — and which often found itself on the losing side of tight contests in 2020 — must be pleased with edging a thriller and starting this year’s campaign with a win. Perfect combination It would be unfair to skipper K.L. Rahul (91, 50b, 7x4, 5x6) and Deepak Hooda (64, 28b, 4x4, 6x6), however, to credit a change in nomenclature for Punjab’s victory. The gentle classicism of Rahul combined beautifully with the brutal hitting from Hooda, as the duo helped PBKS post 221 for six after being put in. That would prove enough to nullify a brilliant 119 off 63 balls (12x4, 7x6) from RR skipper Sanju Samson, who was out off the last ball, caught by Hooda near the deep extra-cover boundary off Arshdeep Singh when five were needed. Samson had nearly pulled off a heist in his first match as captain. RR’s chase had got off to a disastrous start when Ben Stokes was caught and bowled by Mohammed Shami off the third ball of the innings. It would have been worse if Rahul hadn't dropped his counterpart Samson off Arshdeep a little later. The RR skipper gave another chance and also survived an lbw verdict, thanks to DRS, on his way to a third IPL hundred. Nobody else went past 25. Samson was, however, given excellent support down the order by Shivam Dube (23) and Riyan Parag (25) after RR was reduced to 70 for three when Jos Buttler (25) was cleaned up by Jhye Richardson. Earlier, Rahul and Hooda put on 105 for the third wicket off just 47 balls, after a 28-ball 40 from Chris Gayle. Among the bowlers, debutant Chetan Sakariya stood out. The 23-year-old left-arm seamer, who had to put behind him the tragedy of losing his brother just three months ago, claimed three for 31 off four overs. Sakariya also took what could be one of the catches of the season. He flew, like a goalkeeper, to his left and came up with a two-handed blinder to send Nicholas Pooran back for a golden duck off Chris Morris. A little later, Rahul Tewatia also came up with a stunner to destroy his namesake Rahul’s hopes of a hundred with a juggling act near the mid-wicket boundary off Sakariya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahul-and-hooda-lift-pbks-above-phenomenal-samsons-reach/article34307011.ece

KKR batted in top gear against Sunrisers Hyderabad to start the tournament on a high. It beat David Warner’s side by 10 runs. And when it meets Mumbai Indians at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Tuesday, expect KKR to go berserk with the bat once again. The side will be keen on improving its head-to-head record against the five-time champion and keeping the net run rate (NRR) up. Of the 27 games between the teams, KKR has managed just six wins to Mumbai’s 21. Key players Left-hander Nitish Rana, who blasted 80 off 56 in the opener, should continue with the fireworks in the PowerPlay. He has a seasoned partner in Shubman Gill, who has the ability to negate the Jasprit Bumrah threat. MI will be hoping to put up a better show with the bat after managing just 159 in its first match of the season against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Favourite opponent Skipper Rohit Sharma, who missed out on a big score due to an unfortunate run out, will be eager to flex his muscles against his favourite opponent. Rohit has 939 runs against KKR in the IPL at an average of 46.95. Even his only hundred in the tournament came against the Kolkata side. de Kock available South Africa wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock is out of quarantine and available for selection. It remains to be seen whether he makes the final XI ahead of Chris Lynn, who scored 49 off 35 balls against RCB.

Carrying the hopes of a nation on his shoulders, Matsuyama calmly grinded out clutch pars and struck crucial birdies in a pressure-packed march at Augusta National, hanging on over the final holes for a historic one-stroke victory. Matsuyama took the green jacket symbolic of Masters supremacy, a top prize of $2.07 million and a place for the ages in Japanese sports history. “I’m really happy,” he said through a translator. “Hopefully I’ll be a pioneer in this and many other Japanese will follow. I’m happy to open the floodgate and many more will follow me.” Triple-bogey After seeing his seven-stroke lead with seven holes remaining shaved to two shots with three to go, Matsuyama watched Schauffele find water off the 16th tee on the way to a triple-bogey disaster. “I felt like I gave him a little bit of a run and made a little bit of excitement for the tournament until I met a watery grave there,” Schauffele said. “I’ll be able to sleep tonight. It might be hard but I’ll be OK.” Matsuyama settled for bogey but closed with par at 17 and a bogey at 18 to fire a one-over-par 73 and finish 72 holes on 10-under 278. “My nerves really didn’t start on the second nine,” Matsuyama said. “It was from the start today to the very last putt.” American Will Zalatoris was second in his Masters debut on 279 after a closing 70 with US three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and American Schauffele sharing third on 281.  The final placings: 278 Hideki Matsuyama (69, 71, 65, 73); 279 Will Zalatoris 279 (70, 68, 71, 70); 281 Jordan Spieth (71, 68, 72, 70), Xander Schauffele (72, 69, 68, 72); 282 Jon Rahm (72, 72, 72, 66), Marc Leishman (72, 67, 70, 73); 283 Justin Rose (65, 72, 72, 74); 284 Patrick Reed (70, 75, 70, 69), Corey Conners (73, 69, 68, 74); 285 Cameron Smith (74, 68, 73, 70), Tony Finau (74, 66, 73, 72).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/matsuyamas-augusta-triumph-sends-japan-into-a-tizzy/article34307018.ece
13 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Praggnanandhaa wins the Polgar Challenge||R. Praggnanandhaa won the prestigious Polgar Challenge in style with a round to spare on Sunday and gained a berth to join the elite players in the next Meltwater Champions Chess Tour event beginning on April 24. The 15-year-old stayed clear of the challengers by maintaining his eventual victory margin over the last two rounds of the 20-player round-robin event. Praggnanandhaa (15.5 points) scored 14 victories, drew thrice and lost twice in the four-day online rapid tournament and earned $3,000 for his efforts. As per the points scored by members of the two teams, Team Polgar beat Team Kramnik, that included Pragnanandhaa, 96.5-88. Four-way tie D. Gukesh and second seed Nihal Sarin were part of the four-way tie at 14 points for the runner-up spot that eventually went to top seed from Uzbekistan, Nodirbek Abdusattorov. Armed with a half-point lead on the final day when four rounds were scheduled, Pragnanandhaa scored 3.5 points after finishing his campaign with a hard-fought draw against Abdusattorov. In the day’s earlier rounds, Pragnanandhaa beat compatriot Leon Mendonca, Zhansaya Abdumalik (Kazakhstan) and Sarasadat Khademalsharieh (Iran). In fact, it was Abdusattorov’s surprise defeat to China’s Lei Tingjie in the 17th round that opened up a 1.5-point gap between the top two. Commenting on the games, Vladimir Kramnik drew similarities between Pragnanandhaa and Viswanathan Anand. “His chess also pretty much reminds me of Vishy — universal, sharp, quick, with a good sense of dynamics, with a good feeling of the position.” Anand hailed the young champion. “Congrats. Prag dominated and showed his class. But now we have some work, getting him ready for the big one!”  Final standings (after 19 rounds):   1. R. Praggnanandhaa (15.5 points); 2-5.

It is really an amazing opportunity, experience and exposure to understand the highest level of tennis. “In [Jelena] Ostapenko and [Anasija] Sevastova, you have a Grand Slam champion, and someone who has been in the top-50 in the world for a while. Just put your head down and play with your heart. The pressure is on them, not on you. Enjoy the moment,” said the six-time Grand Slam champion Sania, when queried about her message for the team. The Indian team has assembled in Jurmala for the tie to be played on indoor hard courts on April 16 and 17, against former French Open champion Ostapenko and Latvia No. 1 Sevastova. “Ankita is a bit ahead of the other girls, in terms of ranking at least. She has got a WTA event under her belt which is amazing. All three, to make that next big step, need to do a few things right and a lot of things have to fall into place. They have all put in the hard work. It is about clicking at the right time. Move forward “Playing good tennis during the opportunities they get, they can really step it up and move forward. I think Ankita is a little closer to that than the other two. Karman is someone who is very very talented. “She is still young. I think that staying injury free is the most important thing for her,” said Sania, as she viewed her teammates’ prospects. Even as she focuses on the job at hand, Sania was willing to look at the bigger picture for the season, the Tokyo Olympics. “I am preparing for Tokyo. With the COVID situation, we have to take it day by day. I am playing as much as I can under the circumstances. I am looking forward to my fourth Olympics. It is an honour to represent India.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/amazing-opportunity-to-learn-feels-sania/article34307066.ece
13 April 2021||Sheffield,||Arsenal sends Sheffield to the edge||Arsenal eased to a 3-0 win at Bramall Lane as Sheffield United’s relegation from the Premier League edged ever closer on Sunday. A wonderful team goal scored by Alexandre Lacazette gave the visitors the halftime lead before Gabriel Martinelli marked his recall with a goal in the 71st. Lacazette struck again late on for his 50th league goal for the Gunners. It was Arsenal’s first clean sheet in 14 matches in all competitions and the three points moved Mikel Arteta’s team up to ninth. Stuck at the bottom For the Blades, it was a 25th league loss of the season and they remain stuck to the bottom of the table. Atletico Madrid moved back to the top of LaLiga on Sunday after a 1-1 draw against Real Betis opened a one-point lead over city rival Real. Despite missing 19-goal striker Luis Suarez, Atletico was in front after just five minutes when Belgian international Yannick Carrasco scored into an empty net after a goal-mouth scramble. However, Betis, which is in sixth place in the table and chasing European football next season, levelled just 15 minutes later. Cristian Tello was on hand to score from just inside the box.  The results: Premier League: Sheffield United 0 lost to Arsenal 3 (Lacazette 33, 85, Martinelli 71).

13 April 2021||Paris,||Davis Cup Finals in three cities||The 2021 Davis Cup Finals will be held in three cities, with Innsbruck and Turin joining Madrid as hosts, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) announced on Monday. The competition was reformed in 2019, with Rafael Nadal’s Spain winning the 18-team competition in Madrid, but scheduling issues resulted in a number of late finishes and poor attendances at some matches. The ITF said Madrid, Austrian city Innsbruck and Turin in Italy would host two of the six groups each, with the latter two both staging one quarterfinal. The Spanish capital will host two last-eight ties, the semifinals and the final. The finals will run from November 25 to Dec. 5. “It was important to find two European cities that were well connected to Madrid, with similar playing conditions, to provide a smooth transition for players travelling from other venues,” said tournament director Albert Costa. “With confirmation of the three venues, we are already working hard to offer the best possible event in 2021.” The 2019 finals were the first in a single-city format under a deal between the ITF and Kosmos, an investment group headed by football player Gerard Pique, which is financing the event. The 2020 tournament was called off due to complications posed by thepandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/davis-cup-finals-in-three-cities/article34307076.ece

13 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Justice Varma to accept his appointment||Justice Deepak Varma, a former Supreme Court Judge, said on Monday that he would formally accept his appointment as Ombudsman-cum-Ethics Officer of Hyderabad Cricket Association. “It appears that now all hurdles are over and I can assume charge of Ombudsman, unless the said Order of the Single Judge of the High Court is modified or set aside by a Higher Court, he said in a letter addressed to the HCA president Mohd. Azharuddin. Azhar had announced after the AGM on Sunday that Justice Varma’s appointment had been ratified at the AGM even as the group led by HCA secretary R. Vijayanand disputed that claim. “Since COVID-19 pandemic is once again back in the country in full swing and that I had been advised by his doctors not to leave home at all, much less Delhi. So, the question of reaching Hyderabad in the near future does not arise,” he said in the letter. “Should there be any urgent issue, which is required to be sorted out immediately, then that can be dealt with virtual hearing,” Justice Varma mentioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/justice-varma-to-accept-his-appointment/article34307559.ece

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Srihari primed for Tokyo 2020 qualification event||The final stretch leading into a competition like the Olympic Games is generally reserved by athletes to even out rough edges and chisel their games to perfection. But for Srihari Nataraj, India’s best bet to achieve the elusive A-mark Olympic Qualifying Time in swimming, it has been markedly different. A combination of factors — the National lockdown last year, a shoulder injury and a personal tragedy (loss of his father) — have meant the 20-year-old back-stroker is only back in shape now, looking to get as many events as possible three months shy of the July 23 start date for Tokyo 2020. This week he is in Tashkent for the Uzbekistan Open swimming championships, an Olympic qualification event, hoping to bridge the 0.84 seconds gap between his best timing (54.69s) and the A-mark (53.85s) in his pet 100m backstroke race scheduled for Thursday.  “I had lost my pace completely,” Srihari says, recalling the time of the lockdown last year. “Sir (Nihar Ameen, his coach) and I had to train like it was another off season and like I was out of form. But based on how I have been training and how I have been feeling — in the gym, during workouts and the pool — I could say this is the best shape I have ever been in.” “I just did my best time in 50m backstroke (25.46s at an invitational event in Bengaluru) without a shave and a taper. That’s another sign that I am on track.” Inputs from Sokolovas  Inputs from Genadijus Sokolovas, a renowned physiologist and sports science expert from the United States who has in the past worked with legends like Michael Phelps, has helped too. Sokolovas was invited by the Swimming Federation of India in February for a few sessions with the Olympic hopefuls. “He asked me to add a couple more dolphin kicks to increase my underwater pace,” Srihari says. “We noticed it made a difference. He also asked me to pull shallower (to reduce the drag). “The body is now adjusting to move that way and that is how my stroke will be.” Best bet The Uzbekistan event might be Srihari’s best bet. The environment is familiar, having raced here in the 2017 Asian Age Group Championships and done well. With COVID-19 continuing to wreak havoc, tournament schedules around the world are at best dicey. “There is of course some little pressure that this might be my last option or even the best option,” Srihari admits. “[But] I am trying to stay calm, knowing that the training has been done. “I have never been this fit, this lean and big at the same time. I am very hopeful that I will get the A-qualification done. That’s what sir feels, I feel and the training shows.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/back-stroker-srihari-primed-for-tokyo-2020-qualification-event/article34307259.ece
13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||We have a destructive batting unit: Morgan||After starting its IPL campaign with a convincing win over Sunrisers Hyderabad, skipper Eoin Morgan felt Kolkata Knight Riders has one of the most destructive batting units in the competition. KKR’s 10-run win was set up by Nitish Rana and Rahul Tripathi’s aggressive half-centuries which helped the side post 187 on Sunday. “One of the many strengths within our squad is we have two of the most talented guys (Shubman Gill and Rana) in the country opening the batting for us,” said Morgan. “Tripathi today at three played beautifully, and the middle-order we have is extremely versatile. When Dinesh (Karthik) plays like that or Andre (Russell) plays the game he can play, you're going to see a very destructive batting unit that has the potential to win you matches,” he added Meanwhile, Sunrisers’ chase fizzled out after Jonny Bairstow was dismissed in the 13th over. When asked about Bairstow’s position at No. 4, SRH coach Trevor Bayliss pointed to the success of Wriddhiman Saha as an opener towards the end of the tournament last year when the side made the playoffs after a slow start. “At the moment what we want to do is reward the guys who finished the tournament so well last year. We know Jonny can open the batting and keep wickets as well,” said Bayliss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-have-a-destructive-batting-unit-morgan/article34307013.ece

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Uniqueness of Brahman||A sutra is a short statement in which is packed much profound thought. The second sutra in the Brahma Sutra takes up the issue of the jagat karanatvam and draws from the Taittiriya Upanishad mantra, “ yato va imani bhutani jayante .” Here, the Upanishad adopts a step by step enquiry to unravel the uniqueness and speciality of Brahman who is shown to be both the material as well the instrumental cause for this universe, pointed out Sri Padmanabhachariar in a discourse. In our practical experience we see so many objects around us and we tend to wonder about their worth, utility, and also about their maker, and of his capability in bringing them into existence with various kinds of material available in this world. For instance, a mud pot is made from the base material mud; and this mud gets transformed into a pot owing to a process, when the potter who is experienced at the potter’s wheel shapes the mud into a pot. From the raw material gold, the goldsmith fashions many items of jewellery. The material is achetana. It cannot transform itself and requires a skilled person to effect the transformation. Sastras conclude that only the Supreme Brahman with infinite prowess could be responsible for this wonderful creation with all its variety in name, form, etc. He alone has the unbelievable efficiency to conduct each and every aspect of the universe from time immemorial wherein the jivas and beings constantly are born, grow and pass on from birth to birth. Visishtadvaita tradition holds that out of the Lord’s Sankalpa this universe is created. He is all-pervasive, outside, inside and everywhere. This is exemplified in the Narasimha avatar when He manifests from the pillar chosen by Hiranyakasipu. He affirms that He is always ready to help devotees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/uniqueness-of-brahman/article34306971.ece

13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Living the dream||He gets to rub shoulders with some of the all-time greats of the sport of basketball, and works in the top tier of the game — the NBA; but Suyash Mehta has something unique that he can lay claim to. Born to immigrant parents in the U.S., Suyash is the first person of Indian descent to become an NBA referee. “My parents came to America in the ‘80s and my father pursued a career in medicine. My mother was a botanist but later raised four kids, she had her hands full. Our whole upbringing was based on our parents educating us about Indian values; our first language was Hindi and then we ended up learning English,” he says, over a Zoom call from the U.S. Suyash was a medical student, but pursued refereeing part-time. However, when there was an opportunity to take it up full-time, he grabbed it with both hands. Excerpts from an interview:  Tell us about your journey from being a medical student to becoming an NBA referee? I used to play a bit of club basketball during my time at the University of Maryland. It was quite an untraditional path for me because I never thought that I will be a referee. It was something that I was doing as a part-time job in the college. I had this opportunity after college that allowed me to try out for the minor league, and it was the toughest decision of my life because the same year, I had taken my MCAT to go to medical school.I remember sitting down with my parents and having to explain to them that I may not be going to medical school and that I will be pushing back my decision till the time I pursue this dream of becoming an NBA referee. Luckily for me, it paid off. I would not trade it for anything in the world. Referees are also one of the most criticised group in all sports. How do you handle the criticism?  We are so used to hearing the fans and all the boos. However, this year, when there are no fans in the arena, sometimes you tend to miss it. But honestly, it has never really fazed me too much. Especially, pre-pandemic when the arenas were packed, it was always in the background. It was a cool ability to block it out and sometimes it really sharpened my focus. What sort of physical and mental preparation is required of a referee officiating an NBA game?  The lifestyle of a referee is not too far off from athletes. I don’t think I can say that I can dunk the ball ( laughs ) but I take my training pretty seriously. We don’t eat fast food. We take health very seriously because it’s the only way you can have longevity in this career, especially because you may be doing it twice as long as some of the players. So, it’s everything... from working out to staying conditioned, to doing cardio, to doing weightlifting. In the off-season, you are always preparing for the start of the next NBA season. It is a constant cycle.  We are so used to hearing the fans and all the boos. However, this year, when there are no fans in the arena, sometimes you tend to miss it||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/living-the-dream/article34307215.ece
13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Success secrets||Kubbra Sait’s mother once gifted her a cylindrical, cat-shaped jar, which she uses as a repository of gratitude. In it, you would find chits where she has written about the things she is thankful about. The latest chit is about her homecoming. She was in Europe for over seven months due to shooting and travel restrictions. Despite having a good time there, she wished to return to her home in Mumbai. So, when she did, about two weeks ago, she made sure to add to her gratitude jar. “You actually realise that so many things that you ask for on the fly, actually happen. And, when they happen, I think it is important to acknowledge those moments,” she says over a video call from her home. “Gratitude is not the lack of wanting something but it is the appreciation of getting something that you wanted.” Kubbra discusses gratitude at length in My 3 Secrets to Success , an Audible podcast, featuring celebrities from various fields speaking about success. ‘Gratitude’ is atop her list of three secrets to success, followed by ‘challenging yourself’ and ‘getting good sleep’. Kubbra, however, finds it a bit strange that she was invited to the show, because she believes that success is ‘overrated’ “Every little thing that you do can be called success, depending on how you weigh it,” she says. “I have definitely moved a few notches up from where I was as I took the opportunities that came my way. I think when you do what you’ve always wished to do and do it well, that’s success.” She has been in three different careers and been successful in all of them. She was a marketing specialist at Microsoft in Dubai over a decade ago. Then, in the early 2010s, she began hosting shows. She did a few films, too, including Ready, Sultan and Gully Boy, among others. But her performance as Kukoo in Sacred Games widened her popularity. Last year, Kubbra was in Jawaani Jaaneman alongside Saif Ali Khan and in two OTT shows — Illegal - Justice, Out of Order on Voot and Waqalat From Home on Amazon Prime. Kubbra does not consider one career more successful over another, but finds acting most fascinating. “As a host, I never associated myself with my profession. I believe that what you do, who you meet, what religion you follow, where you work… all these are extensions of you. As an actor, I think the liberating thing is that you are never yourself; you are always associating yourself with some other soul. So, in that sense, it feels magical.” There are more projects lined up this year, including Apple TV’s Foundation . Apart from these, she is also working on a memoir, which, at 37, might seem like a vanity project. Kubbra says there is a reason for it. “To let people know, through my experiences, that I am broken, I have failed, I have been down and out and had the courage to stand up again. If this resonates with someone, then my job is done.” For now, however, Kubbra is glad to be back home, in the presence of her white Persian cat, Shifu Sait, who keeps distracting her during the call. “The traffic, rice and dal, my cat… I realised how much emotional comfort I find in India.”  As an actor, I think the liberating thing is that you are never yourself; you are always associating yourself with some other soul. So, in that sense, it feels magical KUBBRA SAIT||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/success-secrets/article34307223.ece
13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Camera is an extension of my personality’||Cinematographer Sanu John Varghese, known for films such as Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon, Karthik Calling Karthik, Vishwaroopam, Wazir, Badhai Ho and Lootcase, has made his directorial début with the recently-released Malayalam film, Aarkkariyam . The film, which he directed and co-wrote, stars Biju Menon, Sharafudheen and Parvathy Thiruvothu. Sanu speaks to MetroPlus about two topics close to his heart: Aarkkariyam and cinematography. Edited excerpts: What is Aarkkariyam about? It is about three people following their religious convictions. The story follows a couple who live in Mumbai with their child. It is the second marriage for both of them. They return to their ancestral home, which is on a large property and isolated. Over time, they realise the deeper you dig, the more disruption one finds. As a cinematographer, how differently do you see the world around you?  Light is an important element and provides the mood for every story that is told. So, as a cinematographer, you tend to look out for this more than the others because that is what you primarily work with. You consciously become aware of the varied kinds of lights around you. It becomes part of your life, your body. Cinematography is something like that. The camera is an extension of your own personality. Aarkkariyam too has the landscape and the interior parts of Kerala where I grew up. Hence, the film captures the light, colours and mood that I have seen in reality.  You have worked with Kamal Haasan and Farhan Akhtar. How is it to work with people with such varied ideologies?   Any of these creative fields provide leads to creative collaborations, even before you start making the film. It gets easier with people who share a similar taste and intellect. It an equation of taste and collaboration. A cinematographer adapts to these aspects of every team. That, for me, is one of the basic characteristics of a cinematographer. The challenge is to understand someone else’s vision and bring it to life on screen. Cinematography, for me, is about telling a story through visuals. Certain films demand a certain kind of a drama, while others demand realism. So as cinematographer, I need to keep that as my primary concern rather than create an identity for myself as someone who creates great visuals. If the latter happens, it is not good as the primary goal of narrating a story. The trick is to be as less visible as possible behind the camera. You have worked in Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam films. Any Kannada film in the offing?  I am open to it. As of now, nothing has come up. If a story gives me scope for strong visuals, then why not? I also feel a certain amount of understanding the language becomes crucial for everyone involved in the making. How have digital platforms changed filmmaking?  You learn to tell stories in a different way. With OTT, you do not have a captive audience, as in, one who has paid money to watch something for three hours. You can take this audience to the edge of boredom because, once inside the theatre, he is not going to get up and walk off. But, not so with OTT. You need to hold the person’s attention, caught in the middle of his many activities. We have to get their attention despite that. So, it is a challenge.  Cinematography, according to Sanu John Varghese, is about telling a story through visuals||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/camera-is-an-extension-of-my-personality/article34307220.ece
13 April 2021||April 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Annaatthe resumes shoot||Rajinikanth-starrer Annaatthe is back on track. The makers of the film posted a photo of director Siva and Rajinikanth on sets. In December 2020, the shooting of this film had come to a stop following the outbreak of COVID-19 on the sets. Though the star tested negative, he spent a few days in hospital and under the observation of doctors, before heading to Chennai for rest. Earlier, the makers announced that the film would hit screens by Pongal 2021, but that has been delayed due to the pandemic. Directed by Siva, the film is expected to be a family-action drama, on the lines of Rajinikanth’s earlier hits like Padayappa and Arunachalam . The superstar’s last film was Darbar with A.R. Murugadoss, which didn’t quite set the box office on fire. Produced by Sun Pictures, Annaatthe has an ensemble cast comprising names like Khushbu, Meena, Keerthy Suresh, Prakash Raj and Soori in important roles. D. Imman, with whom Siva worked in Viswasam , is its music composer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/annaatthe-resumes-shoot/article34307217.ece
13 April 2021||SAHARA (BHILWARA),||Political drama unfolds as BJP rebel exits ring||The withdrawal of candidature by Bharatiya Janata Party’s rebel leader Ladulal Pitliya for the Assembly by-election in Sahara has turned into an unsavoury episode and led to tension between the two major political parties in the fray ahead of polling scheduled for April 17. Mr. Pitliya is at present quarantined at home amid the political drama. Mr. Pitliya, who had left the BJP in 2018 and fought as an Independent in the Assembly polls, filed his nomination papers this time as well. He had returned to the BJP fold in February this year, but the ticket for the bypoll was given to septuagenarian leader Ratanlal Jat, who was earlier elected an MLA twice from Sahara. The rebel leader, who owns a readymade garments’ business in Bengaluru, took back his nomination a day before the last date for withdrawal. A letter and some audio messages doing rounds on social media suggested that he was forced to exit the electoral fight through pressure exerted by some politicians in BJP-ruled Karnataka. With the Congress accusing the BJP of using wrong tactics in the by-election, a notice for 14-day home quarantine was slapped on Mr. Pitliya last week on the ground of not presenting a negative RT-PCR report on COVID-19 infection despite having arrived in Rajasthan from another State. BJP State president Satish Poonia termed it a “politically motivated” action to stop Mr. Pitliya from joining the party's election campaign. Though Mr. Pitliya has tested negative in his latest diagnosis, he has neither ventured out of his home nor issued any statement in support of the BJP. He has a strong hold in the Jain community and his popularity increased after his philanthropic works during the COVID-19 lockdown in Bhilwara district last year.  Absence of migrants District BJP Minority Morcha president Hamid M. Sheikh told The Hindu that the party’s organisational structure in the constituency was quite strong and the impact of the episode involving Mr. Pitliya would be minimal. “Our bigger worry is the absence of about 40,000 migrant workers living in other States. The polling percentage will be affected if they don’t come here by the voting day,” he said. Congress candidate Gayatri Devi, wife of Sahara MLA Kailsah Trivedi who died in October 2020 after being infected by COVID-19, expects to get sympathy votes from the party’s supporters. However, her candidature was initially opposed by Mr. Trivedi’s brother Rajendra Trivedi, who was a strong claimant for the ticket. Though Ms. Devi had earlier fought the panchayat polls in Bhilwara district, Sahara Sarpanch Sangh president Ratni Devi Tiwari submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot with the demand for changing the party candidate. AICC general secretary Ajay Maken thereafter visited the constituency to launch a damage control exercise. RLD eyes Jat votes The Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) has fielded Badri Lal Jat as its candidate in an attempt to get the support of Jat community, which comprises the majority in Sahara’s population. Babulal Mali, a resident of the town, said the RLP, by fielding Mr. Jat, had tried to make a dent into the BJP’s vote bank, as he is the brother of BJP leader Roop Lal Jat, who was the party's candidate in the 2018 Assembly election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/political-drama-unfolds-as-bjp-rebel-exits-ring/article34307050.ece
13 April 2021||Bhubaneswar,||Odisha govt. clears plan for cancer hospital||The Odisha government on Monday gave its consent for the establishment of a state-of-the-art cancer hospital at Bhubaneswar. The proposed hospital — Bagchi-Sri Shankara Cancer Hospital and Research Institute — would be provided 20 acres free of premium in Infocity-II, Bhubaneswar, for establishment of the hospital. The State Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik approved the proposal. The Bengaluru-based Sri Shankara Cancer Care Foundation, a charitable institute with philanthropic practice, volunteered to establish the hospital. Subroto Bagchi, co-founder of Mindtree and Chairman of Odisha Skill Development Authority, and his wife Susmita Bagchi have pledged Rs. 210 crore for the cancer hospital. According to the proposal, the cancer hospital will be equipped with 250 beds initially which will be operational by January 2024. Later, it would be made 500-bedded hospital. With advanced cutting-edge cancer care, the hospital proposed to earmark 25% beds for free treatment and another 25% beds for patients supported under different government health schemes. Help for poor patients Remaining 50% patients will pay for the services and the revenue generated will be utilised for expansion and supporting the poor patients. “It will be an oncology centre of excellence with academic and research facilities with major categories of services such as surgical, medical and radiation oncology, imaging nuclear medicine, paediatric and haemato-oncology and centre for lung disease,” the government said. Besides, the Cabinet also approved the establishment of Bagchi-Karunashraya Palliative Care Centre at Bhubaneswar. This will be first of its kind in Odisha. Bengaluru-based Karunashraya Hospice Trusts partnered with the Bagchi couple who had pledged Rs. 130 crore for the centre. Apart from hospital-based palliative care, the centre would provide the same at homes too. The new centre would train local doctors, health care providers and care-givers on palliative care.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/odisha-govt-clears-plan-for-cancer-hospital/article34307048.ece
13 April 2021||Bhubaneswar,||‘Stop elective surgeries in State hospitals’||The Odisha government on Monday directed State-run hospitals to stop all elective surgeries for decongesting the health facilities in the wake of the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. “Non-essential admissions are to be avoided while all elective surgeries are to be stopped. Only emergency surgeries need to be taken up with universal precautions,” said the State government issuing COVID-19 protocol for hospitals. The move was in order to maintain social distancing, decongest health facilities and see that health care personnel as well as non-COVID-19 patients did not get infected, the State Health and Family Welfare department said. On Sunday, 1,379 persons were found to be infected by COVID-19. Two persons succumbed to the disease.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/stop-elective-surgeries-in-state-hospitals/article34307054.ece
