07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Peaceful polling in T.N., Kerala, Puducherry, Assam and Bengal||The Election Commission of India said polling in the Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Assembly elections and voting in phase three of the Assam and West Bengal elections on Tuesday went off peacefully and under COVID-19 protocols, with the turnout ranging from 71% to 79% as of 7 p.m. Polling was conducted at 1,53,538 polling stations across 475 Assembly constituencies in the four States and the Union Territory of Puducherry, the ECI said. Tamil Nadu recorded 71.79% turnout, the lowest among the four States. Kerala witnessed 77.02% turnout while Puducherry saw 81.64% of the electors cast their ballots. In phase three of polling in Assam and West Bengal, turnout was 82.28% and 77.68% respectively. However, officials said the figures could be revised. The EC said the electronic voting machines (EVMs) and voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPATs) had gone through first-level checking, randomisation and commissioning in the presence of agents of candidates and parties. The EC said it had made a “record seizure” of Rs. 947.98 crore in connection with Tuesday’s polling. “The seizure figure, which includes seizure of cash, liquor, narcotics, freebies etc., is more than 4.198 times higher than the total combined seizure of Rs. Rs. 225.77 crore in GE LA 2016 [General elections to legislative assemblies],” it said. “Today, before the start of the poll, each of the EVMs and VVPATs again underwent a mock poll in the presence of polling agents of the candidates, with minimum 50 votes cast on each, as per standard procedure. At the end of the mock poll, the result of EVM were matched with the result of VVPAT slips and shown to the polling agents. Non-functioning rate during the mock poll is lower than comparable/experienced in the last few polls,” the EC said. Tamil Nadu and the neighbouring Union Territory of Puducherry saw a largely peaceful voting barring a few minor scuffles. With almost 4,000 candidates in the fray for 234 constituencies in a five-cornered contest, Tamil Nadu recorded an estimated turnout of 71.79% at the end of polling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/peaceful-polling-in-tn-kerala-puducherry-assam-and-bengal/article34258702.ece

07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||No move to vaccinate all adults now: Health Ministry||With a growing public clamour for making vaccines available to all adults, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday that India was following a scientific protocol regarding administering vaccines and that it wasn’t possible “to suddenly ramp up” vaccinations. On a day that the country reported administering a single-day record of 4.3 million shots, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, “When people say that India isn’t vaccinating fast enough, we must remember that vaccinating isn’t like buying something and carrying it home in a bag; it can’t be immediately accelerated. We are following a scientific protocol. We have to observe people for half hour for side effects, reactions. Vaccines aren’t given as a matter of individual choice, but according to need.” All countries had employed a restrictive criterion that prioritised the elderly, health care workers, those with comorbidities and India too was following a guidance protocol of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in prioritising those most at risk, he said. V.K. Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog claimed that India was the only country administering vaccines to healthy adults over 45. However, in several States in the U.S. anyone above the age of 16 is eligible to be vaccinated. In Israel too, anyone over 16, has been eligible for a vaccine since the first week of February. India was in a “good position” globally, Mr. Bhushan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-move-to-vaccinate-all-adults-now-health-ministry/article34258703.ece
07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Russia calls for inclusive solution to Afghan crisis||A solution to the Afghan civil war should balance the ethnic and religious groups of Afghanistan and no group should be left out of the final settlement, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov here on Tuesday after holding bilateral discussions with his Indian counterpart Dr. S. Jaishankar. Mr. Lavrov said India and Russia were working for stability and connectivity in the region, and urged that “military alliances” should not come up in Asia. “The Taliban movement is a part of Afghan society. Decision on the settlement in Afghanistan should foresee the participation of all political, ethnic and religious groups in the country. Otherwise, the solution will not be stable. This decision has to be based on balance of ethnic, political and religious interests, including in the legislative bodies,” Mr. Lavrov said. “Any exclusion of any group from this process will not lead to an implementable and sustainable agreement which can lead to resumption of hostilities, which is not the desire of the stakeholders,” he said in response to a question after both the Ministers issued press statements. Dr. Jaishankar said there is a need to “harmonise” the interests of various stakeholders that are active in and around Afghanistan. “For India, what happens in Afghanistan impacts our security directly. I shared our approach that for a durable peace there would require harmonising the interest of all — both within and around that country,” Mr. Jaishankar said. “The peace process should be based on foundational principles to which we all subscribe and a political solution should mean independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan,” he added. Apart from the Afghan situation, the major issue on the agenda for Tuesday’s talks was expected to be the delivery of the Russian S400 missile defence system and the threat of U.S. sanctions that the delivery could attract. However, the Ministers said the “specific” issue did not come up during the discussion. However, Mr. Lavrov acknowledged that the U.S. exerts pressure on any country that wants to sign military and industrial contracts with Russia. “We did not discuss these response from the U.S. but we confirmed that we will deepen our military cooperation. We also discussed the prospects of manufacturing Russian military equipment under Make in India scheme,” said Mr. Lavrov. A diplomatic source however told The Hindu that “all issues” were discussed between the two sides. Significantly, the Indian membership in the Quad featured at the talks, according to Mr. Lavrov. Answering a question, Mr Lavrov indirectly took up the Quad and said he has heard of an ‘Asian NATO’ and ‘Middle East NATO’ and argued that Russia does not believe in the military alliance systems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/russia-calls-for-inclusive-solution-to-afghan-crisis/article34258705.ece
07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Justice Ramana will be the next CJI||President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday appointed Justice N.V. Ramana as the 48th Chief Justice of India with effect from April 24. Born into a family of agriculturists in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, Chief Justice of India-designate Justice Ramana has adorned many hats — from student leader working for farmers and industrial workers to journalist for a leading Telugu newspaper to a first-generation lawyer. He was Additional Advocate General for Andhra Pradesh before being called to the State High Court Bench in 2001. Tenure of 16 months Justice Ramana was the Delhi High Court Chief Justice prior to his elevation to the top court. As CJI, Justice Ramana will have a tenure of 16 months. The incumbent CJI Sharad A. Bobde had recommended Justice Ramana, the seniormost judge of the top court, for appointment as the 48th Chief Justice of India in a letter addressed to the Ministry of Law and Justice, dated March 24. “In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (2) of Article 124 of the Constitution, the President is pleased to appoint Sri. Nuthalapati Venkata Ramana, judge of the Supreme Court, to be the Chief Justice of India with effect from April 24, 2021,” the Ministry of Law and Justice said in a notification. Seniority norm With this, both the Supreme Court and the government have followed the seniority norm in the appointment of CJIs. As Executive Chairman of National Legal Services Authority, Justice Ramana was responsible for making India’s legal aid programme the largest in the world with aid provided on the basis of a ‘means test’ rather than on basis of fixed categories. Justice Ramana has said one of his primary objectives, besides providing easy access to justice, would be to improve the judicial infrastructure through a special purpose vehicle called the ‘National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation’ to act as a nodal agency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/justice-ramana-will-be-next-cji/article34258708.ece

07 April 2021||KALPETTA,||This tribal settlement sets a model with voter turnout||The Kurichiyad Kattunayakka settlement, a remote particulalrly vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) settlement inside the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, has set a model of sorts with all its members exercising their franchise. The majority of the tribespersons in the settlement may be illiterate, but they make it a point to cast their votes on the poll day. This time, all the 57 members of the 58 members on the voters' list exercised their franchise at a polling booth set up in a former alternative school building in the settlement. However, a woman voter, Kully, who had left for Karnataka a few years ago, could not cast her vote, said K. Balan, a member of the settlement. Earlier, security was stepped up in the area owing to Maoist threat. The settlement, in Noolpuzha grama panchayat, is 9 km from the nearest town, Chethalayam. There were 73 families in the settlement till 2016, but 32 eligible families, belonging to the general category, had been relocated under a voluntary relocation project of the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests. Though the tribespeople had refused to accept the project initially, they followed suit later and subsequently were provided 50 cents of land to eligible families on the forest fringes in the Valluvadi and Vadakkanad area three years ago.  However, the project has been in limbo since the land registration process was not completed, said A. Sindhu, a teachers training certificate holder from the hamlet. “Twelve students from the hamlet are studying at the Rajeev Gandhi memorial model residential school at Kallur. However, I have been teaching them since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Sindhu, also a mentor-teacher under the Gothrabandhu scheme under the Tribal Development Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/this-tribal-settlement-sets-a-model-with-voter-turnout/article34259132.ece
07 April 2021||New Delhi,||Vigilance officers to be transferred every 3 years||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has modified the guidelines pertaining to the transfer and posting of officials in the vigilance units of government organisations, restricting their tenure to three years at one place. The tenure may be extended to three more years, albeit at a different place of posting. The CVC, in its order, said undue long stay of an official in a vigilance department had the potential of developing vested interests, apart from giving rise to unnecessary complaints or allegations. “In order to emphasis on the importance of the issue and to ensure transparency, objectivity and uniformity in approach, the Commission has decided to modify its earlier guidelines,” it said. Continuous postings Personnel can have two continuous postings in vigilance units at different places of posting, each running to a maximum of three years. Personnel who have worked for over three years at one place should be transferred in phases, with priority given to those who have served for the maximum period, the order said. Those having completed over five years at one place should be shifted on top priority basis, it added. The Commission said in the first phase, at least 10% of such personnel should be shifted in a sequential order without any exception. In case someone has served at one place for over three years, his tenure at the next place would be curtailed to ensure that the combined tenure was limited to six years. The first phase of transfer/posting has to be completed by May 31. The exercise of transferring all the personnel in question should be completed by June 30, said the Commission. The order said after transfer from the vigilance unit, there would be a compulsory cooling off period of three years before anyone could be considered again for posting in the unit. A personnel, having completed three years in the vigilance unit of an organisation, could be considered for transfer on deputation basis in the unit of another organisation, subject to the laid down rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vigilance-officers-to-be-transferred-every-3-years/article34258692.ece
07 April 2021||GUNTUR,||High Court orders stay on ZPTC, MPTC polls||Justice U. Durga Prasad of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday issued interim orders staying all further proceedings of the elections to the ZPTCs and MPTCs. The verdict coming on the day of the last day of campaigning and just two days before the polling, scheduled to be held on April 8, has yet again placed the ball in the High Court. The Judge further posted the next hearing to April 15 asking the State government to file a counter-affidavit. The judgment comes after a bunch of writ petitions were filed Varla Ramaiah of the Telugu Desam Party, Veera Reddy of the Bharatiya Janata Party and V . Venugopala Rao of the Jana Sena Party seeking a stay on the elections. The petitioners contended that in accordance with a Supreme Court’s judgment, there should be a four-week period to enforce Model Code of Conduct between the announcement of election notification and the date of polling. State Election Commissioner Neelam Sawhney issued the election notification on April 1 and announced the election schedule. Model code of conduct The Judge observed that in case the State Government issued a fresh notification taking into consideration the Supreme Court judgment on the mandatory four-week period of Model Code of Conduct , the court would give appropriate orders then. Giving his observation on the writ petition filed by Mr. Veera Reddy to give orders against the proposal of the government to continue the election process, which had been suspended since March 2020, the Judge said that the onus of conducting elections rested with the State Election Commission. The ruling YSRCP government said it would explore legal options.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/andhra-pradesh-high-court-stays-mptc-zptc-elections/article34258619.ece

07 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Sabarimala back in focus on Kerala polling day||The Sabarimala issue arguably usurped Kerala’s political narrative on the polling day on Tuesday. The polarising debate over the right of women to worship popped up “inconveniently” for the Left Democratic Front at the start of the voting largely owing to a comment by Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair. He said the people desired a regime change and that the intensity of the Sabarimala protests had not tapered off and would reflect in the Assembly polls. Ripple effect Mr. Nair’s statement set off a ripple of political reactions and speculation that dominated the voting day news cycle. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan reacted somewhat metaphorically that the land’s deities, including Ayyappa, viewed the LDF benignly because it had protected the people from the worst ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Congress veterans A.K. Antony, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and BJP State president K. Surendran seconded the NSS stance. However, CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran questioned Mr. Nair’s comment and doubted its timing. Law Minister A.K. Balan moved the Chief Election Officer against Mr. Nair. He said Mr. Nair had portrayed the election as a contest between believers and non-believers. He also brought the BJP and the Congress under the ambit of his petition. Soon, Mr. Chennithala said Ayyappa would curse Mr. Vijayan. The Opposition leader claimed believers would take revenge on the “atheist” Chief Minister. Balan’s charge Mr. Balan alleged that the United Democratic Front and BJP had exploited faith and custom to seek votes. Their actions were patently unconstitutional and infringed on the Representation of the People Act, Mr. Balan said. Voting behaviour The jury was still out on whether and how the Sabarimala issue would impact Kerala’s voting behaviour. The LDF appeared to seek solace in the argument that Sabarimala did not aid the Congress or BJP in the local body polls in 2020. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had “miscalculated” that the “Sabarimala sentiment” would bring them political dividends. Both the BJP and the Congress had made Sabarimala the central plank of their campaigning even as the LDF strained to relegate the topic to the back burner and focus on its track record of “welfarism and development”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sabarimala-back-in-focus-on-kerala-polling-day/article34258624.ece
07 April 2021||Kolkata,||Several candidates assaulted in third phase of polling in Bengal||Several candidates in the fray in the third phase of the Assembly election in West Bengal were attacked and suffered injuries as 31 Assembly constituencies across three districts went to the polls on Tuesday. Till 5 p.m., about 77.68% polling was recorded in the three districts and the voting percentage was expected to rise. Hooghly recorded the highest 79.36% polling percentage, followed by 77.93% in Howrah and 76.68% in South 24 Parganas. The most distressing image of the day was the attack on the Trinamool Congress candidate from Arambagh, Sujata Modal Khan, who was chased by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters through paddy fields in the constituency for hundreds of metres. Videos shared by local television channels showed Ms. Khan being hit on her head and her security officer sustained injuries. Five persons, including supporters of both the BJP and the Trinamool Congress, were arrested in connection with the incident. In the Khanakhul segment in Hooghly, Trinamool candidate Najibul Karim was allegedly attacked by BJP supporters. Another female candidate, Papiya Adhikari, contesting from Uluberia Dakhsin Assembly seat on a BJP ticket, was allegedly assaulted by supporters of Trinamool. There were also allegations of attacks on polling agents in certain places like Tarakeshwar, Uluberia and Baruipur. In Goghat in Hooghly district, Madhabi Adak was allegedly killed while trying to save her son in the early hours on Tuesday. Her son filed a police complaint accusing Trinamool supporters of the attack. At least one person was injured when crude bombs were hurled in Canning Purba segment. Saukat Mollah, the Trinamool candidate, blamed supporters of the Indian Secular Front for the attack. Several allegations were made by voters in the Bishnupur area of South 24 Parganas and Baghnan in Howrah. Villagers alleged that they were threatened on Monday against going to the polling by Trinamool supporters.  Chief Electoral Officer, West Bengal, Aariz Aftab, said the polls were peaceful except a few incidents of violence. About 618 companies of Central forces have been deployed in Howrah, Hooghly and South 24 Parganas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/several-candidates-assaulted-in-third-phase-of-polling-in-bengal/article34258649.ece
07 April 2021||Chennai,||Daily case count highest in the world||With 1,15,232 new COVID-19 cases reported on Tuesday, India continues to record the most number of daily cases globally. Since April 3, India has been registering more daily cases than the U.S. and Brazil, accounting for one in every seven new global cases. The last time India led the world in terms of daily cases was during the first wave in September. The figure reported on Tuesday is the highest India has recorded in its COVID-19 history. The rapid rise in detected cases was primarily due to a record number of tests conducted on Monday (and for whom results were made available by State health departments on Tuesday). As many as 12.11 lakh tests were conducted on Monday, 3.17 lakh tests more than the previous day. The figures do not include cases and deaths from Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Ladakh, Nagaland and Sikkim. The data is sourced from covid19india.org, an independent aggregator of daily COVID-19 figures. India also reported 632 new deaths on Tuesday. The country has so far reported a total of 1,28,27,991 cases and 1,66,350 deaths. Maharashtra reported 55,469 infections (accounting for nearly 53% of the new cases in the country) on Tuesday followed by Chhattisgarh with 9,921 cases and Karnataka with 6,150 new infections. Maharashtra also recorded the highest number of casualties (297) on Monday. Punjab followed with 61 deaths while Chhattisgarh registered 53 casualties. 8 crore doses given The number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered exceeded the 8 crore mark, with 8,31,10,926 shots given as of 7 a.m. on Tuesday, according to a Health Ministry press release. “More than 43 lakh vaccination doses were administered in the last 24 hours. This is the highest single-day vaccination coverage in the country so far,” the release said. Nine States — Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Bihar — accounted for 65% of the total doses given so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/daily-case-count-highest-in-the-world/article34258673.ece
07 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka orders bed quota as cases soar||As new cases rose in Karnataka to 6,150 on Tuesday, the State government reserved 50% beds in private hospitals for COVID-19 patients. “The Health and Family Welfare Department’s Order dated June 23, 2020, on reserving 50% beds in private hospitals and regulating rates to be charged by the hospitals for treatment of government-referred COVID patients and package rate ceiling for treating private COVID patients will continue to remain in force until further orders,” the order issued by the Chief Secretary said. However, the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) that had a meeting with BBMP Commissioner earlier in the day had agreed to allocate up to 40% beds. There were seven more deaths in Andhra Pradesh and close to 2,000 new infections on Tuesday morning. The daily infection tally reported in the past day at 1,941 was the highest incidence since November 8. The test positivity rate (TPR) of 31,657 samples was 6.13%, the highest since October 16. Prakasam and Visakhapatnam reported two new deaths each while Chittoor, Guntur and Kurnool reported one death each. More than half of the new infections were from Guntur, Chittoor and Visakhapatnam districts. Kerala hospital admissions rose by 100-150 patients a day in a week. The State reported 3,502 cases on Tuesday with The State’s cumulative case burden ever since the pandemic began, rose to 11,41,092 cases.the TPR being 5.93%. The addition of 14 new deaths on Tuesday raised the cumulative toll. Kasaragod reported reported four deaths, Alappuzha three, Kollam, Palakkad and Kannur two each, while one death was reported from Malappuram. Tamil Nadu reported 3,645 fresh cases of COVID-19 and 15 deaths on Tuesday. With the new cases, the number of active cases went past 25,000, of which Chennai alone accounted for 9,755. The fresh cases included 33 returnees — 19 from West Bengal, five each from Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, two from Madhya Pradesh and one each from Qatar and Uttar Pradesh. Another 1,809 persons were discharged after treatment. Till date, 8,68,722 persons were discharged. On Tuesday, 80,856 samples were tested.

07 April 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra curbs raise hackles||Even as Maharashtra is buffeted by unprecedented daily COVID-19 case spikes, politics over the pandemic continued with Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Tuesday attributing the alarming surge to a large number of people from other States who were entering the State “without doing their anti-virus tests”. “While the second wave seems to be more terrible than the first, it does beg the question why only Maharashtra is experiencing such an alarming rise in cases,” he said in Mumbai. Stating that a large number of people from other States come to work in Maharashtra owing to its industrial capacity, he said that despite “mass congregation” events like farmer agitations in the north and the West Bengal elections, there had been no drastic spike in cases in those regions as compared with Maharashtra. “The reason is that people coming from other States are not getting their COVID-19 tests done and these States are not putting out their COVID-19 number in a transparent manner. I had earlier told the government that it ought to check whether these people entering Maharashtra had tested negative or had even done RT-PCR tests. But the government paid no heed to my suggestions and did not restrict inter-State travel,” the MNS chief said. Mr. Thackeray ticked off the administration also on the shortage of beds across hospitals. “Despite the Mumbai civic body giving so many facilities to major hospitals, beds are not available for ordinary patients. Commoners are forced to run from pillar to post to get a bed which is usually made available only through the intervention of local politicians,” he said. The MNS chief warned that if the government did not compel Mumbai’s top hospitals to put up correct information on the availability of beds, the MNS would do so using their trademark means. He asked why school fee remained the same despite educational establishments being shut and said that Classes X and XII students should be promoted without exams. Several traders’ associations in Pune, Nagpur and Mumbai came out in protest against the Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s weekend lockdown and stringent curfew rules. Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis urged the Chief Minister to hold discussions with traders’ bodies and reconsider the curbs. In a letter to the Chief Minister, Mr. Fadnavis said, “I had recently received a call from you regarding the increase in the cases and the need for strict restrictions. While we had agreed on the two-day lockdown, the manner in which the other five days of lockdown-like restrictions have been imposed has caused great uneasiness in the minds of people, who have taken to the streets to protest in some places.” Terming the restrictions that have actually been imposed were, in a way, an “unannounced month-long lockdown”, Mr. Fadnavis said the situation of retailers, small shopkeepers, small hotel owners, salons and gym owners must be taken into account.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-curbs-raise-hackles/article34258659.ece
07 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Stars make a splash on voting day||Tamil Nadu politics and Tamil cinema have been inseparable for many decades. Every single move of Tamil stars, many of whom openly harbour political aspirations, is interpreted as a political statement with an eye on their political future. On April 6, supporters of political parties began interpreting the colour of masks worn by actor Ajith Kumar and actor Vijay, who rode a cycle to the polling station, to decipher possible messages. DMK supporters claimed that Mr. Ajith was wearing a ‘black mask with a red thread’ to show his subtle support for the DMK, and Mr. Vijay rode a cycle to show his opposition to the BJP for rising fuel prices. After being mobbed by fans, Mr. Ajith snatched a phone from a fan who tried to click a selfie as he was waiting at the booth, only to return it later. The video went viral. The biggest of all stars, Rajinikanth, who announced that he would start a party and contest in all constituencies in this election but decided not to take the plunge, cast his ballot quietly. As usual, lensmen tried to get a picture of his voting for his choice. But they were prevented from doing so. Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan cast his vote on Eldams Road and then flew to Coimbatore. There were other celebrities who weren’t so subtle — director Lokesh Kanagaraj, who is directing Mr. Kamal Haasan’s Vikram , posted a selfie showing the index finger, with Aboorva Sagodharargal playing on the television behind him. Actor Sathyaraj posted a picture of himself with Periyar’s photo in the background. After voting, actor Vijay Sethupathi said he would always speak against “religious and casteist” forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tamil-filmstars-make-a-splash-on-voting-day/article34258801.ece
07 April 2021||New Delhi,||Assam battle to have wide implications||Voters in Assam, where the final phase of polling ended on Tuesday, will be choosing a government by May 2. However, for the State, the poll is likely to have implications beyond who wins and who loses. It could well settle some questions and issues that have come to define the recent politics in the State. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may be seeking a second term for its first government in the northeastern State but the party went to the polls without announcing the incumbent Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal as its face for a second term. This may be an acknowledgement of the importance of Himanta Biswa Sarma, the Minister who holds a number of portfolios and is the face of the party in the northeast. Mr. Sarma, who joined the BJP in August 2015 from the Congress, occupied the same position under the late Tarun Gogoi in the Congress government. There was a time when his proximity to Mr. Gogoi not only created a wedge between the then Chief Minister and party veterans but also drove many of the old-timers out. Known to be an efficient Minister and a hard taskmaster, Mr. Sarma has been harbouring an ambition for the top post since 2014, when the Congress, after faring poorly in the Lok Sabha poll, had toyed with the idea of replacing the Chief Minister and bringing in young blood. As a protégé of Mr. Gogoi, Mr. Sarma, who was 45 years old then, fit the description. He was also counting on senior Congressmen to deliver on their “promise” of promoting him to the top post. But he is said to have hit a wall in Rahul Gandhi, and the emergence of Gaurav Gogoi as an articulate MP created more stumbling blocks. Now, seven years later, after having proven his utility in the rival party, the current election could define Mr. Sarma’s future path. On the other side, the Congress is struggling to fill the shoes of Mr. Gogoi despite having a strong organisational presence in the State. The Congress, too, went with the collective leadership of State chief Ripun Bora, opposition leader Debabrata Saikia, MP Pradyut Bora and Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, apart from Gogoi junior. The election result is likely to have an impact on who leads the party in the State. NRC and CAA The outcome of the poll could determine the direction of the debate around the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). In Assam, there is considerable support for the NRC but opposition to the CAA. That explains why the Congress claims credit for piloting the NRC project, while staunchly opposing the CAA.  The issue of illegal immigrants — identified as undocumented migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh who came into the State after March 24, 1971 — has defined the State’s politics for over 40 years now. While the original students’ agitation (1979-1985) only focussed on cultural and linguistic differences, the movement translated into more communally sharp politics. If the Congress and the AIUDF have been charged with “protecting the migrants”, the BJP has taken the debate to a different tangent by comparing the election to a fight between indigenous communities and ‘invaders like the Mughals’. But many intellectuals argue that it is not faith but the fear of being “outnumbered” that drives the anti-CAA sentiments. It is this anger against the CAA that gave rise to two new regional parties in the State: the Axom Jatiya Parishad and the Raijor Dal. Though Assamese sub-nationalism defined the agitation of the late 70s and early 1980s, for the past two decades, it has mostly been bipolar, with the BJP overshadowing earlier regional players. The election could well decide the possibility of an alternative to the existing players in Assam’s politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-battle-to-have-wide-implications/article34258647.ece
07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Disqualification pleas: Goa Speaker to rule on April 20||Nudged by the Supreme Court, the Goa Assembly Speaker on Tuesday agreed to advance the date of his decision on the disqualification petitions filed against 10 former Congress MLAs who ‘merged’ with the BJP in 2019 from April 29 to April 20. Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Speaker’s office, whether the initial date of April 29 was fixed with an eye on the fact that he would retire on April 23. “You want the matter to go to another Bench, which will have to hear the case all over again,” Chief Justice Bobde, who heads the three-judge Bench hearing the case, asked the law officer. “It was never that idea... Have it on April 21-22?” Mr. Mehta said. The court said the Speaker had reserved the disqualification proceedings for orders on February 26... April 29 is not acceptable by this Bench... Ask him [Speaker] to dispose of the petition preferably this week itself,” Chief Justice Bobde told Mr. Mehta. The Solicitor General said the Speaker was a constitutional authority who should be free to exercise his discretion in these issues. But senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioner and the Congress party, said the Speaker was “making a mockery of the whole process” under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution. “He has not decided the petitions for the past 19 months. There is a judgment of this court which says the Speaker should decide in four months...” Mr. Sibal argued. Finally, after receiving instructions, Mr. Mehta informed the court that the Speaker would decide on April 20. The court scheduled a hearing on April 21. On January 4, the CJI had orally observed that “nobody can have a vested right to delay” a plea filed by Goa Congress leader Girish Chodankar challenging the Speaker’s delay of over 19 months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/disqualification-pleas-goa-speaker-to-rule-on-april-20/article34258654.ece
07 April 2021||New Delhi/Hyderabad,||Commando is in our custody: Maoists||Maoists released a statement on Tuesday that the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) commando who went missing after the April 3 encounter at Tarrem in Chattisgarh’s Sukma was in their custody. The banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) also demanded that the State government announce a mediator for the release of the commando. Chhattisgarh Director General of Police D.M Awasthi said that the letter issued by the Maoists was authentic and the government would soon take a call on the mediator. The commando, identified as Rakeshwar Singh Minhas, belonged to the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action unit (CoBRA) of the CRPF, a unit specially trained for operations in Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas. A senior government official said that a media person or a social activist could be considered as a mediator. The statement signed by “Vikalp”, spokesperson of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee of the Maoists, said that four People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) cadres were killed in the encounter at Tarrem on April 3. It added that they had also taken away 14 weapons, over 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and other items belonging to the security personnel. The killed PLGA cadres were identified by the Maoists as Odi Sanni, Padam Lakhma, Kowasi Badru and Nupa Suresh, all residents of south Bastar. Sanni’s body was recovered by security forces on April 3. The Maoists have put the condition that the officer would be set free if the government specifically announced the names of the mediators. “Till then he would be safe in the protection of Janatan sarkar,” a Telugu statement released in the name of CPI-Maoist’s Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee official spokesperson Vikalp said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/commando-is-in-our-custody-maoists/article34258666.ece
07 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Why no 24/7 vaccination, HC asks Telangana govt.||Seeking to know “why there was no 24/7 vaccination”, Telangana High Court on Tuesday instructed the State government to file a fresh status report on COVID-19 in the backdrop of second wave of the virus hitting the State. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, hearing a couple of PIL pleas on the pandemic connected issues, gave as slew of directions to the government observing that the latter was going slow on conducting tests for diagnosis. “You are conducting more Rapid Antigen (RaT) tests and less of RT-PCR tests. Your testing is pathetic,” the CJ remarked. Taking exception to government’s failure to comply with the bench’s directions in last hearing, the CJ said what was the government doing to control assembly of people at marriages and funerals. Noting that the court would be compelled to issue orders to check the pandemic if the government failed to act, the bench said that “it is not for us to run the State”. The bench remarked that the government was conducting more RaT tests and less RT-PCR tests for reasons best known to the latter. The RT-PCR tests conducted by the government were less than 10% of total diagnostic tests (which includes Rapid Antigen tests) held in some districts. Citing the figures from a report filed by the government pertaining to Warangal (Urban district), the court said while 4,000 RaTs were conducted there, only 1,400 RT-PCR tests were held. “You cannot afford to go slow on tests,” the CJ told Advocate General B.S. Prasad appearing for the State. Out of 9,11661 total tests, 7,63,136 were Rapid Antigen tests. Only 1,48,525 RT-PCR tests were conducted. When experts opined that RaT results were somewhat misleading, it leaves a lot to be desired about the government move to conduct more of those tests and much less RT-PCR tests which were said to be giving reliable results, the court noted. The statistics about the tests conducted in different districts were “misleading”, the court said. The 406-page status report filed by the government was too “generalised, sweeping and misleading”, the bench observed. The bench said the government should not treat this as adversarial litigation since “it involved the health of people and everyone of us”. “Why not arrange vaccination centres for people within 100 yards at all places instead of confining only to government and private hospitals. There need not be any holiday for vaccination,” the bench said. The bench wanted the government to give wide publicity to all vaccination centre locations through social media platforms. It wondered why restrictions were not imposed on the number of visitors at bars, pubs, malls and film theatres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-no-247-vaccination-hc-asks-kcr-govt/article34258614.ece
07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Supreme Court adjourns hearing of Lavalin case again||On a day Kerala went to the polls, the Supreme Court adjourned the hearing of the SNC-Lavalin corruption case appeals against the discharge of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. A Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit on Tuesday posted the case after two weeks. The court had similarly postponed the case on the basis of a request made by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) earlier in February. This is the fourth time the appeals have been adjourned by the court in 2021. It had adjourned the case back-to-back on January 7 and January 12 this year. On December 4, a Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit had conceded a plea made by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the CBI, for an adjournment. Justice Lalit had then noted how the appeals had been shuttled from one date to another. The first of the appeals was filed in October 2017. Cautioned In a hearing on October 8, Justice Lalit cautioned the CBI that the appeals may fail unless the arguments against Mr. Vijayan’s discharge in the corruption case were cast-iron. The case has skipped from one date to another since January 2018 when the apex court had stayed the trial. A Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana, which was hearing the case initially, had also admitted the CBI appeal against Mr. Vijayan's discharge in the graft case. Mr. Vijayan was discharged as an accused by both the Special Court, CBI, in Thiruvananthapuram, and the Kerala High Court. The CBI has, in its appeal, contended that Mr. Vijayan should face trial in the case. KSEB contract The corruption case concerns the loss of Rs. 86.25 crore in the Kerala State Electricity Board’s (KSEB) contract with Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of the Pallivasal, Sengulam and Panniar hydroelectric projects in Idukki district of Kerala. Mr. Vijayan was the State’s Power Minister then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supreme-court-adjourns-hearing-of-lavalin-case-again/article34258632.ece

In his first public address after reaching Delhi for a four-day visit to prepare for U.S. President Joseph Biden’s Climate Change Summit on April 22, Mr. Kerry said the U.S. is committed to bringing emissions to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and hoped to help India cut emissions as well. Mr. Kerry met Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Tuesday, and is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Minister of State for Renewable Energy R.K.

While it is unclear whether he will make any announcements on restoring some of the funding for India that the Trump administration had cancelled, Mr. Kerry is understood to be discussing how to deepen India’s targets for carbon use and renewable energies. “India has an advantage that we didn’t have in the U.S. as we were developing…Not just the benefits of decades of scientific and technical advancements. You also have the United States as your friend and partner. And we are here to support you on this path to a sustainable future,” Mr. Kerry said in a videotaped message to the US India Business Council (USIBC) at a virtual conference for South Asian women involved in the energy industry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-has-us-as-ally-in-fighting-climate-change-says-envoy/article34258662.ece
07 April 2021||KHAMMAM,||NRI returns to embrace sustainable living||After living abroad for more than two decades, 60-year-old Vasireddy Anil Kumar, who returned to his hometown Khammam from the U.S. in 2019, is running bullock-operated cold-pressed edible oil extraction units at his farm land in Seetampeta in Chintakani mandal. Mr Anil did M. Sc (Chemistry) from the Bhopal University and worked in a Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company as an Assistant Plant Manager before leaving for the US in 1998. After a successful career spanning more than two decades in the US, he returned to India over two years ago to pursue his passion for promoting organic farming and natural pest-control practices. Embracing the traditional ganuga (wood pressed) method of extracting oil, he had set up three bullock-driven oil extraction mills under the banner ‘S-Organics’ at his seven-and-half acres farm land in Seetampeta, located about 25 km from Khammam last year. In a short span, the enterprising venture has gained popularity among health-conscious people with a steady increase in the demand for the cold pressed sesame, groundnut and coconut oils. The time-tested bullock-driven method of extracting oil from seeds using a wooden mortar is an eco-friendly activity with great potential for creating a healthy society and sustained livelihood, says Mr Anil. The cold pressed method of extracting oil helps in retaining the natural anti-oxidants and offers many nutritional benefits, he asserts, saying that the demand for the cold pressed oils was growing with more health-conscious consumers preferring these naturally extracted oils over those made through mechanical process. “We are selling the cold-pressed oils made in hygienic conditions at our three wood-pressed oil extraction units through direct sale and also through courier,” he said, outlining his plans to set up a vermicomposting unit and a hydroponic system of growing fodder at his farm to sensitise local farmers on the sustainable farming and eco-friendly pest control practices.

07 April 2021||PALAKKAD,||Balan petitions against NSS chief, Chennithala||Minister for the Welfare of Backward and Scheduled Communities A.K. Balan on Tuesday raised a complaint with the Election Commission of India (ECI) against Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala for their alleged attempts to describe the election as a “fight between the faithful and non-believers”. In his complaint addressed to the State’s Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Balan accused the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of misusing the election in the name of faith and religion. “Kerala’s electoral history never witnessed such a grave and dangerous situation,” Mr. Balan said. Referring to Mr. Sukumar Nair’s comments that Ayyappa devotees had been bitter about the Sabarimala events that took place in the wake of the Supreme Court order permitting entry for women of all age groups into the temple, Mr. Balan said here that the NSS leader was deliberately trying to portray the election as a battle between the believers and non-believers. ‘Against Constitution’ Mr. Balan also complained against Mr. Chennithala for his remark that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan would have to face Lord Ayyappa’s wrath. “Those statements are against the Constitution, and completely in violation of the country’s democratic values,” Mr. Balan said. Mr. Balan said Mr. Chennithala and Mr. Nair were misusing people’s faith.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/balan-files-complaint/article34259159.ece
07 April 2021||Bengaluru,||It’s homecoming time for many Karnataka politicians||As voters in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry sealed the fate of the parties on Wednesday, leaders from Karnataka who worked in the sweltering heat are headed back home. Before the dust settles from the hectic campaigning, many will return to the election arena in the heat and dust of North Karnataka where bypolls are slated for Belagavi Lok Sabha, Maski, and Basavakalyan. A big team of leaders from both the BJP and Congress sweated it out over the last fortnight, coordinating with the local party functionaries in the conduct of elections in the three Southern States as well as faraway West Bengal. Interestingly, the BJP and Congress efforts in Tamil Nadu were led by Karnataka leaders C.T. Ravi and Dinesh Gundu Rao, respectively. In the elections that are so deep rooted in local politics that the issues differ between regions, and the complex caste combinations at play, how did local leaders contribute to their party’s efforts despite linguistic barrier? In Kerala, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan led the BJP contingent, including Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary and leaders from coastal Karnataka region, managed the cadre, chalked out programme of national leaders, and identified venues for rallies among others. It operated a backend office that identified weak areas, strategised party’s participation while leaders also met local community leaders. Minister Arvind Limbavali was in West Bengal doing a similar activity. Similarly, several Congress legislators, including Krishna Byre Gowda, P.R. Ramesh, H.K. Patil, M. Narayanswamy, and former Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwar, and others were in Kerala as party observers in allocated districts, and coordinated the overall efforts of the party. “Usually leaders with good electioneering skills are deputed to areas where our cadres are still not good at it, to act as force multipliers. These leaders essentially take charge of the electioneering and all its logistics and rarely go campaigning,” said a senior BJP leader. However, in border areas where there is a Kannada-speaking population, leaders from Karnataka also took out rallies and campaigned. In Tamil Nadu’s Krishnagiri district that borders Karnataka, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar conducted rallies. Minister S. Suresh Kumar also went on door-to-door campaigning in parts of Krishnagiri while Minister S.T. Somashekar camped in Udagamandalam (Ooty) that has a sizeable Kannada-speaking electorate. Mr. Shivakumar was also part of election campaign at Kasargod in North Kerala. With the leaders back in Karnataka now, the parties are chalking out their schedules for the byelections, said a leader.

07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Combat ‘false narratives’, Modi tells BJP cadre on foundation day||Amid events to mark the 41st foundation day of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told party workers to create awareness among people on welfare schemes run by the Central government and combat what he termed “false narratives” by opponents on the controversial farm laws and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Addressing party leaders and workers via videoconference, Mr. Modi said “blatant lies” that farmers’ land would be seized, or that citizenship of some people would be revoked, or even that caste-based reservations would be scrapped along with the “Constitution being changed” were being spread by “certain individuals and organisations”. These false narratives had been spread over his governmen’s measures like farm laws, CAA and labour laws, he said. “Deliberate politics is behind it. It is a very big conspiracy and its aim is to trigger political instability in the country by creating misconceptions and stoking imaginary fears,” said the Prime Minister, adding that this was a “serious challenge”.   The Prime Minister also hit out at those who have often dubbed the BJP an “election-winning machine” over its poll triumphs, and accused them of double standards, saying rival parties and their leaders were lauded when they won. “These people do not understand the maturity of Indian people and its democracy, and nor do they appreciate citizens’ hopes, expectations and dreams,” he said. The BJP was a continuous movement to win people’s hearts as it served people for five years honestly, both in the government or from the outside, he said. He added that the poor and the rural India have embraced the BJP as for the first time, they have seen ‘ antyodaya’ (welfare of the most deprived) being realised through a number of schemes, including toilets in households, bank accounts for the poor, free LPG connections and tap water connections in rural areas. He traced the approach of his government to the legacy of Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, and said it could be seen from the Central government’s move to read down Article 370 according special status to Jammu and Kashmir. He expressed gratitude towards the workers of the party, who, he said, had proved that “hard work can make an organisation reach unimaginable heights”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/combat-false-narratives-modi-tells-bjp-cadre/article34258651.ece

The court also asked the State to examine the viability of having night curfew to check late evening and social gatherings. The court passed the directions while expressing concern that though the State government had taken necessary steps to meet the threat of the second wave of COVID-19, the government’s directions had not been complied with by the public. A Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Siddhartha Varma directed the State to also check the viability of inoculating such students who are to appear in the High School and Intermediate Examinations. “A door-to-door vaccination programme should be chalked out,” the court stated. The court also directed the DMs to ensure “strict and definite compliance” of the directions issued by the State government to meet the threat of COVID-19.

Mr. Gandhi’s response comes a day after his party demanded a fresh investigation into the Rafale deal. In the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Mr. Gandhi had made allegations regarding corruption in the Rafale deal the party’s main poll plank, but the BJP’s massive win in the Lok Sabha election made it politically unsustainable. “Karma = The ledger of one’s actions. Nobody escapes it,” Mr. Gandhi said on Twitter on Tuesday with the hashtag #Rafale. The French portal, Mediapart, reported that France’s anti-corruption agency, Agence Française Anticorruption (AFA), found that manufacturer Dassault Aviation had paid €1 million to an Indian company in the € 7.87 billion Rafale deal between India and France. “That middleman is now accused of money laundering in India in another defence deal. The company said the money was used to pay for the manufacture of 50 large replica models of Rafale jets, even though the inspectors were given no proof that these models were made. Yet, against all apparent logic, the AFA decided not to refer the matter to prosecutors,” according to an investigation by Mediapart.   “Does it now not require a full and independent investigation into India's biggest defence deal to find out as to how much bribery and commission in reality, if any, was paid and to whom in the Indian government? Will Prime Minister Narendra Modi answer to the nation now,” said Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-invokes-karma-to-taunt-govt-on-rafale-deal/article34258653.ece

07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||French authorities did not act on allegations: report||French anti-corruption authorities made no serious attempts to investigate the suspicions of corruption and favouritism surrounding the Rafale deal, according to the second of the three-part investigative series by French media which was released on Tuesday. The report details how the then head of the public prosecution services’ financial crimes branch (PNF), Éliane Houlette, “shelved investigations into evidence of corruption behind the deal, despite the contrary opinion of her colleagues”. French President Emmanuel Macron and his predecessor François Hollande are also cited in the allegations levelled in the case. ‘Corruption, favouritism’ “Documents and first-hand accounts obtained by Mediapart show that, following the potentially explosive alert filed by Sherpa, PNF chief Éliane Houlette made no serious attempts to investigate the suspicions of corruption and favouritism surrounding the Rafale deal. She did, however, hold an informal meeting with a lawyer representing Dassault,” the Mediapart report added. Sherpa is the French NGO which, based on media revelations, had reported “suspected corruption, including money laundering, influence peddling and favouritism” surrounding the deal. Ms. Houlette has since justified her decision as one taken to preserve “the interests of France, the workings of institutions”, the report states. It said that in June 2019, shortly before leaving her post as the head of the PNF, Ms. Houlette decided to close the preliminary investigation into Sherpa’s complaint, citing “absence” of any offence, in a move which went “against the advice of the deputy prosecutor in charge of the case and who refused to write up the official notification of it being dropped”. Ms. Houlette’s decision, however, was “finally validated by two magistrates of the Paris public prosecution services and was enacted by Jean-François Bohnert, who succeeded her as head of the PNF”, the Mediapart report added. News reports Flagging a series of investigations and reports since the €7.87-billion Rafale Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) for 36 jets was signed in September 2016, the report referred to a series of reports by The Hindu and said the circumstances surrounding the contract erupted into a scandal in India during the summer of 2018. “Indian daily The Hindu published confidential documents pointing to “parallel negotiations” over the deal that were led by the Indian Prime Minister’s Office behind the backs of the Defence Ministry, and highlighted the vast rise in the unitary price of the jet fighters in the new contract in which Reliance was favoured,” the Mediapart report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/french-authorities-did-not-act-on-allegations-report/article34258688.ece
07 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai registers a turnout of 59.4%||All the 16 Assembly constituencies of Chennai district registered a turnout of 59.4% at the completion of polling at 7 p.m. on Tuesday. The inability of more than 350 officials to use the app to generate turnout data from many of the polling booths in the city led to a delay in compilation of data. The average turnout for all the 16 Assembly constituencies of Chennai district at 5 p.m. was 50.12%. Royapuram (57.66%) registered the highest turnout by then. Since morning, polling in most of the booths in north Chennai was higher than in other parts of the district. Many residents complained about the deletion of names from the rolls. Dandapani, an elector of Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni Assembly constituency, said his name was removed from the rolls without any valid reason. N.E. Ammanullah, a resident of Mannadi in Harbour constituency, said the names of a few members of the same household had been deleted. Serpentine queues were found at a number of polling stations in north Chennai on Tuesday. As the officials restricted the number of electors in polling stations, people were found waiting on footpaths for a long time near major polling stations. Harbour constituency DMK candidate P.K. Sekar Babu alleged that the names of some members of the families belonging to a certain community were deleted from the electoral rolls. A protest was reported in Barathi Arts College, alleging that outsiders had been brought to vote in the constituency. Owing to the arrangements made for COVID-19 patients to vote in the booth located at Chennai Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School on Buddha Street in Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar, police advised electors to leave the premises in the evening. Some electors claimed that they were not allowed inside the booth owing to the arrangements made to accommodate COVID-19 patients. The Chennai District Election Office received 10 complaints pertaining to the distribution of cash on Tuesday. Residents said polling was disrupted for some time at a polling booth in Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni Assembly constituency because of glitches in the EVM. Chennai district election officials had set up all women polling stations at Korukkupet, Erukkencheri, Choolai and Otteri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-registers-a-turnout-of-594/article34258804.ece
07 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Polling largely peaceful in Tiruvallur||Polling was largely peaceful in Tiruvallur district, which comprises 10 Assembly constituencies, but for sporadic incidents and protests in a few places. The district registered 69.3% turnout. Of them, Tiruttani recorded the highest turnout of 79%. In Maduravoyal, the turnout was the lowest with 59.2%. Many polling booths were crowded as early as 7 a.m. as people, particularly senior citizens, came in large numbers to vote. However, they had to wait in some booths as the polling process was either slow or delayed by about half-an-hour due to initial hiccups. In seven places, including Thiruvalangadu and Pappanchatram, Poonamallee, polling was delayed by nearly 20-30 minutes due to issues in EVMs. Tension prevailed at a booth in Uthukottai for over half-an-hour due to an argument between agents of various political parties. According to the police, though only one booth agent was allowed from each party, some parties had more than two agents inside, which caused the friction. In another incident, DMK cadre staged a roadblock that lasted 30 minutes at Sathirai village, alleging cash distribution by AIADMK men. For nearly 460 voters in Thangalperunpulam and Idayankulam villages near Pazhaverkadu, the voting process was an ordeal. They had to travel across the Pazhaverkadu lake by boat to reach the booth at Koraikuppam. Even after three decades, the situation has not changed. Das, a resident of Idayankulam, said: “We have to travel a minimum of 3-4 km to reach the lake and again 1 km to cross the lake. Travel by road would take 20 km to reach the booth.” Residents wanted their long-pending demand for booths in Thangalperunpulam be fulfilled. Durai Mahendran, a resident, noted that women and senior citizens found it difficult to travel by boat and often refrained from voting. Several representations had been made on the issue. In Athipet, which falls under the Ambattur constituency, residents staged a protest. They were moved from the Villivakkam constituency to the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board tenements. The names of nearly 2,000 residents did not figure in the list at Athipet, despite having new addresses in the voter ID cards. Among the 4,902 booths, 15 were identified as critical and 627 as vulnerable. In one of the critical booths at Thambureddypalayam, Gummidipoondi, 60% of the votes were polled by 1 p.m. without hassle. According to Tiruvallur District Election Officer and Collector P. Ponniah, such booths were monitored continuously. Nearly 17% of the voters were first-timers. Of the 70 COVID-19 patients, 58 cast their votes in full PPE kits in five booths across the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/polling-largely-peaceful-in-tiruvallur/article34258842.ece
07 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. sees 71.79% polling, with no major incidents||Braving the heat and the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, an estimated 71.79% of the 6,28,69,955 eligible voters in Tamil Nadu turned out to exercise their franchise for the Assembly election on Tuesday. The fate of the candidates from the 234 Assembly constituencies and the Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha constituency, where a bypoll was held, was sealed at 7 p.m. when polling concluded. The figure of 71.79% is provisional and might be revised upwards on Wednesday, after the numbers are consolidated. Barring a few stray incidents of scuffles across Tamil Nadu, voting was peaceful. Led by Kallakurichi district at 78%, a total of 24 districts of the 37 recorded voter turnout of over 70%. A few more districts such as Kancheepuram, the Nilgiris and Nagapattinam bordered around 69%, which might go up on Wednesday. Chennai had the lowest turnout among all districts, at just 59.4%, while adjoining Chengalpattu followed at 62.77%. The Election Commission of India did not immediately provide data on how many male and female voters exercised their franchise or data on the constituency-wise turnout. Compared with elections in the last two decades, the turnout in 2021 was the third highest. In 2016, the turnout was 74.81% and in 2011, it was 78.01% — the highest ever in Tamil Nadu’s electoral history. In 2006, when the DMK formed a minority government with outside support from allies, the polling percentage was 70.82%, while 2001 saw the lowest turnout at 59.07%. In dramatic scenes necessitated by the pandemic, at 6 p.m., polling personnel wore PPE kits, as infected persons turned up to vote wearing similar kits. DMK MP Kanimozhi, who contracted the virus and is being treated at a private hospital in Chennai, came to her polling booth wearing a PPE kit, a mask and a face shield, a little after 6 p.m. and cast her vote. AIADMK presidium chairman E. Madhusudhanan, too, visited his booth in Old Washermenpet, flanked by medical personnel, and voted. Data on the number of persons affected by COVID-19 who exercised their franchise in the last hour was not immediately available, Chief Electoral Officer of Tamil Nadu Satyabrata Sahoo said. Mr. Sahoo said so far no re-polling had been ordered at any booth in the State. A scrutiny would be held on Wednesday at 11 a.m. with presiding officers, observers and parties, and if any issue arises, it will be flagged to the ECI, which will then decide on re-poll, he said. A total of 174 ballot units, 134 control units and 559 VVPAT units were replaced due to malfunction. Mr. Sahoo said less than 1% of the total EVMs were affected. He also lauded the voters for coming to cast their votes, taking precautions against COVID-19. There will be a total of 75 counting centres for votes to be counted, and three-tier security will be provided at the EVM strong rooms, Mr. Sahoo said. The first layer will be that of CAPF personnel, with the State police forming the second. CCTV cameras in the strong rooms will keep an eye on the rooms at all times.  Compared with elections in the last two decades, the turnout in 2021 was the third highest||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-sees-7179-polling-with-no-major-incidents/article34258828.ece
07 April 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Without slips, voters made to run around||Many residents faced difficulties as they were not given booth slips which contain the location of the polling station and the serial number. The Election Commission of India (ECI) had introduced the facility to eliminate inconvenience to members of the public, who had to depend on political parties for the purpose. With the summer on, many residents turned up in large numbers early on Tuesday at the polling stations where they had cast their votes in previous elections. They found it very difficult to find the booth and had to depend on a few staff outside the polling stations. The ECI had asked voters to download the booth slip online. R. Subash, a resident of Anna Nagar, said: “I was not aware that I could download the booth slip. Normally, the election staff distribute booth slips at our homes. Many of us did not receive them this time. There was a lot of confusion at our polling station.” G.S. Ramsubramanian, a social activist in Anna Nagar, too, faced the same problem. “I am a senior citizen and I was not able to locate my booth easily since the slip was not given to us. We had to wait under the sun for more than one hour,” he said and added that a polling staff had asked them to go to another booth as their names were not in the list. “We were made to go from one place to another. Moreover, mobile phones were prohibited. Then how can we download booth slip online?” he asked. Complaints galore Hundreds of such complaints were received from residents at Anna Nagar, K.K. Nagar, Virugambakkam, Velachery, Taramani, Tondiarpet and other places. “At many places, voters had to depend on the political functionaries who hang around polling stations. The Corporation staff did not distribute the booth slips properly. So these voters, who were clueless, had to approach them to identify the booth or the serial number. Police officers also came to our area and asked the agents of the political parties to disperse from the spot,” said V. Gopalakrishnan, an RTI activist. K. Elangovan, an advocate, said, “Many voters are not computer literate or knowledgeable enough to handle smart phones to download the booth slip on their own. Not enough awareness campaigns were conducted ahead of the poll for easy identification of polling booth.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/without-slips-voters-made-to-run-around/article34258843.ece
07 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||It is 72% in Kancheepuram||Brisk polling was witnessed in all the four Assembly constituencies of Kancheepuram district right from the time voting started at 7 a.m. on Tuesday. Polling went off smoothly except for a minor scuffle between the booth agents of the AIADMK and the DMK at Kavathandalam village, falling under the Uthiramerur constituency. However, police officials intervened and brought the situation under control. The district, comprising the Alandur, Sriperumbudur (reserved), Uthiramerur and Kancheepuram constituencies, recorded 72% voting. The district has a total voting population of 13,13,714. COVID-19 SOPs were followed in all the 1,370 polling stations. The district administration set up a help desk in all polling stations to direct the voters to correct booths. For the benefit of senior citizens, the administration made available one wheelchair in all polling stations. From 7 a.m., voters waited in long queues with social distancing going for a toss in some polling booths in the Uthiramerur and Alandur constituencies. The district recorded a total of 43% voter turnout by noon and gradually picked up again when it touched 63% at 5 p.m. and ended with 71.98% at 7 p.m. In Pillayarpalayam, which falls under the Kancheepuram constituency, crowds, particularly women voters, started streaming in after 3 p.m. to cast votes. The Uthiramerur constituency registered the highest turnout of over 80%, followed by Sriperumbudur at 74.03% and Kancheepuram registering 72.96%. The lowest voter turnout of 60.85% was recorded in Alandur.

07 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Senior citizens find a marked improvement in facilities||During Assembly and Lok Sabha polls, senior citizens normally face difficulties in accessing booths in the city and in nearby districts. Senior citizens and the physically challenged find it difficult to climb steep and narrow staircases. The absence of ramps and wheelchairs add to their woes. However, this election, authorities offered postal votes to those above 80 and announced the construction of ramps at all booths and provision of wheelchairs with volunteers. The Greater Chennai Corporation and the Kancheepuram district administration arranged for wheelchairs at all booths and posted volunteers drafted from the National Service Scheme (NSS). Yet, a few senior citizens complained about the lack of wheelchairs. M. Dhanalakshmi, 80, of T. Nagar, said she was unaware of postal voting; nor did she find any wheelchair with volunteers at a school on Venkatnarayana Road in the city. Finding that wheelchairs were not available, she voted with the help of her granddaughter. A. Annapoorani, 94, of Vinayakapuram, thanked the civic body for providing wheelchairs and constructing ramps, which helped in easy access to her booth at a corporation school in Chepauk. Chinnayan, 95, went to the booth at a government school at Tirupattur in a wheelchair. Yasodha, a resident of the TNHB quarters at Kancheepuram, was all praise for the Collector for providing senior citizens with wheelchairs and NSS volunteers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/senior-citizens-find-a-marked-improvement-in-facilities/article34258858.ece
07 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||All ECI regulations were strictly followed: Police Commissioner||Polling was largely peaceful in the city on Tuesday. Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal was seen visiting sensitive areas and issuing instructions to police personnel on the ground to ensure the smooth conduct of polls. Mr. Aggarwal, accompanied by a striking force of police personnel, began his inspection immediately after polling started in the city. First, he visited polling stations in thickly populated areas, such as Royapuram and Harbour. Later, the Commissioner inspected St. George’s Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, where a large number of voters gathered to cast their votes. He asked poll officials and police personnel whether there were any laxities in the arrangements and ordered officials to regulate the crowd to ensure peaceful polling. Mr. Aggarwal told The Hindu , “We have made elaborate arrangements across the city. All norms of the Election Commission of India have been strictly followed. No untoward incident has been reported so far. Polling was largely peaceful without any incident.” He distributed refreshments to the police personnel on duty and handed out masks to those on the premises and visitors. Poll norm violations While visiting another polling booth on Avvai Shanmugam Salai, he asked personnel to remove the car of a party functionary which was parked near the premises, violating poll norms. While moving on Avvai Shanmugam Salai, Mr. Aggarwal ordered police officers to disperse the party cadre who had gathered near a polling station. On Santhome High Road, he instructed the striking force to chase people loitering near the polling centres. At Santhome Higher Secondary School, he asked health staff to strictly follow all guidelines to check voters and officials while allowing then inside. At Rani Meyammai School on R.K.

07 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A vote to turn the spotlight on mental health||For the second time, a section of residents of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) cast their votes at a booth set up on campus on Tuesday. A total of 84 residents of the 97 identified to be eligible exercised their franchise. The 2019 Lok Sabha poll was the first time when 156 of the residents voted. Prior to the Assembly polls, the institute had made arrangements, including screening for eligibility, creating awareness and demonstration of how to use electronic voting machines (EVM) for the residents. P. Poorna Chandrika, Director of IMH, said many of the residents were excited to vote. Safety norms “We followed all COVID-19 safety norms. All residents who voted were provided with masks and gloves. They were very happy to vote. One of them wanted the fuel price and prices of essential commodities to reduce, while another resident hoped that in the post-COVID-19 situation, industries will give more jobs to people,” she said. Earlier, the Greater Chennai Corporation organised a demonstration on the usage of the EVM for each individual voter on the campus. The residents already had access to newspapers and watched news on television. “This exercise shows the equality in the right to vote for persons with disabilities. It will reduce the stigma and discrimination against mental illness. If more persons start voting, it will put the spotlight on mental health issues,” she emphasised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-vote-to-turn-the-spotlight-on-mental-health/article34258809.ece
07 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Finding names missing, many voters return disappointed||Quite a few people did not vote on Tuesday as their names were missing from the electoral list. Some took to social media to vent their frustration. Several residents of Gandhi Nagar 3rd Main Road in Adyar did not find their name on the voters’ list at the polling booth in St. Michael’s School. One of them said: “I did not get a booth slip, but I went to the polling booth. My name was not on the list. My neighbour and a person in a building next door also did not find their names. But the names of my grandmother who is no more, and a man in our building who died in 2018 were listed though we had given the forms for deletion of names to the Chennai Corporation.” The deceased man’s wife’s name was also not on the list, she said. In another instance, the house owner’s name did not figure in the list whereas the domestic help, listed as a resident of the house, found her name. “My name was not there in the electoral list,” said a Velachery resident, who has been voting for the past 12 years at the Government Higher Secondary School in Draupathi Amman Koil Street. “I voted in the last election,” he said. The same thing happened to another family, he complained. “Where is my right to vote?” he asked. He wants to file an RTI to get answers. A Choolaimedu resident said all others in her apartment complex, including her husband, cast their votes. “My name has been removed from the list,” she said. Another resident of Choolaimedu, who recently changed his address, did not find his name on the list. He then scanned the EPIC website and since his name was on the list he managed to vote, he said. A resident of Chetpet, Rajesh. G., said booth slips were not distributed and in the polling booth on School Road names were not posted, making it difficult to identify the rooms allotted for each street. A resident of TNHB flats in Tiruvanmiyur said quite a few people in the complex returned disappointed as their names were missing. Asha and T.V. Subramanian, residents of Kelambakkam, could not vote. The couple had moved from Royapettah in 2017 and applied for address change last year. Though they received an acknowledgement from the ECIS in March 2020, the change was not effected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/finding-names-missing-many-voters-return-disappointed/article34258810.ece

Mr. Parthasarathy began his teaching career at the National College in Tiruchi at the age of 22 in 1952, before joining Delhi University three years later to teach Tamil. Back then, he cast his vote for both the Parliament and the Assembly elections, which were held simultaneously. As he was posted as a polling officer, his votes were collected by a senior official. His posting was in a village near Lalgudi where “no rural woman would tell her husband’s name for identification. There were no voter identity cards. It was a funny experience!” he recalled. Pointing out that he had never missed a Lok Sabha election, the winner of both the Sahitya and the Sangeet Natak Akademi award said even during his stint at Warsaw University in Poland (1981-86), he cast his vote at the Indian Embassy in Warsaw in 1984. He came back to Tamil Nadu in 1992 and since then, he has been a voter of the Thousand Lights Assembly constituency in Chennai. As for his latest experience, he said he was accompanied by his son-in-law to cast his vote. “There wasn’t much of a crowd,” he added.

07 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Two patients on ventilator support die at RGGGH||Two patients, who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Tower-3 of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), died following a reduction in pressure in the flow of oxygen. Hospital authorities said the two patients were very sick and their critical condition led to their deaths. On Monday night, liquid oxygen was being unloaded that caused a difference in pressure. This drop in pressure transmitted to Tower-3 following which two patients on the ventilator died in an interval of 30 minutes. The remaining 81 patients admitted to the ICU were unaffected, according to officials. Authorities of RGGGH said a 54-year-old woman, who was shifted from a private medical college hospital on the outskirts of Chennai to RGGGH at 8.45 p.m on Monday, and a 62-year-old man, who was admitted for 11 days, died. “Both were very sick. The woman was intubated and shifted here in a very critical state and was unconscious. She had multiple comorbidities with severe anaemia. She had tested negative for COVID-19 but we admitted her to Tower-3, where patients who test positive for COVID-19 and those with suspected symptoms are admitted, as she had clinical manifestations of COVID-19. The man had undergone amputation and also tested negative for COVID-19. But he had severe lung involvement. He was on CPAP ventilation,” a hospital authority said. He added that there was no problem with the flow of oxygen but there was a change in pressure. “This drop in pressure was identified and rectified within a few minutes. These two sick patients died in an interval of 30 minutes due to their illness,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-patients-on-ventilator-support-die-at-rgggh/article34258814.ece
07 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Transgender persons hope for jobs||Many transgender persons in the city went out and voted on Tuesday, hoping for more jobs from the next government. Jaya A., general manager, Sahodaran, an agency working with the third gender, says the marginalised community needs better government protection. “We did a survey sometime ago and found that many transgender persons dropped out of school owing to harassment by teachers.

07 April 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Confusion over namesake||P. Sureshkumar, a voter from Vadavalli, was in for a shock when he went to cast his vote at a government school. The presiding officer of booth 22A said he had voted. Shocked, he asked for proof. “I couldn’t believe that my vote was cast and I was standing there, in front of the officer to vote,” he said. After arguments with the officials, Mr. Sureshkumar found that somebody had signed against him but the identity document of the person who cast his vote was not him. And the signature wasn't his. “After I told the presiding officer that the signature wasn’t mine, I was asked to furnish my PAN card.” By then it had become clear that another voter, his namesake, who was supposed to vote in booth 22 had cast his vote in booth 22A. A supervising official, who was present there, suggested that Mr. Sureshkumar can vote in booth 22. But that didn't happen because the presiding officer there refused to allow him to vote. After a senior supervising official checked with the namesake by calling him over phone and checking credentials, the officer let him cast his vote, Mr. Sureshkumar said. Booth 22A officials admitted that the mistake was theirs because they checked the voter's name but not the EPIC card number or photograph.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/confusion-over-namesake/article34258878.ece

Badrinarayanan about the problem over the phone and he replaced the Inspector with another officer within next 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the technical glitch was rectified and smooth polling resumed. Collector M. Aravind, who cast his vote at St. Antony’s Primary School at Kurusadi along with his wife, said polling was progressing well in the district in peaceful manner even as the over 4,500 personnel had deployed across the district as part of the security arrangements. Technical issues in the EVMs had been attended within the shortest possible time so as to ensure unhindered polling. While micro observers were posted in 288 critical polling stations, webcasting of polling was done in 1,271 polling booths, he said. As the voters had to cast two votes to elect their MLA and the MP, the polling process took a bit more time for every voter. As the police received information about the smuggling of huge quantity of liquor bottles to be distributed to the voters of Poothurai and Kaarunyapuram areas near Niththiravilai, the police intercepted a vehicle at Niththaravilai. However, the occupants of the cargo vehicle managed to escape. Upon checking the ice box in the vehicle, the police recovered 1,557 liquor bottles, each 180 ml. Similarly, 493 liquor bottles were seized near Kurumbanai. Police constable Sreeja of Marthandam Police Station, who had been posted at Government Rubber Corporation Middle School in Keeripaarai under Kanniyakumari Assembly constituency suffered snake bike even as she was on duty on Monday night. She had been undergoing treatment in Government Medical College Hospital at Aasaaripallam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/technical-snags-at-several-booths-in-kanniyakumari-district/article34259035.ece
07 April 2021||KARUR,TAMIL NADU||Voters throng poll booths in Karur||Barring a few incidents of scuffle between AIADMK and DMK workers and malfunctioning of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), the four constituencies in Karur district witnessed brisk and peaceful polling on Tuesday. The polling that began on a slow pace picked up momentum from 9 am. In the first two hours of polling, just 9.18 % of votes were polled in the district. It was just 4.16% in Karur constituency. However,the polling gathered pace thereafter. Irrespective of rural and urban pockets, long queues were seen. In most of the booths, women queues outnumbered men queues. The scorching sun did not deter the voters in exercising their franchise. With the voters thronging in large number, the Government Arts and Science College at Karur, where multiple booths were set up, wore a festive look. Voters came in droves to cast vote. Though the octogenarians were given an option to cast postal votes this year, many chose to visit the polling stations in person to cast votes with the support of relatives and neighbours. At the Government (Girls) Higher Secondary School in Kulithalai, elderly men and women and several lactating women stood in long queues to cast votes. Enthusiasm was palpable among the first time voters. “I am so thrilled to use the democratic right for the first time in my life. I want to see a society that gives equal opportunity to all,” said A.K. Oviya (19), a first-time voter of Kulithalai, who pursues a UG programme in a Bengaluru college. Muslim dominated Pallapatti, which falls under the Aravakurichi constituency, witnessed brisk polling right from 7 am. Braving sweltering heat, women came in large number to the booths. Auto rickshaws and private vehicles transported elderly men and women to the polling stations in Pallapatti. The poll percentage, which stood at 9.18% at 9 am rose to 27.95% by 11 am and went up further to 44.30% by 1 pm. The average poll percentage stood at 77.21 by 5 pm. There were a few incidents of scuffle between the AIADMK and the DMK workers in Karur constituency. The DMK candidate of Karur constituency V. Senthil Balaji and Balamurugan, Chairman of Karur Panchayat Union at Vangal entered into heated arguments when he objected Mr. Senthil Balaji for visiting the polling booth along with his supporters. The police, who intervened in the matter, brought the situation under control. Similarly, the police chased away the cadres of the AIADMK and the DMK when they clashed between them over an issue of casting a vote of an elder at Thiruvallurvar ground. Commotion prevailed at the Pallapatti Higher Secondary School as the BJP workers and the DMK cadres engaged in heated exchanges of words. Claiming that the health workers, who were on duty at the school, were indirectly favouring the DMK candidate in Aravakurichi candidate, the BJP cadres demanded the officials to replace them. Collector Prashanth M. Wadnere toldThe Hinduthat the polling passed off peacefully without any untoward incident. There were a few minor glitches in the functioning of EVMs and they were all rectified immediately. Karur district recorded 83.92 polling percentage of votes in four constituencies. As per the provisional figure, Aravakurichi constituency registered 88.8% polling followed by Kulithalai with 86.5%. Krishnarayapuram and Karur recorded 84.14% and 83.5% polling, respectively.

07 April 2021||KOVILPATTI,TAMIL NADU||Voters boycott polls||A large number of voters of a village panchayat in Ilaiyarasanenthal firka near here boycotted poll on Tuesday to highlight their long-standing demand of annexing their local administration related works with Kovilpatti instead of being with far off Kuruvikulam panchayat union. The Ilaiyarasanenthal firka, having Ayyaneri, Appaneri, Pitchaithalaivanpatti, Chiththirampatti, Puliyangulam, Ilaiyarasanenthal, Pillaiyarnaththam, Vadakkupatti, Zamin Thevarkulam, Nakkalamuththanpatti, Lakshmiammalpuram and Mukkottumalai village panchayats with around 19,000 voters, was annexed to Thoothukudi district in 2008. While the firka’s revenue administration was appended to Kovilpatti taluk from Sankarankovil Taluk, a part of Tirunelveli district then and now Tenkasi district, the Local Administration functioning continues to remain with Kuruvikulam union of Sankarankovil taluk. While the residents of these 12 village panchayats can easily reach Kovilpatti as it is situated just 12 km away from their villages, they have to travel for 42 km for any work in the Kuruvikulam union office. So, the villagers have been staging several protests. Even though officials held talks with Appanaeri villagers only 491 votes out of 1,516 were polled till 7 p.m. on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/voters-boycott-polls/article34259389.ece
07 April 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||Inadequate bus service leaves voters stranded||While the district administration may have directed private firms and businesses to declare a holiday on Tuesday to ensure 100% voter participation, many people who headed out to their native districts to cast votes were left in the lurch without adequate bus services. This led to an irate public blocking a few private buses, forcing the police and the authorities to intervene. People employed in companies in Hosur worked till Monday and were let off only on the polling day. Hundreds of commuters thronged the bus stand in Krishnagiri, from where they had to find connecting buses to their native districts. Even as the commuters had set out before the break of dawn to the bus stand, there were no buses even after 10 a.m. Many families were stranded for hours waiting for buses especially to Thirupathur and Vellore districts. A commuter told The Hindu that he was employed in a company in Hosur and had reached Krishangiri early in the morning. However, he could not a find a bus to Thirupathur , his home town, where he had to cast his vote. As hours passed, crowds swelled up at the bus stand. When The Hindu contacted Collector V. Jayachandran Bhanu Reddy, he said that he had asked the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation to release more buses immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/inadequate-bus-service-leaves-voters-stranded/article34259033.ece
07 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Polling largely incident-free in Madurai||Barring a few glitches and a road roko, polling for the 10 assembly constituencies of Madurai district was largely incident-free on Tuesday. Madurai district recorded a voter turnout of 70.41 percentage. While the polling was dull in the first few hours in the morning, it slowly picked up in the day. But, most polling stations had very less voter turnout in the afternoon as the voters avoided the scorching sun. Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidate for Tirupparankundram assembly constituency S. Ponnuthai and her supporters staged a road roko near APT Duraisamy Nadar Higher Secondary School at Anuppanadi in the evening alleging that the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) candidate had distributed tokens to canvass voters, who will be paid in cash in return for their votes. She demanded to take action against the contestant and the party cadre. There was a technical glitch in the Electronic Voting Machine (EVMs) at a booth in Appar Higher Secondary School at Karuppayurani of Madurai East constituency. This caused a delay and polling commenced only at 8.45 a.m. Partymen of various political parties were seen canvassing votes within the campus of the Appar Higher Secondary School, in violation of the norms.  The Caste Hindu residents of Ulaipatti and Soolapuram villages of Usilampatti assembly constituency had boycotted the polls as the district election officials did not meet their demand of setting a separate polling booth for them. K. V. Rajkumar, Returning Officer of Usilampatti assembly constituency, said that due to a recent clash between the Scheduled Caste and Caste Hindu residents, the Caste Hindu residents had demanded a separate polling booth. “However, we denied setting up a separate booth,” he said. On the other hand, caste volatile areas like Pappapatti and Keeripatti of Usilampatti constituency witnessed smooth polling without any incidents. At most of the polling stations, there were poor arrangements made for the elderly and differently-abled voters.P. Panchavarnam, a crawling differently-abled person, faced difficulty as she had to crawl all the way through the ramp to enter a polling booth at Government Higher Secondary School, Karungalakudi, of Melur assembly constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/polling-largely-incident-free-in-madurai/article34259251.ece
07 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 protocol goes for a toss in rural areas||The mandatory COVID-19 protocol went for a toss during the assembly elections in Madurai district, especially in the rural pockets. People were seen without wearing any mask or maintaining physical distance at the polling booths. The polling agents at the booths said that they urged the voters to follow the guidelines. The polling agents and volunteers said that they even provided masks to the voters who came without wearing them. The masks, sanitisers and gloves at polling stations were made available for the voters at the polling booths in order to ensure strict compliance with the COVID-19 protocols. Thermal scanners were not used in some polling booths. Some polling booths lacked proper facilities. There was a lack of proper drinking water and sanitation at the booths. The washrooms were locked and officials posted at these booths were put to much hardship as a result. In a particular polling booth in the Sholavandan (reserved) constituency, a polling agent said that drinking water was made available to the officials deputed to the booth and no particular arrangements were made for the public. He agreed that sanitation had been compromised and there was a lack of proper facilities in the polling booth. When asked about the violation in COVID-19 guidelines, he said that the public must abide by the guidelines in the view of spike in COVID-19 cases. Some of the polling booths in Tiruparankundram constituency faced similar complaints. In a particular polling booth in the Madurai Central constituency, polling officials complained there was no proper food arrangements made. The drinking water cans were simply placed at the booths without any bubble top dispenser. “How are we supposed to drink the water?” complained a policeman who was deputed as part of security arrangements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-protocol-goes-for-a-toss-in-rural-areas/article34259249.ece
07 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Where women voters were amused by symbols||Inside a polling booth in Madurai East constituency, an elderly couple said they were impressed by the precautionary measures taken for safety against COVID. Their temperatures were checked and each voter was given single cellophane glove to wear before going in to vote. "Throughout the pandemic we stayed in our protective social bubble and I was little wary of coming to the booth," said the man, who was leading his wife. As the couple waited for their turn in the queue, the husband thought it wise to explain the party names and symbols of the contesting candidates that were stuck on a large sheet of paper outside the polling room. Standing behind them two young women joined the conversation and said they were aware of only the two Dravidian parties and their candidate's names. One was exercising her right to vote for the second time and the other had voted three times before. And both laughed saying only after coming to the booth on the day of polling every time they discover so many other candidates are also in the fray. From a CCTV, street light, transistor and air-conditioner to a bucket, cricket bat, gift box, gas cylinder and peas in a pod, there were 16 election symbols to choose from in this constituency. The women were clearly amused by the symbols and wanted to know if the symbols carried any real meaning or were randomly taken. The voter may not read the manifesto or meet the candidate but the election symbol may hold out remarkable promise. The variety of symbols displayed on the EVMs can be fascinating to the last-minute decision makers or the neo voters. In The Great March of Democracy, Seven Decades of India's Elections , a compilation of essays by renowned experts and edited by the former Chief Election Commissioner, S Y Quraishi, it is mentioned that the allotment of symbols to political parties was India's ingenious way of overcoming the shortcomings of an illiterate electorate. If the masses could not read the names of candidates in 1951, they could at least vote the symbol. The first CEC Sukumar Sen thought this would be a temporary measure since it would not be necessary once the literacy levels went up in the promising, foreseeable future. India's literacy rate grew from 18.33 % in 1951 to 77.7 % in 2020, but our election symbols have came to stay permanently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/where-women-voters-were-amused-by-symbols/article34259044.ece
07 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||On ‘democratic duty,’ she takes a push cart ride||It was an unusual sight on Tuesday morning at Government Higher Secondary School, Kottampatti in Melur constituency, as an elderly woman entered the polling booth on a push cart. Two school boys were seen pushing the broken cart on which P. Ramuthai, a 70-year-old differently-abled woman, travelled so that she could exercise her right to vote. Ms. Ramuthai, a Scheduled Caste resident of Kottampatti, said that she had never failed to vote in the past elections. During every elections, Ms. Ramuthai and her father used to travel together to exercise their right to vote. “But, this time my father fell sick and he couldn’t come to vote,”she said. This time, Ms. Ramuthai hired a broken push cart for a rent of Rs. 20 per hour. However, Ms. Ramuthai faced severe inconvenience once she reached the polling booth due to the absence of a wheelchair there. The rules of the Election Commission of India mandate that every polling station must have a wheel chair and a volunteer to help the elderly and differently-abled persons. However, this booth neither had a wheelchair nor a volunteer for the elderly. With great difficulty, Ms. Ramuthai travelled on the broken push cart to climb a ramp to enter the booth. She then had to crawl to get her indelible ink and voted with the help of the presiding officer. “In spite of of these difficulties, I was happy that I could vote,” she said. After casting her vote, Ms. Ramuthai travelled home on the broken push cart. An official present at the polling station said that no wheelchairs were provided for nearly six polling booths that were located inside the school.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/on-democratic-duty-she-takes-a-push-cart-ride/article34259253.ece
07 April 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||No untoward incident in south||The 12-hour-long polling for 58 Assembly constituencies in southern Tamil Nadu and Lok Sabha by-poll for Kanniyakumari constituency ended on a largely peaceful note amidst resurgence of COVID-19 cases on Tuesday. The 10 districts – Theni, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Thoothukudi, Tenkasi, Tirunelveli and Kanniyakumari – recorded a combined poll percentage of around 65, which may go up to 70. Except for minor glitches reported in the EVMs at some polling stations in Dindigul, Kanniyakumari, Tenkasi and Virudhunagar, polling largely went on smoothly. While Deputy Chief Minister and AIADMK candidate for Bodi constituency O. Panneerselvam cast his vote in Periyakulam, former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram exercised his franchise in Kandanoor in Sivaganga district and former Union Minister M.K. Alagiri cast his vote at a polling station in Madurai. Several State Ministers cast their votes in their respective home towns. Absence of wheelchairs at several polling stations irked sections of voters. Differently abled persons and senior citizens suffered in the sweltering heat. They were either carried in plastic chairs or physically lifted inside the stations by their relatives and police personnel. A large number of voters had neglected appeals from the government and officials to wear face masks and maintain physical distancing at polling stations. There were no significant law and order problems in the southern districts. A senior police officer said apart from Tamil Nadu Police, a large contingent of Central forces, deployed at vulnerable and critical polling stations, ensured peaceful polling. Even in Dalit-dominated Pappapatti panchayat in Madurai district, where elections could not be held in the past, there were no issues this time, he added. Fishermen in Rameswaram had threatened to hoist black flags as a mark of protest against the Centre for not giving adequate compensation to their damaged boats. However, following Union Minister Giriraj Singh’s assurance that their problem would be addressed, they dropped the plan and cast their votes. In Bodinaykanur constituency in Theni district, some people pelted the vehicle of AIADMK MP and son of Mr. Paneerselvam O.P. Raveendranath with stones at Perumal Naickenpatti around 3 p.m. when he was returning home after visiting a couple of polling stations. AIADMK men, who chased the assailants, alleged that it was the handiwork of AMMK cadre. DMK candidate Thanga Tamilselvan said his party had nothing to do with the incident after it was claimed on social media that the opposition party was behind the attack. There was a wordy altercation between PMK and DMK cadres in Chinnalapatti in Dindigul district. Police and revenue authorities pacified them after about two hours of talks. Election officials demanded adequate protection at the polling station. In Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Thoothukudi, strong presence of police at vulnerable stations ensured smooth polling, while in Virudhunagar district there were some reports of road blockade after opposition parties made complaints against BJP and AIADMK functionaries, officials said. In Madurai, the CPI (M) cadre claimed to have nabbed some AIADMK men with tokens (meant for exchange for cash to voters) late in the evening. The police said they would investigate into the allegation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/polling-peaceful-in-southern-districts/article34259005.ece

07 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Members of third gender demand a survey in U.T.||Voters of the third gender want the next government in the Union Territory to conduct a survey to identify the number of transgenders and frame measures to bring them into the mainstream. As per electoral statistics available with the authorities, the Union Territory has 116 third gender voters, including 96 in the Puducherry region. Ariankuppam constituency had the largest number of 18 third gender voters, followed by 16 in Karaikal North. Sheetal Nayak, president of Sahodaran Community Oriented Health Development Society, told The Hindu , after voting in a polling booth at Ariankuppam, that the number of eligible transgender voters were much more than the figure with election authorities. “I am sure the numbers will cross 1,000 in the U.T. if the government conducts a detailed survey. When many of us in the community desire to get a voter card, the authorities will direct us to get a birth certificate or other bona fide certificates to prove our identity. Where will we go because a majority of us are thrown out of homes and all the certificate to show our birth must have been destroyed by now,” Ms. Sheetal said. Free housing sought No person would like to take alms for a living. Sheetal said it was circumstances that push a third gender person onto the streets. “People complain about our community members taking alms. What else do we do? Getting a house on rent is difficult and somehow if we manage to get one, how will we pay the rent? The government should at least provide free housing facility like they give for other vulnerable sections,” said Durga Renjitha, who voted at Bhoopalan Kalyanamandapam, Kakkayanthoppu, in Ariankuppam constituency. Ms. Sheetal said the government could conduct a study to find out the number of transgenders and devise a programme to accommodate them in the mainstream by providing some training in skill development programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/members-of-third-gender-demand-a-survey-in-ut/article34259340.ece

07 April 2021||S. SundarSivakasi,TAMIL NADU||Helping hands are not afar||An elderly man, I. Muthiah, 73, walked with great difficulty into the Government Girl’s Higher Secondary School at Tiruthangal to discharge his democratic duty on the polling day. However, his fragile body did not match his mental determination. After having walked for more than 200 steps with the aid of a stick on a cloudy but sultry afternoon, the man stopped on the middle of the ground. He could not walk any more. When enquired, the old man said he was tired and could not walk any more. “I had undergone a surgery four months back. The police outside the school refused to allow my car,” he said. He was also not offered the wheel-chair. However, an ex-serviceman, who was on special duty, came to his help. But he could not find a wheel-chair on the school premises. By then, a young police constable who was on bandobust duty rushed to the elderly man and carried him to the booth. After he cast his vote, he carried him back outside the booth and made him sit comfortably on the verandah. The ex-serviceman walked up to the entrance and made a request to the police personnel to allow Mr. Muthiah’s car inside. Even as his car entered the school, one of the Government employee who was issuing booth slips successfully located a wheel-chair from one of the booths. “We have only one wheel-chair for all the 13 booths in both the boy’s and girl’s schools (adjacent buildings) on the same premises,” he said. Earlier, another elderly woman had to be given support by two men for her to climb down four steep steps and walk towards the entrance. Lack of awareness among the polling staff on what necessitated the provision of wheel-chair at polling stations defeated the very purpose of having it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/helping-hands-are-not-afar/article34259000.ece

07 April 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Brisk polling in Thoothukudi district||This district housing six Assembly segments witnessed brisk polling on Tuesday to register the poll percentage of 69.84.  Following technical snag in the EVMs in two polling booths in St. Michael’s Primary School in Tharuvaikulam under the Ottapidaaram (reserved) constituency, voters had to wait in long queue. While polling commenced at 7.30 a.m. in one of the booths, voting could be started only around 9.15 a.m. Similar problems delayed voting for 30 minutes in the TDTA High School at Christiyanagaram near Udangudi in Tiruchendur constituency, panchayat union primary school at Gnaniyarkudiyiruppu near Sattankulam under Srivaikundam constituency, RC Middle School in Sattankulam. The delay irked the waiting voters and the political party agents as well. Thermal scanner malfunction delayed the commencement of voting in Hindu Nadar Middle School in Kulaththoor under Vilaathikulam Assembly constituency by 15 minutes. Collector K. Senthil Raj, who cast his vote in Caldwell Higher Secondary School on Beach Road, said 15 ballot units, 12 control units and 26 VVPATs had to be replaced in the 6 Assembly segments in the district due to malfunctioning. Condemning the delay in giving them the house site pattas, 1,340 voters of Rajiv Gandhi Nagar under Ottapidaaram (reserved) constituency boycotted the Assembly polls. Following objections from Tamil Nadu Housing Board, issue of patta to the residents of Rajiv Gandhi Nagar is getting delayed. Though the officials held talks with the residents to persuade them to drop boycott of poll, they were firm in their decision. After the protesting villagers gathered at a public place of Rajiv Gandhi Nagar to register their protest, lunch was prepared there to be served to the protesting residents. The aggrieved residents said they, who had registered their lands properly and constructed their houses, had paid the taxes payable to the local bodies – to Meelavittaan panchayat for 13 years from 1997 and to the Thoothukudi Corporation since 2010. However, the objection raised by TNHB has effectively stopped the official machinery from distributing patta to the residents. As the protesting residents were firm in their decision, tahsildar of Thoothukudi Justin and Executive Engineer of TNHB Pandiaraj held talks with them. After they were assured in writing that the TNHB would give them ‘No Objection Certificate’ following due scrutiny, the residents started casting their votes after 4 p.m. When the AMMK cadres detained a few AIADMK men accusing them of distributing cash to the voters in ward 9 of Kovilpatti, they, with the help of the DMK functionaries, handed them over to the police. AIADMK candidate and Minister for Information Kadambur C. Raju, who came to the spot, allegedly tried to release them. Subsequently, they were taken to Kovilpatti East police station. As the ruling party functionaries tried to release their friends in police custody, cadres of the AMMK and the cadres of DMK-led alliance parties gathered at the police station, which escalated tension. However, the police managed to pacify them and further investigations are on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/brisk-polling-in-thoothukudi-district/article34259396.ece
07 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Polling passes off peacefully in central districts||Voters braved the scorching heat to turn up in large numbers to exercise their franchise in the Assembly election across central region on Tuesday. Polling passed off peacefully in all 41 Assembly constituencies in the nine districts in the region. An elaborate safety protocol was in put in place in view of the pandemic at the polling stations. Civic workers checked body temperature, sprayed sanitisers and handed out gloves to voters before they entered the polling stations. Many of the polling officials were seen wearing face shields. In some booths, however, thermal scanners were not provided in Tiruchi city. Some voters found it difficult to wear the gloves made of thin polythene sheets. The flimsy material gave away when they tried to wear it. Authorities too struggled to enforce social distancing, especially in rural areas. Nevertheless, many voters were appreciative of the preventive measures. “The arrangements were good, especially the provision of sanitiser, glove and safety gear. The Election Commission deserves appreciation,” said Kuppan Chetty, a resident of Anna Nagar. Shamianas erected in front of the polling booths gave much needed cover to the waiting voters. The provision of wheelchairs also came in handy for senior citizens. Voting pattern that was visibly varied across the district in the morning hours gathered pace during the course of the day. While booths in urban areas encompassing Tiruchi East and West constituencies witnessed queues of voters waiting to exercise their franchise within an hour of the start of the polling process, the process was sluggish in parts of Tiruverumbur constituency in the morning. However, polling gathered pace gradually as the day wore on. Commencement of polling was delayed at a few booths due to malfunctioning electronic voting machines, which were quickly replaced. Complaints of voters not receiving booth slips also abounded. In most of the constituencies in the region, more than 25% of the voters had cast their votes by 11 a.m. and the polling percentage crossed 40% by 1 p.m. despite the soaring temperature. By 3 p.m., the voter-turn out in many of the constituencies in the region crossed 55%. By 5 p.m., 71.91% polling was reported in Manachanallur and 70.63 % in Lalgudi. A case of bogus voting was reported at a booth at Mela Kalkandarkottai in Tiruverumbur constituency. The voter, Ramesh Kumar, 34, cast a tendered vote under Section 49 P of The Conduct of Elections Rules. “Despite exercising the provision of Section 49 P, I am still disappointed as tendered votes are not factored in during normal counting,” he said. Officials explained that the validity and scrutiny of tendered ballots came into question only when the losing candidate had sufficient reason to believe that the tendered ballots could materially alter the result of that particular election. At Devarayaneri, a locality where families of Narikurava community resided, the voter turnout was less than 5 % after three hours. Later in the day, a section of voters created a commotion in front of the booth saying they had not received the money promised to them by supporters of contesting candidates. They dispersed after persuation by officials. The printer of a VVPAT machine at the booth at Valadi became dysfunctional and the polling process was disrupted for a while until the device was rectified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/polling-passes-off-peacefully-in-central-districts/article34258992.ece
07 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Transgender women vote in hope of a better tomorrow||Transgenders in Tiruchi cast their votes in various booths across the district, hoping for better treatment in society and provision of welfare assistance. They demanded separate colonies for residence, education and job opportunities among other needs. P. Kajol, a former member of the Tamil Nadu Transgender Welfare Board said that while a few transwomen had cast their vote on Tuesday, many abstained from it as they believed that no changes would be come about in their status. Selvi, a senior member of the trans community in the district said that while the visually impaired, gypsies and other groups had separate colonies allotted by the government for them, the transwomen were yet to have any such facilities due to the social stigma. “We are also human, with needs and wants, but the officials look at us with an eye of suspicion,” she said. If the transwomen are given equal opportunities, they would not resort to begging or sex work, she added. A group of transwomen had, earlier this month, written a letter to the Chief Minister's office seeking reservation in government jobs, loan waivers for transgender self-help groups, free accommodation facilities, a government order allowing equal share in family inheritance and transport allowance for aged transgenders. "We hope the new government will at least treat us with dignity," Selvi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transgender-women-vote-in-hope-of-a-better-tomorrow/article34258980.ece

07 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||It is peaceful in Tirunelveli||The district witnessed peaceful polling on Tuesday and recorded 66.54 poll percentage. Poll percentage in these 5 segments – Tirunelveli, Ambasamudram, Palayamkottai, Nanguneri and Radhapuram - in 2016 Assembly election was 69. Speaking to reporters after casting his vote in a booth at St. John’s Higher Secondary School in Palayamkottai, Collector V. Vishnu said the polling was going on smoothly as all arrangements had been put in place and reviewed. The EVMs would be taken to Government College of Engineering, Palayamkottai, the counting centre, by 157 teams, each led by a Zonal Officer, he said. Model booths with reception team, decorated shamiyana, chairs for waiting voters and medical team had been established at Madharasa School in Kailaasapuram, MDT Higher Secondary School, Tirunelveli Junction, Loyola Convent in Palayamkottai, ‘All Women Booth’ at St. John’s Higher Secondary School attracted everyone’s attention as even the police personnel deployed there were also women. Though technical glitches in Electronic Voting Machines in more than 20 polling booths gave anxious moments to the polling personnel, technicians rushed to the spots to rectify the problems within the shortest possible time so that there was no significant delay in commencing the polling. As distribution of ‘booth slips’ could not be completed before the deadline of April 5, the Block Level Officers were stationed at booths to distribute booth slips to the voters on arrival. A good number of voters had downloaded the ‘booth slips’ on their mobile phones. While use-and-throw polythene glove and sanitizer were offered to the voters after the person deployed at the booths for this purpose checked the body temperature of the voter with the thermal scanner, the voters did not bother to ensure physical distancing even though lime powder circles had been drawn in front of the booths. In the first two hours of polling, Tirunelveli district recorded only 6.66% of polling that gained momentum to some extent in the forenoon. While poll percentage in all other segments in the district had crossed 60% by 5 p.m., less than 54% of the highly literate Palayamkottai voters had cast their votes by this time, much to the disappointment of the officials. A family of three from Perumalpuram in Palayamkottai, who are in home quarantine after getting recovered from COVID-19, were allowed to cast their votes in the booth in their area around 6.30 p.m. After the polling personnel were given the personal protection kits including full cover, the trio in full cover, cast their votes. “As the couple’s daughter, a postgraduate medical student of Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, contracted the viral infection, they tested positive. Since they have recovered from the viral infection and tested negative, they are in home quarantine as of now. Since they wanted to cast their votes, they were allowed to do so after all precautionary measures were taken,” said a Corporation official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/it-is-peaceful-in-tirunelveli/article34259392.ece
07 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||A tough time for differently abled and aged voters||Though the differently abled and the aged voters had been promised of being provided with wheelchairs in the polling stations as they arrive there for casting their votes, the non-availability of these facilities in most of the polling stations gave anxious and embarrassing moments for them as they had to seek the help of others. When the differently abled voters, believing the officials’ assurance that they would get wheelchair from the entrance of the polling station up to the booth to cast their votes, came to the polling station to cast vote on Tuesday, they were disappointed. While their family members and the police carried them after making them to sit on a plastic chair in some places, these voters were carried in hands by their relatives in some other places. When an elderly male voter arrived at CSI Jayaraj Annapackiyam Higher Secondary School near Tuckerammalpuram check-post in Palayamkottai Assembly constituency around 8 a.m., his son, who brought his father in a car up to the portico of the polling station, searched for the wheelchair, but in vain. Subsequently, the son and another voter waiting in the queue had to support him to enter the polling booth to cast his vote. Another agonizing scene could be seen at Panagudi under Radhapuram constituency in Tirunelveli district, where a physically challenged girl had to crawl for about 100 meters to reach the polling booth, again due to the non-availability of wheelchair in the polling station. In Pallam, a coastal village near Kanniyakumari, the family members of an elderly male voter carried him from the entrance of St. Jude’s Higher Secondary School up to the polling booth. “The officials, who were actively conducting voter awareness programmes – right from bike rallies to parasailing - ever since the poll notification was made to encourage all voters to exercise their franchise, should have made arrangements for stationing at least a wheelchair with a volunteer in every polling station so that the differently abled voter could have cast their vote with ease. After asking every eligible voter to cast their votes without fail, they have forgotten the promise they had made to the physically challenged and the elderly voters. Do you think these physically challenged and the senior citizen voters would come again for casting their votes in the next election?” asked Edward of Pallam near Kanniyakumari. A random check in the polling stations from Arockiyapuram to Colachel revealed that wheelchair was not provided to the aged and the physically challenged voters in any of these polling stations, all located in the coastal hamlets housing Christian fishermen voters. In most of the places, the physically challenged and the aged voters could cast their votes, thanks to policemen on duty in the polling stations and the voters waiting in the queue. Tirunelveli Collector V. Vishnu said wheelchairs had been dispatched for all polling stations having differently abled voters. “We’ll check with the officials concerned,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-tough-time-for-differently-abled-and-aged-voters/article34259388.ece
07 April 2021||Tirupattur,TAMIL NADU||For this community, casting vote is a compulsive habit||For 18-year-old R.Ranjitha, from the Narikurava community, applying the indelible ink in her finger and casting vote for the first time was an exciting experience. She hopes that the person who comes to power will do good for her community. There are more than 1,000 Narikuravas living in Gandhi Nagar, Agaramcheri, Ambur constituency in Tirupattur district. Out of this, there are 260 voters. Members of the community claimed that there were 46 first-time voters among them. “I don’t know much about politics but I wanted to exercise my democratic right. I hope the candidate I chose would win and do good for the constituency, especially for us,” Ms.Ranjitha said. Members of this community, who have been living in Gandhi Nagar, for past many decades, have never failed to vote. “We come as a group to vote. Nearly four decades ago, we wanted to boycott elections as our demands were not met. But we didn’t do it and voted,” said S.Anandan, an elderly member of the community.  Meeting held D. Rajini, one of the leaders of the community, living in Agaramcheri, said a meeting was held among the members a week before the election, and it was decided that everyone should vote. “We analyse what each candidate has promised for the development of our community and we decide whom to vote for,” he said. Mr. Rajini said that they need proper houses and good drinking water supply. He said that during Chief Minister K. Kamaraj’s regime they were given 65 acres of land. “But it was grabbed by different people. I advise youngsters that it is important to vote to choose the leader who can bring a change in the society. I want the mentality among our community members towards education of our children, especially girls, to change,” he said.

Diana, a Toda woman from Muthanad Mund near Udhagamandalam, said that members of the community had not wanted to go to the polling booths early fearing that there would be crowds. “However, we all decided to go out and vote at around noon,” said Ms. Diana, who said that she found it extremely easy to cast her vote this time due to the preparations undertaken. “Everyone waited patiently in the queue, wearing masks and maintaining personal distancing, while election officials also were extremely clear with their instructions on how to use the EVM machine,” she said. Though polling itself was without incident, the AIADMK’s candidate contesting in Coonoor, D. Vinoth, was not allowed to leave the village of Thuthurmattam after local residents and DMK cadres accused him of distributing cash to voters on the eve of the elections. The incident occurred on late Monday night. Police rushed to the spot and spent over two hours dispersing the crowd. District election officer and Collector, J. Innocent Divya, said that a case has been registered against Mr. Vinoth for campaigning past the deadline, which ended on Monday evening.

07 April 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Barring a few glitches, polling in 4 districts conducted peacefully||Barring a poll boycott in Katpadi Assembly constituency and some glitches in the functioning of EVMs, the elections in the four districts — Ranipet, Vellore, Tirupattur and Tiruvannamalai — was by and large peaceful amidst the pandemic. This is the first Assembly election after the trifurcation of Vellore district. Following cash seizures, including Rs. 97 lakh from Ranipet and Rs. 18.41 lakh in Katpadi, more than Rs. 5 lakh in Gudiyatham and Rs. 4 lakh in Anaicut, there was a fear that the election may get rescinded in Vellore and Ranipet districts. However, the polling was conducted smoothly. Though it began at a slow pace in the morning, it gradually picked up momentum as the day progressed. According to the data released by the Election Commission, Ranipet district registered 74.36%, Tirupattur district registered a total polling percentage of 74.66, Tiruvannamalai recorded 75.63% and Vellore had a polling percentage of 72.31 at the end of the election.

Thousands of officials and policemen were deployed in the booths to ensure that the polling was conducted smoothly. Unmindful of the scorching heat, residents started coming to the booths as early as 6.45 a.m. However in most booths, personal distancing was thrown to the wind. Elderly citizens came in large numbers to vote. "I wanted to vote in the booth, hence I did not use the postal ballot," said an elderly woman who was waiting at a booth in Ambur. First-time voters also turned up enthusiastically to exercise their franchise. “I was excited. I want a good leadership in my constituency,” said T. K. Padmavathi, a first-time voter in Gandhi Nagar, Katpadi. Though overall the voting was peaceful, there were delays in all the districts due to malfunctioning of the EVMs. They were set right immediately.

07 April 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||78.49% turnout in Villupuram||Villupuram district on Tuesday registered 78.49% turnout in the Assembly election on Tuesday. Cuddalore district registered 76.6% polling, while Kallakurichi district recorded 78%. Polling in all the seven Assembly constituencies in Villupuram district was largely peaceful.

Personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) chased away the workers and brought the situation under control. Malfunctioning of EVMs was reported from a few booths. But overall, voting progressed at a brisk pace in all the seven constituencies. Initially, COVID-19 protocols were adhered to and officials marked circles outside the booths to ensure physical distancing. Voters had their hands sanitised and were screened with thermal scanners outside the booths. However, a few hours into polling, people began to crowd the booths and little effort was made to regulate them. Ramadoss upbeat In the first hour of polling, PMK founder S. Ramadoss cast his vote at a booth at Sri Maragadhambigai High School in Tindivanam. Speaking to reporters, Dr. Ramadoss claimed that people were happy with the performance of the AIADMK government and said good governance should continue in the State. ‘Imposition of opinion’ About opinion polls predicting a landslide for the DMK-led front, he said people attached little value to the opinion polls. “They are not opinion polls but only a compulsory imposition of opinion,” he said. PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss and Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam cast their votes in Tindivanam and Avvaiyarpuram respectively. DMK heavyweight and former Minister K. Ponmudi cast his vote in Villupuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/7849-turnout-in-villupuram-district/article34258848.ece

The State was marching ahead in all sectors thanks to good governance provided by the government. Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss termed the opinion polls, which predicted a victory for the DMK-led alliance, as an imposition of opinion under the garb of survey. ‘Exit polls’ Dr. Anbumani said that since 2001, most exit polls in the State had gone wrong. The opinion polls lacked credibility as the sample survey accounted for a meagre 0.1% of the electorate of 6.25 crore in the 234 Assembly segments in the State, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-hopeful-of-big-win/article34259346.ece

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Tough terrains do not deter people from voting||Tough terrains did not deter voters in several parts of the western districts to cast their vote on Tuesday. Voters in Malliamman Durgham in Bhavanisagar and Kathirimalai in Anthiyur Assembly constituencies that could be reached after trekking rough jungle terrains for nine km exercised their franchise in the Assembly election on Tuesday. Both these settlements are located inside the reserved forest areas and are inaccessible to reach by vehicle. The villages have no mobile connectivity and solar lights light up the houses. While poll materials are transported in a pick-up van to reach the Panchayat Union Middle School at Malliamman Durgham that has 427 voters, two donkeys ferried materials to the Government Tribal Residential Middle School at Kathirimalai that has 134 voters. Due to poor road connectivity, over 50 families from Malliamman Durgham moved to Kadambur many years ago in search of jobs and schools for their children. On Tuesday, over 100 voters visited their settlement in pick-up vehicles, cast their votes and returned to Kadambur. At Navamalai, a remote tribal hamlet located 10 km from Aliyar, in Coimbatore district, 170 of the 275 voters had exercised their franchise by 1 p.m. The hamlet has about 50 houses of tribal people and employees of the Electricity Department. Vellachi, who does not know her age, says her husband, daughter, son-in-law and she visited the polling station, located about a half a km from her house, early to cast their votes. “There are no jobs here. If we need to earn we need to go to the plains,” she says. Banumathi, who runs a grocery store, says the Department staff, who were residents of Navamalai but transferred and are yet to get their votes registered in the new location, visit the hamlet during election. Of the three hill hamlets of Kottur, Alakettu and Erimalai in Pennagaram Assembly constituency that declared poll boycott over motorable road, Kottur with 327 votes stood its ground and boycotted the polls without casting a single vote. The other two hamlet residents refused to cast their vote until afternoon. The villages at an elevation with a 7-km trek have never had a road and had relied on donkeys to transport their rations and the ballot boxes for every election. With unmotoroble terrain, the residents decided that they would not vote if that vote would not fetch them the bare minimal amenity of a road. This year, the hamlets with over 700 votes declared a poll boycott and stood firm till afternoon. However, soon after officials intervened, Alakettu and Erimalai were convinced to cast their votes.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Some voters cast tendered vote||When some of the voters, who went to the polling station on Tuesday, found that their votes were already cast, they cast their tendered vote. Two voters cast tendered votes within Tiruppur North Assembly constituency under Section 49P of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. Election officials said that a voter named Shanthi cast her tendered vote at the polling station in Corporation Middle School, Ramakrishnapuram, and another voter named Selvaraj cast his tendered vote at S.S.A Corporation Middle School in A.S. Pandit Nagar. These two voters found out that someone had already voted in her/his name at the respective polling stations and they resorted to exercising their franchise after flagging the issue with the respective presiding officers. According to Section 49P of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, if a voter realises that someone has already voted in her name, she can approach the presiding officer at the polling booth and flag the issue. After answering the presiding officer’s questions about her identity satisfactorily, the voter will be allowed to cast a tendered vote. Tendered votes are cast on ballot papers, sealed and locked away. These votes are useful when the margin between the winning candidate and the runner-up is slim. However, if the difference is large, tendered votes are not counted. Vimala, who had gone to the polling station at Koundampalayam at about 11.30 a.m., was told that her vote was cast. Her mother, husband, and son, who accompanied her, were able to exercise their franchise. “I was threatened by a policeman and I refused to move from the polling station. The officials asked me to cast tendered vote,” she alleged. She demanded that her vote should also be counted as there was no mistake on her part. A 32-year-old elector, whose vote was cast by somebody, invoked 49P of The Conduct of Election Rules, and cast his tendered vote at a polling booth at Bhavanisagar Assembly constituency. C. Saravanan of Kenjanur Housing Unit in Sathyamangalam is working as a junior assistant at the Department of Information and Public Relations Office at the Erode Collectorate. On Tuesday, he went to the polling booth at Government High School at Kenjanur only to learn that his vote had already been cast. Shocked by it, he questioned the presiding officer and said that he was working at the Collectorate and displayed his government identity card. Later, the officer pacified him and he filled up Form 17B of Rule 49P and cast his tendered vote.  (With inputs from R. Akileish in Tiruppur, V.S. Palaniappan and M.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore, Tiruppur Assembly constituencies witness brisk polling||At the stroke of 7 a.m., electorate were seen making a beeline to the polling stations resulting in long unwinding queues in many places in Coimbatore and Tiruppur districts. In many polling stations, conservancy workers were busy cleaning and marking personal distancing circles. This resulted in piling up of voters in large numbers and the crowd started melting only after 9.30 a.m. Kinathukkadavu, Pollachi and Valparai Assembly constituencies witnessed a brisk turn out. Pollachi witnessed the highest poll percentage at 77.28 followed by Sulur at 75.49 %. While there was optimal compliance to COVID-19 norms in urban areas in terms of personal distancing, masks and sanitiser, rural areas almost saw nil compliance. However, in many of the polling stations in the rural areas of Coimbatore district, the voters did not maintain physical distance. As the turnout was high in the morning, people stood in queues in front of the booths, without maintaining distance. The polling percentage for the district stood at 68.32 at the close of polls at 7 p.m. of the 10 Assembly constituencies. The polling percentage stood at over 67.4% in Tiruppur. Officials of poll machinery said with data still flowing from remote areas , there could be a variation of one or two percent. All eight Assembly constituencies in Tiruppur district saw brisk polling. There were no untoward incidents reported. One of the polling stations set up at a government school in Avinashi (Reserved) constituency did not have any personal distancing circles marked. However, compliance with wearing masks was seen to be high in both rural and urban parts of Tiruppur district. A rumour that an electronic voting machine at a polling station set up in a private school within Avinashi (Reserved) constituency casts all votes to AIADMK caused a stir. However, the rumour was immediately found to be false. The Hindu visited the polling station in Kaniyampoondi, where a presiding officer said that a voter made the allegation at around 11 a.m., but the officials checked the control unit, ballot unit and the voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines and found no faults. The polling continued as usual, he said. District Election Officer K. Vijayakarthikeyan told The Hindu that some sections of media reported the “false hearsay information”. “We have verified it thoroughly, there is no evidence of any such incident,” he said. Meanwhile, Tiruppur City Police seized nearly 300 liquor bottles that were allegedly stocked up for sales in a rented room on Kongu Main Road.  (With inputs from V.S. Palaniappan, M.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Age, disability do not deter them from voting||Senior citizens, who had seen several elections so far, did not fail to fulfil their constitutional right on Tuesday when the State went to polls. Marappa Gounder, aged above 80, travelled to Mavathampadhi polling station alone on Tuesday morning to cast his vote. He usually votes at Navakkarai. This year, the polling station was changed and that did not matter. “I cannot stand for a long time. So I will rest for a while and then cast my vote,” he said, as he waited for his turn. At Kinathukadavu, 74-year-old Lakshmi said she could not see properly. She walked to the polling station with her son and was helped in casting her vote. An elderly couple – Subramanian (73) and Lakshmi (63) – reached the polling station in Tiruppur North Assembly constituency all the way from Udumalpet to exercise their franchise. In Avinashi (Reserved) Assembly constituency, a first-time voter V. Vignesh (21) accompanied his grandmother Krishnaveni (75) to the polling station. At the polling booths at P.K.D. School in Pollachi, women coming with infants, senior citizens, and those with disabilities were asked to go in first. However, in the Nilgiris, people with disabilities had a tough time getting to the polling booths. Most of the booths were not disabled-friendly. At Kalhatti, the polling booth had a ramp that was too steep for wheelchair users. And, a portion of the cement ramp was broken. The only other means for accessing the booth was through the stairs. Fortunately, polling officials said that no one with a serious disability had come to cast their vote till Tuesday afternoon, with elderly persons being helped by accompanying family members or by police. At the Gel Memorial Girls Higher Secondary School in Udhagamandalam, 65-year-old K. Subramanian was accompanied by his daughter, P. Priya, to cast his vote. Ms. Subramanian said that he walked more than a kilometre with his daughter due to lack of transport to the polling station. “If I did not have my daughter with me, it would have been very difficult to cast my vote, as there were no wheelchairs to help me,” he said.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||First time voters share their experience||For the first time voters, the whole experience of visiting a polling station, choosing the candidate on the EVM and casting their vote was new and different. S. Sriharan of Tatabad, Coimbatore, plans to keep his booth slip safe. “It is a reminder of my first voting exercise,” says the medical student. Rashmi B., a second year college student, enquired with her mother and understood how to vote. After getting all the details the young voter exercised her franchise at the government school in Vadavalli, accompanied by her friend, S. Diksa. Two sisters – A. Kavinarasi (24) and A. Ilakkiya (22) – cast their votes together for the first time in Palladam Assembly constituency. Ms. Kavinarasi said that she initially found it difficult to go through all the candidates in the list on the electronic voting machine. She and her younger sister said that the hardships caused due to the COVID-19 restrictions and soaring temperatures were not a major concern to exercise their franchise. M. Sneha (20), another first-time voter in Palladam Assembly constituency, said that the COVID-19 restrictions in the polling stations were “difficult,” but asserted that there is “no other way” given the present situation. In the Nilgiris, the first time voters included several residents of Tibetan origin who had made the Nilgiris their home several years ago. The community of Tibetan-exiles, most of whom own small businesses near the Government Botanical Garden in Udhagamandalam, have only recently started to vote in elections. Tibetans born in India between 1950 and 1987 are legally allowed to vote since 2014. Tashi Yangzom, a resident of Tibetan origin, said that many members of the community felt it was their duty to vote in the elections. “We never faced any discrimination in the Nilgiris, and we feel that this is also our home,” she said. Though not all members of the community speak Tamil or English, they were assisted by election officials to cast their vote for the party of their choice, they said. Another first-time voter in the Nilgiris K. Shobika, a resident of Fern Hill, and a third-year college student studying in Coimbatore, said, “One of the factors which is driving youngsters like me to go out and vote is the influence of social media, which is driving home the message of the need to vote, and the need to also choose our elected officials wisely.”  (With inputs from Karthik Madhavan and Wilson Thomas in Coimbatore, R.

According to officials there are 992 voters in the village. However, till 6 p.m., only 18 votes were polled. “We have been demanding the closure of a tyre factory in our village. The unit separates the metals from the tyre and sells them as crap and the tyre is burnt to get a type of oil which is used in paints,” said A. Rudramoorthy, a resident. Deenadayalan, a 27-year-old resident of the village, said that the factory was set up two-and-a-half years ago. “Smoke caused due to smoking of tyres has been causing health problems, including breathlessness and heartburn, for the villagers,” he claimed. Road roko On April 1, the villagers staged a road roko and the factory was closed temporarily. “However they reopened it a few days ago. Hence we decided to boycott the polls till we get some respite,” said Mr. Deenadayalan. V.

Hand-in-hand, C. Shanmugam, aged around 80 years, and his wife came all the way from home to exercise their democratic duty at Tiruvarangulam in Pudukottai district. The aged couple wore masks and walked slowly towards the booth at Panchayat Union Elementary School along Pudukottai-Alangudi Main Road where hand sanitisers and gloves were kept ready for distribution to voters. Despite suffering from mild visual impairment, Mr. Shanmugam’s wife Chellammal was equally keen to vote this time as well. Armed with documents required for voting, the couple did not find it difficult to vote as they turned up early at the booth. Notwithstanding their age, they said in one voice that they wanted to exercise their democratic right. Volunteers and other staff deployed at the booth assisted them. The same was the case with 85-year-old N. Gopalakrishnan, a resident of Pudukottai Town. Holding a walker and assisted by his close relative, Mr. Gopalakrishnan promptly arrived a couple of hours after polling began at the booth set up in Government Ranees School in Pudukottai. “Considering my age, officials allotted me a separate area to wait for a short duration of time prior to casting my vote,” said Mr. Gopalakrishnan. There was no delay in voting and arrangements made by the official authorities at the booth were good, he said after exercising his franchise. Overcoming her difficulty to walk freely, 70-year-old Remisha Beevi, accompanied by her son Sadakathullah, promptly cast her vote at a polling booth set up at Government Higher Secondary School in Illupuri. Ms. Remisha Beevi said she had been exercising her franchise for several years and did not want to discontinue despite her mobility problem. Authorities had made provision of a wheelchair among other facilities at the polling booth to help voters especially those with physical disability. Ms. Remisha’s son, who brought her in a vehicle up to the entrance, shifted her to the wheelchair and took her to the designated booth inside the sprawling premises braving the intense heat in the afternoon. Ms. Remisha did not have to wait for long as she was given priority to cast her vote by those waiting in the queue and by officials. Provision of ramp was made at several booths all over the district to help those with physical disability and senior citizens. Many aged women wearing masks turned up promptly to vote in favour of the candidate of their choice in the district. In Tiruchi district, some senior citizens who turned up to vote felt that the new government must prioritise the welfare of senior citizens. S. Muthu, 65, a resident of Woraiyur who lives alone with his wife, said the government must provide for the care of the elderly. “During the pandemic, we suffered a lot. We were unable to purchase any groceries and had to depend upon others for our basic needs.” Officials could conduct door-to-door enquiry and arrange supplies such as groceries and medicines, he added. M.S. Ashraf, senior physician and former national vice-president, Indian Medical Association, felt that the government should increase its focus on healthcare. “A clear plan of action on combating communicable and non-communicable diseases could be charted out. The government must also promote vaccination for all.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/senior-citizens-brave-pandemic-to-exercise-their-franchise/article34258988.ece

The demonstrators hailing from Maththiyur, Mathiruppu and Vandaiyariruppu alleged that their basic requirements such as approach road to burial grounds, drinking water facility, toilets and roads remained unfulfilled for the past 10 years. Attempts to attract the attention of officials and pleas with elected representatives had not yielded desired result. Hence, the electorates attached to the three villages staged a demonstration at Maththiyur with black flags stating that they would prefer to stay away from the democratic exercise. On hearing the news, Thirupanandal police rushed to spot and pacified the demonstrators. Later they voted at the polling booth allocated for their villages, the sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/villagers-stage-protest/article34258974.ece

A total of 2,741 polling stations, including 526 ancillary booths, were established in the district in which polling was held from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. While water cans were made available in the booths in the city limits, they were absent in the booths in rural areas. At the polling booths in Lakkapuram Pudur in Modakkurichi Assembly constituency, works to clean the premises and mark white circles to ensure personal distancing were taken up only after 8 a.m. Elders and differently-abled persons found it difficult to access wheel-chairs, as the vehicles in which they had come were not allowed parking near the polling stations.

07 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Call for extra caution during festival weekend, bypolls||While COVID-19 experts have warned that the coming four weeks are crucial for Karnataka, they are now concerned that this long weekend due to festivals (Ugadi and the start of Ramzan) followed by the bypolls will only trigger a steep rise if people do not follow the standard guidelines of SMS (Social distancing, Masking and Santisation). While some experts suggest that the State may consider a weekend lockdown and night curfew as done in Maharashtra, members of the State’s Technical advisory Committee (TAC) said a weekend lockdown and night curfew have a limited role in reducing the speed of transmission. Concerned by the surge, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has convened a meeting with Chief Ministers of various States on April 8. The State on Tuesday reported 6,150 new cases of which 4,266 are from Bengaluru Urban alone. TAC chairman M.K. Sudarshan said people should strictly avoid travel to their native villages during the festival season. “Based on our recommendations, the Government has already issued an Order prohibiting large gatherings and public celebrations of festivals and fairs. This should be strictly enforced,” he said. “People should follow precautions, stay home and avoid non-essential travel. Following COVID-19 appropriate behaviour is in your own interest. Protect yourselves as well as your children,” he said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said Ugadi is a festival where people usually go out of the city to their villages. “But now, they should realise that they can either carry the infection there or bring it back with them on return. What is the need to visit native places when you can celebrate in a simple manner here itself,” he asked. V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, suggested that the State government consider a weekend lockdown and night curfew as done in Maharashtra, especially this long festival weekend. “This is my personal suggestion as people are not listening or following government orders. They do not seem to understand the gravity of the current situation,” he said. However, Giridhar R. Babu, who heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India in Bengaluru, said a weekend lockdown and night curfew have a limited role in reducing the speed of transmission. “It will only create a sense of responsibility among people that if they do not listen, the government will be forced to impose drastic measures,” he said. A top health official said the government has to go step by step if the need arises for a weekend lockdown. “First containment zones should be notified and strict perimeter control should be enforced. If this does not help, then Section 144 should be imposed followed by area restrictions/seal down. The government can think of partial lockdown, night curfew and total lockdown only after these measures,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/call-for-extra-caution-during-festival-weekend-bypolls/article34258764.ece
07 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘We have to safeguard our rations from rodents’||As she works on levelling the pavement and helping her husband who is planting saplings, Sameena (name changed) keeps an eye on her three-year-old son, who is playing by himself nearby. Sameena and her husband Sharief (name changed) are among the 30-odd labourers working on T. Chowdaiah Road. The labourers, who are mostly from different districts of north Karnataka, live on-site in tents made of blue tarpaulin and tin sheets. There is just one portable toilet for all the labourers and their families. With soaring day time temperatures, these tents become inhospitable, and the nights are no better. Troubled by mosquitoes and rodents, sleep is elusive. Shivamma (name changed) is from Hoovina Hadagali. She has been in Bengaluru for the past three years, working as a labourer for various projects. For the past three months, she has been living with her husband in a tent on Cunningham Cross Road. “We can manage the heat; it’s the rodents and other vermin that are giving us sleepless nights. We have to safeguard our ration from them,” she said. All these labourers are working on road projects being executed by the Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. (BSCL). Road improvement works have been taken up on around 35 roads, all in the Central Business District, most of them a stone’s throw away from Raj Bhavan and Vidhana Soudha, the power centres of the State. Yet, they continue to live in squalid conditions with no proper ventilation or other facilities. According to Maithreyi Krishnan from the All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), the labourers should be given all facilities as prescribed under various laws, including Building and Other Construction Workers’ Act, 1996, Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, and Inter State Migrant Workmen Act, 1970. “Ideally, these labourers should be provided minimum wages, equal pay for equal work and accommodation with basic facilities. The onus is on the principal employer, in this case BSCL, and the contractor. Any other arrangement, such as sub-contracts, is deemed illegal,” she said. The labourers are working on improving civic amenities in the city, especially in the five-km radius around Vidhana Soudha, but are living in poor conditions, she pointed out and said AICCTU was undertaking a survey of the living conditions of these labourers. More than a year ago, CIVIC Bengaluru, a non-profit organisation, had submitted a memorandum on the poor living conditions of these labourers to the Labour Department. Consequently, the department issued an order, based on the Model Scheme of the Union Ministry of Labour, Supreme Court directives and borrowed heavily from CIVIC’s memorandum, directing the Building and Other Construction Workers’ Board to utilise cess amounting to Rs. 8,000 crore to provide basic benefits to these workers, pointed out Kathyayini Chamaraj from CIVIC. ‘No response to queries’ However, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of implementation is unclear. Ms. Kathyayini added that she had now filed an RTI application seeking information about the same. “We had raised the issue again in March and written to the Chief Minister, Urban Development Department, BSCL and Labour Department. However, there has been no response so far,” she claimed. Hemanth Kumar from Ashankura Trust that works for the welfare of migrant labourers alleged that many labour laws were being violated. There have been instances of contractors not even paying compensation to workers injured at the work site, he claimed. He said he would take up a survey of these work sites and submit a complaint on the labourers’ living conditions to the Labour Department and BSCL. BSCL Managing Director P. Rajendra Cholan claimed that he had not received any complaint on the labourers’ living conditions. He, however, admitted that, as the principal employer, BSCL would ensure that contractors provide all amenities to labourers, especially basic accommodation that is well-ventilated. “We are working towards ensuring all the pending work is completed by May. Around 60% of work is completed so far,” he said and added that in case of any negligence on the part of contractors, BSCL would initiate stringent action against them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/we-have-to-safeguard-our-rations-from-rodents/article34258754.ece
07 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC: Relaxation given to pvt. medical establishments defeats object of law||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday observed that prima facie the exemption granted from securing trade licence and producing occupancy certificates (OC) for buildings at the time of registration of private medical establishments (PMEs) defeats the very purpose and object of the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments Act, 2007. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice John Michael Cunha made this observation while ordering notice to the State government on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition in which legality of the circular, issued by the Commissioner for Health on August 17, 2020, has been questioned. Circular The Commissioner, citing suggestions by associations of private medical establishments to simplify and streamline the process of registration and renewal of the PMEs, had stated in the circular that “the mandatory trade licence clause for registration and renewal of private medical establishments is hereby relaxed”. The circular had also discontinued the requirement of uploading of OCs given for the buildings housing PMEs citing the difficulties faced by those managing the PMEs to upload them while making it clear that it is sufficient to upload documents such as khata/tax paid receipt and lease or rental agreements with respect to the buildings. However, it has been contended in the petition, filed by Bharath Yuvajana Sene, a city-based social organisation through its advocate Vaijayanthimala B., that the exemption from producing OC amounts to allowing PMEs to operate in the buildings constructed illegally as such buildings would not get the certificate under the law, particularly in cities. It is meaningless to allow hospitals to be established in buildings sans OC when ordinary residential structures require OC under municipal law before occupation, the petitioner pointed out. Also, it has been contended in the petition that granting exemption from securing trade licence would not only cause crores of rupees loss to the State exchequer but also result in further loss of control and monitoring of quality and services in additional services such as medical stores and restaurants provided within in the PMEs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-relaxation-given-to-pvt-medical-establishments-defeats-object-of-law/article34258788.ece
07 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC judge Cunha lauded at farewell||John Michael Cunha, judge, High Court of Karnataka, who as a district judge had convicted former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa in a disproportionate assets case in 2014, retired from service on Tuesday after serving as a judge of the High Court for around four years. While addressing a farewell ceremony organised by the High Court and the Karnataka State Bar Council, High Court Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka lauded the service rendered by Judge Cunha while recalling the observations made by the Supreme Court in its verdict of upholding Ms. Jayalalithaa’s conviction. Citing the apex court’s observation that “...the Trial Court was meticulous, sensitive, vigilant and judicious in appraisal of evidences,” the Chief Justice said that such an observation by the apex court was a great honour for a judicial officer. He pointed out that Justice Cunha disposed of 216 cases, arising from the Special Court set up to deal with criminal cases against MPs and MLAs in Karnataka, within a short span of time. In his address, Judge Cunha recalled that for the first time in the history of the HC a written exam was conducted for selection to the post of district judges in 2001, and it was only because of that exam he could get into the judiciary. “Otherwise I could not have dreamt of it. These exams, which have now became regular as per the SC’s judgement, have not only brought transparency and objectivity in selection process but also paved the way for representation of diverse sections of the society who otherwise could not have become judges of the trial courts and the HC,” he said.

07 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Auto driver arrested for murdering his sister||The Baiyappanahalli railway police have arrested a 24-year-old autorickshaw driver who allegedly killed his younger sister early Saturday morning and then dumped the body on railway tracks. He tried to escape detection by telling his family that she had committed suicide. However, the accused, Kiran, was spotted by a witness carrying the body on his shoulder. The witness alerted the control room. A patrolling police team from Ramamurthy Nagar rushed to the spot. They extricated the body away from the tracks minutes before a goods train passed by. The police, after analysing CCTV footage, saw clips of the accused carrying the body on his shoulder and walking towards the railway tracks. “On further investigation, we discovered that his house is located about 500 metres away from the railway tracks,” said a police officer. Kiran allegedly stabbed his sister Mangala, 19, to death at 2 a.m. on Saturday outside their house. Her mother was sleeping inside and did not realise what had happened. Kiran told his family that his sister had committed suicide. He tried to leave the city soon after the funeral, but a police team was keeping tabs on him. They took him into custody where he allegedly confessed to the crime. Kiran, an auto driver by profession, also worked at a fish stall. “He was unhappy that his sister was friendly with multiple boys and tried to elope in the past. He claimed to be embarrassed by her behaviour. When she refused to listen to him, he murdered her,” said a senior police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/auto-driver-arrested-for-murdering-his-sister/article34258757.ece
07 April 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Eshwarappa issue may figure in core committee meeting on April 18||Though the tussle between senior Minister K.S. Eshwarappa and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is expected to be looked into by the party central leaders only in May as they are busy with the elections to State Assemblies, there is a likelihood of the issue coming up for discussion at the State core committee meeting on April 18. “The agenda is yet to be finalised. However, as Mr. Eshwarappa and Mr. Yediyurappa will be attending the meeting as core committee members, there is a possibility of the issue figuring,” observed a leader from the party. He, however, added that only the party central leadership could resolve the issue considering its seriousness as well as the seniority of leaders involved. The party high command is yet to focus on this contentious issue in Karnataka as it is occupied with the preparations for the ongoing Assembly elections in different States, he pointed out. “As of now, the ongoing polls are a political priority for the Central leadership. Hence, the Karnataka issue could be taken up only after completion of Assembly polls by this month-end,” he explained. Some leaders argue that if the Central leadership has to involve itself in government formation in any of the States going to polls, finding a resolution to the Karnataka tussle may get delayed further. Meanwhile, BJP national general secretary Arun Singh, who is also in-charge of Karnataka, is arriving in the State on a four-day visit on Thursday. But sources close to him made it clear that he would dedicate the visit to campaigning for byelections to Lok Sabha and Assembly seats and visiting all constituencies that are going to polls. But some leaders in the party State unit feel that Mr. Singh may give his feedback on the episode informally. The supporters of both Mr. Eshwarappa and the Chief Minister admit that the issue cannot be resolved without the intervention of the party high command as Mr. Eshwarappa has stirred up a hornet’s nest by complaining to the Governor and Prime Minister about “interference” by Mr. Yediyurappa in his departmental administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/eshwarappa-issue-may-figure-in-core-committee-meeting-on-april-18/article34258776.ece

07 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vaccinations to be ramped up to 70,000 a day, micro plan prepared||In the wake of the second wave and increasing case load in the city, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike is working towards doubling the vaccination rate to check the spread of COVID-19. At present, on an average, round 35,000 citizens are vaccinated in primary health centres (PHCs) and private medical facilities across the city every day. The BBMP has prepared a micro plan at the PHC level. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that two lakh vaccines had already been provided to the civic body. An additional one lakh will be provided shortly. This will help improve the vaccination rate, especially covering those aged above 45 years.  P. Rajendra Cholan, BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Health), said that the civic body was not able to ramp up vaccination earlier due to shortage of vaccines. “We need to have a buffer of at least 2 lakh vaccines at any given point of time. There was also demand from various private medical facilities who wanted to extend the time to facilitate vaccination of the working population,” he said. The additional vaccines now provided to BBMP will be disbursed accordingly to various PHCs and private medical establishments. “We had identified 8.5 lakh citizens aged above 60 years in the city. Of these, we have covered 5.5 lakh senior citizens. Similarly, there are nearly 20 lakh persons aged above 45 years,” said Mr. Cholan. He added that spot registration among this age group has seen an increase over the past few days in the various private hospitals. Hence, the hospitals had also sought an increase in vaccines and buffer stock in their facilities. This may mean that from 200-250 per day, the target could be enhanced to 500 a day per vaccination site (private hospitals). ASHA workers Meanwhile, Mr. Gupta said ASHA workers would be directed to identify beneficiaries from slums and other lower socio-economic areas and encourage them to get vaccinated. Mr. Cholan said the ASHA workers had been given a target of identifying at least five persons every day and bringing them to the nearest PHC or health sub-centre. “We are thinking of providing buses or tempos to bring the beneficiaries to the vaccination sites,” he said.  We need to have a buffer of at least two lakh vaccines at any given point of time. P.

07 April 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Congress leaders condemn Kateel’s remarks on Kharge||Taking serious exception to BJP State unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel’s remarks on Congress veteran M. Mallikarjun Kharge, former Minister Sharan Prakash Patil, former MLA B.R. Patil, former Parliamentarian K.B. Shanappa and other leaders said that Mr. Kateel’s language was a manifestation of his and his party’s culture. Responding to Mr. Kharge who had recently said that RSS and BJP ideology was poisonous to the country, Mr. Kateel had, at Kalaburagi Airport on Saturday, said that people defeated Mr. Kharge as he was poisonous. “Mr. Kateel’s remarks on Mr. Kharge show his culture. It shows his foolishness. Mr. Kharge had contributed a lot to the development of the Kalyana Karnataka region. Because of his efforts only, the region got Special Status under Article 371(J), ESIC medical complex and other several development projects. Mr. Kharge was defeated not because people did not like him, but because of hate and malicious propaganda spread by BJP. His defeat was the result of the BJP’s conspiracy to keep him away from the Parliament. Now, the people of Kalaburagi are regretting the defeat of the Congress veteran,” Mr. Sharan Prakash said, at a media conference in Kalaburagi on Monday. Mr. B.R. Patil said that BJP had always resorted to the character assassination of a person when it did not find any fault with them. He strongly justified Mr. Kharge’s stance on RSS and BJP ideology by stating that he would continue to repeat Mr. Kharge’s words. “Basing on his own experiences in India’s politics, Mr. Kharge had clearly said that RSS-BJP ideology was poisonous. Yes, it is. It is the poisonous ideology of RSS and BJP that has destroyed the secular fabrics of the nation. It is the ideology that has created enmity among the communities. Mr. Kharge was not the first to term RSS-BJP ideology as poisonous. Hundreds of scholars, intellectuals, social reformers and secular politicians have said and written a lot terming the RSS-BJP ideology as poisonous to the country. We could continue to repeat Mr. Kharge’s words,” he said. Mr. Shanappa, a former Rajya Sabha member, regretted being part of BJP for some time stating that his association with BJP was the biggest blunder in his long political career. Referring to the internal clashes in BJP and the verbal attacks unleashed against Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa by Basangouda Patil Yatnal and K.S. Eshwarappa, Allam Prabhu Patil, a Congress leader, advised Mr. Kateel to stop his party leaders from spitting poison against each other before pointing to the poisonous people in other parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-leaders-condemn-kateels-remarks-on-kharge/article34259060.ece

It has been given a free hand to investigate the case. I have personally directed SIT to be impartial and legitimate in its task. Everything is going on as per law. There is no question of protecting anybody in the case. Investigation is moving in the right direction to unearth the truth. There is no need to be apprehensive.

Yogeshwar has said. “We have decided to build heliports in major tourist destinations across the State to boost tourism. Kalyana Karnataka has good potential for development of tourism as it has many historical monuments. We have, therefore, included Kalaburagi in the list of places where we are going to build heliports,” Mr. Yogeshwar said during his interaction with mediapersons at the district administrative complex in Kalaburagi on Tuesday. When asked for details, the Minister said that Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubballi, Hampi and Mangaluru were the other places where heliports would be developed. “Just as an airport is for larger flights, a heliport is a permanent place for helicopter operations. It would be larger than a helipad and can accommodate four-five helicopters. We need a minimum of five acres to build a heliport. Each heliport would cost about Rs. 10 crore,” Mr. Yogeshwar said. Earlier in the day, the Minister held a meeting of senior officers in the city and discussed the possibility of tourism expansion in the city. With the inputs provided by people’s representatives and the officials, a few places, including Chandrampalli Dam, Amarja Dam, Bhosga Lake and Sonna Barrage, were identified for the development of tourism. “We have asked the local administration to prepare a detailed project report to develop tourism in these identified places. Infrastructure development is a prerequisite for the development of tourism in any place. We are, therefore, offering 15% of the project cost or Rs. 5 crore, whichever is lower, for those who come forward to build hotels in tourist destinations. There is a demand from people’s representatives from Kalyana Karnataka to increase the incentive to 25% and we will consider it,” he said. When asked about the government’s apathy to the development of Sannati, one of the major Buddhist sites in India, which was excavated by the Archaeological Survey of India, Tourism Department Secretary Pankaj Kumar Pandey said that his department would take up the issue with the Union government and try to add the ASI site in the country’s Buddhist Circuit.

07 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Private bus operators ready to serve people during strike||Karnataka State Private Bus Owners Association on Tuesday said that the strike by road transport corporation employees was not justified at a time when COVID-19 cases were increasing and students were preparing to write exams. Speaking to reporters in Udupi, association treasurer Kuiladi Suresh Nayak said that private operators, with 8,000 stage carriages, 20,000 maxi cabs and 4,000 all India Contract Carriage permit buses, would be ready to serve the people and support the government. Mr. Nayak said that RTCs employees strike would severely inconvenience the general public and there were other ways to register one’s protest. The government too reportedly had agreed to most of the demands of the employees and there was no reason for them to go on a strike. RTCs employees should have sorted out the issue through dialogue with the government, he added. The Dakshina Kannada Bus Owners Association too agreed to operate contract carriage buses on routes served by KSRTC buses on the basis of temporary permits issued by the Transport Department. Association president Dilraj Alva said that the Mangaluru Regional Transport Officer in a meeting here urged private operators to extend their cooperation on Tuesday. Contract carriage bus owners have agreed to provide services.  60:40 formula To prevent such strikes by RTCs employees, the government should adopt the 60:40 formula wherein RTCs operate 60% of services and private operators 40%, as in Tamil Nadu. This would help prevent strikes, he said and added that during the last strike, RTCs employees operated services in districts where private buses too were running and stopped services where they had monopoly. The Union government has amended the Motor Vehicles Act suitably to issue permits to private stage carriage buses, he added. Mr. Nayak said that the government offered lip-sympathy to public transport as it did not support private operators in any way. If the government provides for monthly advance tax payment instead of quarterly advance tax payment and reimburses at least 50% of expenses incurred towards offering concession to students, elderly and differenty abled, it would help private operators. Many State governments have allowed up to one year exemption in tax payment for public transport operators during COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/private-bus-operators-ready-to-serve-people-during-strike/article34259263.ece

Khader, former Minister and Mangaluru MLA, on Tuesday asked the city police to register a suo motu case of disturbing peace in the society against office-bearers of Bajrang Dal, who recently held press conference seeking law to stop ‘Love Jihad’. He said the office-bearers of Bajrang Dal held the meet on April 2 when the police arrested four of their activists in connection with the stabbing of a 23-year-old man and assault of the 23-year-old woman in Pumpwell Junction on April 1. Mr. Khader said the office-bearers falsely termed the incident as ‘Love Jihad’ and included few recent acts of vigilantism as action against Love Jihad. “How can organisations be allowed to hold such meets where they justify their activists taking law into their hands to stop love jihad. The office-bearers should be booked for breaching peace in the society,” he said, and added that he would shortly write a letter in this regard to Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai. Bajrang Dal Prant Sanchalak Sunil K.R. and Prant Sahasanchalak Muralikrishna Hansantadka addressed the conference on April 2 wherein they demanded laws on ‘Love Jihad’ and also claimed that their activists were being falsely targeted by the police. Mr. Khader said if Bajrang Dal and VHP wanted a law on love jihad, they could demand it by protesting against the State and Centre. “Let them protest. Instead, they are making innocent Bajrang Dal activists land in bars for the acts of vigilantism,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/book-suo-motu-case-against-bajrang-dal-says-khader/article34259278.ece
07 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Probe sought into Pachchanady fire||Opposition Congress leader in the council of Mangaluru City Corporation A.C. Vinayraj said on Tuesday that the government should conduct a thorough inquiry into the fire accident at the dry waste recycling unit (or plastic baling unit) of the corporation at Pachchanady on Sunday night. Addressing presspersons, he said that several lapses such as lack of water facility and fire fighting equipment at the unit site have been observed after the fire broke out. There was a borewell near the dumping yard. But its pump has been shifted elsewhere now. Hence, fire tenders could not get water immediately at the site. The ruling BJP in the council should own up the responsibility for the accident. Earlier, the corporation had prepared a detailed project report for setting up a modern solid waste processing plant at Pachchanady at an estimated cost of Rs. 12.5 crore. The administration in the council should take it forward to make the project a reality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/probe-sought-into-pachchanady-fire/article34259264.ece
07 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Judge says prima facie negligence on the part of agency may have caused fire||Senior Civil Judge and Member Secretary of Dakshina Kannada Legal Services Authority Shilpa A.G. said on Monday that prima facie the fire that broke out in the dry waste recycling unit of Mangaluru City Corporation at Pachchanady on Sunday night appeared to be due to negligence on the part of the agency outsourced by the corporation to manage the unit. Speaking after visiting the spot on an instruction by the State Legal Services Authority, she said that the agency had not taken enough precautionary measures to prevent fire accidents. If it had taken them, the accident would not have occurred, she added. The exact reason for the fire is still not known, though it is said that it was due to short circuit. There is no proper compound wall surrounding the unit, she said. The judge said that plastic material worth Rs. 65 lakh were reduced to ashes in the fire. Ms. Shilpa said that she visited the spot as the authority instructed her to submit a report on whether the fire created problems to the local people. During her visit, she sought information on the steps taken by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and the city corporation after the fire accident and whether the outsourced agency had followed the required guidelines. She said that the fire and the smoke that billowed from it created problems to the local people. The smoke was dangerous to environment. The city corporation should take steps to avoid such incidents in future. A representative of the outsourced agency told the judge that initially the fire was noticed on the premises of the unit and later it spread due to the wind. The shed and the machines got burnt in the fire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/judge-says-prima-facie-negligence-on-the-part-of-agency-may-have-caused-fire/article34259260.ece
07 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||NMPT signs pact with IOCL for enhanced fuel supply to ships||The New Mangalore Port Trust (NMPT) has geared up to supply enhanced quality of fuel to ships visiting the harbour as well as ships on anchorage/offshore as the port signed an agreement with the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., (IOCL) to this effect here on Tuesday. It had invited tenders from firms for supplying bunker fuel for five years and IOCL, Bengaluru, won the bid by offering the highest minimum volume of bunker offered by a firm. Through bunkering, it supplies fuel to ships that includes shipboard logistics of loading fuel and distributing among available bunker tanks. Port chairman A.V. Ramana told The Hindu last financial year that the IOCL had supplied 43,000 tonnes of fuel while the new agreement provides for supply of minimum 90,000 tonnes of fuel for bunkering. The enhanced volume was promised despite the port facing two main hindrances – 5% GST collected even from foreign vessels and Customs Clearance to provide bunkering. Customs Clearance was not insisted on at the Kochi Port. If GST and Customs Clearance were waived off, the port could supply more fuel, he said. It intended to provide all the required facilities to the shipping community in general and to port users in particular in a phased manner. NMPT explored the possibilities of improving the facilities in the service sector especially in shipping and in line with the guidelines and directives received from the Ministry of Ports Waterways and Shipping. Based on the present policy of the Centre, NMPT initiated action to identify infrastructure projects and found that the bunkering facilities for ocean-going vessels and coastal vessels would enhance the services since the port was located on the trunk route.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nmpt-signs-pact-with-iocl-for-enhanced-fuel-supply-to-ships/article34259276.ece
07 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Orphanage warden arrested for sexually assaulting four boys||The police on Tuesday arrested Ayub (52), a warden (ustad) of an Yateem Khana (an orphanage) under Ullal Police limits, on the charge of sexually abusing four minor boys. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar told reporters here that the incident came to light after a recent day-long awareness programme on child abuse organised for residents of 37 child care centres in the city. The programme was organised at the T.M.A. Pai Convention Hall on March 28 by the police in association with K.S. Hedge Medical Academy, the School of Social Work, Roshni Nilaya, the Child Welfare Centre and the Women and Child Development Department. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar said that over 480 students from child care institutions took part in the programme. Students were given a set of questions and based on their answers, some children underwent counselling. Mr. Kumar said that a 14-year-old boy from the district was among those who underwent counselling. “Initially, the boy said that the warden does not behave with him properly. After subsequent counselling sessions by experts, the boy revealed sexual assault by the warden,” he said. Then more than 50 boys in the Yateem Khana underwent counselling and this revealed that three more boys were victims of sexual abuse by Ayub. These children have been abused for the last two months. The police have registered a case against Ayub under the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Mr. Shankar will investigate the case, Mr. Kumar said. The Police Commissioner said that the programme revealed 20 instances of abuse and other harassment faced by children at six child care institutions. “These children are being counselled further. More details will be sought in an effort to get to know the nature of abuse they faced,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/orphanage-warden-arrested-for-sexually-assaulting-four-boys/article34259271.ece

07 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Spices Board inks deal with UNDP to develop blockchain-powered traceability interface||The Spices Board India has inked a memorandum of understanding with UNDP India’s Accelerator Lab to build a blockchain-based traceability interface for Indian spices to enhance transparency in supply chain and trade. Blockchain is a decentralised process of recording transactions on an open and shared electronic ledger. “This allows for ease and transparency in data management across a complex network, including farmers, brokers, distributors, processors, retailers, regulators, and consumers, thus simplifying the supply chain. It will allow farmers just as all other members of the supply chain to access the information, which further makes the entire supply chain more efficient and equitable,” according to a statement released by Spices Board India from New Delhi. The UNDP and Spices Board India are working towards integrating the blockchain traceability interface with the e-spice Bazaar portal developed by the board for connecting spice farmers with markets. Design of blockchain interface is expected to be completed by May 2021. The project will be piloted with more than 3,000 farmers engaged in chilli and turmeric farming in select districts of Andhra Pradesh, the press statement said. “India is the largest export, producer and consumer of spices in the world. India’s spices export crossed a milestone of 3 billion USD during 2019-20 and our estimates indicate that we would cross that milestone and achieve a new high during 2020-21,” the statement quoting Secretary of Spices Board India D. Sathiyan said. The changing order in the global spices and food sector has increased the relevance of infrastructure development for value addition, certification for quality and food safety, implementation of traceability systems etc. and the board has been working to provide support to the stakeholders of the sector and to strengthen the supply chain so as to position India as the premier destination for clean and safe spices, the statement added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/spices-board-inks-deal-with-undp-to-develop-blockchain-powered-traceability-interface/article34258791.ece
07 April 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Tobacco farmers seek increase in crop size||Farmers in Karnataka have urged the Tobacco Board to enhance the crop size for tobacco in the State to 99 million kg and increase the quota for each barn to 1,750 kg. In a letter dated April 5, 2021, to Chairman of Tobacco Board, Guntur, president of Federation of VFC Tobacco Growers’ Associations of Karnataka Javare Gowda pointed out that tobacco farmers in Karnataka were growing around 100 million kg every year as per the allotted quota. During 2020-21, the Board initially fixed a crop size of 99 million kg, but soon brought it down to 88 million kg in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised ceiling on tobacco production saw the quota for each barn plummet from 1,750 kg to 1,558 kg. Pointing out that tobacco was grown in rain-fed areas and their output varies from 1,750 kg to 2,000 kg per barn depending on the rainfall patterns, Mr. Gowda said the cost of cultivation and overhead expenditure incurred on each barn will be same irrespective of the quantity produced. Hence, the cost incurred by the farmers on each kg of cured tobacco went up significantly in view of the reduced quota during 2020-21. The farmers, who produced in excess of the quota were penalied and forced to cough up the fine amount. “Any authorised quota less than 1,750 kg per barn is unsustainable to the farmers,” Mr. Gowda said. Tobacco cultivation in Karnataka is spread across Mysuru and parts of Hassan and Chamarajanagar district. “In our region, we don’t have any alternate crop as remunerative as tobacco,” he said while pointing out that several farmers, who had experimented with ginger and maize last year had suffered huge losses. Hence, Mr. Gowda has urged the board to fix the crop size at 99 million kgs and allow the barn quota to be restored to 1,750 kg.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tobacco-farmers-seek-increase-in-crop-size/article34259289.ece

Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi who conducted a video conference with various officials instructed that additional private buses be introduced for the benefit of the public. The State-wide strike is expected to cause repercussions even in the district and hence the district administration should ensure that alternative transportation was in place, said Mr. Ravi. The officials were instructed to ensure that the COVID-19 protocols were in place and routes that are highly patronised by the public, should be accorded priority in deployment of additional services, he added. The special arrangement will be in place till the strike was withdrawn and temporary permits to operate on different routes will be issued to private operators. The district administration has also warned the private operators against fleecing the public. Those found guilty of fleecing passengers will be prosecuted and the vehicles will be seized, warned the authorities. Similarly, the private operators should honour the bus passes issued by the KSRTC in case of students travelling to their respective educational institutions, said Mr. Ravi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/additional-private-buses-to-run-in-chamarajanagar/article34259291.ece
07 April 2021||Yadgir,KARNATAKA||Woman injured; bags of groundnut destroyed||Monday evening’s unanticipated heavy rain accompanied by gusty winds has caused extensive damage, particularly in Yadgir city. Farmers are facing the threat of loss as groundnut in several thousands of bags that were kept on the APMC Yard for selling are almost inundated. Officials were supposed to complete the tender process on Monday. But, the heavy rain has almost damaged the foodgrains. “There are more than 7,000 bags that farmers brought groundnuts in to sell them. Officials have been asked to analyse the damage as farmers are saying that almost all of them (7,000 bags) are inundated or have been washed away in rainwater,” Deputy Commissioner R. Ragapriya told The Hindu here on Tuesday. When asked about compensation, she said that after getting a detailed report from APMC officials, she would send a requisition to the State government to release compensation for damage. The city went without power supply for several hours from evening as electricity poles were uprooted and cables were damaged in gusty winds. “The restoration works have been completed and now there is no interruption in power supply,” Dr. Ragapriya said. Meanwhile, local MLA Venkatareddy Mudnal, City Municipal Council Chairman Vilas Patil and CMC Commissioner B.T. Nayak visited the CMC office, Subhas Chowk, the railway station area, Basaveshwar Nagar, Lakshmi Nagar and APMC Yard. Due to gusty winds, the roof of the meeting hall located in the first floor of the CMC building collapsed and several equipment, including chairs, have been damaged. “Approximately, property worth around Rs. 20 lakh-Rs. 30 lakh have suffered damage in rain. However, an accurate figure after assessment by officials,” Mr. Patil said. He also said that storm-water drains that were blocked by mud and used material such as empty bottles were cleared on Tuesday morning to let rainwater to flow easily. A woman, who was present near Subhas Chowk where a portion of a compound wall collapsed damaging at least 10 two-wheelers, has suffered injuries on the back of her neck and in her leg. She was identified as Sabamma. She has been taken to the District Hospital where her condition is stated to be stable.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Govt., RTC staff spar over salary revision||At the crux of the indefinite strike proposed by the Road Transport Corporation employees, starting Wednesday, is the demand for salary revision, which the government says is impossible to meet at the present juncture. Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar, speaking to media persons after a meeting on the issue with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Tuesday, categorically said that “there was no question of treating RTC employees like other State government employees and implementing Sixth Pay Commission”. Instead, he announced that the State government has finalised a pay hike of 8% to all RTC employees which will be implemented either after the bypolls or subject to permission from the Election Commission of India, immediately. However, the protesting RTC employees rejected this offer and accused the State government of “going back on its word”. “Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi had given it to us in writing that the State government will implement Sixth Pay Commission during our protests in December 2020, which the government is now going back on,” said Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, honorary president, KSRTC Employees’ League. He also criticised Mr. Savadi for being away on campaign when the RTCs are going on an indefinite strike. “The Sixth Pay Commission was never on our agenda. When we asked for RTC employees to be taken on government rolls, it was the government that suggested implementing Sixth Pay Commission,” said R. Chandrashekhar, president of the league. However, Mr. Ravi said RTCs have been reeling under severe losses already, also due to the reduction in ridership since last year due to the pandemic. “All RTCs combined, the government incurs a loss of Rs. 4 crore everyday. However, the government has been considerate and has provided Rs. 2,100 crore in the last one year to RTCs and ensured all employees are paid salaries on time. In this light, we appeal to RTC employees to be considerate and not go on strike,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-rtc-staff-spar-over-salary-revision/article34258773.ece

(BMRCL), was on Tuesday appointed the new Economic Affairs Secretary. The appointment at the Centre came on the day BMRCL was carrying out a trial run on the eagerly-awaited extension of the Purple Line. Mr. Seth, a 1987 batch Karnataka cadre IAS officer, had taken over the reins of BMRCL in July 2018 from Mahendra Jain. He has been credited with several milestones of Namma Metro. The latest was the launch of the extended Green Line on Kanakapura Road in January this year, bringing huge relief for a large number of residents near the 6-km line from Yelachenahalli to Silk Institute. Last July, tunnel work under Namma Metro Phase II was started after a long delay, with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa inaugurating the work at Cantonment Metro station. Under Phase II, the BMRCL plans to construct a 13.9-km underground line from Jayanagar Fire Station to Nagawara. The alignment will have 12 underground stations and 10.37 km of twin tunnels. Land acquisition for the airport line received a push during his tenure. In January 2019, the State government approved a plan to extend the metro from K.R. Puram to KIA via Nagawara, Hebbal. In November 2020, the BMRCL informed that it had acquired 59,103 square metres of land at a cost of Rs. 569 crore for the ORR line from Silk Board to K.R. Puram. For the K.R. Puram to KIA line, it is spending Rs. 2,100 crore for 3.17 lakh square metres of land. Mr. Seth was unavailable for comments. Earlier, in January 2018, 1985-batch Karnataka cadre IAS officer Pradeep Singh Kharola took over as the CMD of Air India when the government had started the process for its strategic disinvestment. He had been the managing director of BMRCL since February 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmrcl-md-gets-central-posting/article34258760.ece

Victims can launch a complaint on a call, and the police will work with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to freeze the beneficiary’s account within the golden period of two hours. A pilot project was launched in the last week of December 2020 and has been deemed a success. “It is a novel, people-friendly system where we try to give immediate relief for victims of cybercrime, especially financial fraud, for the first time in the country,” said Kamal Pant, Commissioner, Bengaluru City Police. A victim of online financial fraud has to call 112 and raise a complaint, giving available details. This is registered as a Cybercrime Incident Report (CIR) and transferred to a panel of cybercrime investigators in the CIR cell at the control room, which is networked with Reserve Bank of India and a host of other banks. “Most times, the victims provide us with the phone number from which they got a call or an SMS, using which we try to track the beneficiary’s bank account. A report is shared with the RBI and, if we know, the bank concerned. RBI has designed an SOP for the project, fixing the golden period as two hours, within which the banks have to act and freeze the beneficiary’s account,” said Isha Pant, DCP, Command Centre. “The golden hour is important as the account has to be frozen before the money is withdrawn or spent,” she said, adding that it is an evolving process. “If the money is found in the account, the victim needs to lodge an FIR and access the money through a court order,” she said. Presently, as part of the pilot project, the CIR cell has five dedicated lines and 20 cybercrime investigators working in three shifts. “All calls to the control room reporting cybercrime are transferred to the cell,” Ms. Pant said.  It is a novel, people-friendly system where we try to give immediate relief for victims of cybercrime, especially financial fraud, for the first time in the country Kamal Pant, Commissioner, Bengaluru City Police||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-system-to-report-cybercrime-to-be-launched/article34258756.ece

07 April 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||74.75% cast their votes in Alappuzha||High voter turnout and minor issues marked the Assembly elections in the district on Tuesday. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, 74.75% of the total 17.82 lakh electorate exercised their right to vote when the polling closed at 7 p.m. The voting percentage is likely to go up as the Election Commission has not yet released the final figures. Among the nine constituencies, Cherthala recorded the highest voter turnout with about 80.74% exercising their franchise. It is followed by Aroor (80.42%), Alappuzha (76.31%), Ambalappuzha (74. 71%), Haripad (74. 25%), Kayamkulam (73.35%), Kuttanad (72.25%), Mavelikara (71.18%) and Chengannur (69.10%). In the 2016 Assembly polls, the district registered a voter turnout of 79.84%. The voting started at 7 a.m. on a brisk note with 11.58% turnout in the first two hours. Issues with voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines in a few booths, including Kizhakkekara in the Haripad constituency, Vettakkal in Cherthala, Eramalloor in Aroor, Eera in Kuttanad and Puthiyavila in Kayamkulam slightly delayed the polling in these places. By noon, 41.99 voters exercised their franchise in the district. However, cloudy skies and rain that lashed parts of the district in the afternoon dampened the spirit of voters. Sharngadharan (Podikochu), 60, of Thrikkunnapuzha, collapsed and died at Pathiyankara, near Thrikkunnapuzha, allegedly after seeing a clash between the Left Democratic Front and United Democratic Front workers. A polling officer and a few voters sustained injuries in a stray dog attack at Thalavady. A polling officer who failed to turn up for election duty at a polling booth at Thalavady was arrested. A person who came to cast vote at a booth at Kalarcode wearing helmet was not allowed to vote after he refused to remove it. Officials said that barring minor issues, the polling was peaceful and largely incident-free Important voters Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, Public Works Minister G.

He was speaking to reporters after casting his vote at a polling booth at Kanichukulangara, near Cherthala. ‘Inappropriate time’ On Nair Service Society general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair's comments that people expect a change, Mr. Natesan said the NSS leader had made the remark at an inappropriate time. He should have expressed his opinion before the polling day. The SNDP Yogam general secretary said he could not say whether the Left Democratic Front would retain power or not in the State. “The SNDP Yogam has not supported a particular front in the polls. The BJP has improved its performance, but it does not mean the party will win more seats,” Mr. Natesan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cant-say-if-ldf-will-retain-power-natesan/article34259225.ece

He was speaking to mediapersons after casting his vote at booth number 51 at Mannarasala Upper Primary School in Haripad. “The people of the State expect a change of guard. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government is enmeshed in corruption and has destroyed the State in the past five years. People are disenchanted with the arrogance and anti-people policies of the government. Both the LDF and the Bharatiya Janata Party will be uprooted in the UDF wave,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-will-make-a-historic-win-chennithala/article34259190.ece
07 April 2021||Bonacaud,KERALA||The dwindling votes of Bonacaud||It is not yet noon, and the occasional breeze is the only relief from the heat at booth number 24 at the Government Upper Primary School, Bonacaud, in the Aruvikkara Assembly constituency. A few hundred metres back on the road along the school is a post office that spells the name of the place as Bonaccord. It is, however, known as Bonacaud among the local people. The history of Bonacaud is linked to the present through workers of tea plantations here that closed down two decades ago. The plantations were maintained by people whose forefathers had been brought from Tamil Nadu. After the factory downed shutters, some of them moved back to their home State — an estimated 150 of the 791 voters here. However, each election, they had been back, with some facilitation by party workers. This Assembly election, though, has been different. But for a handful who have relatives here, they did not turn up for voting. Political parties that usually competed to bring maximum number of the former estate workers by arranging vehicles did not do so this time as it would have been an expensive proposition during the pandemic, not to mention one without any guarantee of securing votes. Some of the settlers’ names have also been removed from the voters’ list over the years as they have moved out for good. Those who shifted to Vithura or Aanapara or other places in search of employment form a good chunk of the voters here presently. Then, there are some 115 families with 220-odd voters here. MGNREGS succour Sudharma, who now resides at Peroorkada, is among those who came to the polling station at Bonacaud to cast her vote. She had shifted to the hilly range after her marriage, and used to pick tea leaves at a plantation. Ever since it was closed down, she had been earning her livelihood thanks to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Pushpathai and Chellathai also depend on the MGNREGS to eke out a living. They say they have gratuity and other benefits for years of work they put in, not to mention the 34 months they toiled without pay.“With what we earn and government support, we are making do,” says Pushpathai who lives here with her husband in the company quarters. If the company pays what they are due, the house will be surrendered, she says. An estimated 300 people who had shifted out in search of better opportunities, were expected to cast their votes. The booth witnessed brisk polling, and by 1 p.m., more than 380 people had voted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/the-dwindling-votes-of-bonacaud/article34259360.ece

The Nedumkandam police have registered cases against 12 persons for casting double votes. Nedumkandam Circle Inspector Suresh said that cases were registered against the persons under Cr.PC 151. They were waylaid by Bharatiya Janata Party workers while on their way to Tamil Nadu in a jeep. Tension prevailed at Cumbom Mettu where Congress workers blocked a vehicle alleging that it carried people from Tamil Nadu who were on their way to cast votes in Kerala after casting votes in Tamil Nadu. On the border check-posts, Central forces had been deployed to prevent cross-border voting. There were 1,292 booths in the five Assembly constituencies in the district, including those in remote forest areas in the Devikulam and Peerumade constituencies. The remotest polling booth of Pachakanam inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve had only 29 voters. In some polling stations, especially in the Idukki and Thodupuzha constituencies, there were long queues of voters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/polling-near-peaceful-in-idukki/article34259224.ece

According to preliminary reports, 74.97 % of voters cast their ballot in Wayanad district. The district witnessed a high voter turnout. The percentage in the Kalpetta constituency was 74.3 %, in Sulthan Bathery 74.29 % and in Mananthavady 76.43 %. In the 2016 Assembly polls, Kalpetta constituency witnessed 78.48% polling, Sulthan Bathery 78.32% and Mananthavady 77.67 %. The district recorded 23.18% polling by 10.15 a.m. The polling percentage rose to 70.01% by 5 p.m., according to District Collector Adeela Abdulla. The polling percentage is likely to increase as the State Election Commission is yet to release the final figures. No untoward incident was reported in the district, Aravind Sukumar, Superintendent of Police, told The Hindu . Polling was peaceful and largely incident-free, barring minor technical snags in Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) at a few polling booths, Mr. Sukumar said. The machines were promptly replaced and voting continued uninterrupted. Despite the COVID-19 threat, voters, including tribespeople and plantation workers, turned out in large numbers in the early morning and formed long queues outside polling booths in various parts of the district. Elaborate security arrangements had been made by the police for the smooth conduct of elections. Paramilitary and police forces were deployed in 124 booths which were identified as Left Wing Extremists (LWE) affected booths and three-level security measures were in place in these booths. In Mananthavady, former minister and UDF candidate P.K. Jayalakshmi cast her vote at Edathana Tribal Government School. NDA candidate in the Sulthan Bathery C.K.

07 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Enthusiasm marks polling in city, suburbs||Braving the summer heat and scare of the second wave of the pandemic, voters of Kochi enthusiastically exercised their franchise on Tuesday. While voters queued up at booths right from the initial hours in the city, it was a slow-paced affair in the suburbs. Polling was peaceful, and no untoward incidents were reported. Barring stray cases of technical snags in electronic voting machines (EVMs) at a few booths, polling by and large remained uninterrupted. Though voting was disrupted for half-an-hour at Girls’ High School, Pathalam, following EVM snag, it resumed after the machine was replaced. Health officials and student police cadre dutifully checked voters’ body temperature and gave them hand sanitisers before allowing entry to booths. Additional booths Though auxiliary booths were functional on the directions of the Election Commission, long queues of voters were seen at several centres in the city. Voters patiently waited for their turn even as senior citizens were allowed to cast vote without waiting in queues. Polling began at a slow pace in the West Kochi area. After two-and-a-half hours of polling, only 10% of voters turned up at St. Thomas Girls’ High School, Perumanoor. Polling progressed at a snail’s pace at Our Lady’s Convent, Palluruthy, too. Armed with automatic guns, members of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) guarded booths at the station. There was a high turnout of voters at St. Joseph’s High School, Chullikkal. Meanwhile, voter response in the forenoon session was not encouraging at M.M. Oriental Vocational Higher Secondary School, Panayappally, which used to witness long queues in the previous elections. However, more than half the number of voters turned up at St. Philomena’s High School, Koonammavu, by 12 noon. COVID protocol Police personnel overseeing polling at Government Upper Primary School, Valluvally, had a tough time making voters maintain physical distancing. Throwing caution to the winds, voters stood close to one another. The station witnessed nearly 40% polling by noon. Voter inflow, however, picked up in the evening. The final hour of polling, between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m., was reserved for COVID-19 patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/enthusiasm-marks-polling-in-city-suburbs/article34259173.ece
07 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Thripunithura segment witnesses heavy polling||Seventy-year-old Gauthami emerged from the polling booth at SNVSUPS, Eroor, in Thripunithura Assembly constituency a sweaty and frustrated soul. She had taken her place in the queue right at the beginning of polling only to be told that she will have to wait as the electronic voting machine has developed a snag even before a single vote was cast. Eventually, the machine was replaced and polling started at around 8.15 a.m. Gauthami was among the large number of voters who turned up at polling booths across Thripunithura Assembly constituency which witnessed a brisk start to polling. ‘Clichéd analysis’ Returning after casting his vote at his home district Malappuram, Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate M. Swaraj said that the clichéd analysis that heavy voter turnout indicates a potential United Democratic Front (UDF) victory no longer makes any sense. “In fact, it is a sign of people’s desire to see a return of the LDF government,” he said while alleging that the sudden appearance of posters in the name of Sabarimala Karma Samiti on the eve of polling urging voters to defeat the LDF by not voting for the BJP was the handiwork of UDF candidate K. Babu who during the course of his campaign had staked claim to BJP votes. That the Samiti had disowned the posters is proof of that, Mr. Swaraj said. Mr. Babu, however, shot down the allegations as baseless and of little consequence before exuding confidence of a victory on emerging out after casting his vote at Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Thripunithura. Chandran, an LDF worker manning the party booth just outside the polling booth, however, predicted a defeat for Mr. Babu going as far as saying that this will turn out to be the last electoral battle for the veteran Congress leader. Kaladharan, a voter outside the polling booth at SUVSUPS, Eroor, however, had no doubt about a UDF victory. “This constituency has seen no development other than what brought about by Mr. Babu,,” he said. A little away at the polling booth at Pottayil Temple, a Kudumbashree worker in her green uniform said that she wanted to see Mr. Swaraj win but can’t say as much while on duty. Solitary look A BJP booth in the neighbourhood cut a solitary look except for one activist, Surendran, who predicted a victory for party candidate K.S. Radhakrishnan who, he said, will garner in excess of 60,000 votes. Rifling through the voter’s list, Joby, an activist at an LDF polling booth, said it was too early to draw any conclusion. Holding on to his autistic child outside the polling booth at St. Josephs LPS, Kodamkulangara, Babu was nonchalant when asked for his prediction in the electoral battle. “Let anyone win,” was all he had to say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thripunithura-segment-witnesses-heavy-polling/article34259169.ece
07 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||A section of Chellanam residents boycott election||Joyce Babu, a housewife from Kannamali along the coastal belt of the Kochi Assembly constituency, was among those who chose to boycott the election as a mark of protest under the aegis of Kochi Chellanam Janakeeya Vedhi. And, the reason for her boycott could be seen right next to her house along a fully collapsed seawall that hardly serves the purpose of keeping marauding sea waves from surging into households in the neighbourhood during every high tide. “All political parties have shared power but have failed to offer us any respite from our nightmare. All they have given us over the years have been empty promises. Why should we even bother to vote for people who don’t care for us?” asked 55-year-old Ms. Babu who has been living there for 25 years now. Metilda Cleetus, another housewife from Saudi, also boycotted the poll on same grounds. She is unsparing of political parties’ alleged apathy towards the plight of coastal people who frequently have to move to relief camps with little privacy with their grown-up girls and toddlers every time the sea breaches the coast. “For someone who had never wasted a single vote, it was with a heavy heart that I decided to forgo my voting right for the first time,” said Ms. Cleetus. Hunger strike Kochi Chellanam Janakeeya Vedhi has been on a relay hunger strike for 520 days now, demanding a solution to sea erosion by erecting seawall and groynes. The protest has since been shifted from a roadside pandal to individual households in compliance with the COVID-19 protocol. “Initially, nearly 2,300 people had planned to boycott the election, but quite a few succumbed to pressures from political parties and even the Church. Yet, over 1,000 might have boycotted it,” said Jayan Kunnel, working president of the organisation. Dredging He added that the organisation had for long been asking for a simple solution of depositing sediments and soil dredged by the Cochin Port Trust along the Chellanam coast. “That will help reduce the depth along the coast, thereby softening the intensity of sea erosion. That is a simple relief possible with an executive order, and following it up with erecting groynes to retain sediments from getting washed away will offer a permanent solution,” said Mr. Kunnel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-section-of-chellanam-residents-boycott-election/article34259166.ece
07 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Piravom witnesses heavy turnout||The Piravom Assembly constituency which witnessed a keen three-cornered contest saw a voter turnout of 72.46% when polling ended at 7 p.m. on Tuesday. Though voting started on a tepid note in the morning, it gained momentum by noon. In fact, most booths did not have long queues, as auxiliary booths had been readied in view of the COVID-19 situation. Interestingly, members of the Haritha Karma Sena and civil defence volunteers gave guidance to voters at several booths. Meanwhile, voting was peaceful in the five sensitive booths at Irumpanam. There was a huge turnout at these booths, which had a heavy presence of Central forces. Sitting MLA and Kerala Congress (Jacob) leader Anoop Jacob is the UDF candidate in Piravom, while Sindhumol Jacob of the Kerala Congress (M) is the LDF candidate. M. Ashish is the NDA candidate. Anoop Jacob had won the seat in 2016 by a margin of 6,195 votes. At the end of polling, both LDF and UDF workers remained hopeful of victory. Mr. Jacob said he was confident of winning by a handsome majority. Playing down the allegation that the UDF was in cahoots with the BJP, he said the LDF had been raising such charges out of fear of defeat. Sindhumol Jacob too exuded confidence that she would win the seat. M. Ashish, NDA candidate, said the front was expected to garner around 30,000 votes this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/piravom-witnesses-heavy-turnout/article34259171.ece

After taking a fleeting look at the arrangements at the polling station, she approached the polling officer inside the booth to cast her first vote. “After pressing the button of the electronic voting machine, I waited for a few seconds to hear the beep sound emanating it, as instructed by my mother yesterday, to complete the voting,” said Ms. Sneha, who was seen waiting outside the polling station with her mother. “Most of my friends have turned 19. Yet, no one has enrolled themselves as voters,” said Ms. Sneha, a B.Com student of St. Paul’s College, Kalamassery. “There is no political activity on the campus,” she said. For A.B.

There were no untoward incidents or disruption of polling at any booths.

The actor did not meet newspersons who were on the premises of the booth to take his photographs. The incident took place around 11.30 a.m. at Booth 63 A at the school but was resolved quickly without affecting the voting process. Sitting MLA and UDF candidate P.T.

The constituency is witnessing an intense contest, with the three fronts and Kitex-sponsored Twenty20 fielding candidates. V.P. Sajeendran, two-time MLA, who is contesting as the UDF candidate for a third time, said the high voter turnout was a consequence of the UDF’s spirited campaigning. “All workers have been active. We set out to stubbornly prevent the rise of Twenty20. The LDF camp turned silent in the face of Twenty20’s presence,” he said. “We expected a turnout between 70% and 80%. The high turnout is a good sign,” said LDF candidate P.V. Sreenijin. On whether the LDF camp had indeed been subdued this time, Mr. Sreenijin said, “Let us wait for May 2.” “There is a section of voters who are fed up with the two political fronts and would like to see Twenty20 win for a change,” said Sujith Surendran, Twenty20 candidate. Renu Suresh, BJP candidate from the constituency, said, “We have received a good response from voters and are hoping they have voted for a change.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kunnathunad-registers-highest-turnout-of-women-voters/article34259161.ece

07 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||A day’s work for six votes in Kunnathunad||A tiny booth in Kunnathunad did not see any long queues on Tuesday, with a total of just six voters casting their ballot. Nestled in a quiet spot among rubber trees at Varikoli is a leprosarium located a few metres uphill from the Kochi-Dhanushkodi national highway. Four residents of the leprosarium, one member of the administrative staff at the institution, and sixth voter whose name happened to be on the list, voted at the booth. The Salvation Army runs the institution. The Ernakulam District Information office confirmed that the booth, with 13 voters on the list, is the smallest in the district. Of the seven names on the list who did not vote three voters have passed away and their names have not been removed, the other two are voters from outside the institution whose names are on the list, another person had deleted the name but his name still featured on the list, and the last was a bedridden patient who couldn’t make it to the booth, said Limu E.K., receptionist and a polling official. Though the patients had voted in the morning, polling officials had to keep the booth open till the designated time. “A separate booth was set up here when the institution used to house over 200 patients who could not step outside to vote. But that number has dwindled now,” said Annie Roby, the presiding officer at the booth. Booth officials Ms. Annie is also the staff nurse at the leprosarium. “Polling booth officials are usually staff members here,” she said. Since they are required to be at the booth, staff members are often unable to cast their votes. A webcasting facility was also set up here. Patients who voted are all over 70 years old.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-days-work-for-six-votes-in-kunnathunad/article34259327.ece

Jayaraj that a bogus vote was cast allegedly with the help of polling officials. Police intervene The complaint was filed with the polling officer at Booth Number 77, East Kadungalloor LP School.

07 April 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Voters turn up in good numbers in Kollam||Despite the scorching sun and threat of COVID-19, voters turned up in large numbers to exercise their franchise in the 3,213 polling booths arranged across the 11 Assembly segments in Kollam. The final polling percentage of the district stood at 73.07, which is lower compared to the 75.07 during the 2016 polls. It includes 72.54% votes by male voters, 73.56% by female voters and 31.25% by transpersons. The Karunagapally constituency recorded the highest polling, closely followed by Chavara and Kunnathur. The voter turnout at various constituencies is: Chavara (76.09), Punalur (69.28), Chadayamangalam (70.72), Kundara (73.92), Kollam (72.12), Pathanapuram (72.05), Kottarakara (72.23), Kunnathur (75.22), Eravipuram (70.57) and Chathannur (72.24). The district had reported 7.83% voter turnout during the first hour of polling, which steadily increased and hit 39.61% around noon. At 1.30 p.m., the polling percentage reached 48.30%. Though long queues were seen in many parts in the morning, afternoon hours saw a lull. But the polling picked up pace after 3 p.m. and stood at 69.71% around 5.15 p.m. Glitch-free No incident of bogus voting was reported in the district and in all places polling progressed without any serious glitch all through the day. Despite the district recording a 2% dip in the overall voting percentage, both the fronts seem hopeful about the results. According to the Left Democratic Front (LDF) leadership, Kollam is all set for a repeat of 2016 when the Left front won all the 11 segments. “The welfare and development initiatives of the LDF government were well accepted by the voters. There was no anti-incumbency sentiment and the crowd at campaign meetings promises a resounding victory for the Left,” said S. Sudevan, CPI(M) district secretary. The United Democratic Front (UDF) is equally optimistic as they believe that the front will win 75% seats in the district. “Despite having 11 MLAs and two Ministers, Kollam saw no comprehensive development in the past five years. This time the voters will rectify the mistake they made in 2016,” said District Congress Committee president Punalur Madhu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/voters-turn-up-in-good-numbers-in-kollam/article34259231.ece

07 April 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Fall in polling in Kottayam||Notwithstanding the high-octane campaign that the region witnessed over a period of three weeks, Kottayam recorded a notable decrease in voter turnout in the Assembly elections held on Tuesday. As per the records of the Election Commission of India (EC), the provisional polling percentage was 72.08 when polling ended by 7 p.m. This marks a nearly 5% decline in the overall polling percentage of 76.90 recorded in 2016.

07 April 2021||Kottoor,KERALA||At Kottoor settlements, it’s still a long trek to cast the vote||Aruviyan Kani had begun his trek to the polling station from his home at Pothode, deep inside the Agasthya forest reserve, at around 6 a.m. on Tuesday. Close to 9 a.m., he arrived drenched in sweat at the single-teacher school in Podiyam, which serves as the polling booth to 440 people living in a clutch of tribal settlements in these forests. "Hardly any road exists after this point. A few jeep services do run once in a while, but considering the condition of the roads, you might reach faster if you walk. Three years ago, we got power in our households, thanks to the total electrification programme, but the local ward members or the MLAs over the years have not taken any interest in making these roads motorable. We usually come out of the forests only twice a week for the market in Kottoor. But after the pandemic, even that has not been functioning regularly. My daughter, a degree student, is staying at a hostel in the city," says Kani. The voters are somewhat used to the long walks, which are part of their daily lives, but for the polling officials, it can be a different ballgame, especially when they have to provide regular updates on the polling percentage to the Election Commission. "We have no network coverage, but need to provide periodic updates. Luckily, we found a spot high up a hill nearby from where we can send the information. So, we head there frequently,” a sectoral officer says. Banking on bus A few kilometres further down is the polling booth set up at a forest office in Kottoor. Many voters from high up the hills depend on a KSRTC bus that arrives at 7 a.m. to access the booths. However, with the bus not turning up on Tuesday, some of the political parties arranged vans. A few of them reach the bus stop after long treks through the forests.   However, things have improved a bit. But the pace of the change has not been in sync with the aspirations of the people here, many of whom from the younger generation have now settled closer to the towns for the sake of convenience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/at-kottoor-settlements-its-still-a-long-trek-to-cast-the-vote/article34259364.ece
07 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Webcasting enables flawless surveillance of 1,828 booths||The webcasting facility operated by the Information Technology Mission ensured flawless surveillance of 1,828 polling booths, including hypersensitive and vulnerable ones, in Kozhikode district on Tuesday. Along with the IT Mission team, District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao was also present at the district-level control room to monitor the live visuals and give instant instructions to the team members. The City and Rural police were given two dedicated control rooms for viewing the live visuals from various hypertensive and vulnerable booths in Kozhikode district. High-speed Fibre to The Home (FTTH) internet service and superior quality webcams helped the monitoring teams to have an uninterrupted surveillance experience covering the whole district. “We had prepared for the day with multiple trial sessions under the District Electoral Officer. Apart from the ground-level staff, who handled the power supply and connectivity jobs, there were nearly 2,000 people, including Akshaya entrepreneurs and supervising team, who stood by us to successfully complete the task,” said C.M. Midhun Krishna, District Nodal Officer for Webcasting. He said the laptops and webcams used for the webcasting initiative were all brought by Akshaya entrepreneurs. In Kozhikode district, there were 43 critical booths and 499 vulnerable booths which demanded high security and surveillance measures. There were also 32 booths facing threats from Maoist activists. Considering the safety issues, 7,234 police officials, including those from the paramilitary and armed forces, were present in the district. Video cameras were used to record visuals from 209 booths where webcasting was facility was unavailable for technical reasons.

Gender-wise, 79.26% of female voters and 77.31% of male voters voted in the polls. Final figures However, the voter turnout is likely to increase as the Election Commission is set to announce the final figures on Wednesday. Even then, the number appeared to be less than the previous Assembly polls. The voter turnout was 81.89% and 81.27% in the 2016 and 2011 Assembly elections respectively. Polling commenced at 84.45% of 3,790 booths in the district at 7 a.m. itself. Voting was delayed at several booths due to technical glitches in electronic voting machines. Polling at one of the booths at AMLP School, Arathilparamba, Perumanna, started only after 10.30 a.m. Complaints of inoperative machines led to the delay of more than an hour at a few booths in Kozhikode South, Kunnamangalam and Koyilandy. The election passed off peacefully barring isolated incidents of scuffles between supporters of rival parties in a few places. Congress candidate and actor Dharmajan Bolgatty had to face the ire of DYFI workers when he tried to enter a booth at Balussery. Congress candidate at Nadapuram K. Praveen Kumar was also prevented from entering a booth by CPI(M) supporters. The polling concluded at 7 p.m. with the final hour being facilitated for COVID-19 patients, suspected cases and those undergoing quarantine. A total of 96 candidates are in the fray in 13 Assembly constituencies. Long queues Brisk polling was witnessed in the initial hours with about 10% of the electorate casting their votes by 9 a.m. However, by 10 a.m. the turnout had crossed 20% in the district. Long queues of voters were seen only in the forenoon. Voters had preferred to exercise their franchise in the morning due to the scorching sun at noon. Besides, additional booths had been set up in all Assembly segments to maintain COVID-19 protocols. About 50% of the voters exercised their franchise in the first six hours of polling. By 5 p.m. the turnout crossed 75%. An urban voter apathy was seen in Kozhikode North and Kozhikode South constituencies. The district also saw prominent leaders, including KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran and BJP State president K. Surendran, voting at Chombala and Balussery respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-sees-7840-voter-turnout/article34259144.ece

She does not remember her age. Her son, who drove the autorickshaw, said she was 83. Khadeeja could have avoided the arduous trip to and from the polling station as she had the choice to cast her vote at home under the category of absentee voters. But, she is one of the many elderly persons who missed the opportunity due to a lack of awareness. “We did not know that we had to apply for the facility until we met polling officers who came to record the vote of one of our elderly neighbours,” said Khadeeja’s son. “I am not sure if I am 80 years old. So I did not apply for it,” said Lakshmi Amma, a voter at AMLP School, Arathilparamba, Perumanna, in Kunnamangalam constituency, who could barely walk to the polling station on the arms of her granddaughter. Another voter demanded that the facility provided to aged persons should also be extended to sick persons who were not capable of reaching the booth by themselves. Safiya, who had severe arthritis and could barely walk, was brought to a polling station at MMLP School, Parappil, in Kozhikode South constituency by her son, but the security personnel did not allow their vehicle inside the school compound. Safiya had to be carried in. She sat under a tree for around ten minutes until a wheelchair could be brought for her. “They should consider persons like me too for the absentee voter category,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/missing-postal-vote-and-making-the-arduous-trip/article34259137.ece

He also complained that the youth organisation workers tried to manhandle him in the presence of voters and created a lot of trouble. “I did not file any petition with the police as I was least interested in stirring up any political or legal issue in the name of that incident. It was only exposing their imprudence and stupidity,” he said. Mr. Dharmajan also claimed that there were a series of threats against him from his political opponents for his candidature in Balussery constituency. “But, I never tried to react the way they adopted.

07 April 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Attappady students lend a helping hand||The Student Police Cadets (SPC) and members of the Electoral Literacy Club of Government Higher Secondary School, Agali, lent a helping hand to several physically challenged persons and remote tribespeople to exercise their right to franchise on Tuesday. The students played an active role not only in creating electoral awareness among the people of Attappady but also in bringing them to polling stations to cast their votes. Apart from the physically challenged persons, senior citizens were also given a helping hand by the students. The student groups brought some senior citizens of Pudur, Agali and Sholayur panchayats to polling booths and took them back to their homes after voting. At homes Ahead of the elections, the students had reached the homes of the differently abled persons and senior citizens. When some chose to make use of the postal ballot facility for absentee voters offered by the Election Commission, some others insisted that they vote in a polling booth to “feel and enjoy the process of voting.” The students helped those who could not make it to the polling stations on their own. During the Lok Sabha election of 2019, the students could raise the polling percentage in Attappady by 14%. “It was a creditable achievement for our children. The good work they are engaged in will go on. I am sure we have an increased polling percentage this time as well,” said Electoral Literacy Club nodal officer T. Satyan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/attappady-students-lend-a-helping-hand/article34259334.ece
07 April 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Not on poll rolls, no franchise for Chengara protesters||The well-laid road that winds down an interminable network of rubber plantations along Chengara abruptly gives way to a rocky path in the last few metres. At the end of it stands the gateway to Ambedkar Memorial Model Village — location of one of the significant land struggles in the State. The din and bustle of the back-to-back elections in the world outside have made no difference to the life inside. As the State queued up at polling stations on Tuesday, elders in the village, which falls in the Konni constituency, went about their work routine. The remaining people spent the day in and around a building under construction, which they consider as their library-cum-community hall. None of the 800-odd adults here have been able to exercise their franchise for the past decade and a half — their attempts to enrol themselves on the voters’ list remaining unsuccessful. “It seems India does not regard us as their citizens and we are not entitled to any of the rights the country has guaranteed to its people,” says T.R. Sasi, president of the Chengara Land Struggle Committee. “Nearly 100 people had died and more than 200 children were born in the village over the past 12 years, but none of their names have been entered in the birth and death registers,” he says. Despite repeated pleas to the government and directives from the State Human Rights Commission, Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, and State Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe Commission, the people here do not have ration cards, voter identity cards, and house number. Life in the village has been miserable in the absence of basic necessities, including water and power. The road that passes through the heart of this location remains unpaved and broken. “Life hit a rock bottom with the COVID-19 outbreak, which effectively prevented us from making ends meet with daily earnings. With little help from the government machinery, the families here survived by sharing whatever little things left with them,” says Biju, a resident here. 300 families As many as 300 landless families, under the aegis of the Sadhu Jana Vimochana Samyukta Vedi, encroached on nearly 145 ha of the HML rubber plantation at Chengara under the cover of night on August 4, 2007 demanding five acres for farming and Rs. 50,000 in cash towards initial farming expenses for each family. They pitched tents on the occupied land, tapped latex from rubber trees, and later turned to agriculture to eke out a living.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/not-on-poll-rolls-no-franchise-for-chengara-protesters/article34259181.ece

Currently residing at Chalakkayam near Pampa, this was for the second time in the last six months that this 34-year-old, a member of the Malampandaram tribe, emerged out of the forests with his family to take part in the electoral process. Staying in a makeshift dwelling, the family has been part of a nomadic tribal community that eke out a living by collecting forest produce. “Unlike those living inside the Kakki forests, we always try maintaining a good relationship with the people outside and are eager to participate in the electoral process,” he said. But with just two polling stations in their ward, which is spread out across a wide area from Llaha to Pampa, casting vote has been a challenging task for his community members. As per official estimates, about 83 members of the tribe who live inside the forests here have enrolled their names in the voters list for the Sabarimala ward, which falls in the Perunad panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/from-dense-forests-to-cast-their-votes/article34259379.ece
07 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Polling falls by 3 percentage points in State||Brisk polling marked the single-phase elections to the Kerala Assembly on Tuesday, with 74.02% of the 2.74 crore electorate exercising their franchise by evening, as per the latest available data. The final figures are expected on Wednesday. The byelection for the Malappuram Lok Sabha seat, held simultaneously, registered a polling percentage of 74.53%. The State had registered a voter turnout of 77.35% in the Assembly polls in 2016. 10 FIRs filed Stray incidents of clashes between Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Bharatiya Janata Party workers were reported from places such as Kattayikonam in the Kazhakuttam constituency. “Barring a few minor incidents, polling was by and large peaceful in the State with no complaints about the poll process,” election officials said in a statement. Ten FIRs have been filed by the police across the State “for minor offences”, they said. The election was conducted in strict compliance with the COVID-19 protocol. COVID-19 patients and electors in quarantine voted in the final hour of polling. Among the voters who cast their votes wearing protective gear included Left Democratic Front candidate in Thodupuzha K.A. Antony, United Democratic Front candidate in Kochi Tony Chammany, and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's daughter Veena. As per the latest updates, 150 ballot units, 150 control units, and 747 voter verifiable paper audit trail machines malfunctioned during the elections. Four ballot units, four control units, and 33 VVPAT machines used for the Malappuram bypoll also had to be replaced. As part of the security arrangements, webcasts were arranged at 20,478 polling stations. As the number of polling stations had been increased to 40,771 to avoid crowding, 2.02 lakh polling personnel were deployed. This time, 140 companies of the Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) had been allotted to the State for beefing up security. Polling ended at 7 p.m., except in nine north Kerala segments where it ended at 6 p.m. on account of the threat posed by Left wing extremist groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/polling-falls-by-3-percentage-points-in-state/article34259189.ece
07 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Capital district records 70.01% turnout in peaceful polling||The capital district recorded a polling percentage of 70.01% in the Assembly elections on Tuesday, as per the latest information available with the Election Commission. The numbers were bound to slightly increase with the final update of data from polling booths. In the Assembly elections of 2016, the district had recorded a polling percentage of 72.02%. Polling was largely peaceful across the district, except for an isolated incident of violence involving BJP and CPI(M) workers at Kattayikonam in the Kazhakuttam constituency. Police force was deployed in large numbers in the area to prevent further violence. As in the past, the rural areas of the district were ahead of the urban regions in voter enthusiasm, with most of the urban constituencies recording polling percentages lower than 70% and the rural constituencies recording more than 70%. The Aruvikkara constituency, consisting of remote polling stations in the high ranges, recorded the highest polling percentage of 73.27%, while the Thiruvananthapuram constituency in the heart of the city with easily accessible booths had a polling percentage of 61.92%. Nemom, the sole constituency won by the BJP in the State ever and which this year witnessed a tight triangular fight, had a relatively low polling percentage of 69.80%, compared to 74.11% in 2016. The case was similar in Kazhakuttam as well, which had a polling percentage of 69.63%, as against 73.46% last time. Shift in pattern The coastal regions witnessed a significant shift in voting pattern, as serpentine queues that used to be a common sight along the belt were missing this time. The setting up of auxiliary stations on account of the pandemic prevented crowding within the polling stations. COVID-19 protocol was largely adhered to across the district. While physical distancing could not be enforced owing to paucity of space in some booths, all other precautions were adopted. An adequate stock of disposable masks kept ready at all stations proved useful, with some voters, especially in the coastal areas, turning up without such protective gear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/capital-district-records-7001-turnout-in-peaceful-polling/article34259374.ece
07 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Poll panel’s vigil pays off||Despite the concern that multiple entries on the electoral rolls may pave way for bogus voting, the issue did not cast a shadow over Tuesday’s Assembly polls. Barring stray incidents, polling was relatively free when considering the sheer magnitude of the controversy that rocked the election scene. Moreover, the tight vigil maintained by polling officials and additional preventive measures introduced by the Election Commission appeared to have paid off. “Our officials had put in a lot of hard work and came out with a mechanism to prevent bogus voting, which was approved by the High Court and the Election Commission. It paid dividends,” Chief Electoral Officer Teeka Ram Meena said. “We have ensured that no bogus voting occurred,” he said. However, a few complaints did make news. United Democratic Front candidate in Taliparamba V.P. Abdul Rashid demanded a repoll in the segment, accusing the Communist Party of India (Marxist) of ‘capturing’ booths. Allegations of bogus voting were reported from Koothuparamba, Mannarkkad, Kalamassery, and Kattakada. At Mananthavady, Vypeen, and Parassala, some voters reportedly found that their votes had already been cast beforehand in the form of postal votes. Reportedly, these voters had never applied for postal ballots. In the run-up to the elections, it was Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala who flagged the issue, claiming that over four lakh 'fake' voters were present on the rolls. Both the UDF and the Bharatiya Janata Party had lodged complaints with the commission. On March 30, the commission informed the Kerala High Court that it could detect only 38,586 demographically similar entries in the rolls. Acting on a court directive, the ECI had introduced steps to prevent multiple voting and impersonation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/poll-panels-vigil-pays-off/article34259185.ece
07 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Coastal belt witnesses brisk polling||The coastal belt in the district witnessed brisk polling throughout the day on Tuesday. However, in contrast to the previous elections, serpentine queues were missing, with the district administration increasing the number of polling booths in view of the COVID-19 scenario. Several polling stations, prominently St. Mary’s Higher Secondary School in Vettucaud, St. Antony’s Higher Secondary School in Valiyathura and Leo XIII Higher Secondary School in Pulluvila, had nearly 10 booths within their premises to prevent crowding. Auxiliary booths were arranged in most places to ensure that only a maximum of 1,000 voters were allotted the same booth. Large turnout Many polling booths in coastal areas saw the electorate, predominantly the fishing community, turn in large numbers by around 10 a.m. Women and youngsters were among the early voters in the region. Adhering to a general trend in coastal areas, the voting picked up pace around 4 p.m. following a lull during the afternoon. Stepped-up vigil Heavy security was put in place in most polling stations that were designated ‘critical booths’, with Central forces being deployed to augment surveillance and prevent crowding within and outside the stations. A large posse of 28 Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel led the security measures at the Pallithura Higher Secondary School in Kazhakuttam. According to sub-inspector Lenju, who oversaw the measures, the security scheme was drawn up in view of the polling station’s long history of booth capturing and violence. Similar arrangements could be seen in several other polling venues along the coastal belt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/coastal-belt-witnesses-brisk-polling/article34259365.ece
07 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||COVID-19 norms largely met at polling stations||Barring physical distancing, most other requirements of the COVID-19 protocol were met at polling stations across the district. While masks were distributed among those who failed to wear one, a few polling booths surprised one and many by handing out disposable gloves and marking circles to maintain a safe distance among voters. While the capital district had warmed up to the idea of adopting measures to mitigate the COVID-19 spread during the local body elections last year, polling officials rose to the occasion admirably yet again. The growing awareness among the public too went a long way into upholding the norms. Despite the authorities’ inability to enforce social distancing norms, the Election Commission of India’s (ECI) move to arrange auxiliary booths and cap the maximum number of voters prevented crowding to a large extent. Thermal checks Volunteers and special police officers ensured that each voter was subjected to thermal screening and had their hands sanitised prior to entering the booths. Such guidelines were thoroughly ensured except in a few polling stations, including the Minor Irrigation Office in Varkala where the equipment ceased to function. Officials at the Mukkudil Lower Primary School in the Vamanapuram constituency sprang a surprise as they went a step ahead in enforcing COVID-19 norms to distribute disposable gloves to voters. Circles were marked outside another polling booth in the same constituency to enforce physical distancing. Such initiatives would prove heartening for the authorities who have been exploring options to enforce the pandemic norms that were being dismissed as “impractical” by a large section of officials.  The ECI’s move to arrange auxiliary booths helped prevent crowding||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-19-norms-largely-met-at-polling-stations/article34259368.ece
07 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Tension at Kattayikonam as CPI(M), BJP activists clash||Workers of the CPI(M) and the BJP clashed against each other at Kattayikonam, near Kazhakuttam, during the Assembly elections that otherwise passed off peacefully in the district on Tuesday. What began as an argument over distributing slips among voters flared up, leaving one activist injured and many others detained by the police. The region, which had witnessed political clashes in the past, kept the police on tenterhooks throughout the day. A BJP worker was allegedly attacked by a group of CPI(M) activists over the argument around 11.30 a.m. This prompted the NDA Kazhakuttam candidate Sobha Surendran to stage a sit-in as she demanded that Central forces be deployed in the area. She alleged that the attack was intended to intimidate voters from turning up at the polling booths. While the issue was soon resolved by the police, things took a turn for the worse two hours later when CPI(M) workers accused a group of BJP and RSS workers of arriving in two cars and fleeing in one of them after attacking two of their party activists. This led to CPI(M) workers, who found the NDA’s campaign materials for the Kazhakuttam and Nedumangad constituencies in the vehicle, to vandalise the car. They also alleged to have found weapons in the vehicle. Minister’s accusation The police soon resorted to a lathi charge to disperse the protesters. Many CPI(M) workers were also forcibly removed from the area. Incensed by the police action, Tourism Minister and LDF’s Kazhakuttam candidate Kadakampally Surendran accused the police of behaving in a partial manner. Raising strong charges against the police, he alleged that the action was orchestrated in accordance with a pre-planned script. Senior officials, including Sanjaykumar Gurudin, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Thiruvananthapuram Range, and P.K. Madhu, Superintendent of Police, Thiruvananthapuram Rural, visited the area to take stock of the situation. According to Nedumangad DySP Umesh Kumar J., two cases have been registered against CPI(M) activists for attacking the BJP worker and vandalising the car of another. The police were yet to receive a formal complaint from the CPI(M), he said. The region has come under a strong security blanket, with four striking forces stationed at various points to attend to exigencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tension-at-kattayikonam-as-cpim-bjp-activists-clash/article34259369.ece

In a major push to ensure free and fair elections, live monitoring and webcast had been arranged in 20,478 of the total 40,771 polling stations for the Assembly polls in the State. Polling stations, including the ones tagged as critical and vulnerable, were placed under surveillance as per the Election Commission of India norms. Live feed Live feed from these booths was made available to Returning Officers, District Collectors/District Election Officers and the central control room at the office of Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Teeka Ram Meena in Thiruvananthapuram. 70-member team A team of 70 people were involved in monitoring the footage. The infrastructure was put together over several months. “We had a team of officers who have been working in close coordination with the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, IT Mission and Keltron on the facility. They did a wonderful job. The credit goes to them,” Mr. Meena said. The team included Secretary and Additional CEO Sanjay Kaul who led the technical team; Additional CEO D. Balamurali, Deputy CEO V.

07 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||80.53%, turnout of 1987 Assembly election, yet to be surpassed||The Left Democratic Front (LDF) had come to power when polling touched an all-time high of 80.53% in the State in the 1987 Assembly polls and 77.35% in the 2016 polls. Since 1957, only the Congress-led alliance had been able to ensure continuity in power and that too way back in 1977. In the elections held after the Emergency, the Congress-led United Front was voted to power and K. Karunakaran became the Chief Minister. But, the fifth Assembly witnessed several political moves and three other Chief Ministers — A.K. Antony, P.K. Vasudevan Nair and C.H. Mohammed Koya. The Assembly was dissolved in 1979 and President’s rule imposed in the State. The previous government led by the Congress alliance was led by Communist Party of India leader C. Achutha Menon as the Congress did not join the Ministry initially after the 1970 elections. The Assembly, which had 133 seats, also had an extra tenure of 18 months as Emergency was imposed in the country and elections could not he held. After the 1980 elections, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led LDF was able to form the government under E.K. Nayanar when the voter turnout was 72.28%, with the LDF securing 93 seats. In 1982, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) came to power when the turnout was 73.56% and K. Karunakaran became the Chief Minister. However, the LDF formed the government in 1987 by bagging 77 seats. E.K. Nayanar again became the Chief Minister. The polling percentage of 80.53 in 1987 continues to be a record in the State. In the 1991 elections, K. Karunakaran became the Chief Minister after the UDF bagged 90 seats and the polling percentage was 73.46. However, in the 1996 elections, the LDF formed the government under E.K. Nayanar again when the polling percentage was 71.66. Congress leader A.K. Antony formed the government after the UDF wrested power from the LDF in the 2001 elections. The polling percentage was 72.22. In 2006, the LDF returned to power under V.S. Achuthanandan when the turnout was 72.38% and the front secured 98 seats. Sticking to its tradition of rotating power, the State again elected the UDF under Oommen Chandy in 2011, with the front securing 72 seats. The turnout was 75.27%. In the 2016 elections, the LDF assumed power bagging 91 seats under Pinarayi Vijayan. The polling percentage was 77.35.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/8053-turnout-of-1987-assembly-election-yet-to-be-surpassed/article34259184.ece

07 April 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Moderate polling of 73.74 % in Thrissur||A neck-and-neck race is expected in Thrissur district as 73.74% polling has been recorded in the Assembly elections. While 73.75 % women cast their votes, polling percentage of male voters is 73.63 and that of transgender voters is 41.30. All the three fronts are busy evaluating various socio-politico-religious factors, which may be decisive in determining the result, as there is a dip of 4.05 in polling percentage compared to 2016. In 2016 district recorded 77.74 % polling. However, a sizeable number of voters, including elderly persons, have cast their votes this year ignoring the COVID-19 pandemic. It is considered that if there is a high polling percentage, it means more neutral voters have cast their votes. All the parties claim advantage of these votes. In the last Lok Sabha election, Thrissur district recorded 78.36% polling. In 2016, when the LDF had a sweeping victory, there was 77.74% polling in the district. In 2011, the polling percentage was 74.88. The district recorded a polling percentage of 75.07 in the local body elections held in December. All constituencies in the district, except Guruvayur, where there was no candidate for the NDA, and Thrissur recorded polling percentage above 70. Experts are confused over the low percent of polling in Thrissur. There is a small dip in polling percentage in all constituencies.

07 April 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Leaders of fronts hopeful of win after casting votes||The Left Democratic Front (LDF) will win all 13 constituencies in Thrissur district in this Assembly election, says Minister A.C. Moideen after casting his vote at a booth in Panangattukara in Thekkumkara grama panchayat under the Wadakkanchery constituency. He said the Left would wrest back the Wadakkanchery, which it lost to the United Democratic Front. “Anil Akkara’s allegations on the LIFE Mission project are just the blabbering of a person who survives on controversies,’’ he said. A. Vijayaraghavan, CPI(M) acting State secretary, also shared the view as he said people who were optimistic about the development of the State would stand with the LDF. “The people will vote against the negative politics of the Opposition. Controversies and lies are their campaign tools. Those who want to protect plurality and secularism will support the LDF,” he said after voting at Sree Kerala Varma College here. Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar said the LDF would get a historic win in this election and that it would win all the 13 seats in the district, including Wadakkanchery. He alleged a Congress-BJP unholy alliance against the LDF in many places. C. Ravindranath, Education Minister, also shared Mr. Sunil Kumar’s optimism as he stated that the LDF would get to rule the State again after an emphantic win. From the UDF camp, T.N. Prathapan, MP, said the UDF would bag a huge victory in the district this time There was a clear pro-UDF wave in the State, he added, after casting his vote at the Kaithakkal Kunnathupally madrasa. ‘Dark era’ The State witnessed a dark era in the last five years, alleged Thrissur District Congress Committee president M.P. Vincent, after casting his vote at the Government High School, Alagappa Nagar. The election would be a verdict against the dark days under the LDF rule, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/leaders-of-fronts-hopeful-of-win-after-casting-votes/article34259331.ece
07 April 2021||VAMANAPURAM,KERALA||Pullampara residents repose trust in democracy||For 65-year old Kumaran, Tuesday’s elections presented him and his neighbours at the Poyikyam colony in the Vamanapuram constituency an opportunity to display their unwavering trust towards the democratic process despite facing neglect in the pursuit of development. The residents of the Scheduled Castes colonies in Pullampara, near Venjaramoodu, flocked to the polling booth at the Mukkudil Lower Primary School to cast their votes. They exercised their franchise en masse, putting aside their grouse over the failure of the authorities in realising their decades-long demand for a bridge across the Vamanapuram river that connected the Pullampara and Kallara grama panchayats. The absence of the bridge has left the nearly 15 families in the colony and many more in the region with the plight of travelling long distances for their needs. Mr. Kumaran claimed that they had to travel over 15 kilometres via Muthuvila to reach Kallara. For this, they had to catch two buses to reach schools, hospitals and markets in Mithirmala, Kallara and other areas. Funds awaited While the government had accorded administrative sanction for a steel pedestrian bridge in Neermankadavu that would link the Kallara, Pullampara and Vamanapuram grama panchayats, work was yet to take off. Besides, the proposed project awaited funding. According to Pullampara grama panchayat member Sreekantan Nair, the colony dwellers have been provided the most basic amenities. While maintaining that the residents could travel to Thembamoodu nearby for their other needs, he concurred that the proposed bridge would provide them greater accessibility. With the PWD having submitted an estimate for the bridge, Mr. Nair expressed confidence that its construction would commence this year. Besides improving connectivity, the bridge would also enable the grama panchayat to do away with the existing ferry service across the Vamanapuram river that has created a huge financial burden on the local body.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pullampara-residents-repose-trust-in-democracy/article34259362.ece

A complaint in this regard was received at the Meenangadi police station on Monday night but no First Information Report (FIR) has been registered so far, they said. The police said its Special Branch wing conducted an initial inquiry and it was found that some people tried to restrain the man from selling meat in the area alleging that he was ‘selling non-halal meat.’ The complainant Shaji told reporters the unidentified group blocked his vehicle in an area near Meenangadi town and tried to destroy the meat, alleging that he was not distributing beef. Shaji, who is a district coordinator of a farmer producer company, also alleged that the group of men tried to force feed him the raw meat. He claimed he managed to escape from the spot in his vehicle. The plan was to distribute fresh meat among Christians who are members of the farmer producer company called ‘Kisan Mitra’ for Easter celebrations. 150 kg The incident allegedly occurred when Shaji went to the area with 150 kg of fresh meat (beef and pork) in a three-wheeler, some members claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fracas-over-halal-meat-police-to-probe-complaint/article34259238.ece

APCC president S. Sailajanath, at a press conference here on Tuesday, demanded that a fresh notification be issued instead of continuing the process that had been paused last year. Many political parties were complaining that their candidates had either not been allowed to file nominations or had been forced to withdraw under duress, he said. “This apart, many new voters have been added to the list. But they are not allowed to cast their vote in the elections, which is against the spirit of democracy,” Dr. Sailajanath said. “Let the SEC re-issue the notification and follow the guidelines of the Supreme Court on implementing four-week model code of conduct. Where is the urgency in conducting the elections when the YSRPC is sure of winning majority seats?” questioned Dr. Sailajanath. “The Congress is contesting 260 ZPTC and 170 MPTC seats,” Mr. Sailajanath added. “It is ridiculous on the part of the YSRCP to talk of development, As we cross the inter-State border in Telangana or Karnataka, we see boards announcing – ‘Buy diesel or petrol at Rs. 5 or Rs. 7 less per litre, which tells the scenario in A.P.,” he said. “Giving a week’s time for the elections was a murder of democracy. People in the administration should not bow down to the evil designs of the politicians in power,” said CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna in a statement. ‘Blot on democracy’ More than 2,000 MPTCs and 125 ZPTCs had been elected unanimously after intimidating the opposition parties in various ways, he alleged and described it as a blot on democracy. Demanding that a fresh notification be issued, he said that all political parties should be given a chance to file nominations afresh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-and-congress-too-seek-fresh-notification-by-sec/article34259314.ece

District Collector Vivek Yadav, Deputy Inspector General (South Coastal Range) Trivikram Verma, and Superintendent of Police (Guntur Rural) Vishal Gunni paid floral tributes.

He was recruited by the CRPF in 2015 and soon earned a place in the elite COBRA battalion. “Our son spoke to us on April 1 saying that he will come home on May 15. We were making his wedding arrangements but within a couple of days, we received this heart-breaking news,” said his father Ravindra Babu. Chief Minister Y.S.

Jagan Mohan Reddy. Addressing the media at the party central office on Tuesday, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said that JSP president Pawan Kalyan had no thought process of his own and that his speeches lacked subject. “TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s political career has ended the moment he announced the boycott of ZPTC and MPTC elections,” he said. Alleging that the TDP government had left Rs. 2.6 lakh crore debt, he said the Chief Minister had prioritised the welfare of weaker sections in spite of COVID-19 and financial crisis. Referring to the remarks of BJP leader Sunil Deodhar that “Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy is currently on bail and that he can be jailed any moment,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy questioned, “How is it possible for the BJP leaders to know about it in advance and whether the judiciary is in their hands?” False cases had been filed against Mr. Jagan, and he was illegally jailed for 16 months, he alleged. Viveka murder case On the investigation into the Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy’s murder case, he said, “The Central agencies are doing their job, and there is no need for Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy to influence the process.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/oppn-out-to-destablise-govt-alleges-sajjala/article34259315.ece

07 April 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tobacco growers worried as COVID induces price correction||Even as auctioning of tobacco began on a promising note in the middle of March, the farmers have now their fingers crossed as the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has induced a correction in the prices of various grades of tobacco at a time when they are expecting to recoup their losses incurred last year due to dull markets due to prolonged lockdown. The buyers were offering more than Rs. 180 per kg for the bright grade varieties when the auction platforms opened. Now, the same varieties are fetching Rs. 170 per kg at best, a group of farmers at Vellampalli auction platform said. Major buyers of the produce, which find its way to global markets, are shying away from the auction of late over the health concerns with the spurt in the infection count. “We are trying our best to step up the number of bales traded each day by at least 100. At present, 400 to 500 bales are being traded in the wake of sluggish market conditions,” Southern Light Soil(SLS) Regional Manager D. Venugopal told The Hindu . Farmers fear disruption in tobacco trade this year too as coronovirus has already triggered lockdown in some parts of the country. There is a long way to go as only 7.26 million kg have been been traded so far as against the estimated production of over 70 million kg in the traditional tobacco growing areas under the purview of the SLS and the Southern Black Soil auction platforms. The unseasonal rains during the rabi season in several spells also hit tobacco production in Nellore and Prakasam districts, as farmers had to go for gap filling as the wet spell destroyed the early planted crops. Market intervention “The Centre should press into service the State Trading Corporation (STC) as the tobacco sector earns a good volume of foreign exchange. Like last year, the State government should direct the Markfed to intervene to create a buoyancy in the market,” said Vellampalli II Tobacco Growers’ Association president N. Chimpriya. The auctions started on a promising note with the price of F1 grade going up to Rs. 184 per kg. Just 20 days have passed since the platforms were opened, the market is now on the correction mode. In SBS auction platforms, the average price realised for the 3.55 million kg marketed so far has dropped to Rs. 170.95 kg now. In SLS auction platforms, the 3.71 million kg marketed so far fetched an average price of Rs. 173.30 per kg, according to Tobacco Board sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tobacco-growers-worried-as-covid-induces-price-correction/article34259305.ece

Singh in New Delhi on Tuesday and sought amendment to Handloom Reservation Act so as to check powerloom products from being marketed as handloom products. ‘Distinction should be made’ They complained that the alleged illegal practice by powerloom players adversely affected livelihood of the handloom weavers, who were reeling under debt trap. National Federation of Handlooms and Handicrafts founder president Macherla Mohan Rao said that there was an urgent need to include a legal provision to make a clear distinction between hand printing and hand embroidery vis-a’-vis digital printing and machine embroidery. Presence of fake products in the market was highly detrimental to the handloom industry, he continued. Powerloom products should have their own tag similar to the handloom mark. The Ministry should make necessary legal provision for effective enforcement of the Act and sufficient security personnel posted for the purpose, the NFHH said. The weavers wanted exemption of yarns, dyes/chemicals and handloom products from the Goods and Services Tax(GST). Demands They wanted students of design institutes to undergo internship with handloom weavers to introduce new designs in keeping with changing fashion trends in the local and international market. The government should provide handsome stipend for them to attract talented youth in developing trend setting designs. At least Rs. 15 crore should be earmarked for Central universities to invent devices to distinguish the powerloom and handloom fabric, he said. The weavers wanted the government to provide 40% subsidy to establish small Scale Spinning Units at village level (2,000- 8,000 spindles/unit) for weavers to have easy access to yarn in small quantities and at low cost in their own villages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/handloom-weavers-seek-centres-support/article34259308.ece

Srikakulam district is witnessing almost 100 new cases on a daily basis. The active caseload is 490, but it is expected to rise sharply in the coming days. As many as 415 patients are under home isolation while 51 persons have been admitted to hospital. Twenty-four patients are under observation at COVID Care Centres. “We will ready 1,000 beds soon as positive cases being reported from all over the district. People should follow safe distancing and wear masks, apart from quickly getting vaccinated. Government hospitals are providing the vaccine free of cost for all persons aged above 45,” said J. Nivas, Srikakulam Collector. Meanwhile, several service organisations have been conducting awareness programmes in the district to prevent the spread of the second wave of COVID-19. Srikakulam Rotary Club central president K.T. Naidu and secretary N.V. Bhaskar expressed concern over people moving freely without masks. “Social distancing is hardly being followed at public places. That is why our club has been creating awareness about COVID-19 protocols among the people at public places such as Rythu Bazaar, Old Bus Stand, APSRTC Complex and other places, explaining the severity of second wave,” said Mr.Naidu. In neighbouring Vizianagaram district, 49 new cases were reported on Tuesday, taking the active caseload to 232. District Medical and Health Officer S.V.

07 April 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Is district facing shortage of vaccines?||Following the State government’s plan of large-scale vaccination to control the spread of COVID -19, the district administration has embarked on a drive, by opening up multiple sites and allowing private hospitals to give the jab to all in the 45 plus category. But since April 3, most of the private hospitals who have given the permission, are turning people out, as they do not have the required stock of vaccine vials. Since the vials have to be purchased from the government-run department, the management of the hospitals say that they have put up the requisition, but have neither received the stock nor have they got any confirmation on replenishment. According to the District Medical and Health Officer P. Suryanarayana, there is no shortage at present, but the supply to the private players has been reduced, as the demand has been very high, in the recent times. Ever since, it was opened up to the private players, many are preferring them to the government-run centres and that is why the demand suddenly peaked, he said. According to the health officials, at present there are about 60,000 vaccines in the district and all are stocked at various centres. This indicates that there may not be sufficient stock at the District Immunisation Centre, which handles the central cold storage. It is also learnt that the flow of vaccines have reduced off late, as compared to the initial days. In the initial period, the district was receiving good numbers and there were days when about 60,000 vaccines were sent on a day. But then the awareness had not picked up and vaccination programme was not to the desired-level. But now as the demand has picked up with the onset of the second wave, the numbers have dropped to 10,000 to 14,000 per shipment, every three or four days, it is learnt from the Health Department. As of now since the vaccination programme began on January 16, the district received around 3.8 lakh vaccines and so far close to 2.8 to 3 lakh have been vaccinated. In the initial days, the district was clocking around 6,000 jabs per day. But ever since the drive was taken up, it has gone up to 20,000 per day, and the district administration has set a target of about 30,000 per day, so that it can vaccinate close to 6 to 9 lakh people in the next 30 days. But if the availability is hit due to lack of timely replenishment, then the programme might receive a setback, said a senior doctor from KGH. For a target of 30,000 jabs a day, there must be at least one lakh vaccines in the cold chain, he added. Ever since, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken the first shot of Covaxin, the demand for it has been more. More people are preferring it to the other, this also may have created an imbalance, said District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/is-district-facing-shortage-of-vaccines/article34259418.ece

07 April 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||For YSRCP, a win in Tirupati is more than retaining the seat||After back-to-back victories in the panchayat and municipal elections, the YSRCP is clearly on a bull run to win the Tirupati (SC) Lok Sabha seat. For the ruling party, which is putting a no-holds-barred fight, a win here means much more than retaining its own seat that had fallen vacant with the demise of party MP Balli Durgaprasada Rao due to COVID-19. This is also considered a barometer on the level of people’s faith retained, two years after its stunning victory in 2019. Surprise choice Chief Minister and party supremo Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s selection of a political novice is also understandably meant to send a clear signal that his personal charisma, late YSR’s legacy, the party symbol, and the implementation of welfare schemes alone matter at the hustings. The choice of the candidate Maddila Gurumoorthy, who had served as Mr. Jagan’s personal physiotherapist during his padayatra, came suddenly out of the blue, and he has little to boast of compared to his rivals in the fray, considered giants in terms of political exposure or administrative experience. The party leadership, apparently brushing aside this factor, has moved many top leaders to Tirupati to ensure a huge victory margin of five lakh votes. Apart from top-rung leaders such as Y.V. Subba Reddy, Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy and K. Narayanaswamy, the Chief Minister has personally deployed a Minister to each of the seven Assembly segments, viz. Perni Nani for Tirupati, P. Anil Kumar for Gudur, A. Suresh for Sarvepalli, M. Goutham Reddy for Sullurpet, K. Kannababu for Srikalahasti, K. Nani for Satyavedu and B. Srinivasa Reddy for Venkatagiri. The seven local MLAs are also sweating it out in the scorching sun to reach out to the last voter in the hinterland. Party MLA and senior leader B. Karunakar Reddy says a victory by a huge margin will also silence its detractors, who have been cornering the ruling party on issues of religious conversion, desecration of idols and undue interference in temple affairs. Queried about the oft-made blame of volunteers intimidating voters on continuance of social security benefits, Government Whip Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy says a thumping win will finish such baseless arguments, as the parliamentary elections have nothing to do with pensions or ration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/for-ysrcp-a-win-in-tirupati-is-more-than-retaining-the-seat/article34259320.ece
07 April 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Padmavathi Nilayam to be COVID Care Centre again||With a sudden spurt in COVID-19 cases all over, Sri Padmavathi Nilayam, the TTD’s multi-purpose building in Tiruchanur, is all set to don its previous avatar of a 1,000-bed COVID care facility. The sprawling compound was originally built by TTD to be run as a pilgrim accommodation complex, but was handed over to Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC), evidently to be operated on profitability basis. It was exactly a year back that the building was given a rejig to be used as a multi-bed COVID Care Centre to serve as isolation facility for mildly positive COVID cases. Almost 70% of the cases registered in Chittoor district are in and around Tirupati, which is a cause for concern, where byelections are due. Collector M. Hari Narayanan visited the facility on the city outskirts and found it suitable to be used again for the same purpose. He instructed all the officials to ensure maximum adherence to the central guidelines on COVID-19, while laying emphasis on vaccination as the ‘key to ensure safety’. “All the government staff deployed for poll duty will get the jab”, he said. Addressing a meeting of medical officers in Chittoor later on Tuesday, Mr. Narayanan stressed the importance of coordination among departments to ensure management of containment clusters, apart from testing, tracing and treating. The primary and secondary contacts of every person testing positive should be traced without fail and made to undergo the test. Fever clinics Mr. Narayanan said fever clinics should be established for better management of cases in the containment clusters. “Cases aged above 60 years with comorbid conditions should be sent to SVIMS, those in 45-59 years age group will be sent to Ruia, while top priority should be accorded to home isolation,” the Collector said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/padmavathi-nilayam-to-become-a-covid-care-centre-once-again/article34259312.ece

Vivekananda Reddy murder case, the Telugu Desam Party on Tuesday reacted and said, “The YSRCP was the first to demand a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the murder when in the Opposition. But it slow-pedalled the case after coming to power. There are many doubts over the manner in which the Chief Minister had changed the composition of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) three times.” TDP national spokesperson K. Pattabhi, while addressing the media here, also saw a pattern in which the accused persons, or witnesses, were either getting killed or committing suicide. Referring to Ms. Vijayamma’s assertion that the YSR family was sympathetic towards Viveka’s daughter Sunitha Reddy, the TDP leader wondered why their family run media house had not extended coverage to her press conference in Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/viveka-murder-ysrcp-slow-pedalled-case/article34259318.ece

Chandrababu Naidu has welcomed the Andhra Pradesh High Court judgment staying the notification issued by the State Election Commission for the ZPTC and MPTC elections. In a statement on Tuesday, the former Chief Minister said the court order was a vindication of the TDP’s decision to boycott the elections. The SEC issued the notification in violation of the Supreme Court guidelines, he said. Terming the verdict as a slap in the face of the government, Mr. Naidu alleged that the government had scant respect for the constitutional institutions and their heads. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and the YSRCP should start acting in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. The State Election Commission should issue a fresh notification and start the election process afresh,” Mr. Naidu said.

Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked officials to provide drip and sprinkler facilities to all the small and marginal farmers within the stipulated time. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, during a review meeting on horticulture, micro irrigation and agriculture infrastructure on Tuesday, said the government was taking steps to dig borewells for the small and marginal farmers. Providing drip and micro irrigation facilities to them would help them in getting better yield, he said. The works should be done on saturation basis and every eligible person should be benefited from the schemes being implemented, and there should be no scope for corruption, he said. The Chief Minister also suggested the officials to give priority to the farmers with less than 10 acres of land in Rayalaseema and Prakasam, and less than five acres in other places in providing drip and sprinkler facilities. Procurement of micro irrigation facilities through reverse tendering would help reduce the cost and benefit more farmers. He said the cost of drip and sprinkler systems would be concluded after taking the subsidies of the Central government and the State government into consideration, he said. Mulberry cultivation The Chief Minister directed the officials to focus on solving the problems of farmers cultivating mulberry and improving their situation. He also reviewed the setting up of multi-purpose facility centres as part of Agri Infra such as dry storage, drying platform, godowns, horticulture infrastructure, primary processing centres, collection centres, cold rooms for storage, custom hiring centres, assaying equipment, Janata Bazaars, procurement centres, and e-marketing.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, APRSSC State convener Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao said the NDA government at the Centre has brought in laws that are detrimental to the agricultural sector and farmers. ‘No sympathy for us’ “Farmers have been protesting on the roads for over four months for their rights. Many have even died, but there is not even an iota of sympathy from the Modi government, which is most condemnable. The electorate is free to vote for the party of its choice, but we urge voters not to vote for the BJP,” he said. Mr. Rao said the Centre has removed the safety net of Minimum Support Price (MSP) while allowing corporates and traders to sell essential commodities up to 50% more than the average price of each commodity in the past year. The Modi government did nothing for the development of farmers but was trying to suppress the farmers’ agitation, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dont-vote-for-bjp-urges-farmers-body/article34259402.ece

But there was a surge in the number of apps introduced by the School Education authorities, burdening the teachers with a plethora of non-teaching activities. They said the situation was worse in schools that were being run with single teachers.

07 April 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Merger of VSP with SAIL plants can create a global conglomerate’||The Steel Executive’s Federation of India (SEFI) and RINL’s Steel Executive Association have demanded that the Centre’s plan to privatise the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) be dropped and that the RINL, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), Neelanchal Ispat Nigam Limited, NMDC and Mecon under the Ministry of Steel be merged to form a huge conglomerate. Both the bodies, at a meeting in New Delhi on Monday, passed a resolution to submit a representation to the government seeking that the steel industry be continued as a strategic sector. “The merger of the units under a roof, the SAIL, will make the steel plants into a huge steel conglomerate with a production capacity of about 30 MPTA. With all steel plants being in the expansion mode, the total production can go up to 50 MPTA by 2030 and this would make the steel conglomerate among the biggest in the world. It would even cross the POSCO’s capacity of 40 MPTA,” said SEA vice-president K.V.D. Prasad. Both the SEFI and the SEA members feel that the RINL’s advantages can iron out the disadvantages of the SAIL and vice-versa. Speaking about the RINL’s advantages that can be beneficial to the SAIL and other steel plants, Marpu Sarat of the SEA said the RINL is the only shore-based integrated steel plant and its sea connectivity can be utilised by others for import and exports. Captive mines “Moreover, we have a very strong marketing network in south India, which can help the SAIL immensely. The RINL has got a huge land bank that can be utilised for expansion and changing the product mix, which the SAIL plants do not have,” pointed out Mr. Prasad. He said with no captive mine, the RINL’s production cost is going up and with the merger, the mines of the SAIL and the NMDC can change the fortune of the RINL. Product mix As the RINL has a limited product mix, its quality has a global recognition. With the merger, the SAIL that has a huge product range can make the steel conglomerate a force to reckon with in the global market, opined Mr. Prasad.  The Centre has so far invested around Rs. 4,500 crore in the RINL, but the steel plant has given back over Rs. 45, 000 crore in the form of taxes and dividends. More essentially, wherever a PSU steel plant has come up, a city has developed. Even in the case of RINL, the per capita of Gajuwaka region is the highest in the State, he pointed out. “We urge the government to consider the from a holistic point of view,” said Mr. Prasad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/merger-of-vsp-with-sail-plants-can-create-a-global-conglomerate/article34259325.ece

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Working towards a Healthier World!||Conceived and promoted by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the World Health Day is a global health awareness day celebrated every year on 7th April. This day was initiated to create awareness on a worldwide scale about good hygiene, better wellbeing, and salubrious habits towards a healthier and disease-free life. The day was first organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the year 1950. Through this day the organisation focuses and promotes cognizance on health-related issues across the globe. Every year, the day is celebrated around a globally relevant health related theme. Through different social campaigns and various activities, this day is used as an opportunity to focus on a priority area of concern. While last year, the focus was on mid-wives, nurses and maternal care, this year the focus is on worldwide inequalities in the health sector. In the backdrop of COVID-19 and the destructive pandemic, the significant disparity in the access to adequate healthcare facilities became obvious and worrisome. The theme for this year's World Health Day is a call to eliminate health inequalities around the world. According to WHO, The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed more people into poverty and food insecurity, and amplified gender, social and health inequities. Accordingly, this whole year will be dedicated to bringing people together to ‘build a fairer, healthier world’ as per the WHO agenda for the World Health Day. The campaign focusses on the humane fact that, ''the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.'' The global agenda of WHO is to promote better health and hygiene. But with the pandemic still creating havoc throughout the world, it makes sense to ensure better health and hygiene in and around our surroundings as well. Being extra careful with regards to hygiene only serves to protect you and your family. You can do your part by creating awareness about the importance of better hygiene and sanitisation, wearing masks or face shields, and encouraging social distancing.  Healthy foods at Sattva Naturals  With the advent of the novel corona virus, consumption patterns of consumers, especially concerning food have refashioned. While the health-care system has grown in leaps and bounds with new technologies and innovations hitting us on a day-to-day basis, the age old saying that the food we consume will by and far be supplemented still holds true. Catering to this demand, Sattva Naturals offers a variety of products sourced directly from the farmers. Established in 2018, Sattva Naturals was envisioned by an engineering graduate with a motivation to bring together like-minded health enthusiasts and spread awareness on the significance of eating healthy, while at the same time, helping the farming community get a fair and better deal for their produce. Consequently, in just a few years, Sattva Naturals has emerged as the preferred destination for a variety of millets, fresh farm produce and organic products in Vizag. Apart from a variety of millets, the range includes grains, pulses, dals, cold-pressed oils (wooden extracted), herbal cosmetics, spices, traditional snacks, healthy snack options, and ready-to-cook snacks with a nutritional twist. Also available are earthenware, medicinal plants and more. The store offers a wide and varied range. The crux of Sattva’s business model involves creating a fair marketplace to sell the farmers’ produce directly to the customers, without the middleman. With health being paramount, and immunity-building being the key towards better health, there has been a growing awareness and the willingness to switch to healthier lifestyles, organic and natural products, which is where Sattva Naturals provides an effective solution.  Kidney-care at AINU  With the second wave sweeping the nation, people with co-morbidities especially kidney diseases are falling prey to this pandemic. Due to the hesitancy and fear of seeking medical care for non-life-threatening diseases during the pandemic, there has been a raise in incidences of complications because of late presentation. Neglected kidney stones, small kidney tumours, and swelling of the kidney can be cured with early intervention. Asian Institute of Nephrology and Urology (AINU) is first of its kind comprehensive hospital for kidney and urological care in the heart of Vizag.

07 April 2021||AVUSULAPALLY (SIDDIPET DISTRICT),TELANGANA||Four districts to get irrigation from Godavari water||The life of thousands of farmers will be changed for good in four districts. Facing drought conditions will be history. The districts that would benefit from Haldi vagu include Siddipet, Medak, Kamareddy and Nizamabad. It is expected that the water would take some 10 days to reach Nizamsagar, the end of point of Godavari water in the district. From Nizamsagar the water would irrigate the some 2 lakh acres ayacut of the project through the existing canal system. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao released Godavari water at 6.125 kilometre point of Sangareddy canal to Haldi Feeder channel. The channel which starts at that point has been designed to carry 1,683 cusecs of water. The water from Haldi Offtake passes through series of four tanks — Bandham Cheruvu, Pedda Cheruvu, Dharmai Cheruvu and Khan Cheruvu — all in Wargal mandal. Haldi vagu starts from surplus of Khan Cheruvu and transverses for about 70 kilometres and merges with Manjeera river. From that point Manjeera river travels for about 20 kilometres and ends in Nizamsagar. Coming to Sangareddy canal, a total of 1,19,106 acres will be provided irrigation from this canal. Reach One of Sangareddy Canal will irrigate 19,019 acres, Canal Reach Two 32,401 acres, Canal Reach Three 47,686 acres, Keesara Canal 4,324 acres and Bommalaramaram canal 15,676 acres. “We are happy that we are getting water with the blessings of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. From now on our fields will be a green carpet even in summer. A life time dream has come true for us,” a woman farmer Ch. Santoshamma, who travelled to the venue just to see the Chief Minister release Godavari water into the channel, told The Hindu .

07 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CS calls for doubling of daily COVID tests||The State government has directed the Health department and district collectors to ramp up COVID-19 testing and vaccination in light of reports that the second wave of the coronavirus is intensifying. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar directed the collectors to double the number of tests conducted on a daily basis and identify as many positive cases as possible. Early identification and isolation of positive cases would help control the spread of virus and also ensure early treatment to reduce the possibility of the cases taking a serious turn. The Chief Secretary gave a series of instructions to the collectors during a video conference that lasted over two hours, to review the measures taken for management of COVID-19 pandemic in the State. The collectors were given directions covering the entire scope of COVID management including testing, tracing, treatment, vaccination and enforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviour. The Chief Secretary conducted the video conference from home. Incidentally, he has been diagnosed with the infection after he underwent tests following complaints of uneasiness. The collectors were asked to take steps to ensure that the pace of testing did not come down on weekends and holidays. They should take steps to see that the testing centres functioned on all days of the week, Mr Somesh Kumar said. The new testing app should be deployed for effectively tracing the contacts of positive cases so that they too could be tested. Steps should be taken to ensure that all symptomatic persons found negative in the rapid antigen tests were subjected to RT-PCR tests, he directed. Mr. Somesh Kumar stressed the need for ensuring on-the-spot assessment and counselling for all COVID-positive persons at the testing location itself. Focus should be on handing over kit of essential medicines to persons found fit for home isolation while steps should be taken to monitor persons in home isolation through home visits/tele-calling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cs-calls-for-doubling-of-daily-covid-tests/article34259087.ece
07 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Focus on heritage preservation again||A new ongoing construction outside the southern wall of the 400-year-old Mecca Masjid has again brought focus to the state of heritage preservation in Hyderabad. “It is illegal. We are planning to file a criminal complaint against the builders. Though it belongs to the Mecca Masjid, the Archaeological Survey of India and Telangana Heritage should take action. The work has however stopped,” said Mohammed Saleem, Chairman of Telangana State Wakf Board. While Wakf officials say the work has been stopped, residents of the area say the work is going on in the night. Incidentally, it is the intersection of jurisdiction that is hobbling action against the construction work. While the Mecca Masjid is a heritage site under the care of Department of Heritage Telangana, it is a listed Wakf property identified as TSHY2216. Sprawled over 73696 square yards or about 15.2 acres, the masjid is within the radius of protection of the Charminar under the custody of ASI. “The construction is on a private land and we have asked them to stop work,” said a staffer at the masjid. Recently, a photograph showing the construction near the masjid’s parapet triggered ire of activists. “Though it might be outside the masjid it is still going to spoil the view of the heritage site. It should be stopped so that other shop owners around the masjid also stop construction,” said Anuradha Reddy of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage. The RC slab and brick work for a second storey by a cloth store appears as if it is abutting the masjid wall, from inside, it is a different story. The construction is beyond the wall and behind the Khankha and there is a 23-metre space between the masjid and the outer wall. A few days ago, a restaurant owner who sneaked in his private vehicle into the masjid through the southern entrance and shot a viral video had to face music. “We arrested two of them and they had to spend time in the prison. Their restaurant has been shut down,” said a police official. A police official has now been posted at the southern entrance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/focus-on-heritage-preservation-again/article34259095.ece
07 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Siddipet Collector invites wrath of HC, tenders apology||Siddipet District Collector P. Venkatrami Reddy tasted the anger of Telangana High Court on Tuesday when he failed to appear before it in an appeal filed by him against punishment in a contempt of court case. With a division bench headed by Chief Justice Hima Kohli declining to stay the punishment following his absence in the virtual proceedings, the IAS officer finally appeared before the bench towards the end of the session. The CJ declined to stay the single judge order despite repeated requests from Advocate General B.S. Prasad. “Be careful,” CJ Hima Kohli told the officer when he turned up for the court hearing through video conference. The CJ made it clear to Mr. Reddy that he was contemnor in the case and was supposed to appear before the court when the appeal came up for hearing. Mr. Reddy along with two other officers Krishna Bhaskar (former Siddipet Collector and current Rajanna Sircilla Collector) and Jayachandra Reddy (Special Deputy Collector, Land Acquisition, Kaleshwaram project Unit-III) was held guilty of contempt of court by a single judge. Aggrieved farmers Some tenant farmers and agricultural labourers of Vemulaghat village of Thoguta mandal of Siddipet filed two contempt of court pleas alleging that the three officers wilfully disobeyed the single judge orders in two writ petitions pertaining to their dispossession of their lands for construction of Mallannasagar reservoir. The petitioners contended that copies of the Detailed Project Report (DPR) in Telugu were not provided to them. They also charged that their objections were not taken into consideration by the authorities. Holding the officers guilty of contempt of court, the single judge awarded two-month simple imprisonment to Mr. Jayachandra Reddy and imposed Rs. 2,000 fine on him. The other two officers were imposed with a fine of Rs. 2,000 each. The judge ordered that an adverse entry should be entered in the service records of the officers. The three officers filed appeals against the single judge order which came up for hearing before a division bench of CJ and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy on Tuesday. When the hearing began, Mr. Jayachandra Reddy and Mr. Krishna Bhaskar attended through video conference. ‘Collector preoccupied’ When CJ pointed out the absence of Mr. Venkatrami Reddy, the AG explained that he was occupied with an official programme. With the CJ taking a serious note of the officer’s absence and declining to stay the punishment, the AG said the officer had respect for the HC. “We can take care of our respect,” the CJ observed making it clear that the court would not stay the single judge order. Next hearing At that juncture, the AG requested the bench to pass over the matter assuring to secure presence of the officer who joined the proceedings eventually and tendered an apology for his absence.. After hearing contentions of AG and respondents’ counsel, the bench posted the matters to April 12 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/siddipet-collector-invites-wrath-of-high-court-by-his-absence-tenders-apology/article34259104.ece

07 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bio-remediation of Hussainsagar initiated||Work pertaining to cleaning and bio-remediation of the Hussainsagar has been initiated, with HMDA awarding it to NACOF India Limited, a public sector cooperative federation. NACOF has won the global tenders invited for the bio-remediation of the lake water, by bidding the lowest, engineering officials from HMDA informed. With continuing inflow of sewage and effluents, and increasing evaporation rate, the lake water starts giving out unbearable stench during summer, to arrest which the HMDA had initiated the bio-remediation efforts starting from 2016. The contract for “technological intervention to arrest odour nuisance, algal blooms and to improve water quality” will be for a duration of six months and can be extended up to one year. Before initiating the actual process, the lake should be cleaned of floating material and weed. Bio-remediation process to be followed by NACOF involves Effective Micro-organisms solution coupled with Bokashi mud balls, to promote the growth of microorganisms which keep multiplying and eat into the sludge and reduce Biological Oxygen Demand, while improving the dissolved oxygen. The agency should commence the work immediately after issue of the LoA, and the process of treatment should be completed within 15 days, evidenced by arrest of odour from 16th day onwards, the conditions of tender document stipulate. The process has a limited purpose of controlling the bad odour during summer, which has the potential to reduce the tourist traffic. NACOF has a track record of carrying out the work effectively in Hussainsagar in 2018. Last year, the work was awarded to a Canada-based firm, but the contract was reportedly terminated as the work was not to the satisfaction of the Hyderabad MetropolitanDevelopment Authority. During December last, the HMDA had invited tenders for the work, but reportedly had no takers. The tender notification re-issued on March 22 received six responses, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bio-remediation-of-hussainsagar-initiated/article34259093.ece

The suggestion was offered during a meeting of the hospital managements with Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao here on Tuesday even as admission of COVID patients in ICUs and other wards is on the rise. From 361 ICU beds and 1,133 beds overall in government and private hospitals on March 1 this year, the occupancy had increased to 1,257 and 4,670, respectively, by Monday. Mild cases Besides, the managements were asked to open COVID Care Centres at hotels to admit patients with mild form of the infection. This strategy had been implemented last year too. Usually, patients with mild form of COVID are advised to isolate at home and undergo treatment. However, some get anxious and seek admission in hospitals to be in safe hands. If they are accommodated at hotels rather than in hospitals, beds in healthcare facilities can be kept available for emergency COVID and non-COVID patients. Dr Srinivasa Rao said that 86 COVID care centres of government have been opened across the State for people who do not have space for isolation at home. The senior official has also asked the managements to postpone elective (non-emergency) surgeries.

07 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP not power hungry, says Bandi Sanjay||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and cadre will not cowed down by the ‘harassment’ from the ruling Telangana Rastra Samithi (TRS) and will take inspiration from sacrifices made by the earlier generation of party leaders to ensure it comes to power in the next Assembly elections in 2023, claimed Telangana party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Tuesday. “We are neither power hungry nor hanker after power. However, the need for the BJP to form the next government here is imperative to provide justice to the poor and save Telangana from the current tyrannical regime. Many laughed at us when we were trying to form a government at the Centre too. Now, we are running a popular and clean government under the leadership of Narendra Mod,” he pointed out. Addressing a meeting on the occasion of the 41st anniversary celebrations of the party formation, Mr. Sanjay Kumar said the BJP had never compromised on its ideology or its principles in its quest for power. The fact that the Vajpayee government had resigned for missing the majority mark by a mere one MP without succumbing to any political blackmail was a good example. “We went back to people and got a renewed mandate from the people,” he said. Even when it did not have the numerical strength in Parliament or elsewhere, the party leaders and cadre always moved with the common people to understand their needs and problems. “We did not step back despite extremists and naxalites targetting our brethren over the years by continuing to espouse our cause and ideology,” claimed the BJP leader and Karimnagar MP. CRPF jawans The party chief also condoled the death of CRPF jawans in Chhattisgarh and claimed that when the BJP was in the government, the naxalite movement was effectively controlled whereas the security personnel lives have been lost under the Congress government. Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy stated that unlike other parties which are “family limited companies” mired in “corruption”, the BJP had won the trust of different sections of society and has been providing ethical and clean administration. Most MPs This has also been reflected in the party having the highest number of MPs belonging to the weaker sections and women in Parliament, he added. Senior leaders K.

So far some 40 youth had ended lives forcibly due to lack of suitable employment opportunities, the AICC spokesperson said. “It’s unfortunate that one more youth Mahendar Yadav has ended life as the government has failed to take recruitment process to fill the existing vacancies in all government departments. A private school teacher, Chandarashekar, who lost his job due to the pandemic, ended life unable to find any alternative employment. On Tuesday, Ravi, a Dalit teacher, also ended life in Nagarjunasagar due to the same reason,” he said giving some examples. Reminding the Chief Minister the days of Telangana agitation where he led the struggle, the Congress leader sought to know why he was unable to feel the same pain for the unemployed youth as he used to express then. He wondered why the government was not trying to taking even the minimum responsibility and protect at least the existing jobs in private sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/government-apathy-pushing-youth-to-end-life/article34259102.ece
07 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Officials prepare to deal with ‘grave’ situation||The raging second wave of COVID-19 has put senior officials in Telangana Health department on high alert. Discussions about the ‘grave’ situation are under way and preparations to attend more cases are being made, even as there are clear signs of officials dreading that the situation may go from bad to worse. On April 3, Health Minister Eatala Rajender said the department would resume providing COVID treatment at all government hospitals where the services were provided last year. Besides, he has directed officials to make available five hospitals in Hyderabad to treat and quarantine COVID patients. Corporate hospital managements have also been advised to reserve 50% of beds for COVID-19 patients, and to open COVID Care Centres at hotels to accommodate mild cases. All these steps indicate that the officials are preparing themselves to deal with an unprecedented spike in case burden. From a maximum of 370 daily cases from March 1 to 9, it has increased by more than four times by April 5 as the State recorded 1,498 new infections on Monday. Officials predict that the surge would continue as people take part in mass gatherings such as functions and assembling at religious places. Officials are closely monitoring clusters of cases which continue to be reported from some districts. Even as the caseload increases, people do not seem to be paying heed to safety norms like wearing masks and practising social distancing, and precautions such as avoiding mass gatherings. In such a scenario, the Health officials are aiming to contain the spread by vaccinating maximum number of eligible beneficiaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/officials-prepare-to-deal-with-grave-situation/article34259080.ece

Bringing down curtains on possibility of left wing extremists planting the tiffin box bomb targeting law-enforcing agencies, the police surmised that it could have been done by some persons practising black magic. Earlier, reports did the rounds of the tiffin box bomb being found on Marimadla-Manala stretch in Konraopet mandal of the district bordering Nizamabad. “As part of a government-related greenery project, the bushes were being cleared when some stray dogs started digging at a particular spot,” a local police officer said.

07 April 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||BJP ‘chargesheet’ against TRS, Congress||Leaders of the Congress party and the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) have constantly neglected the people of Nagarjunasagar Assembly constituency, and they have only done injustice to the people here, Bharatiya Janata Party’s national general secretary and Telangana in-charge Tarun Chugh said on Tuesday. “The Nagarjunasagar project provides irrigation to several districts, but not the people here. Those leaders have betrayed Nagarjunasagar, why vote for them?” he asked, at an event at Haliya. Mr. Chugh along with State BJP leaders released a ‘Chargesheet’ as part of the campaign for BJP candidate for the byelection to the Assembly seat. The book is “a piece of evidence of corruption, atrocities, false promises by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Congress former legislator K. Jana Reddy to the people of Nagarjunasagar constituency.” Addressing media persons at a private function hall, he recalled nine promises made by the TRS and contrasted them with the present situation. “Sweet lime farmers were assured of a juice factory, not even proposals are ready. Completion of Nellikal and Chintalapalem lift schemes was promised to irrigate 5000 acres, but farmers are still left holding empty coconut shells. They promised setting up a Government degree college, but shifting of B.Ed college out of Haliya goes on unopposed. Not even 30% houses get tap water under Mission Bhageeratha. Podu land dispute resolution was promised, but tribals are booked under false cases,” he said, elaborating on other issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-releases-chargesheet-against-trs-congress/article34259118.ece
07 April 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||Question BJP and TRS on price rise, unemployment: Congress||Former minister and senior Congress leader Mohammed Ali Shabbir called on the people of Nagarjunasagar Assembly constituency on Tuesday to elect Congress candidate K. Jana Reddy to change the course of Telangana politics. “Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is spending hundreds of crores for winning elections, to create a false impression that people are with him. Freeing Telangana should start with the defeat of TRS and BJP in Nagarjunasagar,” he said. He was addressing a meeting with minority leaders in Haliya town, and said people should question the TRS and the BJP governments about the constant price rise and unemployment woes. He observed that though the prices of crude oil in the international market fell, the same benefit was not passed to the taxpayer both under the Centre and the State governments, even as the tax burden and overall price of essential commodities is on the rise. While the BJP removed all subsidies, implemented demonetization and an unplanned COVID-19 lockdown, leading to rise in unemployment, in the State, the Chief Minister also failed to fill required vacancies, he said. “In the first term, KCR failed to honour the promise of creating one lakh jobs and in the second, he cheated the unemployed by promising the Rs. 3016 unemployment allowance scheme. While the vacancies are 1.91 lakh, KCR is assuring to fill only 50, 000 vacancies,” Mr. Shabbir said. He cited the suicidal deaths of Mahbubabad’s Sunil Kumar Naik and Sircilla’s Mahender Yadav, reportedly for lack of jobs, as the failure of the State. Later, meeting leaders of Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Hind, and discussing issues of reservations and budget allocation vis-à-vis expenditure for minorities by the current governments, Mr. Shabbir sought their support in the election of Congress contestant Jana Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/question-bjp-and-trs-on-price-rise-unemployment-congress/article34259119.ece

07 April 2021||Ghaziabad,||Uttarakhand in the grip of unprecedented forest fires||The video of Uttarakhand Environment Minister Harak Singh Rawat, which shows him trying to douse a forest fire with a bush in Chamoli district on Monday, that spread like wildfire on social media put the spotlight on a major issue being faced by the hill State that boasts of around 70% forest cover. In the last 24 hours, according to official sources, 75 incidents of forest fire — 50 in forest reserves and 25 in civil or van panchayat areas — had been reported affecting 105.85 hectares of forest land. In what is being seen as an unprecedented April, 414 incidents affecting 645.3 hectares, have been reported in the first six days of the month. Rajiv Bhartari, Principal Conservator of Forests held the high fuel load and consistent dry weather responsible for the high number of fire incidents. “Incidents of forest fire usually happen in Uttarakhand between February and June. Last year, we had had very few incidents during this period. It led to an excessive fuel load,” he said. Environmentalists feel the State government could have prepared itself better. Anoop Nautiyal, founder of the Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities Foundation, said when the first fire was reported in October 2020, the government should have known what was on the cards. “It is only April. What will happen in May and June when the temperatures soar further?”  NDRF team After Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s intervention, two helicopters have been pressed into service and a team of NDRF has been stationed in Haldwani. Mr. Bhartari said the fire had been contained on the ground and it has not risen to crown level in any of the districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/uttarakhand-in-the-grip-of-unprecedented-forest-fires/article34258969.ece

07 April 2021||GURUGRAM,||Demand for plasma grows over past week in Millennium City||Demand for convalescent plasma has grown steadily over the past one week in Gurugram with sudden spike in COVID-19 cases. However, there remains a mismatch between the supply and the demand, especially with people unwilling to come forward to donate the plasma. Department of Transfusion Medicine (Medanta Hospital) Director Aseem Kumar Tiwari said five-to-six requests for convalescent plasma were being received every day over the past one week. “The demand for plasma was almost nil since January this year, but we started getting requests 10 days ago,” said Dr. Tiwari. He added the demand was being met with the efforts of the social activists and the family of the patient also arranged donor in some cases. Dr. Tiwari said it was difficult than earlier to find a donor because those vaccinated were not eligible to donate and the mismatch between supply and the demand could widen. District Administration Plasma Donation Core Group member and social activist Lovleen Kumar Satija said demand had suddenly gone up over the past two days with an average two dozens requests for plasma every day. “It is really difficult to arrange a donor,” said Mr. Satija. However, there are few who have donated plasma multiple times. “I have come to donate my plasma for the fourth time,” said Sumit Rohatagi, 40, who donated plasma at Medanta Hospital on Tuesday. Arunesh Kumar, Senior Consultant and Head, Respiratory Medicine and Pulmonology, Paras Hospital, said the demand was exponentially high and gone up by 50%. Mahima, a doctor at Rotary club, running a plasma bank in collaboration with the district administration, said there were around 7-8 requests for plasma every day, and there were reaching out to previous donors for donations. Gurugram Chief Medical Officer Virender Yadav said ICMR in its guidelines last year had advised against “indiscriminate use of Convalescent Plasma Therapy”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/demand-for-plasma-grows-over-past-week-in-millennium-city/article34258944.ece
07 April 2021||Kurukshetra,||Farmers gherao BJP MP in Haryana, smash windscreen||Protesting farmers on Tuesday blocked a BJP MP’s car, smashing its windscreen as he tried to leave a party worker’s home, police said. Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini said police had a tough time getting him away from the protesters at Shahbad Markanda, 20 kms from here. In two separate incidents, groups of farmers raised slogans against Women and Child Development Minister Kamlesh Dhanda in Kaithal district and State BJP chief O.P. Dhankar shortly before he was to arrive for a party event in Panipat. Describing the attack on Mr. Saini as “murderous”, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said while it is the democratic right of farmers to hold a protest, violence will not be tolerated. Farmers protesting over the three new farm laws were sitting on a ‘dharna’ in front of Jannayak Janta Party MLA Ram Karan Kala’s home when they learnt that Mr. Saini had reached a BJP worker’s home in nearby Majri mohalla. They then gathered outside the BJP worker’s home while Mr. Saini had tea inside, police said. According to Mr. Saini, when he sat in the vehicle and tried to leave the place, over 50 protesters ‘gheraoed’ it. A few of them jumped over the vehicle’s bonnet while someone smashed the windscreen with a stone or a lathi. Police were deployed in large numbers in the area after the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/farmers-gherao-bjp-mp-in-haryana-smash-windscreen/article34258966.ece
07 April 2021||Mumbai,||Mumbai hospital fire: won’t arrest mall’s administrator, police tell HC||The Mumbai Police on Tuesday assured the Bombay High Court that they would not arrest Rahul Sahasrabuddhe, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)-appointed administrator running Dreams Mall where a hospital caught fire last month, claiming 11 lives. Mr. Sahasrabuddhe approached the HC last week, seeking a direction to the police to not take any coercive action against him. Additional public prosecutor Aruna Kamat Pai on Tuesday told a Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and Manish Pitale that Mr. Sahasrabuddhe was not yet named as an accused in the FIR lodged by the police on March 26. On March 25, a fire broke out in Sunrise Hospital situated on the fourth floor of Dreams Mall in Bhandup. The hospital had started functioning in October 2020. Eleven patients admitted to the hospital were killed in the blaze. On March 26, an FIR was lodged by the police against owners of Dreams Mall and directors of the Privilege Healthcare Services Private Limited, which owns Sunrise Hospital. In 2018, the Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd. that had owned Dreams Mall, lost the property to the NCLT, which then appointed Mr. Sahasrabuddhe as an administrator to supervise the functioning and operation of the mall. Mr. Sahasrabuddhe’s advocate J.S. Kini told the HC on Tuesday that he had received a letter from the police, asking him to appear before them. “The police told the petitioner (Mr. Sahasrabuddhe) that Sunrise Hospital had written a letter to the police asking them to initiate action against him for negligence and failing to do his duty,” Mr. Kini said. He argued that Mr. Sahasrabuddhe was appointed by the NCLT as the mall’s administrator. “In fact, the petitioner has written several letters to the NCLT, police and fire brigade informing them that the mall and the hospital were not conforming to the protocols and safety procedures laid down by the fire brigade,” Mr. Kini argued. The court said it would hear the plea on April 8. Pai then assured the court that until then, the petitioner would not be arrested by the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mumbai-hospital-fire-wont-arrest-malls-administrator-police-tell-hc/article34258960.ece
07 April 2021||Mumbai,||90% restaurants will have to be shut down in State, says hotel association||The new “Break The Chain” guidelines introduced by the State government would force almost 90% of restaurants to shut down completely due to continued losses, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) said. It said after having suffered unprecedented damage after last year’s lockdown of over eight months, the hospitality industry was headed at even worse consequences. “Over 20% of the hospitality establishments haven’t opened fully even after the lockdown was lifted and 30% of hotels and restaurants in the country have shut down permanently due to financial loss. The rest continued to operate in losses and revenues are below 50% of the pre-COVID-19 level,” it said. On account of the new guidelines, the HRAWI has appealed to the government to compensate employees engaged in the industry and their families for the loss of income, and also support hoteliers and restaurateurs by waiving all statutory fee, taxes, and utility bills. “Even after one year, the hospitality industry has not received any relief from the government. Of the approximately 30 lakh employees engaged in the industry directly in the State, 40% have faced job loss and the figures are only increasing,” Sherry Bhatia, president, HRAWI, said. “Many employees, who have just returned from their homes, will have to be compensated to ensure that their families are not made to suffer all over again. There is no way that the industry can survive another lockdown.” The HRAWI said the “Break The Chain” order was equivalent to another complete lockdown. Maharashtra has around 10,500 hotels and 210,000 restaurants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/90-restaurants-will-have-to-be-shut-down-in-state-says-hotel-association/article34259216.ece
07 April 2021||Mumbai,||Civil groups write to Uddhav, suggest measures to mitigate impact of curbs||In the wake of restrictions imposed by the Maharashtra government to control the second wave of COVID-19 in the State, 40 civil society organisations have written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray with suggestions related to migrant workers, livelihood, healthcare, vaccination, and food security. They have called for a 24-hour helpline to be set up to deal with specific issues people are facing. “A situation of lockdown would once again result in loss of livelihood, income, and lack of access to basic survival needs, which would severely affect the majority poor, who are yet to recover from the impacts of the national lockdown,” the letter said. It added that such a situation should entirely be avoided and instead, alternatives should be explored, and measures put in place to ensure that the public health emergency and economic crisis on account of the pandemic did not worsen. The organisations, who have been working with different communities for years and especially, during the lockdown, have submitted their suggestions to ensure poor communities do not face hardships in second straight year due to the restrictions. To prevent a migrant workers crisis again, it suggested provision of adequate notice, a proper system to ensure safe travel to their home towns/villages, food security through the public distribution system, shelters for those who had lost, or were in need of housing, and money or cash transfer for their sustenance. For food security, the letter said, foodgrains and rations must be made available to all, irrespective of documents they have. “Oil, fuel, cereals, other grains, and vegetables need to be included,” it said. On housing, the civil society groups suggested that rent moratoriums should be reapplied while government-run shelters should be provided to workers, homeless and poor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/civil-groups-write-to-uddhav-suggest-measures-to-mitigate-impact-of-curbs/article34258962.ece

People of the State have high expectations from the Home Department. My priority is to strengthen the police force and provide clean administration. I will ensure that no political interference is seen in administrative wok,” Mr. Walse-Patil, who took charge of the office on Tuesday, said. The minister clarified that he had heard of various police officials helping specific political parties. “First, let me collect all information. Then it will be clear as to who pledges allegiance to whom and after that action can be taken,” he said. About the department facing criticism over the alleged racket in police transfers, Mr. Walse-Patil said, “As far as transfers are concerned, I will be working as per the set procedure in various departments and rights given as per the hierarchy.” Mr. Walse-Patil said that the Maharashtra government would be approaching the Supreme Court against the Bombay High Court decision to direct the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe the alleged demand of collecting Rs. 100 crore extortion money by the previous minister. “We will, however, fully cooperate with Central agencies who will come to Maharashtra for any probe,” he said. When asked about his priorities, Mr. Walse-Patil said that implementing Shakti law, initiating police recruitment, and completing police housing projects are on his list. On the alleged groupism within the IPS lobby, the minister said that he could comment on it only after fully understanding the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/will-ensure-no-political-interference-in-police-administrative-work-walse-patil/article34258964.ece
07 April 2021||Mumbai,||Hiren murder: NIA takes Sachin Vaze to CSMT||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) took suspended police officer Sachin Vaze to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) in south Mumbai from where he had boarded a train to Thane on the day of businessman Mansukh Hiren’s murder, a police official said on Tuesday. In a CCTV footage of March 4, Mr. Vaze was seen taking a train from the CSMT to Thane. Hence, a team of the NIA took Mr. Vaze to the CSMT late Monday night to recreate the scene, he said. Later, the NIA also took Mr. Vaze to the Mumbra creek in Thane district were Hiren’s body was found on March 5. The NIA is conducting a probe into the case of an explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in south Mumbai on February 25 and the subsequent murder of Hiren. The probe agency arrested Mr. Vaze last month for his alleged role in planting the vehicle with explosives near Mr. Ambani’s house. During recreation of the scene at the CSMT on Monday, the NIA sleuths asked Mr. Vaze to walk on its platform no. 4 to compare his movement with the man seen in the CCTV footage, the official said. The NIA team, which spent over an hour each at the CSMT and the Mumbra creek, was accompanied by some witnesses, forensic experts, and Railway Protection Force officials. Earlier also, the NIA had taken Mr. Vaze to various places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hiren-murder-nia-takes-sachin-vaze-to-csmt/article34259213.ece
07 April 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Navi Mumbai civic body starts helpline for beds, ambulances||Owing to the increasing complaints of non-availability of COVID-19 beds, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) on Monday started a helpline number — 02227567460 — for those seeking beds and ambulances. Within 24 hours, over 240 calls were received. “Not all calls were for booking beds. While some were for enquiring if they could dial this number after their test reports came in, some were out of anxiety after experiencing virus symptoms,” an official from the corporation said. NMMC Commissioner Abhijit Bangar said there had been a rise in the cases of bed rejections. “Even though the NMMC portal would reflect the bed availability, on physically visiting the hospital, patients were denied beds. Hence, we started this helpline number which will have all the data on the bed availability at the civic-run facilities as well as private hospitals,” he said. Depending on the location, and symptoms, Mr. Bangar said, the caller would be guided about the bed. “Till the time a relative does not confirm successful admission of the patient, we will not close the call. The caller can also seek ambulance service. The helpline centre will continuously be in touch with the nodal officers who would update it about the real-time bed availability,” the Commissioner said. He also said that the bed availability portal of the civic body would soon be available in application. Currently, the NMMC has 436 ICU beds and 257 are planned to be added. Besides, there are 3,500 other beds — 2,000 oxygen beds and 1,500 normal beds. In the next 15 days, 2,000 beds would be added to the normal bed category, Mr. Bangar said. Recruitment of medical staff is currently under way. The highest single-day surge of 1,441 COVID-19 cases was reported on April 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/navi-mumbai-civic-body-starts-helpline-for-beds-ambulances/article34259214.ece

07 April 2021||New Delhi,||Jain reviews revamped Chandni Chowk||Public Works Department (PWD) Minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday reviewed the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk here on the heels of its inauguration. Mr. Jain directed senior officials from the department to make a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for essential and emergency services allowed at the revamped area where electric vehicles will be operated for the convenience of senior citizens. Inauguration on April 17 The redevelopment of the historic Chandni Chowk area has been completed with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal scheduled to inaugurate it on April 17, the government said. A sum of Rs. 99 crores has been spent on the entire project on which work began on December 1, 2018 and was targeted to be completed by November 2020 but got delayed by a year allegedly due to the pandemic, the PWD said. Tourism factor “Chandni Chowk is a historical site. It has been made beautiful to promote tourism and it is the responsibility of all of us to maintain its beauty. We have to ensure that the situation in Chandni Chowk does not become as it was before,” Mr. Jain said. While reviewing the project, the PWD Minister discussed facilities being offered to tourists on the redesigned stretch from the Red Fort to the Fatehpuri Mosque instructing that more illuminating LED lights be installed. Mr. Jain also suggested planting high-rise saplings on the street so that shopkeepers do not face problems. The Minister was told that Chandni Chowk had been developed in four phases. The width of the road carriageway on the stretch is 5.5 meters; for non-motorised vehicles, a 5- to 10-meter-wide pavement has been built on either side of the road. There is also a 2.5-meter footpath on either side of the road. Only manual rickshaws will be allowed on the redeveloped stretchand these will be marked. At the review meeting, the Delhi Police demanded 166 civil defence volunteers from the PWD Minister for action against motor vehicles entering the restricted area, citing manpower constraints till the cameras became operational. Mr. Jain directed the PWD to provide 75 volunteers for two months. Vehicles providing essential and emergency services will be allowed in the area from Red Fort to the Fatehpuri Mosque. The roads will be cleaned before 9 a.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/jain-reviews-chandni-chowk-revamp-project/article34258954.ece

07 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘Civic bodies have become financially weak due to political malice of govt.’||The BJP on Tuesday alleged that the Capital’s civic bodies had become financially weak due to the political malice of the AAP government over the last six years of its rule. Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra said not only were the corporations being denied funds constitutionally due to them but also funds enhanced as per the fourth Delhi Finance Commission cleared by the Delhi Legislative Assembly. “This has brought several public services to a standstill and employees are not getting their salaries. On one hand, these corporations are being deprived funds while on the other, AAP is busy in maligning the image of corporations with baseless allegations,” Mr. Malhotra said, adding that this is happening “despite the Delhi High Court reprimanding the Kejriwal government twice in a month it has still not honoured its directive in this regard”. The party alleged that the Delhi government owed Rs. 6,309 crore to the north, Rs. 4,590 crore to the east and Rs. 2,304.69 crore to the south Delhi municipal corporations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/civic-bodies-have-become-financially-weak-due-to-political-malice-of-govt/article34258953.ece

Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said: “The government should ramp up COVID-19 vaccination drive to give maximum jabs to people at free of cost, which is the only solution to control the pandemic surge and not night curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. as announced by the CM.” He added that the marriage season will start from April 13, besides the Navaratri festival, and the night curfew will create panic among the people as the government is yet to spell out the manner in which it would be enforced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/night-curfew-will-create-panic-cong/article34258947.ece

07 April 2021||SUJANGARH (CHURU),||Congress confident of getting ‘sympathy vote’ in Sujangarh||The ruling Congress is confident of getting “sympathy vote” in the upcoming Assembly by-election for the reserved seat of Sujangarh, where it has fielded the late Bhanwarlal Meghwal’s son Manoj Meghwal. The senior Meghwal was a Minister and had represented the constituency five times in his political career spanning four decades. Though Mr. Meghwal, 48, a salt trader, was not groomed as a politician, he expects to take forward his father’s legacy with the support of the committed voters of Congress. On the hustings in the villages, he has promised to complete the projects left unattended and launch new initiatives for development of the arid region in northern Rajasthan. The Churu district’s Sujangarh constituency has had a history of electing the Congress and BJP candidates alternately in the Assembly polls since 1985. Besides, the voters here have always elected the MLA of the party which formed the government in the State. Though this has given an advantage to the local politicians in raising the people’s grievances, the most important demand for making Sujangarh a district has remained unaddressed. Amit Marothiya, Deputy Chairman of Sujangarh Municipal Council, told The Hindu that the Congress would not only get the benefit of sympathy for the Meghwal family, but would also enjoy the support of farmers agitating against the Centre’s farm laws. “The majority of the 2.74-lakh voters here are Jats, followed by Dalits and minorities. At the present juncture, there is no reason why they will not support us,” he said. With an eye on the minority community’s votes, Mr. Meghwal recently played an instrumental role in the nomination of Nilofar Ghauri as the Municipal Council’s chairperson. Political analyst Ashfaq Kayamkhani said the BJP candidate, Khemaram Meghwal, who was earlier elected twice in 2003 and 2013, faced the challenge of uniting the rival factions led by Churu MP Rahul Kaswan and seven-time MLA Rajendra Rathore within the party. On the other hand, the Congress’ strategy of keeping the leadership confined to a single family might not be fruitful in the longer run, he said.  ‘Failure of Congress’ The BJP workers have highlighted the alleged failures of the Congress government in the election campaign and offered Mr. Khemaram’s vision for development as the solution for people’s grievances. “Mr. Khemaram’s simplicity is his strength. His experience as a Minister of State in the Vasundhara Raje government will be an asset for the people,” Buddhi Prakash Soni, former BJP block president, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/congress-confident-of-getting-sympathy-vote-in-sujangarh/article34258968.ece
07 April 2021||Vienna,||U.S. to join talks to salvage Iran deal||The United States is set to start talks with the European Union negotiators on Tuesday in Austria’s capital Vienna aimed at salvaging an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme, which Washington withdrew from in 2018. U.S. President Joe Biden has said he is ready to reverse the decision of his predecessor Donald Trump and return to the 2015 agreement, which was supposed to ensure that Iran never developed a military nuclear programme. But Iran is demanding an end to crippling sanctions imposed by Mr. Trump and has refused to meet U.S. negotiators at the latest talks, meaning European players will act as intermediaries. Ahead of the talks, U.S. special envoy Rob Malley suggested that the United States could be open to lifting sanctions and returning to the 2015 deal, comments Iran government spokesman Ali Rabiei called “promising”. “We find this position realistic and promising. It could be the start of correcting the bad process that had taken diplomacy to a dead end,” he told reporters in Tehran on Tuesday. Iran confirmed in January it was enriching uranium to 20% purity, well beyond the threshold set by the deal. Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group, which monitors conflicts, tweeted that the talks represented “an important marker that both U.S. & Iran are serious about breaking the inertia”. Since neither side appears willing to take the first step, experts such as Mr. Vaez have suggested that the negotiators could make a “gesture-for-gesture” deal to break the deadlock. Mr. Rabiei reiterated Iran was ready to reverse the steps it had taken as soon as all sanctions imposed during the Trump administration are lifted. “We do not accept a step by step approach,” he said. The European Union will preside over talks between current members of the 2015 pact — Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia and Britain — set to take place later on Tuesday at a luxury hotel. “Preparatory bilateral meetings are under way,” Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s Vienna-based envoy to international organisations, wrote on Twitter. The U.S. delegation will meet in a different hotel with EU negotiators acting as go-betweens. At the same time, expert meetings are expected to take place and could take “15 days, a month, we don’t know”, according to a Vienna-based diplomat. U.S. delegates are not part of those meetings, but will be updated. Kelsey Davenport, director for Non-proliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association think tank, said the lack of direct Iran-U.S. talks was not ideal but added that the EU was well situated to break the stalemate. She called for a “bold first step by both sides” which she hoped would inject “much-needed momentum” into the process. Washington, for example, could unfreeze Iranian funds held in foreign banks and facilitate humanitarian trade, and Tehran could stop enriching uranium beyond the levels agreed in the 2015 accord, said Ms. Davenport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-to-join-talks-to-salvage-iran-deal/article34258606.ece
07 April 2021||Amman/Jerusalem,||Palace row: Jordan’s Prince pledges loyalty to King||Jordan’s Prince Hamzah pledged loyalty to the King on Monday as the monarch accepted mediation over a rift within the royal family that saw the Prince placed under house arrest, the palace said. The government has accused the former Crown Prince Hamzah, half-brother of King Abdullah II, of a “wicked” plot and involvement in a seditious conspiracy to “destabilise the kingdom’s security”. Prince Hamzah, detained along with at least 16 others, had earlier struck a defiant tone saying he had been placed under house arrest inside his Amman palace, but insisting he would not obey orders restricting his movement. But in an apparent easing of the palace turmoil, the 41-year-old Prince pledged his backing to King Abdullah. “I will remain... faithful to the legacy of my ancestors, walking on their path, loyal to their path and their message and to His Majesty,” he said in a signed letter, quoted by the palace. “I will always be ready to help and support His Majesty the King and his Crown Prince,” he is quoted as writing. His statement came shortly after the palace said King Abdullah had agreed to enter mediation “to handle the question of Prince Hamzah within the framework of the Hashemite (ruling) family”. The job of mediator was handed to his uncle, Prince Hassan, himself a former heir to the throne. Prince Hamzah — whom King Abdullah stripped of the title of Crown Prince in 2004 — has emerged as a vocal critic, accusing Jordan’s leadership of corruption, nepotism and authoritarian rule. Meeting with critics A new audio recording that surfaced on Tuesday indicated that Jordanian authorities tried to silence the Prince for meeting internal critics but contained no mention of a foreign plot to destabilise the Western-allied monarchy that officials alleged he was involved in. The recording appeared to capture Saturday’s explosive meeting between Prince Hamzah and Gen. Yousef Huneiti, the military Chief of Staff, who came to the Prince’s palace to inform him that he was being placed under a form of house arrest. The Army chief is heard saying that the Prince was being punished because of meetings he had with individuals who “started talking more than they should”. The Prince responded: “You come to me and tell me in my house what to do and who to meet with in my country and from my people? Are you threatening me? ... You come to my house and tell me you and security leaders are threatening me? Not to leave your house, only go to your family and don’t tweet?” “The bad performance of the state is because of me? The failure is because of me? Forgive me but the mistakes are my fault?” he said. Gen. Huneiti, speaking in a calm voice, denied threatening him and said he was simply delivering a message from the heads of intelligence and general security. Neither man mentioned the King or a foreign plot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/palace-row-jordans-prince-pledges-loyalty-to-king/article34258611.ece
07 April 2021||yangon,||Myanmar activists splash red paint to protest junta bloodshed||Myanmar activists daubed roadways with red paint Tuesday to protest against the junta’s bloody crackdown on protests, as an online fundraising drive to support the movement neared the $10 million mark. The country has been in turmoil since the military ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1, rocked by daily clashes between protestors and authorities that have left at least 570 people dead. Ten of Myanmar’s ethnic rebel armies voiced support for the protest movement at the weekend, stoking fears that the country could slide into broader civil conflict, while the UN has warned of a looming “bloodbath”. On Tuesday, in the commercial capital Yangon, people smeared red paint and handprints on bus stops and pavements in protest at the military's violence. The so-called “bleeding dye strike” is the latest creative method thought up by protestors to voice opposition without risking being shot or arrested by demonstrating in person. One slogan painted on a bus stop said the military was being misused to protect junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, and urged soldiers not to shoot civilians. In the city of Hpa-an in eastern Karen state, youths sprayed red paint on the road, giving the three-fingered salute borrowed from the Hunger Games books and films that has become symbolic of the movement. Tuesday also saw rallies in the second biggest city Mandalay, as well as in Karen, and Kachin State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-activists-splash-red-paint-to-protest-junta-bloodshed/article34258604.ece
07 April 2021||Beijing,||Don’t team up, China cautions Japan ahead of Biden-Suga meet||China’s Foreign Minister cautioned Japan against teaming up with the U.S. to counter Beijing, as Japan speaks up more on human rights in the Xinjiang region in China and Hong Kong ahead of a U.S.-Japan summit next week. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart, Toshimitsu Motegi, in a phone call on Monday evening that their two countries should ensure that their relations “do not get involved in the so-called confrontation between major countries”, a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said. It quoted Mr. Wang as saying that “China hopes that Japan, as an independent country, will look at China’s development in an objective and rational way, instead of being misled by some countries holding biased view against China”. Japanshares U.S. concerns about China’s military buildup and claims to territory in the South and East China Seas. However, its major trade and investment interests in China have at times reined in its criticism of its larger neighbour. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is to travel to Washington to meet President Joe Biden on April 16 in what will be the U.S. leader’s first in-person summit since taking office in January. Mr. Biden, in contrast to his predecessor Donald Trump, has stressed rebuilding ties with European and Asian allies as the U.S. prepares for competition with a rising China.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/dont-team-up-china-cautions-japan-ahead-of-biden-suga-meet/article34258608.ece
07 April 2021||Jerusalem,||Netanyahu chosen to try to form Israel’s next govt.||Israel’s President unenthusiastically nominated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday to try to form a government, two weeks after the latest inconclusive election on March 23, but voiced doubt that any lawmaker could forge a parliamentary majority. Israel’s fourth vote in under two years failed to produce a clear path for any candidate to form a coalition capable of commanding a majority in the 120-member Parliament. On Monday, President Reuvin Rivlin held the traditional round of consultations that follow each Israeli election, seeking recommendations from party representatives on who they want to lead the government. Mr. Netanyahu secured 52 recommendations, while centrist Opposition leader Yair Lapid earned 45.

07 April 2021||Kiev,||Ukraine urges NATO to speed up membership||Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday urged NATO to speed up his country’s membership in the alliance, saying it was the only way to end fighting with pro-Russia separatists. Mr. Zelensky spoke with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg after an increase in clashes and Russian military movements on the border raised fears of an escalation of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. In a tweet after the call, Mr.. Zelensky said it was time for NATO to move forward with Ukraine’s longstanding desire for membership. He said Kiev was committed to defence reforms requested by the alliance for membership. “But reforms alone will not stop Russia,” said Mr. Zelensky, whose government has said it hopes to be invited this year to join a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP). “NATO is the only way to end the war in Donbas. Ukraine’s MAP will be a real signal for Russia.” Fears have been mounting of a major escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled separatists in the mainly Russian-speaking Donbas region since 2014. Ukraine last week accused Russia of massing thousands of military personnel on its northern and eastern borders as well as on the Crimean peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014. Kiev’s Western allies have rushed to its defence, with a series of statements warning Russia against taking further action. Mr. Stoltenberg said on Tuesday he had called Mr. Zelensky “to express serious concern about Russia’s military activities in and around Ukraine and ongoing ceasefire violations”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ukraine-urges-nato-to-speed-up-membership/article34258607.ece
07 April 2021||beijing,||Beijing holds aircraft carrier drills near Taiwan||China is holding naval drills involving an aircraft carrier battlegroup near Taiwan, which it said were aimed at safeguarding Chinese sovereignty, an apparent allusion to Beijing’s claim to the self-governed island. The navy said the exercises involving the Liaoning , one of its two aircraft carriers, were routine and assigned under an annual schedule. China has been upping its threat to take control of the island militarily with exercises and routine incursions into the island’s air defence identification zone by Chinese warplanes. The Navy’s statement late on Monday did not say when the exercises began, but it said more such drills would be held in future. It said the exercises aimed to “assist in improving the ability to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests,” terms often interpreted as being directed at Taiwan’s democratically elected government, which has refused to give in to Beijing’s demands that it recognise the island as part of Chinese territory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/beijing-holds-aircraft-carrier-drills-near-taiwan/article34258609.ece

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Stamp out the canker thwarting democracy||The 21st century is host to multitudinous crises impacting different sectors. For instance, the 2007-08 financial crisis seriously dented the economies of many nations, and the recovery has been slow, or sporadic. Since then, a succession of unrelated crises have heralded forebodings of still graver damage not only to the economy but also to the body politic and people everywhere.  Introspection and action The COVID-19 pandemic provided the backdrop for dire predictions of this kind. Its impact has been far reaching, which has included an economic tsunami, upheavals and dislocation affecting every sphere of human activity, an accompanying health crisis which has not spared any nation, and the fostering of a crisis mentality. The fact that the novel coronavirus pandemic shows few signs of abating is aggravating this crisis atmosphere.  Several other negative trends are simultaneously present. A churn in the post-1945 Westphalian order is only too evident. Across different continents, we are again witness to a series of political and strategic crises. Disinformation and distortions caused by an overload of fake information are creating an impression that the world is facing a systemic and multidimensional crisis, the consequences of which are unpredictable.  The combination of circumstances is exposing the fragility of today’s party-based democracies, leading to questions about their ability to deal with newer problems. As crisis upon crisis plagues nations and countries, anger is becoming a dominant aspect. The situation demands a great deal of introspection followed by conscious action. Finding an optimal combination of authoritarian, populist and democratic trends, to ensure the material well-being of the majority and achieving economic development is, however, not easy. Concerns are that it could lend itself to the rise of new political oligarchies, masquerading in the garb of defenders of democracy, and the creation of new elites professedly seeking to defend democracy.  Fair polls under threat Recent trends within this country tend to buttress such concerns. For instance, elections have of late become a kind of a no-holds-barred battle for power, irrespective of whether it is being held in a large State, a medium-sized State or even an Union Territory. Levels of electioneering increasingly lend themselves to abuse, rather than a highlighting of issues or policies. Innuendoes and personal remarks dominate political debates. Money power is all too evident, and violence is the leitmotif in many segments. The most threatened aspect is the concept of fair and free elections. Concerns whether the verdict reflects the true will of the electorate are, hence, bound to persist long after the results are in.  Even if an argument is put forward that many of today’s excesses do not reflect long-term reality, it is difficult to believe that the situation would return to the previous normal. Also that this is merely a dark chapter that will soon be forgotten. If this were true, it could be treated as a closed chapter, but this is unlikely to be the case. We may, hence, need to deal with this new reality, which puts greater reliance on authoritarian methods rather than on democratic means.  None of these would, however, still amount to an existential crisis. The real existential crisis that India confronts — in a period dominated by the pandemic and bitter electoral battles — is the virtual collapse of systems of governance in many States, as well evidenced by the events that took place recently in India’s Maximum City, and the nation’s economic capital, viz. , Mumbai. Holding a mirror What was played out in public is a searing indictment of India’s claims to be a state with an entrenched belief in order and the rule of law. No amount of rationalisation can possibly justify the saga of events that have been unfolding daily in this city, since the so-called discovery of gelatine sticks in an abandoned vehicle just across the residence of India’s richest businessman, which is located in one of the city’s most protected areas.  To this day, the police force has made no honest effort to determine why anyone should plant explosives in one of the most protected neighbourhoods in India, and believe that it would not be discovered (as so happened in this case), or what purpose was served by putting gelatine sticks without a triggering mechanism inside the vehicle. Instead, every attention has been devoted to making it a kind of free-for-all among members of the political class, the bureaucracy and the police hierarchy.  The main villain in the latest saga — which is a true reflection of the existential crisis we currently face — is a lowly assistant police inspector, S. Vaze, who personifies everything that is wrong with the system and not only of the police, whose unsavoury exploits have now become too well known. The Mumbai incident should be seen as merely the tip of the iceberg of what is the current reality, which is not confined to Mumbai city, but extends well beyond Maharashtra to other States in the country. Vaze would have been well served had he followed the sage advice proffered to Alexander the Great by a group of Jain philosophers, in the Fourth Century BCE, that ‘every man can possess only so much of the earth surface as this we are standing........., you will soon be dead and then you will own only just as much of the earth as will suffice to bury you’. Perhaps Mumbai and Maharashtra too might well have been spared the ignominy and the indignity of what we have been seeing. What comes through loud and clear, however, is that Vaze is a symptom of what ails several layers of the political, civil and law and order system across the country. What is worse is that much of this is well known to both the powers that be as well as the people at large. Both have been cohabiting in this space for years.  Even by the standards of a decline in police mores, the recent spate of disclosures confront us with an unpleasant reality that excesses of this kind, tend to occur almost daily. Established norms of conduct are sometimes given the go by during difficult periods, such as communal riots or other violent upheavals, but the extent of falsehoods indulged in by individuals in this instance has degraded not only the police force but also the entire system. What it signifies is anyone’s guess, but what is certain is that we have almost nowhere to go. This is the real existential crisis we confront today.  An alliance with a difference It may, hence, be time to embark on a new phase. It is no longer enough to merely define good policing or what kind of a relationship the community should have with the police. The reality is that it takes more than a courageous police leadership to stand up for the right policies, including not protecting officers who have clearly done something wrong. The situation has advanced far beyond this stage.  Consequently, we need to look at newer alternatives. Repeating ad nauseum about reforming the police and establishing yet another blue-ribbon committee to undertake a thorough overhaul of the police machinery is a recipe for yet another disaster to come. This kind of thought is neither original nor revolutionary. Police commissions cannot alter the milieu in which the police are compelled to operate, in which everyone — the politicians, bureaucrats and everyone in authority or presumes to have authority — seeks a police force that they can bend to their will. Added to this is the widespread corruption that casts a larger-than-life shadow over not only police functioning but every facet of public life. It should, hence, be obvious to the meanest intelligence that no amount of recommendations or the constitution of Supreme Court-monitored investigations of police excesses can bring about any real change. What is, perhaps, needed, or needs to be attempted, is an informal alliance of people and institutions, irrespective of ideology or interests (to the exclusion of activists of every hue, business titans and politicians) which should come together to coalesce into a mighty stream of public-spirited action and activity. Essentially, it means creating and executing a national public awareness campaign against the kind of excesses that have been allowed to continue, embarking instead on a determined campaign to stamp out the canker that is thwarting democracy and democracy-related procedures and actions. Creating such a movement and sustaining it will not be easy, but if the system is to be saved, there is a need to consider such real alternatives. M.K.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The start of a more authoritarian era||Why should anyone care that the Chinese government recently made drastic changes to the already undemocratic way in which Hong Kong’s Chief Executive and members of its legislature are chosen? As scholars of protest patterns and repressive actions, we feel these changes represent a devastating development. Changes in rules related to voting, vetting candidates, and apportioning legislative seats in a city that was never fully democratic could seem less alarming than more dramatic actions to curtail liberties in Hong Kong. But they are arguably just as threatening to the region’s political future. Listening to the people One way to appreciate the significance of the changes is to consider the long-standing tradition of ‘democracy with Chinese characteristics’. The concept is expressed as a pair of characters that are commonly rendered in English as ‘democracy’ but stand for more than just electoral campaigns, voting, and other aspects of institutionalised politics. In Cantonese, the characters are pronounced manzyu and on their own they mean ‘people’ and ‘rule’. Manzyu can suggest a system in which those who zyu (rule) listen to and provide for the man (people). Crucial to such responsive governance are mechanisms of accountability, which include more than simply voicing opposition though elections. Rulers can be responsive in different ways, such as listening to protest slogans, reading petitions, and engaging in dialogue with representatives of social groups. Under a hybrid regime that combines elements of liberal and illiberal institutions, Hong Kong citizens have forced one Chief Executive to step down before his term had ended and another one to decide against running for ‘re-selection’ in 2017. Popular protests have also compelled local officials — who were in part trying to show that they were willing to listen to the man and stay in power — to withdraw proposals in 2003 and 2012 when it became clear how disliked their plans were. In 2003, Beijing wanted the Hong Kong government to pass a law on national security and sedition. The proposal was withdrawn after protests. The same thing happened in 2012 when students led a struggle against the introduction of mainland-style patriotic education into local schools. With Beijing’s new electoral rules, and the quashing of protest and other forms of opposition since last summer, it is less likely that a future Hong Kong Chief Executive will face the threat of removal by popular opposition. The zyu can now rule without much worry about how the man will respond. There is less political space now for the creation of movements like those of 2003 and 2012. Many of the leaders of those movements, as well as key participants in the big protest surges of 2014 and 2019, are now incarcerated or in exile. A sketch of past electoral practices shows how the latest rules fit into the larger story of the manzyu phenomenon in Hong Kong. Deciding who occupies the top spot in the government has always been more a process of selection than election. Colonial Governors were appointed by the British Parliament without anyone in Hong Kong having a say. Since the 1997 Handover that made Hong Kong a Special Administrative Region of China, Chief Executives have been voted into office by an Election Committee comprising 1,200 members, nearly all of them pre-approved by Beijing. The list of candidates similarly needed Beijing’s approval. Under Hong Kong’s 1990 Basic Law (the closest thing the city has to a Constitution), the Chief Executive enjoys broad powers, but the legislature (Legislative Council, or Legco) holds a key check on executive power through a provision that forces a Chief Executive to step down under certain conditions: generally, when he or she cannot muster sufficient legislative support on budgetary or “other important bills”. While this contingency was always remote since it entailed snap elections and a new Legco’s continued opposition to a bill, the recent electoral changes now virtually rule out such a scenario. There were always blocks of Legco seats that were effectively controlled by the pro-Beijing establishment. Now there are significantly more. New rules The new arrangement shrinks the number of directly elected seats in Legco from 35 (half of the current 70) to 20, or less than one-quarter of the 90 seats in the expanded legislature. The other 70 seats will be split between 30 representatives elected from professions and occupations, and an astonishing 40 ‘representatives’ will be chosen by the same Election Committee — now with 1,500 members — that selects the Chief Executive. And just to be on the safe side, anyone who files to run for the legislature must be pre-screened by the Hong Kong government to ensure they possess sufficient ‘patriotic’ credentials. Non-patriots (e.g., critics of Beijing) need not apply. Even Hong Kong’s courts — once bastions in protections of political speech — are unlikely to help, since there is no recourse to appeal to them when one’s candidate application is denied on patriotism grounds. Being able to remove the Chief Executive was not the only manzyu feature of the old Legco; having a shot at close to half the seats also meant that opposition forces could temporarily block unpopular measures, which gave organisers time to ramp up street actions. It has always been clear that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would be able to prevent anyone it didn’t feel it could work with from becoming Hong Kong’s Chief Executive. But the new rules have changed the ‘card game’ from one in which the deck was stacked against pro-democracy forces to one in which ‘the house’ will always win — not just after a few draws from the deck but from the opening hand. Beijing has also made moves to make activities relating to Legco politics similarly stripped of the play of chance. Beyond elections, the new rules also matter because they fit into a broader assault on values and processes that have long set Hong Kong apart from cities on the mainland. It has been a political setting in which expressions of dissenting views had a clear place, both during the quickly liberalising final years of colonial rule and from the Handover until last year. These views could be voiced at most points not only in electoral politics or marches but also in annual political rituals and satire that flagged differences from the mainland. Now, though, marches that were once considered legal are routinely banned. The popular television show, Headliner , which aired comic sketches that mocked the policies of the colonial Governor before, and of the Chief Executive after 1997, has been pulled from the air waves. Student organisations are under pressure to curtail criticisms of the CCP and the Hong Kong government. Students are not permitted to put up critical placards on campus bulletin boards called ‘ Manzyu Walls’. All of these herald the arrival of a more authoritarian and less responsive era, in which the man of Hong Kong will continue to find ways to voice resistance but will have to do so in subtler ways. And in which there is less distance or contrast than ever between the zyu in Hong Kong and the far more powerful rulers in Beijing.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Reworking net-zero for climate justice||Global transformation is affecting the planet. But there is no uniform transformation across the world. Global temperature increased sharply only after 1981 with little contribution from the developing countries as their industrialisation and urbanisation had yet to begin. In 2015, at the UN General Assembly when the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 was adopted and at the Paris Conference, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed a reframing of climate change to climate justice, arguing that just when countries such as India were becoming major industrial and middle class nations, they should not pay the price for the pollution caused by the West. The Paris Agreement, explicitly recognises that peaking will take longer for such countries and is to be achieved in the context of “sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty”. This balance is now being upset for a common target and timetable, with non-governmental organisations (mostly foreign funded) in support and negotiators (mostly public servants) opposing the pressure. India will meet its Paris Agreement target for 2030, its per-capita emissions are a third of the global average, and it will in future remain within its share of ecological space. The pressure arises from the way the agenda has been set. Treaty’s inequity First, inequity is built into the Climate Treaty. Annual emissions make India the fourth largest emitter, even though climate is impacted by cumulative emissions, with India contributing a mere 3% compared with 26% for the United States and 13% for China. According to the United Nations, while the richest 1% of the global population emits more than two times the emissions of the bottom 50%, India has just half its population in the middle class and per capita emissions are an eighth of those in the U.S. and less than a third of those of China. Second, the diplomatic history of climate negotiations shows that longer term goals without the strategy to achieve them, as in the case of finance and technology transfer, solve a political problem and not the problem itself. The focus on physical quantities, emissions of carbon dioxide and increase in global temperature, measures impacts on nature whereas solutions require an analysis of drivers, trends and patterns of resource use. The current framework considers symptoms, emissions of carbon dioxide, and was forced onto developing countries to keep the discussion away from the causes of the problem , the earlier excessive use of energy for high levels of well-being.   Third, models on which global policy recommendations for developing countries are based consider achieving ‘reasonable’ not ‘comparable’ levels of well-being to show that early capping of energy use will not affect their growth ignoring costs on the poor. The different means to achieve the goals are not on the agenda because the rising prosperity of the world’s poor does not endanger the planet and the challenge is to change wasteful behaviour in the West. Role of infrastructure The vaguely worded ‘net zero’ emissions, balancing emissions and removals, could be disastrous for development latecomers like India because the current frame fails to recognise that more than half the global cumulative emissions arose from infrastructure, essential for urban well-being. First, infrastructure has a defining role in human well-being both because of the services it provides outside the market and the way it shapes demand distinct from manufacturing (production) and lifestyles (consumption), which alone are captured in model projections. Second, the global trend is that in an urbanised world, two thirds of emissions arise from the demand of the middle class for infrastructure, mobility, buildings and diet. There is no substitute to cement, steel and construction material, and worldwide they will need half the available carbon space before comparable levels are reached around 2050, while developed countries use most of the rest. For developed countries, peaking of emissions came some 20 years after infrastructure saturation levels were reached and net-zero emissions are being considered some two decades even later to take advantage of aging populations and technology. Third, because of its young population and late development, much of the future emissions in India will come from infrastructure, buildings and industry, and we cannot shift the trajectory much to reach comparable levels of well-being with major economies. For example, China’s emissions increased three times in the period 2000-2015, driven largely by infrastructure. New framework A global goal-shaping national strategy requires a new understanding. India must highlight unique national circumstances with respect to the food, energy and transportation systems that have to change. For example, consumption of meat contributes to a third of global emissions. Indians eat just 4 kg a year compared with around 68 kg per person for the European Union and twice that in the U.S. where a third of the food is wasted by households. Transport emissions account for a quarter of global emissions, are the fastest growing emissions worldwide and have surpassed emissions from generation of electricity in the U.S., but are not on the global agenda. Coal use Coal accounts for a quarter of global energy use, powered colonialism, and rising Asia uses three-quarters of it as coal drives industry and supports the renewable energy push into cities. India with abundant reserves and per-capita electricity use that is a tenth that of the U.S. is under pressure to stop using coal, even though the U.S. currently uses more coal. India wants to eliminate the use of oil instead with renewable energy and hydrogen as a fuel for electrification, whose acceleration requires international cooperation around technology development and transfer. In the Paris Agreement, ‘climate justice’ was relegated to the preamble as a political, not policy, statement. It needs to be fleshed out with a set of ‘big ideas’. The first is a reframing of the global concern in terms of sustainable development for countries with per capita emissions below the global average, in line with the Paris Agreement. Second, the verifiable measure should be well-being within ecological limits. Third, international cooperation should centre on sharing technology of electric vehicles and hydrogen as a fuel, as they are the most effective response to climate change.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Redefining combatants||A report in The New York Times on the October 2020 breakdown of the Mumbai power distribution system points a finger at Chinese cyber hackers. While the truth may remain hidden, the discussion points to a macro issue. When, and under what conditions, would a non-kinetic strike, say a cyberattack, be considered an attack on the state? And under international rules of self-defence, what response would be considered legal? Would only a cyber counter-attack be justifiable or a kinetic response also be acceptable? Would a pre-emptive strike be kosher? These and other questions are knocking at our door, even as the definition of combat and combatants undergoes fast mutation.  Changing definitions The universally accepted Lieber Code of 1863 defines a combatant. It says, “So soon as a man is armed by a sovereign and takes the soldier’s oath of fidelity, he is a belligerent...”; all others are non-combatants. An organised group of “belligerents” constitutes a regular armed force of a state. The 1899 Hague Convention brings in further clarity of what constitutes a regular force. First, the force should be commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates. Second, it must have a distinctive emblem recognisable at a distance. Third, it must carry arms openly. And last, it must conduct operations in accordance with laws and customs of war. Those who conducted the (yet unproven) Mumbai ‘cyberattack’ or the 2007 attack on Estonia’s banking system did not meet any of the four conditions of being called combatants, but still wreaked havoc. A combatant, thus, needs to be redefined due to three reasons. First, a cyber ‘army’ need not be uniformed and may consist of civilians. After the cyberattack on Estonia, the government set up a voluntary Cyber Defence Unit whose members devote their free time towards rehearsing actions in case of a cyberattack. A rogue nation could well turn these non-uniformed people into cyber ‘warriors’. Second, cyber ‘warriors’ do not carry arms openly. Their arms are malicious software which is invisible. And finally, the source of the attack could be a lone software nerd who does not have a leader and is up to dirty tricks for money, blackmail or simply some fun. None of these meet the requirements of The Hague Convention but the actions of these non-combatants fall squarely in the realm of national security. This raises two very basic inquiries that need deliberation. First, would the nation employing civilians in computer network attacks not be in violation of the laws of war? And second, if these people are considered as combatants, would the target country have the right to respond in self-defence? A response would be reactive, after the attacker has conducted his operation; hence, as a right of self-defence, would an act of pre-emption (through kinetic means and/or through cyber) be in order? This argument may appear far-fetched now but needs to be examined as India seems to have a new view on the concept of the right to self-defence. View of the right to self-defence In a February 24, 2021 UN Arria Formula meeting on ‘Upholding the collective security system of the UN Charter’, the Indian statement says, “...a State would be compelled to undertake a pre-emptive strike when it is confronted by an imminent armed attack from a non-state actor operating in a third state.” It adds that “this state of affairs exonerates the affected state from the duty to respect, vis-a-vis the aggressor, the general obligation to refrain from the use of force.” In a perceptive analysis of the statement, in Opinio Juris , Srinivas Burra, an Assistant Professor, opines that in a clear departure from established practices, “India... expressly contextualises its position on the question of the right of self-defence against the acts of non-state actors in international law.” Though used with reference to an “armed attack”, the implications of the statement, when viewed vis-à-vis cyberattacks done by faceless persons who are non-combatants as per international law, open up an avenue that requires careful examination; cyberattacks may not kill directly but the downstream effects can cause great destruction. International actions against hackers have been generally limited to sanctioning of foreign nationals by target nations. In 2014, for the first time, a nation (the U.S.) initiated criminal actions against foreign nationals (five Chinese operatives of Unit 61398 of the People’s Liberation Army) for computer hacking and economic espionage. The question is, how long before this escalates to covert and/or overt kinetic retaliation. India seems to have made its intentions clear at the UN meet, but this is a game that two can play; if not regulated globally, it could lead to a wild-west situation, which the international community should best avoid by resolute action.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||In Bengal, it’s advantage BJP||Regardless of the outcome in West Bengal, it is palpable that the State is going through a tectonic ideological shift towards the Hindu Right. Even if the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) wins the Assembly election and forms the government, lessons from Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh suggest that she might not be able to run it for another complete term. For a complete term, she would have to win by a massive margin, like the Aam Aadmi Party did in Delhi. For the TMC, it is not victory itself but the margin of that victory that will determine its future. This means that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in a win-win situation regardless of the outcome. The decision on the part of the Left-Congress coalition to run on their own making the electoral competition triangular has made the task for the BJP very easy to emerge as a dominant player. Nonetheless, the internal crisis of the Left parties, particularly the CPI(M), the big partner, both at the leadership and organisational level, is not any different from the Congress. The only difference is that the Left does not have a Gandhi for critics to take regular potshots at. With the Left cadres buckling in West Bengal and Tripura, one wonders whether those cadres were indeed ideological or mere appendages to state power of the time, as is the case with most machine politics. Finding its feet According to Prashant Kishor, key strategist for the TMC, the BJP’s victory in Bengal would transform India into a “one nation, one party”. This is a little exaggerated. The results of Assembly elections in Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan indicate that the BJP as a populist party remains vulnerable. It will take a few more elections for the BJP to find its feet in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Punjab, which will head to the polls next year, will present the most enduring electoral and ideological resistance to the Hindu Right. While the BJP has come very close to replicating the Congress in its heyday, its capacity to maim Opposition parties remains unparalleled in modern Indian history. This is where the BJP of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah is distinctly different from the BJP of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani or even the Congress of Indira Gandhi. The Modi-Shah BJP realises that state power is central to ideological goals and means are inconsequential. This is something that even the Left could not figure out. New developments The BJP’s emerging dominance has brought a paradigm shift in West Bengal’s politics in at least two ways. First, it has introduced caste politics in a way that never existed in West Bengal and which is expected to sharpen in the future. Second, it has resuscitated Hindu-Muslim politics on antagonistic lines in ways that might even surpass the bloody days of the 1930s and 1940s in Bengal. The politics of polarisation around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act will perpetuate ethnic unrest in Bengal’s various regions. This will have repercussions far beyond its shores, both inside and outside India. Peace between Hindus and Muslims is the single-most significant accomplishment of the Jyoti Basu-led Left Front regime. Now that stands in tatters. The Sachar Committee Report of 2006 and the Pratichi Report of 2016 documented the rather spectacular failure of the Left and TMC regimes in addressing poverty among Muslims. No other social group will be more devastated by the arrival of the BJP as Bengal’s ruling party than the Bengali intelligentsia, which has helped build the dominant narrative against the Hindu Right. Despite being direct victims of India’s violent Partition, prominent figures like Amartya Sen have remained consistent critics of dark forces of Hindu majoritarianism. The secular narrative of Bengali intelligentsia will continue, no doubt.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Fits and starts||After a month of moves and messages that indicated a détente, events last week appear to have slammed the brakes on the India-Pakistan dialogue process. The moves began with a ceasefire announcement at the LoC in February, followed by Indus water talks, sporting visas and other measures, including official speeches by Pakistan’s top leadership pushing for regional rapprochement, and salutary messages exchanged between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Imran Khan. Despite the growing bonhomie, however, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi decided not to meet or even exchange greetings at a conference in Dushanbe last week. And then days later, Mr. Qureshi led a charge of Cabinet Ministers who opposed a move by Pakistan’s Economic Coordination Committee to reopen imports of Indian cotton and sugar, arguing that it would violate Pakistan’s commitments on Kashmir. Subsequently, Mr. Khan announced he was dropping the import proposal he had made in his capacity as Commerce Minister, and that ties with India would not be normalised unless the Modi government revoked its steps of August 2019, on Jammu and Kashmir and Article 370. New Delhi, which has chosen not to comment on the events of the past month, and has not denied reports that claimed India-Pakistan moves were part of a back-channel dialogue facilitated by other countries, has also made no comment on Mr. Khan’s U-turn. While such swings have been common in the India-Pakistan engagement, the present scenario poses questions. If talks are indeed under way behind the scenes, it is unclear why Pakistan’s import decision was not better coordinated before being publicly announced. The move followed a speech by Pakistan’s Gen. Bajwa where he stressed the need for geo-economics, trade and connectivity to be prioritised for regional prosperity. So, if it is not the all-powerful Army Chief or the ‘Pakistani establishment’ that is playing the “spoiler”, the Khan government must identify who it is. It is significant that New Delhi has chosen not to press its advantage over the embarrassing confusion in Pakistan’s stand, or react to its unworkable demand on Article 370, which has drawn India’s sharp comments in the past. This might indicate that the dialogue that has reportedly been on for months has been paused and much will depend on whether any other outlooked steps, including the restoration of High Commissioners in each other’s capitals and LoC trade that was suspended for security reasons in 2019, or commitments from Pakistan on cross-border terrorism, are announced next. If the nascent re-engagement is to have any chance, there must be also more clarity on what the two governments have decided to embark upon and hope to achieve from it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fits-and-starts/article34258582.ece
07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Mayhem in Myanmar||The violence of March 27, Myanmar’s Armed Forces’ Day, in which over 100 protesters were killed, has sent shockwaves. India, which initially expressed its “deep concern” and called for the “rule of law” and “the democratic process” to be upheld, had stopped short of directly condemning the junta’s violence. It had also sent a representative to attend Saturday’s celebrations. But on the day India’s defence attaché, along with the representatives of seven other countries, including China, Pakistan and Russia, was attending a massive military parade in Naypyidaw, the junta was gunning down its people. The violence and the prolonged crisis seem to have triggered a stronger response from several capitals, including New Delhi. On April 2, India, which has cultivated deep ties with Myanmar’s civilian and military leaderships, condemned “any use of violence” and called for “restoration of democracy”. There is growing international appeal for ending the bloodshed, but the junta seems unperturbed. Even after the March 27 killings, protests and regime violence continue. According to independent agencies, the junta has killed over 570 civilians, including 46 children, since the February 1 coup. When the regime resorted to violence, it may have calculated that swift repression would extinguish the fire for freedoms, like in 1988 and 2007. But there is a fundamental difference this time. If in the past the protests erupted against the continuing military rule, in February, the military usurped power from an elected government after a decade of partial democracy. Those who enjoyed at least limited freedoms, first under the transition government and then under Aung San Suu Kyi, have built a stronger resistance to the junta this time. Street protests are not the only challenge the Generals are facing. The banking system is on the brink of collapse with most staff on strike. Cash is scarce and prices of essential goods are rocketing. Industrial workers are also on strike, bringing the pandemic-battered economy to its knees. The Generals’ efforts to bring bank and government employees and port and industrial workers back to work have been unsuccessful so far. Worse still, armed insurgent groups have thrown their weight behind the protesters, triggering fears of a wider civil conflict. The Generals are unlikely to give up power on their own. They should be nudged to end the violence and make concessions. Initially, India and China, both vying for influence in Myanmar, were ambivalent in condemning the junta’s violence because they did not want to antagonise the Generals. But an unstable Myanmar is not in the interest of any country. India, China and other countries in ASEAN should heap pressure on the junta and work towards restoring democracy in Myanmar, which is the only way forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mayhem-in-myanmar/article34258583.ece

War along the present line would be preferable,” he said addressing the United Labour Party convention here yesterday. Gen. Dayan said Israel was not at war with the Soviet Union “and I hope with all my heart that we shall not find ourselves fighting Russian soldiers.” He said, he hoped the threats against Israel being heard from Moscow did not represent the Russians’ policy in Cairo and that they would use their influence there against war and for peace. Earlier, addressing the same convention, the Israeli Foreign Minister, Abba Eban, expressed hope for a Middle Eastern Community on the lines of the European Community. This was not an impossibility, he added. Mr. Eban rejected the proposals for international guarantees, rather than agreed and secure borders. He said: “The Jewish people throughout its long history has had rather too many guarantees and not enough geography.” Mr. Eban said guarantees, which would have the backing of the United Nations, would not necessarily be lasting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/no-pull-back-to-pre-war-borders/article34258591.ece
07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||‘India growth outlook of 12.5% faces severe risks’||After an estimated contraction of 8% in the 12 months ended March 31, India is projected to grow at 12.5% in the current fiscal year, an outlook that, however, now faces significant downside risks because of the ongoing wave of COVID-19 in the country, the IMF said on Tuesday. The International Monetary Fund’s ‘World Economic Outlook (WEO): Managing Divergent Recoveries’ — released ahead of the virtual World Bank-IMF Spring Meetings — also forecast India’s economy to expand by a relatively more sedate 6.9% in the next financial year. The projections for India were based on evidence to support the normalisation of economic activity, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath stressed at a press conference, adding that these forecasts had preceded the current wave of COVID-19 in India, “which is quite concerning”. Observing that the growth projections in the outlook did already take “a fairly conservative view”, IMF economist Malhar Nabar added, “but it’s true that this very worrying uptick in cases… poses very severe downside risks to the growth outlook for the economy”. On the global economy, the IMF said it expected growth to rebound to 6% this year, after an estimated contraction of 3.3% in 2020 (calendar year), before easing to 4.4% in 2022. There were, however, significant divergences within and between countries, it observed. Projections for 2021 were slightly higher than they were in October 2020 due to fiscal support in some large economies and a vaccine-supported recovery. A 1.3 percentage point forecast upgrade for the U.S. especially contributed to this, resulting in U.S. growth projections being reset to 6.4% and 3.5% this calendar year and next, the fund said. The U.S. GDP level in 2022 is forecast to be higher than in a non-pandemic scenario — the only large economy for which this is true. Other economies are also expected to rebound this year albeit at a slower rate, as per the IMF. The Euro Area is projected to grow at 4.4% and 3.8% over these time periods; China, at 8.4% and 5.6%. World economy Global growth is projected to settle at 3.3% in the medium term due to damage inflicted on supply potential as well factors that pre-date the pandemic such as ageing (which has resulted in slower labour force growth in advanced economics and some emerging markets). “Recoveries are also diverging dangerously across and within countries, as economies with slower vaccine roll-out, more limited policy support, and more reliant on tourism do less well,” Ms Gopinath said. Averting divergent outcomes would mean “resolving the health crisis everywhere” the IMF said. The average annual loss in per capita GDP over the 2020-24 period relative to pre-pandemic forecasts is expected to be 5.7% in low-income countries and 4.7% in emerging markets. For advanced economies, this number is lower at 2.3%. “Such losses are reversing gains in poverty reduction, with an additional 95 million people expected to have entered the ranks of the extreme poor in 2020 compared with pre-pandemic projections,” the IMF’s chief economist said. Pointing to uneven recoveries within countries, Ms. Gopinath wrote in the outlook that the unskilled, young and women had been impacted more.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-growth-outlook-of-125-faces-severe-risks/article34258573.ece

Following this agreement, Bharti Airtel will receive a consideration of Rs. 1,037.6 crore from Reliance Jio for the proposed transfer. In addition, Reliance Jio will assume future liabilities of Rs. 459 crore relating to the spectrum, Bharti Airtel said in a statement. “The sale of the 800 MHz blocks in these three circles has enabled us to unlock value from spectrum that was unutilised,” said Gopal Vittal, MD & CEO (India and South Asia), Bharti Airtel. “This is aligned to our overall network strategy.” As per the agreement, which is subject to statutory approvals, Reliance Jio will acquire the right to use spectrum in the 800MHz band in Andhra Pradesh (3.75 MHz), Delhi (1.25 MHz) and Mumbai (2.50 MHz) circles through spectrum trading. In a separate statement, Reliance Jio said it would now have 2 x 15MHz of spectrum in the 800MHz band in the Mumbai circle and 2 x 10MHz of spectrum in the 800MHz band in the Andhra Pradesh and Delhi circles, thereby further consolidating its spectrum footprint in these circles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/bharti-airtel-to-sell-spectrum-to-reliance-jio-in-rs-1497-crore-deal/article34258567.ece

Addressing a summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) virtually, Mr. Tyagi said SEBI had issued an advisory providing an illustrative list of information that should be disclosed about the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Companies must avoid selective disclosures while revealing material information, he said. “Since the onset of the pandemic, with its attendant uncertainties and accompanied restrictions, corporate boards across the world are facing complex new problems to tackle with,” he said. “A critical area that emerged during this pandemic was the need to provide adequate level of disclosures to stakeholders about the health and performance of the company amid the uncertainty,” the SEBI chief said. “The company boards should ensure that adequate disclosures are provided timely to stakeholders and there is no asymmetry of information,” he said. Mr. Tyagi said disclosures should include the impact of COVID-19 on business, performance and financials.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Capitals eager to curve their redemption arc towards glory||Over the last two seasons, Delhi Capitals has seemed firmly on the redemption course. After failing to make the playoffs for six successive editions, Capitals finished in the top three in 2019 and reached the final in 2020. This year, too, Capitals begin as favourites to make the playoffs. Even without injured captain Shreyas Iyer — and with all-rounder Axar Patel set to miss the start of the tournament after testing positive for COVID-19 — Capitals have the bench-strength to get past the league stage. Under new skipper Rishabh Pant, on a high in the last four months, Capitals boast of the much sought-after ‘balance’ of a formidable playing XI. For Pant, much has happened since the last edition of the IPL. The flamboyant youngster’s place in the national squad, in all formats, stands cemented and he has brought about noticeable improvement in his wicketkeeping skills. Luxury of options Capitals’ batting line-up offers a few right-left combinations, followed by the luxury of options among the available all-rounders before the bowlers almost select themselves in the playing XI. All credit should go to the team’s think-tank, headed by coach Ricky Pointing, for the decisions taken before and during the recent auction. Capitals let go of players who did not fit the plans and invested in all-rounder Tom Curran (Rs. 5.25 cr.), Steve Smith (Rs. 2.2 cr.) and wicketkeeper Sam Billings (Rs. 2 cr.). They also added Umesh Yadav (Rs. 1 cr.) as a back-up pacer. Up front, openers Shikhar Dhawan and Prithvi Shaw have displayed good recent form, as if with a vengeance to make up for the string of poor innings. Ajinkya Rahane provides the calming influence in the company of Shimron Hetmyer/Smith and Pant before all-rounders such as Marcus Stoinis/Chris Woakes make a late charge. Ishant back In the bowling department, Capitals have the services of the South African duo of Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje, with a fit-again Ishant Sharma back as the other specialist pace option. Curran, Stoinis and Umesh could take turns in making the playing XI. Spinners R. Ashwin and Amit Mishra add variety. Once Axar is back, Capitals need look no further. At least on paper, Capitals seem prepared for ‘death-over bowling’ which caused some worry in the previous edition. With their resources in order, Capitals have the capability to go all the way. After all, Ponting will settle for nothing less from this brigade.  My first match as captain will be against Mahi (Dhoni) bhai. It will be a good experience for me as I have learned a lot from him. I have my own experience as a player as well Rishabh Pant   I am looking forward to making the most of this opportunity [to lead]. We haven’t won a title yet and I will try my best to get a title this year. We've been playing nicely as a team for the last two-three years and our preparations are going on well   He [Ponting] has been so amazing for us in the last two-three years. He brings energy to the team    X-Factor   Rishabh Pant: This supremely confident youngster could unleash his stroke-making skills to make the decisive difference to his side’s fortunes. Although captaincy is unlikely to affect the way he bats, the faith shown by Capitals should see him put a price tag on his wicket and stay longer at the crease.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/capitals-eager-to-curve-their-redemption-arc-towards-glory/article34258682.ece
07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||We judge by actions, so why force umpires to judge on intent?||Deception is an acknowledged part of sport. Basketball players look left and pass right, footballers feint to catch defenders off guard, tennis players charge as if preparing to play a forehand drive and then tap the ball gently over the net, badminton players leap to smash and finish with a drop shot instead — the list of deceptions that are legal is a long one. As is the list of illegal deceptions — using performance-enhancing drugs, diving into the box in search of a penalty in football, playing below par in return for money, and more. Three years ago, a new section was added to the Laws of Cricket under ‘Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batsman (Law 41.5).’ I have watched the run out of Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman in the recent ODI against South Africa many times, and there is only one conclusion to be drawn. Wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock fooled the player by pointing to the non-striker’s end causing the batsman approaching him to slow down. The throw hit the stumps and Zaman was given out. De Kock’s immediate reaction was a “Hey, I fooled you” smile; the commentators praised his wit and sharpness while his captain Temba Bavuma called it “quite clever”. De Kock deliberately misled the batsman and according to Law 41.5.1 it was an unfair dismissal. According to the ESPNcricinfo correspondent, match officials are unlikely to penalise either de Kock or his team. Two issues There are two issues here. Let’s take the more important first — the question of intent. This is something umpires on the field are expected to take a call on in a split second. Umpires are trained professionals who know and understand the laws of the game. And now with the electronic eye assisting them, get a high percentage of decisions right. But to expect a human being to get into the head of another to judge intention is both unreasonable and undoable. We can only judge by actions, my father used to say, only god can judge by intentions. To present umpires with this ethical conundrum — no DRS can read a player’s mind, after all — is unwarranted. There is too the question of parity. The penalty for pretending to take a catch or a fake throw is five runs. That’s the same penalty as for ball tampering. So either ball tampering is not such a big deal, or a fake throw is a severe breach of the law. If we expand the argument further, cricket is a game of deception in so many ways. Here ‘deception’ is used in the sense that the ‘deceiver’ is providing incomplete or erroneous information to his opponent who has to decide on the basis of such inadequate data. The leg-spinner fools the batsman into misreading his googly, the master of the reverse swing upsets the batsman’s expectations, the batsman who reverse sweeps makes a mockery of the bowler’s field placing. The argument that an addition to the law was required because a fake throw or a false dive might fool the batsman into not taking a run doesn’t hold. The onus is on the batsman to keep his eye on the ball or trust that his partner is doing so. Wicketkeepers are notorious for getting a runner to relax by using their body language to suggest the opposite of what is actually happening. Mahendra Singh Dhoni sometimes dropped his shoulders and even looked away from the scene of the action to trick a batsman into misjudging a run or relaxing at the wrong end. Fielders fake in jest, wicketkeepers do so too. Kumar Sangakkara and Jonny Bairstow, among others, have done it at international level presumably to hurry the batsman or watch him needlessly dive for the crease. One of de Kock’s teammates defended him later saying the wicketkeeper was asking for a fielder to back up at the non-striker’s end. Was he? Who can judge intent? Players know how to make things look accidental. Was a shot offered or was that deliberate padding? That’s another question the umpire has to answer on intent. And so to the second issue. Yes, as the law stands, de Kock ought to have paid the price. But, not surprisingly, no one wants to make that call. Even the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), custodian of the Laws would only say:“The Law is clear, with the offence being an attempt to deceive, rather than the batsman actually being deceived. It’s up to the umpires to decide if there was such an attempt. If so, then it’s Not out, 5 Penalty runs + the 2 they ran, and batsmen choose who faces next ball.” This is true of course, but the umpires could do with some guidance. At any rate, that section of the law needs to be looked at again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-judge-by-actions-so-why-force-umpires-to-judge-on-intent/article34258579.ece
07 April 2021||Chennai/MUMBAI,||Kiran More tests positive||Three days before Mumbai Indians begins its Indian Premier League title defence, its talent scout Kiran More has tested positive for COVID-19. The former India wicketkeeper’s diagnosis is the first case of a franchise representative having been infected in a bio-secure bubble of the IPL. “Kiran More is currently asymptomatic and has been isolated. Mumbai Indians and More have followed all the BCCI health guidelines. The MI medical team will continue to monitor More’s health and abide by the BCCI protocols,” the team said in a statement. Over the last week, players Axar Patel, Nitish Rana and Devdutt Padikkal tested positive, but their test results were confirmed either before joining the team or during the isolation period before entering the bio-secure bubble. It is understood that with the recent surge all over India, the IPL hierarchy is not taking any chances and has started testing all the individuals in the bubbles daily. It is also learnt that in case any other member of the MI camp is found to have contracted the virus by Wednesday, the IPL authorities may be forced to tinker with the schedule. Mumbai Indians is scheduled to face Royal Challengers Bangalore at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Friday night. BCCI secretary Jay Shah, IPL chairman Brijesh Patel and BCCI interim chief executive Hemang Amin didn’t respond to queries about the concern regarding a positive case in the bubble. However, the development has certainly made a few other franchises jittery. While no one was willing to comment on it, a couple of franchise executives, on condition of anonymity, hoped the case turns out to be a one-off and the “schedule doesn’t need to be altered”. More has been a part of an extended MI entourage, which had formed a bubble in a hotel in suburban Mumbai before leaving for Chennai on March 31. It is understood that he had cleared all the mandatory tests in Mumbai and Chennai before his test result returned positive. More, a renowned wicketkeeping consultant too, has been attending various team activities over the last week in Chennai. In the photographs shared on social media by Mumbai Indians, More has been seen in the team’s training sessions at the SSN College ground and a team meeting in the hotel. The former India chief selector had taken the first shot of the vaccine in Vadodara on March 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kiran-more-tests-positive/article34258684.ece

07 April 2021||KOLKATA,||Bio-bubble is tough, but Indians have handled it well: Ganguly||Former India captain Sourav Ganguly feels for the present-day cricketers who have been living in a bio-bubble for months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The BCCI president said life in a bio-bubble was never easy. “In the last six or seven months, with so much of cricket going on in the bio-bubble, it’s so tough. Just room and ground, handle the pressure on the ground, come back to the room and get back to the ground. It's an absolutely different life. Stay positive “Look at the Australian team. They were supposed to go to South Africa for a Test series. They refused to go because they said their mental health was not good — going away from families, not being able to see the country, not being able to go out in the open and always being in COVID scare. You have to stay positive, you have to train yourself mentally,” said Ganguly at the virtual launch of the Mpower Kolkata centre on Tuesday. According to Ganguly, the Indians handled pressure better. “You have seen in the last two or three years so many successful people, including athletes overseas, have come up and said I need mental help. I feel we Indians are a bit more tolerant than the overseas athletes. I have played with so many Englishmen, Australians, West Indians... they just give up on mental health.” Talking about pressure in a sportsperson’s life, Ganguly cited an example from his career. “I was the captain of India till 2006. Immediately after that, I was dropped for three-four months. During those four months, I had a terrible time mentally. 20 laps of Eden! “One day I was training at the Eden Gardens and I was very angry. “I kept running and running, and I did not know that I had finished 20 laps of the Eden Gardens! That’s what you go through as an individual. It’s about preparing individuals to go through tough situations,” said Ganguly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bio-bubble-is-tough-but-indians-have-handled-it-well-ganguly/article34258728.ece

07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Latvia favourites, but we are ready’||Facing Latvia spearheaded by 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko will be a big challenge for India in the upcoming Billie Jean King Cup World Group play-off tie on April 16 and 17. But India’s No. 1 woman’s tennis player Ankita Raina isn’t worried as she is preparing hard with the ace Sania Mirza in Dubai. “They will be the favourites, especially the way they played the United States and with their top-50 ranking. But we are ready for this challenge,” said Ankita, catching a breath between her tennis and gym sessions, on Tuesday. In a season in which she has had a sound start — competing in doubles at the Australian Open, winning a WTA doubles title, and stepping up the quality of her game overall — Ankita felt that she was steadily moving up. “I have had a good start to the season. Definitely feeling confident about better performances ahead. I can see the improvement in my game. Will do my best to continue and take it forward,” she said. It was a pleasant surprise for the 28-year-old Ankita to be invited by Sania to stay with her in Dubai and train. Sania an inspiration “It is great to train with Sania. She has been a World No. 1 in doubles for long, won Grand Slams and been top-30 in singles. She is an inspiration to all of us, not just tennis players. She is ready to share her experience with us. It is a great opportunity to stay with her, train and converse off court. “It is even more inspiring to see her passion for the sport after becoming a mother. She has so much to say about tennis and how to prepare for big events. She is giving me minute tips to be more effective,” gushed a thrilled Ankita, a sincere student of the sport. Having had prior experience of playing some of the world's best players, Ankita knows that one has to compete without worrying about results. “Yes, both Jelena Ostapenko and Anastasija Sevastova (World No. 47) are good. It is going to be a challenge for us. [But] we all practice day in and day out so that we can face such challenges and make the most of the opportunities,” said Ankita. The tie will be played on the indoor hard courts at the National Tennis Centre Lielupe in Jurmala.  Jelena Ostapenko and Anastasija Sevastova are good.

07 April 2021||New Delhi,||Arjun Maini seeks a few podium finishes||The first Indian driver to secure a full-time racing deal in Germany’s DTM series, Arjun Maini has no qualms conceding that he would be up against a difficult field, but is nonetheless hopeful of a few podium finishes with his Mercedes-AMG Performance Team GetSpeed. The 23-year-old from Bengaluru will be seen in action at the DTM touring car championship in June. “Everybody knows how big the DTM championship is and I followed it while growing up as well and now to be a part of DTM as a Mercedes-AMG driver is an honour. I am really excited,” Arjun said during a virtual press conference. “Every driver will say they want to win but it is very difficult line-up this time and we have to keep our foot down and heads above shoulders and keep working from day one. “We had a good start last week. Of course we want to deliver some podiums and race wins but I am focussing on the small steps that we need to take to make it possible.” The 2021 DTM begins on June 18 with eight rounds and 16 races scheduled across prominent European racetracks.

07 April 2021||Bengaluru,||‘No need for Padikkal to quarantine’||Devdutt Padikkal can join the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) team in Chennai immediately after he tests negative for COVID-19, as he does not need to undergo the quarantine process, RCB head coach Simon Katich stated. Big relief This will come as a big relief to RCB, which opens its IPL campaign on Friday at Chennai. Padikkal, who tested positive on March 22, is currently recovering at home in Bengaluru. “Devdutt will be available for practice immediately after he arrives in Chennai. From what I’ve been told, he does not need the quarantine process. The medical officers have informed me that Devdutt can came to Chennai and start training straightaway. In a way, he is in the same situation as Virat (Kohli), Washington (Sundar) and A.B. de Villiers, who get out of quarantine on Wednesday,” Katich said in an interaction on Tuesday. Katich backed Yuzvendra Chahal to come good in the IPL, despite the leg-spinner’s recent struggles. In the India-England T20I series last month, Chahal picked up only three wickets in three matches, at an economy rate of 9.9. He was replaced by Rahul Chahar in the last two outings. Impressive record Chahal’s IPL record, however, is undeniably impressive. The 30-year-old finished the previous two editions as RCB’s highest wicker-taker. Chahal is also the ninth-highest wicket-taker in IPL history, with 121 scalps. “England are a very good team, and Chahal had a tough time. However, in the IPL, his record is second to none. He’s done a great job for RCB. Chahal bowled very well in our first practice match — he took wickets, got spin and had all the variations. At his best, he’s a match-winner. We start our tournament in Chennai, which historically assists spinners,” Katich said. RCB has four specialist spinners — Chahal, Washington Sundar, Adam Zampa and Shahbaz Ahmed — to choose from. Katich stated that he is comfortable with the safety measures that are in place in the IPL, in the wake of the surge in COVID-19 cases. The league has suffered a few scares, with groundsmen and staff at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai testing positive, apart from some players (KKR’s Nitish Rana, DC’s Axar Patel and RCB’s Padikkal) and team staff. “The cases are a lot higher in India this time around. But we are confident that the people employed by the BCCI will ensure that the bubble is not breached,” Katich said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-need-for-padikkal-to-quarantine/article34258681.ece
07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||We will have to train with a lot of intensity, says Edu Bedia||FC Goa skipper Edu Bedia stressed the need to be smart as the club embarks upon its maiden AFC Champions League campaign. The Indian Super League side, which finished fourth in the recently concluded campaign, will come up against clubs with Champions League pedigree. Goa’s Group E, which begins on April 14 in Goa, is made up of last season’s finalist Persepolis FC (Iran), Qatar’s Al Rayyan and the playoff winner of Al-Wahda (UAE) and Al-Zawraa (Iraq). All four nations’ club competitions are among the top 10 in the AFC rankings, while India is placed 15th. Goa finished the ISL league stage with the highest average possession (58%) and second-most number of passes (9665) but acknowledges it won’t enjoy a familiar superiority in the continent’s biggest stage. “Keeping in mind their level, we will have to work hard and train with intensity in preparation for this,” said Bedia, who has La Liga experience under his belt. “It’s important to remember that we are not used to this experience. We are a team that likes to keep a lot of the ball but we might not see a lot of the ball. It might become a possession-based game then we need to be smart about it. Obviously, whenever we get chances, there will be few and far between, we need to take them.” While Goa last played on March 8, its opponents are in the middle of their domestic competitions. Bedia welcomed the week-long break at the end of a five-month-long ISL season in a bio-secure bubble, however, head coach Juan Ferrando expressed concerns over getting the intensity levels back up. “The teams [opposition] are working week by week in intensity. It’s game, training, game for them. For us, the last month has been training, training, training,” said Ferrando, who recovered from COVID-19 last week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-will-have-to-train-with-intensity-bedia/article34258726.ece
07 April 2021||Seoul,||North Korea will not go to Olympics: sports ministry||North Korea will not attend this year’s Tokyo Olympics because of the coronavirus pandemic, Pyongyang’s sports ministry said, dashing Seoul’s hopes of using the Games to restart talks with its neighbour. The isolated North’s participation in the last Winter Games, hosted by the South in Pyeongchang, was a catalyst in the diplomatic rapprochement of 2018. North Korea’s Olympic Committee “decided not to participate in the 32nd Olympic Games in order to protect players from the world public health crisis caused by COVID-19”, said the Sports in the DPR Korea website, run by the sports ministry in Pyongyang. But analysts said other factors may have been at play. The announcement — dated Monday — reported a meeting of the national Olympic committee on March 25.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Essence of sacred literature||Kooratazhvan’s Varadaraja stava is in praise of Lord Varadaraja of Kanchi. It is based on the Vedas and the Divya Prabandham, and therein lies its appeal. If sugarcane and cane juice were both offered to us, would we not prefer the latter? Chewing the cane is cumbersome, and if we can get its sweetness in the form of an extract, we will, naturally, go for it. In the same way, Koortaazhvan’s work scores by giving us the substance of all sacred literature, said P.B. Rajahamsam in a discourse. Kooratazhvan refers to Lord Varadaraja as nissama, which means none is equal to Him. But Kooratazhvan also uses the word abyadhikam while praising Varadaraja. This means there is none superior to Him either. A similar sentiment is expressed by Nammazhvar when he talks about Oppiliappan, the deity of a temple near Kumbakonam. When He took the Trivikrama avatara, the Lord measured all the worlds. What more proof is needed of His Supremacy? In verse two of Varadaraja stava, Kooratazhvan refers to Lord Varadaraja as Srinidhim nidhim. Why did he use the word ‘nidhim’ in succession? It is not to be seen as a repetition, but as a meaningful and necessary praise of the Lord and His Consort. Srinidhim shows the inseparability of the Divine Couple. It is futile to think of One without the Other. She is the One who brings us close to Him. She gives us the confidence that He will save us. She convinces Him that He should overlook our faults and grant us the refuge of His feet. She guides the seeker to mend his ways. She coaxes the Lord to forgive us. She reminds Him of His qualities of daya and kshama, for with such qualities, how can He be unforgiving of our blemishes? If He is unresponsive to Her pleas, She uses Her charm to bring Him round.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/essence-of-sacred-literature/article34258674.ece

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Big shot||If there is one artiste in Malayalam cinema inspiring aspiring actors, it would be Joju George. His journey from a junior artiste ( Mazhavilkoodaaram , 1995) to one of the bankable stars in the industry has been nothing short of a dream run. Having emerged as a versatile actor, Joju is elated that he has some interesting films lined up for release. Ready to hit screens on April 8 is Nayattu , directed by Martin Prakkat. Joju will be seen in yet another police role in Nayattu . “I might have played over 40 police characters till date. But this is a cut above the rest. He is a hefty character, literally and figuratively. I was at my heaviest, 132 kilogram, when I did the role!” laughs Joju, adding that he is now trying to get back in shape. Without revealing much about the plot, Joju says that Nayattu is a “survival movie”, revolving around three police personnel, SI Maniyan (Joju), Praveen Michael (Kunchacko Boban) and Sunitha (Nimisha Sajayan) who are on the run. “The film also looks at the lives of policemen, up close and personal, an aspect that has been rarely explored in our cinema,” he adds.  Nayattu is scripted by real-life cop, Shahi Kabir, who wrote the thriller, Joseph , which took Joju’s career to new heights.“I was the first one to hear the story of Nayattu , when we were working on Joseph . I love Shahi’s stories as I can easily connect with the emotions that he puts across. His characters are real and rooted,” says Joju. The actor points out that Nayattu will be a project that Malayalam cinema will be proud about. “A lot of effort has gone into the script, designing the plot, shooting location, choosing the cast…There are many new faces who have given vibrant performances,” he says. This is his first work with Martin as an actor, although they have jointly produced films such as Charlie and Udaharanam Sujatha . “When I asked him for a role in his directorial debut, ABCD , he said I was not ready! (laughs) I don’t know whether I was in his mind when he heard the story of Nayattu . Since the film has been shot in sync sound, I haven’t seen the film as a whole. But I am sure this will be a prestigious project in Martin’s career; you can see his growth as a director,” he adds. Joju admits that he still has not come to terms with the fact that he is getting to share the screen with big names in Malayalam cinema. “I’m excited when I meet them. I often wonder if it was difficult for them to accommodate an artiste like me who came into cinema playing blink-and-you-miss kind of roles,” he says. He makes note of his recent release One , a political thriller, in which he plays Babychan, secretary of the ruling party and a classmate and close friend of Chief Minister Kadakkal Chandran, played by Mammootty. “When I used to go from one film location to another looking for roles, I would watch Mamm ookka [Mammootty], Lal ettan [Mohanlal] and other actors from a distance. I wouldn’t dare to go near them. My friends used to come with me then. Many years later , after watching One , one of my friends told me that he had goosebumps when he heard me address Mammookka as ‘ eda’ (Hey you) in a scene. Chackochan [Kunchacko Boban] was already a star when I met him the first time; he has always supported me.” Joju’s upcoming releases are Malik , Thuramukham, Pada, Star and Oru Thathwika Avalokanam . “Besides intense characters, there are a couple of feel-good roles as well.               I might have played over 40 police characters till date. But the one in Nayattu is a cut above the rest. He is a hefty character, literally and figuratively.

07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A natural fit||Popular Malayalam digital platform Karikku, made its Netflix début with a sketch video Ripper — The Wanted Killer . Uploaded on April 3 on Netflix India’s YouTube Channel, it has already garnered 10 million views — one of the highest figures for the channel. This figure, Karikku founder Nikhil Prasad says, is “high and fast growing” even for the OTT platform. He had been in talks with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video for other content when this project came up for discussion. “It was intended as a promotion for the Malayalam film Irul which is streaming on Netflix. We suggested this format instead with a video reference to Irul in the sketch, an idea that Netflix agreed,” he says.  Irul starring Fahadh Faasil and Soubin Shahir, and directed by Naseef Yusuf Izudin, released on Netflix on April 2. Formed in 2018 by Prasad, Karikku has grown into one of the top digital content creators in Malayalam with almost seven million followers on YouTube. It hit the jackpot after conceptualising the hugely popular YouTube series Thera Para . The cast of Ripper... too comprises Karikku and Thera Para regulars Anu K Aniyan, Arjun Ratan, Jeevan Stephan, Sabareesh Sajjin, Kiran Viyyath and Unni Mathews. Prasad, who is the writer/director, has pegged the script on Karikku’s core strength, which is humour, and incorporated an element of horror. Not only the cast, even the location for Ripper... is the same as Thera Para . “It’s the same house where we shoot our episodes!” The almost 17-minute episode revolves around a serial killer on the loose in Kochi, and a group of friends who alternate between being afraid and joking about it. “We had complete freedom to create what we wanted to and how. There was no interference on the part of Netflix and they are very happy with how everything has turned out,” Prasad says. Karikku is now in talks with other OTT platforms as well about content creation, with their impressive début on Netflix only helping to make the convincing part easier, Prasad believes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-natural-fit/article34259201.ece
07 April 2021||April 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Hear her growl||“From October to January, we were just looking for a recording studio that could give us a slot,” says Anusha Rema, lead vocalist of fledgeling metal outfit Avekn. They had three songs to record for their first EP, but the COVID-19 lockdowns put those plans — like innumerable others — on hold. The EP is finally out now, and the tracks have been received with surprise. With its comparatively mild sound, it is being described by many as “gateway rock”, says the duo over phone. “People who normally do not enjoy metal music are surprised to find that they actually like it, and can follow the lyrics instead of dismissing it as noise,” laughs Keshav M, the guitarist who makes up the second half of the alternative metal act. Keshav was formerly with the Chennai-based four piece metal band Fobia Deimos — the founding member left to be a part of Avekn in 2019, helping Anusha with her vocals and creating compositions around her lyrics for the album that has been nearly two years in the making. Anusha, on the other hand, had been lending her vocals to indie acts of various genres around town, while working on her own tracks on the down low. Her musical interests go beyond metal — “I listen to jazz, and classical piano music,” she says, “I have listened to metal growing up, but never thought that kind of vocals was something I could do. Then Keshav came along, encouraged me, and here we are.” The duo only had only each other for the album: percussions were created via software. “Keshav works on sharing the story through music, and I just have so much to say through lyrics — it’s almost like a rant,” says Anusha, following it up with a nervous little laugh that belies the anger, frustration and hopelessness of her songwriting. The opening track, ‘The Point Of It All’, is all about the daily grind and existentialism. ‘Rude Awakening’ the song, on the other hand, takes on a more menacing note, questioning reality and perceptions through lyrics accompanied by a rather sinister composition. The third and final song, ‘Black Leather Brock’ was co-written by Anusha and a friend and set to a high-energy barrage of music — this is where Anusha really gets her growl on. The duo has no plans of making its music heavier anytime soon. “This kind of genre is something we have not heard from a lot of bands — instrumentation that is not too heavy, lyrics that don’t get buried in the music. We want to toe this line for a while, and see where we can go with it,” signs off the vocalist.  ‘Rude Awakening’can be streamed on Spotify, Amazon Music, JioSaavn, iTunes and Amazon Music.   I have listened to metal growing up, but never thought that kind of vocals was something I could do.

07 April 2021||Ghaziabad,||Rakesh Tikait reaches out to Dalit farm hands||Reaching out to Dalit labour in farms, Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, said on Tuesday that farmers should take care of Dalit labour that works in their fields. “Whoever works in the field is a Dalit. Without their support, your protest would neither be complete nor meaningful,” said Mr. Tikait while addressing a ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ in the Hafizpur area of Hapur that has a significant Dalit and Muslim population. He appealed to farmers to worship sage Valmiki. “Every rural household should have a photo or idol of the age. It is the community that makes your households worth living,” he asserted, giving the slogan of Jai Bhim, Jai Ram . Talking of social alliances, Mr. Tikait said the place has a significant Muslim population too. “First, this government declared Muslim outsiders and termed them Pakistani. When Sikh farmers protested, they were dubbed as Khalistani… We have to overcome these divisive forces,” he said. “I appeal to farmers if there is a protest in another part of the country on issues that concern you, you should respond by holding a protest here. We need to build a pan Indian alliance,” he said.  ‘Formula of 3T’ Reiterating his formula of 3T, Mr .Tikait said the jawan with his tank, the farmer with his tractor and the youth with his Twitter (account) would lend solidarity to farmers’ protest. Earlier, he unveiled a symbolic martyrs’ memorial at the Ghazipur border with social activist Medha Patkar. It has been dedicated to 320 persons who lost their lives during the farmers’ protests. Describing the building of the memorial as part of Mitti Satyagrah (soil satyagraha), Mr. Tikait said any farmer from across the country could bring soil from his village and mix it here. Addressing the gathering, Ms Patkar said the government was busy diving the society. “I salute this movement because it brought farmer and farm labour, male and female farmer on the same platform.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rakesh-tikait-reaches-out-to-dalit-farm-hands/article34258903.ece
07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Four hurt in clash between civil defence volunteers, commuters||Four persons, including three civil defence volunteers, sustained injuries when a quarrel broke out between them and commuters near the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in south Delhi on Monday. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Thakur said that two cases, based on the complaint from both sides, have been registered at the Hauz Khas police station. The police said that a PCR call was received around 3 p.m. regarding a quarrel at the red light signal near IIT-Delhi gate. When they reached the spot, it was revealed that the volunteers were issuing challans for not wearing masks. Just when the traffic lights turned green, the volunteers stopped a car to penalise its driver for allegedly not wearing a mask, they said. Car hit from behind As a consequence, the driver suddenly applied the brakes and the next car, driven by Gitesh Dagar, also abruptly stopped. Mr. Dagar’s car was hit from behind by another vehicle due to the sudden halting, an officer said. Mr. Dagar argued with one of the volunteers who allegedly then attacked him with a belt. Eventually, other commuters joined and attacked the volunteers along with Mr. Dagar.  The police said four persons sustained injuries and they have been taken to a hospital for medical examination. Their statements have also been recorded.  Mr. Thakur said that a case under Sections 186 (whoever voluntarily obstructs any public servant in the discharge of his public functions), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered based on the complaint given by the volunteers. Another case under Sections 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 354 (whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any woman, intending to outrage her modesty), 509 (word, gesture, act intended to outrage modesty of a woman), 427 (mischief causing damage ), and 34 (common intention) of the IPC has been registered based on Mr. Dagar’s complaint. Civil defence volunteers are not authorised to issue challans. They can assist officials who are authorised by the district administration to issue challans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/four-hurt-in-clash-between-civil-defence-volunteers-commuters/article34258936.ece
07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Guard dies after iron girder falls at abandoned construction site||A 50-year-old watchman died after an iron girder of an under-construction railway bridge fell on a truck in West Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh on Monday night. The police have registered a case into the matter. Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Prashant Gautam said that the deceased has been identified as Ram Bahadur, a resident of Ashoka Park. He belongs to Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur. The police said a call was received around 10 p.m. regarding the incident. When police reached the spot, it was revealed that the bridge was under construction but had stopped a few years ago after which the space underneath it was allegedly illegally used for parking trucks. Bahadur used to work as watchman at the parking space to ensure no theft takes place. “On Monday night, Bahadur was sleeping in one of the trucks and the iron girder fell on the same vehicle crushing him to death. He was taken to hospital where he was declared brought dead,” said a senior police officer. The girder was subsequently removed. The body was sent for post-mortem and the family was informed. The police said that a case has been registered and further investigation is under way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/guard-dies-after-iron-girder-falls-at-abandoned-construction-site/article34258934.ece
07 April 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. to revive 2,000 eco clubs inactive due to the pandemic||The Delhi government is trying to revive about 2,000 ‘eco clubs’ in schools and colleges, many of which became non-functional during the pandemic, according to officials. The department is also planning to make many activities of the clubs online and organise events and competitions to sensitise students. “We are trying to revive the clubs. Due to the pandemic, schools were shut and there was no way to organise events and spend funds on programmes. On Wednesday, we are organising a virtual meet with different organisations and teachers to brainstorm ideas on how to run these clubs during the pandemic. We will have to move at least part of the activities online,” a Delhi government official said. “The idea of these clubs is to make students aware about the environment and teach them to protect it. This will have a ripple effect on thousands of households, as they will talk about it to their families,” the official said. Grants for institutions Last year, the department surrendered Rs. 2 crore, which was earmarked for the eco clubs. Eco clubs used to organise various campaigns, quiz competitions and awareness programmes on the theme of environment. Colleges and senior secondary schools are eligible for a grant of Rs. 50,000 a year for each eco club and the amount is Rs. 30,000 for secondary schools and Rs. 20,000 for middle and primary schools. Rupa Arora, former in-charge of an eco-club at a government-run school in Shalimar Bagh, said they would be able to do better programmes once they start getting the grants. “In our school, the club has about 50 students. We used to take them to gardens to study different types of trees and they also used to take charge of a herbal garden at the school. We organised rallies for promoting ‘cracker free’ Deepavali and poster competition for students,” said Ms. Arora. She said if the school starts getting the grants, they will be able to give prizes to students for various competitions. “Even during the pandemic, the club was not completely dead. We organised quizzes and activities. Earlier, we used the grant money to buy seeds, pots and for trips for students to gardens or other places. This year we don’t even have money to make banners,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-to-revive-2000-eco-clubs-inactive-due-to-the-pandemic/article34258938.ece
07 April 2021||New Delhi,||HC warns against ‘wishy-washy medical reports’||The Delhi High Court has warned against “sketchy and incomplete” medical reports given by hospitals and doctors being used for the grant of bail or extension of bail of inmates and undertrials. Justice Subramonium Prasad cautioned that “private doctors who submit such sketchy, wishy-washy medical reports are guilty of an offence under Section 192 of the Indian Penal Code”. Section 192 IPC deals with fabricating false evidence. The High Court noted that advantage was being taken of the fact that judges are not medical experts and are therefore unable to correctly appreciate the nature of the ailments. “The accused try to get their bail extended even though they are not suffering from any serious ailments which require them to be released on interim bail,” the HC said. The HC passed the order while hearing a plea challenging the bail granted to a jail inmate on medical grounds. The court said that the inmate had “abused” the law as the surgery performed on him was “purely for cosmetic purposes” and only a ruse to get bail. Licence cancellation “A serious note is taken of such skimpy, wishy-washy medical documentation and the licence of such doctors should be cancelled if found to be lacking/falsely done,” the court said. “Sketchy, wishy-washy medical documents from any random private doctor with ambiguous, incomplete documentation in illegible handwriting will not be entertained in future, rather viewed seriously with suspicion,” the High Court ordered. It ordered that in future, medical reports from the jail hospital must clearly state the history, examination findings and clinical diagnosis, and the interpretation of the diagnosis in simpler terms for the judges to understand. In case an inmate is referred to a referral hospital then the medical report must, among other points, state the diagnosis, its simpler interpretation, and whether the disease was treatable by conservative medical management or if surgical intervention was required.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-warns-against-wishy-washy-medical-reports/article34258928.ece
07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Stretch from NH-44 to Western Yamuna Canal to turn signal-free||The stretch of the Urban Expansion Road-I (UER-I) from the National Highway-44 to the Western Yamuna Canal would be made signal-free with the addition of U-turns, the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry said on Tuesday as HUA Minister Hardeep Puri inaugurated a flyover-cum-road over bridge (ROB) at Narela. In a virtual ceremony, Mr. Puri opened the ROB that is a part of the plan to decongest Delhi and develop Narela, the Ministry said in a statement. “The ROB will provide smooth connectivity between densely populated Narela and Bawana, which are upcoming residential and industrial hubs in north-west Delhi. There used to be traffic congestion in the area as railway crossing was a bottle-neck on the route,” the Ministry said. The crossing, which sees over 150 trains passing through daily, is a busy one with about 80,000 cars moving across every day, it said. The 1,680-metre-long ROB, built at a cost of Rs. 389 crore, was funded 80% by the Urban Development Fund of the HUA Ministry and 20% by the Delhi Development Authority. The ROB is about 2.5 km away from NH-44 and connects the NH (GT Karnal Road) to Bawana-Auchandi road, the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/stretch-from-nh-44-to-western-yamuna-canal-to-turn-signal-free/article34258930.ece
07 April 2021||New Delhi,||Court allows termination of 24-week pregnancy due to foetal abnormality||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday allowed a woman to abort her more than 24 weeks pregnancy after taking note of a medical board’s report that the foetus suffers from substantial abnormalities. Medical report The High Court said the medical report indicated there was also a risk to the woman during the pregnancy termination procedure as she was a cardiac patient and was being administered blood thinners. Before granting the permission, the High Court also spoke to the woman’s husband to find out whether he understood the risks associated with the procedure. In India, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act stipulates a ceiling of 20 weeks, for termination of pregnancy, beyond which abortion of a foetus is statutorily impermissible. The woman, in her plea moved last week, stated that she is in the 24th week of her pregnancy and on carrying out medical examinations, it has been reported that the foetus is suffering from facial haemorrhage and hydrocephalus. The plea had challenged the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act which restrict medical termination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks. The plea argued that the provision providing for the 20-week ceiling may have been reasonable when the section was enacted in 1971 but has ceased to be reasonable today where technology has advanced and it is perfectly safe for a woman to abort at any point during the entire period of pregnancy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/court-allows-termination-of-24-week-pregnancy-due-to-foetal-abnormality/article34258926.ece

07 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Lab on wheels unveiled to impart education||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia inaugurated a lab on wheels, which is part of Delhi Technological University’s (DTU) Education Reaches You Scheme, on Tuesday. The lab will impart science education to students in Delhi government schools and under privileged children. The Minister also inaugurated DTU’s new classroom complex Pragya Bhawan and a new centre for the Department of Design. Customised bus The lab on wheels is a customised bus with 17 computers, two televisions, one 3D printer, cameras and normal printer that will hop around the city to give educational lectures, tutorials and teach school students as part of its outreach programme for guiding students in the domains of maths, science and advanced technology. Education movement After inaugurating the lab, Mr. Sisodia said that it will add joy in learning for students as it will act as an information and guidance cell. He urged all the 14,000 students of DTU to become mentors for at least one student so that students of Delhi government schools can receive the best guidance to be future-ready, and their dream of studying reputed courses like engineering can be fulfilled. “Only building school infrastructure will not be sufficient to bring a mass movement in education.

07 April 2021||New Delhi,||Withdraw Prof. Saibaba’s termination: DUTA to V-C||The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) on Tuesday wrote to Vice-Chancellor P.C. Joshi over the termination of service of professor G.N. Saibaba by the Ram Lal Anand (RLA) College. Demanding the university to review and withdraw any action against Mr. Saibaba, the DUTA in its letter to Mr. Joshi said: “We wish to reiterate that since Dr. Saibaba’s appeal before the High Court has been admitted and listed for hearing, the matter is sub judice and original proceedings are continuing, the case against him cannot be regarded as final until all appellate remedies are exhausted.” The teachers’ body also cited the instance of professor S.A.R. Geelani of Zakir Hussain College (evening) who was an accused in Parliament attack case of 2001 and later acquitted by the High Court. “Dr. Geelani was suspended after his arrest in Parliament attack case and his service was not terminated despite his conviction and award of death penalty by the trial court. He remained under suspension and was reinstated upon acquittal by the High Court. It is submitted that, similarly, any action against Dr. Saibaba, should await the final decision of the HC in the matter of his appeal,” read the letter. The DUTA also said that that the letter to terminate services was served without waiting for a reply to a show cause notice earlier served to Mr. Saibaba. “The decision to terminate his services without waiting for his reply, when he is unable to respond seems arbitrary, vindictive and against the principles of natural justice,” DUTA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/withdraw-prof-saibabas-termination-duta-to-v-c/article34258939.ece
