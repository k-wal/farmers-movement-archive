06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Lavrov-Jaishankar talks today||An important round of discussion between India and Russia will take place on Tuesday between the visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar. Mr. Lavrov who will be accompanied by Moscow’s Special Envoy on Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov is expected to brief the Indian side about the Russian plans regarding the difficult peace process underway in Afghanistan. Tuesday's meeting will provide India with a window to share its frank assessment about the continuing scenario in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control. Mr. Lavrov’s visit will coincide with the tour of India by the U.S. President Joe Biden’s Envoy for Climate John Kerry. The U.S. Embassy’s spokesperson said on Monday that Washington views “India as an important partner on future clean energy research, development, and deployment”. Mr. Lavrov had visited China in March where both countries put up a joint front against the United States. India, on the other hand, has called upon China to withdraw from the remaining friction points along the LAC following the spirit of disengagement that was achieved at Pangong Tso earlier. Mr. Kabulov’s presence in the discussion will provide a first hand briefing on the latest Russian moves on the Afghan front. He has argued for engaging the Taliban of Afghanistan for a fruitful negotiation. Updates on talks Russia held a summit on Afghanistan on March 18 where India was not invited. Tuesday’s meeting is, therefore, being interpreted as a Russian move to update New Delhi about the latest on the issue. Mr. Lavrov is expected to call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his April 5-6 visit which will conclude on Tuesday afternoon with his departure for Pakistan, where he will meet Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lavrov-jaishankar-talks-today/article34249301.ece
06 April 2021||New Delhi,||Fight against Maoists will be intensified, says Shah||The fight against the Maoists will be intensified in the coming days, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has said. Mr. Shah, who flew to Chhattisgarh on Monday, two days after the April 3 attack at Tarrem in Sukma where 22 security personnel were killed, said the killings were “an act of desperation by the Maoists” and the fight would soon take a decisive turn. “I reviewed the security today. The officers here said there should not be any let-up in the fight against the Naxals. The loss of lives of jawans will not be in vain. In the past five or six years, many security camps have been opened in core areas of the Naxals. This attack is a result of their desperation. The Chhattisgarh government and the Centre are working together,” Mr. Shah told mediapersons in Jagadalpur. He was accompanied by Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, who said more security camps would be established in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas at a rapid pace, and development works would also be accelerated. As many as 14 of the 27 districts in Chhattisgarh are affected by LWE violence. In the recent past, the CRPF has opened 18 new security camps in South Bastar. “New camps are being established in the area, because of which the Naxalites are panicking. The area of Naxalite dominance is shrinking rapidly. It is the first time when we have entered the den of Naxalites,” Mr. Baghel said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/fight-against-maoists-will-be-intensified-says-shah/article34249303.ece

06 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||BJP, JSP urge ECI to rescind Tirupati byelection, issue fresh notification||The BJP and the Jana Sena Party (JSP) have urged the Election Commission of India (ECI) to rescind the byelection to the Tirupati (SC) Parliamentary constituency and issue a fresh notification immediately after the declaration of the results of the MPTC/ZPTC polls on April 10. A delegation of the two parties has also appealed to the ECI to initiate suitable disciplinary action against the State’s Chief Secretary and the officers of Chittoor and Nellore district, including the Collectors and the Superintendents of Police for allegedly violating the ECI’s Constitutional mandate and authority. In a memorandum to the ECI, BJP leaders Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Sunil Deodhar, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, Om Pathak Neerraj, C.M. Ramesh and Y.S. Chowdary and JSP political affairs committee chairman Nadendla Manohar stated that the Tirupati Parliamentary constituency extends over Chittoor and Nellore districts and even while the byelection process was under way, the State Election Commission (SEC) issued a notification for resuming the MPTC and ZPTC elections that were stalled in March 2020 due to COVID. They said the Chief Secretary and the Collectors and Superintendents / Commissioners of Police of Chittoor and Nellore districts where the expanse of the Tirupati Parliamentary constituency is located, have shown utter disregard to the ECI’s Model Code of Conduct which is in vogue for the byelection. The campaign for the byelection has thus been vitiated and the purity of election hampered. ‘Deliberate act’ Leaders of the alliance complained to the ECI that the government and its officials deliberately recommended to the SEC to conduct the paused elections to MPTCs/ ZPTCs on April 8 so as to interfere with the Tirupati byelection, thereby jeopardising its purity and sanctity by seeking to give an undue advantage to the winning party by fixing April 10 as the date of declaration of results.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bjp-jsp-urge-eci-to-rescind-tirupati-bypoll-issue-fresh-notification/article34249298.ece
06 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Curbs in T.N.’s containment areas set to be intensified||Urging people not to believe rumour about a total lockdown after polling on April 6, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan on Monday said restrictions will be tightened in COVID-19 containment areas. Restrictions will gradually be enforced for non-essential activities based on government’s policy decisions and views of public health experts. “Some steps should be taken without affecting the public and with public cooperation we can avoid an out-of-control situation like Maharashtra. Of the 4.5 lakh areas, there are 925 containment areas that had more than three COVID-19 cases. Restrictions will be tightened in these areas. We will have focus volunteers and take up testing,” he told reporters shortly after an inspection at the State Vaccine Store. He said people should learn to avoid crowding at funerals, marriages and cultural events, and avoid unnecessary travel. Starting April 7, the day after polling, he said door-to-door fever surveillance in containment areas and screening centres for triaging of COVID-19 patients would be taken up in full swing. Noting that there were over one lakh COVID-19 cases in India on Sunday, he said that in Tamil Nadu, the cases were rising gradually but the positivity rate was not as high as it was in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab, he said. “Nevertheless, the numbers are slightly alarming and we have crossed 3,500 cases a day. There is continuous monitoring, and we are ensuring that there is no lacunae in testing, tracking and isolation. A minimum of 20 to 30 contacts of a patient are being traced, tested and isolated,” he said. One of the main challenges was house to house fever surveillance in containment areas, he said and added: “Starting April 7, we will take up house-to-house fever surveillance in containment areas in full swing. We did not carry out the same to avoid creating confusion during election time. The field-level teams in each of the 15 zones of Greater Chennai Corporation and monitoring teams at the district-level are in place,” he said. Mr. Radhakrishnan said that COVID-19 Care Centres had been started in all districts. Taking into account the five hospitals in Chennai — Government Corona Hospital, Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, Government Stanley Medical College Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital — 1,869 persons were admitted, while the total bed capacity was 4,368. “Persons are directly going to the Government Corona Hospital. Those with mild symptoms can go to CCCs. After April 7, we will have 10 screening centres from the present three for triaging patients. Not all patients need to be treated in hospitals and doctors will decide on that,” he said. Slow vaccination Another area of concern was vaccination. The State has so far received nearly 54 lakh doses of the vaccines but the off-take had been low, he said. Only around 15,000 people were vaccinated on Sunday. “The disease is on the rise. All those aged above 45 should take the vaccine. We could not promote vaccination on campaign mode due to the model code of conduct. However, after April 7, we will take up this on a campaign mode to motivate people who are eligible to get vaccinated... Some might get infected after vaccination. It is said to have 70 to 85% efficacy 14 days after the second dose. In such cases, it will not be a severe COVID-19,” he said. Noting that vaccine hesitancy continued in the State, he said that neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka had more takers than T.N. The average capacity of a vaccination centre was 100 persons a day. On an average, RGGGH and Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, vaccinate up to 500 persons a day but in many cities, districts and rural parts, only 25 to 40 persons are vaccinated, he said. “The Centre’s supply of additional doses depended on the three-day average utilisation. States that have higher utilisation such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are getting more vaccines supplied. There is a view that we are not utilising the already supplied vaccines,” he said. So far, 4.25 lakh doses of Covaxin and 28.30 lakh doses of Covishield were utilised, he said. The State has till now received 7.8 lakh doses of Covaxin and 47.43 lakh doses of Covishield. Daily analysis till April 4 showed that Chennai’s test positivity rate was 8.01%, Ranipet 7.39%, Theni 6.85%, Coimbatore 6.17%, Chengalpattu 5.53%, Tiruvannamalai 5.38% and Salem 5.07%.  Positivity rate “Except for these seven districts, the remaining have a lesser positivity rate. As per the Centre’s direction, we should bring down the positivity rate to below 5%. We should do additional tests for which fever camps will come in handy. The Corporation on an average conducts 500 camps a day, while in districts, 100 camps will be held where additional tests will be carried out. Attention will be given to all other districts with above 2% positivity rate. Only Tirupattur has below 2% positivity rate,” he said. Due to lack of adherence of SOPs such as checking for temperature and hand hygiene in places such as the service sector, the disease was spreading from one person to many. “Elections were a challenge, but do not assume that cases would drop after April 6. We have had cases through banks, service sectors and training centres,” he said. He said although schools were closed, training centres were being run illegally. Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine T. S. Selvavinayagam was present. “Persons are directly going to the Government Corona Hospital. Those with mild symptoms can go to CCCs. After April 7, we will have 10 screening centres from the present three for triaging patients. Not all patients need to be treated in hospitals and doctors will decide on that,” he said.

06 April 2021||Pune,||Allow vaccination for all over 25 years: Uddhav to PM||There was no let-up in Maharashtra’s case spike on Monday as the State recorded a huge surge of 47,288 new COVID-19 cases, pushing its active case tally past the 4.50 lakh mark to reach 4,51,375. A total of 155 deaths (123 of which were reported in the last 48 hours, while the rest were from an earlier period) took the total toll to 56,033. In contrast to the spike, just 26,252 patients were discharged. The State’s recovery rate has now dipped to 83.38%. While the total tally has reached 30,57,885, the cumulative recoveries stand at 25,49,075. “Of a total of 2,07,15,793 laboratory samples tested thus far, 30,57,885 (with the average case positivity rising to 14.76%) have returned positive with over 1.75 lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” said State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate. The State’s case fatality rate has incrementally dipped to 1.83%. Mumbai reported 9,879 new cases, taking its total case tally to 4,62,560, of which 66,803 are active. With 21 fatalities, the city’s death toll rose to 11,800. In view of the surging cases, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to allow the vaccination of all above the age of 25 years in the State. State amends order As part of its ‘Break the Chain’ drive, the government added other essential services to its April 4 order. These include petrol pumps, and petroleum-related products, all types of cargo services, data centres, cloud service providers, IT and infrastructure-related services, government and private security services, and fruit sellers. However, as per the instructions of the Central government, the employees working in such establishments or concerns will have to be vaccinated. Until that happens, they will need to carry a negative RT-PCR certificate. A fine of Rs. 1,000 will be levied on anyone who breaks the rules, read the directive. Anyone arriving or departing by train, bus or plane between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. will need to carry an official ticket so that they can travel to stations or home during the curfew. Industrial workers are allowed to come and go between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. according to their work schedule on the basis of their identity card. If a student taking an exam wants to travel home after 8 p.m., he will have to carry a hall ticket.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/allow-vaccination-for-all-over-25-years-uddhav-to-pm/article34249791.ece
06 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||HMR yet to receive remaining fund from Centre||While there is renewed hope of second phase of the Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) kicking off with the government allotting Rs. 1,000 crore in this year’s budget, the pending payment from the Centre under the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) continues to stick as a sore thumb. This is for the first phase of the project built by L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad (L&TMRH) across three routes under the Public, Private Partnership (PPP) mode. The Centre had assured to give Rs. 1,458 crore or little more than 10% of the projected cost of Rs. 14,156 crore then and the money was being released in stages as per the construction progress in the seven years of construction for completing about 69.2 km - Red Line or Corridor One from L.B. Nagar to Miyapur, Blue Line or Corridor Three from Nagole to Raidurg and Green Line or Corridor Two - Jubilee Bus Station and Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station, Imlibun. Centre had released Rs. 1,204 crore and the balance amount of Rs. 254 crore has not been sanctioned even after completion of the first phase of the project - save for extending the line beyond MGBS into the Old City till Falaknuma, as per the latest government report. Whether it is because of non-completion of this stretch or because there were issues with regard to the revision of the fare structure at the time of the launch by L&TMRH, the fact is funds were not released despite repeated reminders. “The issue has been brought to the notice of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharam too and many communications were sent with senior Minister K.T. Rama Rao personally taking up the matter, however, the remaining fund is yet to be released,” disclosed senior officials, declining to be identified. Telangna government had put in Rs. 2,730 crore into the first phase for road widening, properties acquisition, shift of utilities like water, power and sewer pipelines. L&TMRH had invested Rs. 18,103 crore and had already submitted that the project cost overrun has been to the tune of Rs. 3,756 crore, seeking appropriate relief - another pending decision, this time the onus is on TS. The government has put the revenue loss due to shutdown of the metro rail service for about six months from March to September last year at Rs. 220 crore. L&TMRH has claimed a loss of Rs. 382.21 crore in 2019-20. The project was completed and opened in stages between Nov. 29, 2017 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the inaugural stretch from Nagole to Miyapur via Ameerpet to the last mile between JBS-MGBS flagged off by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Feb.8, 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hmr-yet-to-receive-remaining-fund-from-centre/article34249609.ece
06 April 2021||Chennai,||India reports 96,580 fresh infections, 440 deaths||After reporting a record spike of more than 1 lakh new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, India reported 95,374 fresh infections and 430 deaths as of 10.15 p.m. on Monday. Data from Assam and Jharkhand were not available. The decrease in cases was largely due to a reduced number of tests. As many as 8.93 lakh new samples were tested on Sunday (and for whom results were made available by the State Health Departments on Monday), 2.73 lakh fewer than that on the previous day. The country has so far reported a total of 1,26,83,297 cases and 1,65,562 deaths. It has 7,77,304 active cases. Maharashtra reported 47,288 infections, accounting for 49% of the new cases, followed by Chhattisgarh (7,302) and Karnataka (5,279). Maharashtra also recorded 155 casualties, followed by Punjab (72) and Chhattisgarh (38). India reported 48,166 recoveries on Monday. The cumulative recoveries stood at 1,17,28,127. Nearly 8 cr. vaccinations The number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered neared the 8 crore mark, with 7,91,05,163 shots given as of 7 a.m. on Monday, according to the Union Health Ministry. Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtraaccounted for 60% of the total doses given so far, the Ministry said in a release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-reports-95374-fresh-infections-430-deaths/article34249302.ece
06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. rubbishes Rafale report as Congress demands probe||A French media report that stated that France’s anti-corruption agency, Agence Française Anticorruption (AFA), had found that aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation had paid €1 million to an Indian company in connection with the 2016 Indo-French Rafale deal, prompted the Congress on Monday to demand an independent investigation and answers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad dismissed the reports of pay offs to middlemen in the €7.87 bn fighter aircraft deal as “completely baseless”. He reiterated that the Supreme Court had rejected a demand for a probe in the purchase of the fighter aircraft and the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) had also found nothing wrong. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala, however, claimed the latest revelation by the French news portal — Mediapart — is a vindication of former party chief Rahul Gandhi’s allegations of corruption in the Rafale aircraft deal. The Congress was quick to hold a press conference to ‘reiterate’ its earlier allegations of corruption and sought fresh answers from Mr Modi, a day before the third phase of voting in Assam and West Bengal and polling in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. In the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Mr. Gandhi had made the alleged corruption in the Rafale deal as the party’s main poll plank but the BJP’s thumping victory made the issue politically ‘unsustainable’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-rubbishes-rafale-report-as-congress-demands-probe/article34249306.ece

After holding a road show in Kolkata in support of the Trinamool Congress candidate Aroop Biswas in Tollygunj, Ms. Bachchan told reporters, “We may not be a resident Bengali, but we are Bengalis nevertheless. I have not come here to act but my party leader Akhilesh Yadav has sent me here to support Mamata Banerjee.” Ms. Bachchan, who will campaign for Trinamool Congress till April 7, heaped praises on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. “Mamata ji as a single woman is fighting against all atrocities, head broken and leg broken but they have not able to break her heart and spirit,” she said. Ms Bachchan, who is a Rajya Sabha MP, said those opposing Trinamool Congress are trying to hijack religion and democratic rights of the people. While the BJP has fielded actor Mithun Chakraborty as their star campaigner the TMC has tried to match this by bringing in Ms. Bachchan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-one-has-succeeded-by-intimidating-bengalis-jaya/article34249711.ece

In an open letter released on Monday, Ms. Vijayamma said that her son Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and daughter Y.S. Sharmila also wished to see justice done in the case. She further alleged that a section of the media was resorting to yellow journalism in the case in an attempt to drive a wedge between Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter Sunitha and the Y.S. family. “A section of the media, unable to support the TDP which is fast losing its political relevance, has been spreading a malicious campaign against the Y.S. family. At a time when the TDP has given up and has withdrawn from contesting in ZPTC and MPTC elections, a section of the media is blowing up the remarks made by Y.S.

06 April 2021||MANGALURU,||Residents stage protest against coastal berth project||Residents of Bengre Kasaba staged a demonstration here on Monday in protest against a proposal to construct a coastal berth and capital dredging at Bengre under the Sagarmala project to boost coastal cargo and other related activities. Participating under the banner of Al Madrasul Deeniya, Bengre Kasaba, and other like-minded organisations, the residents said that the coastal berth would snatch away livelihood of thousands of people in the region, including fishermen and those dependent on ancillary activities. The 350-m-long coastal berth would cause havoc in the lives of hundreds of people engaged in fish drying, boat repair, fish net repair and other activities. Traditional fishermen would lose space for berthing their boats and being engaged in fishing activities, the residents said. They said that by bringing the coastal berth and capital dredging projects to Bengre, the government was making an attempt to evacuate people from Bengre. This was despite the residents demand for years seeking title deeds for land on which their houses stand. The two projects would displace thousands of residents who were dependent upon fishing and related activities. The project would also force the closure of the government high school in the locality thereby denying education to children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/residents-stage-protest-against-coastal-berth-project/article34249764.ece

06 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||All arrangements made for Kerala polls today||After the high-octane campaign of the past weeks, the stage is set for the Assembly elections in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Tuesday.  Extensive arrangements are in place for the smooth conduct of the polls.  In Kerala, the byelection for the Malappuram Lok Sabha seat too will be held on Tuesday. Polling will open at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. in all constituencies except nine — Mananthavady, Sulthan Bathery, Kalpetta, Ernad, Nilambur, Wandoor, Kongad, Mannarkkad and Malampuzha — where it will start at 7 p.m. and end at 6 p.m. In all, 2,74,46,039 voters are eligible to exercise their franchise as per the final roll published by the Election Commission of India (ECI). Among them, 1,32,83,724 are men, 1,41,62,025 are women while 290 belong to the third gender. Overseas voters number 87,318. In all, 957 candidates are seeking the mandate this time in Kerala. The elections are being conducted in strict compliance with the COVID-19 and green protocols. COVID-19 patients and quarantined electors will be permitted to vote in the final hour of the polling. Kerala has 40,771 polling stations, including 15,730 auxiliary stations necessitated by the ECI decision to keep voter numbers per booth to 1,000, given the COVID-19 situation. In view of the recent controversy over multiple entries on the electoral rolls, the ECI has laid down strict guidelines for preventing bogus voting. The ECI had issued standard operating procedures in this regard and furnished presiding officers with polling station-wise lists of Absent, Shifted, Dead/Duplicate voters Multi-cornered contest In Tamil Nadu, which will witness a multi-cornered contest, the AIADMK-led alliance, with Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its chief ministerial candidate, is seeking a renewed mandate. DMK president M.K. Stalin, heading a rainbow alliance, is making a strong pitch to form a government with himself as the Chief Minister for the first time. The front, led by Makkal Needhi Maiam founded by Kamal Haasan, Naam Tamilar Katchi, anchored by Seeman, and T.T.V. Dhinakaran’s Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam-led alliance are seeking to prove themselves as credible alternatives to the two Dravidian parties. Voters in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will on Tuesday exercise their franchise, adhering to the COVID-19 safety protocol, to elect new governments. The byelection to the Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha constituency will be held simultaneously. Tamil Nadu Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo said on Monday said 95% of the booth slips had been distributed. He clarified that as long as the name was on the list, booth slips were not compulsory. Voters could obtain booth details from the National Voters Service Portal or by dialling ‘1950’ with the respective STD code prefixed. On representations for cancellation of polling for alleged cash distribution, he said a report had been sent to the Election Commission of India. In Puducherry, where the V. Narayanasamy government fell in February, voters would choose essentially between the fronts led by the Congress and the All India NR Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/all-arrangements-made-for-kerala-polls-today/article34249222.ece
06 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Stakes higher for Mahajot in final phase||When Mohammed Sanaullah, a retired soldier, casts his vote at the Koloikash Primary School under the Chaygaon Assembly constituency on Tuesday, his mind will perhaps be on a faraway “hellhole” he had spent a week in, almost two years ago. The Goalpara Central jail, one of six in Assam also serving as detention centres for “foreigners”, is about 100 km from his village west of Guwahati. Mr. Sanaullah was lodged in this detention centre after a Foreigners’ Tribunal (FT) declared him a non-citizen. But he is more worried about the one to come — an exclusive detention centre at Matia about 25 km east of the Goalpara jail and under the Goalpara East Assembly constituency. This centre is expected to house 3,000 people who don’t get reprieve from the FTs after exclusion from the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “This election has perhaps been the most polarised, stoking the sentiments as well as fears of the minorities. We will be voting for dignity, to live without the tag of Bangladeshi or Miya or illegal immigrant,” Mr. Sanaullah told The Hindu on the eve of polling across 40 of Assam’s 126 Assembly seats. About 19.06 lakh out of 3.3 crore applicants were left out of the complete NRC draft published in August 2019. Opposite stands The government refrained from divulging the district-wise exclusion data, but it is believed that the bulk of the Brahmaputra Valley dwellers, mostly Bengali Muslims and Hindus, excluded from the NRC are from at least half the constituencies in the second phase. The two main alliances fighting to run the next government have taken opposite stands on the issue of NRC. While the BJP-led alliance, unhappy with the outcome of the updating exercise, has vowed to come out with a “corrected” NRC, the Congress-led Mahajot , or grand alliance of 10 parties, said it will accept the NRC and issue identity card to every citizen. The Congress and its prime ally, All-India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), hopes its pro-NRC and anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act would see it through in most of the constituencies where migrant Muslims call the shots. BJP hopes to surprise The BJP and its ally Asom Gana Parishad, which won 15 of these seats in 2016, are confident too. “Going by the vote share in the 2019 Parliament elections, we expect to spring a surprise in some minority areas,” State BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, contesting the Patacharkuchi seat, said. Key candidates in this phase are BJP Ministers Himanta Biswa Sarma (Jalukbari seat) and Chandra Mohan Patowary (Dharmapur), AGP Minister Phani Bhushan Choudhury (Bongaigaon) and BPF Ministers Pramila Rani Brahma (Kokrajhar East) and Chandan Brahma (Sidli).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stakes-higher-for-mahajot-in-final-phase/article34249242.ece
06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘India delayed second wave, can contain economic impact’||Though India is in the middle of a second wave of COVID-19 infections, with a new peak of over 1 lakh cases reported on Sunday, the Finance Ministry stressed on Monday that the country had been able to delay the onset of the second wave and was well armed to cope with downside risks to the economy. “The gap between the first peak to start of the second wave has been 151 days in India, while it was much lower in other countries. This implies the readiness of the health infrastructure and awareness of the standard operating protocols at this time,” the Ministry said in its monthly economic report for March. Five-fold strategy “India is emphasising on a five-fold strategy to curb the tide of new cases — exponential increase in testing, effective isolation and contact tracing of those infected, reinvigoration of public and private healthcare resources, ensuring of COVID-appropriate behaviour and targeted approach to vaccination in districts reporting large numbers,” the report said, adding that a fast vaccine roll-out would bolster the battle against the virus. “Despite the surge in cases, the recovery in economy is resilient with sustained improvement in a majority of high-frequency indicators,” noted the Department of Economic Affairs report. Predicting a strong revival in investment growth supported by the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Mission and the infrastructure and capital expenditure impetus provided in the Union Budget for 2021-22, the report said, “The wheels of India’s capex cycle have been set into motion, signs of which were imminent in the second half of the year.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-delayed-second-wave-can-contain-economic-impact/article34249258.ece
06 April 2021||Bengaluru,||SIT asked to submit status report on probe||The High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to submit in a sealed cover a status report on the probe conducted so far into the complaints registered in connection with the CD scandal involving the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, issued the direction while hearing two separate PIL petitions questioning the validity of establishing an SIT and seeking a court-monitored probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the complaints related to the scandal. While questioning the validity of setting up an SIT, Geetha Misra, a city-based social activist, questioned why the first information report (FIR) was not registered by the police soon after one Dinesh Kallahalli brought the scandal to their notice. She alleged that the SIT was set up on the letter written by the Home Minister after Mr. Jarkiholi, an accused, himself sought a SIT probe into complaint of Mr. Kallahalli though there was no FIR when the SIT was set up on March 11, as the Cubbon Park police had merely treated Mr. Kallahalli’s complaint as a petition before it was withdrawn. Mr. Jarkiholi lodged a “vague” complaint with the police on March 13, two days after the SIT was formed, the petitioner said while claiming that the SIT had no legal sanction when it was set up, as neither the city Police Commissioner had power to set up a SIT nor a notification was issued in the official gazette in this regard. She also alleged that police officials were leaking information to the media about the probe contrary to the directions of the apex court on investigation of criminal cases. In another petition, S. Umesh sought a direction for a court-monitored probe by the CBI or setting up of a Central Special Investigation Team to conduct probe monitored by the court to avoid any allegation of bias that could crop up owing to the involvement of the State’s political leaders in the case. He also sought a direction to the authorities to ensure that the media and the investigation agencies followed the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on March 5, 2021 based on the directions of the Bombay High Court. While alleging that certain programmes telecast by TV channels on the CD scandal amounted to a “media trial” and “interference in investigation” in clear violation of apex court’s guidelines, Mr. Umesh also said that round-the-clock programmes on the CD scandal on TV channels “ has affected the mental health of the young children who watch local TV programmes”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sit-asked-to-submit-status-report-on-probe/article34249214.ece

06 April 2021||New Delhi,||CRPF commando may be in Maoists’ custody||A commando of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), who was part of the team that was ambushed at Tarrem in Sukma of Chhattisgarh on April 3, is suspected to have been abducted by the Maoists, the police said. Director-General of Police, Chhattisgarh, D.M. Awasthi told The Hindu that the police had information from several sources that the commando was with the Maoists. The commando, Rakeshwar Singh Minhas, belonged to the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) of the CRPF, a unit specially trained for operations in areas affected by left-wing extremism. “There is no statement by the Maoists yet, but we have information from other sources that the commando is with them. We can say he is safe so far. We are trying to ascertain how he was taken away,” Mr. Awasthi said. A senior police official said it was possible that the commando ran for cover when a volley of bullets came from the Maoists and unknowingly moved to the other side. Mr. Manhas’s family in Jammu released a video message appealing for his safe return. His wife, Meenu, said she last spoke to him around 9.30 p.m. on April 2 when he told her that he was going for an operation and would return the next day. The police official said the Maoists were watching the forces. “There were four groups numbering over 400 that left from various camps on night of April 2. When the fourth and the last group reached Tarrem, they were attacked. There were two villages on the way that were empty and the forces should have avoided the route,” said the official. Another official said there was prior information about the presence of Maoists there since it was one of their core areas. “There were intelligence inputs, but we could not find Maoists at the said location. The security forces were being watched and when the last group moved in, they were attacked,” said the official. Around two dozen sophisticated weapons used by the security personnel were taken away by the Maoists. Home Minister Amit Shah, on a day-long visit to Chhattisgarh on Monday, addressed the CRPF personnel who were part of the encounter at Tarrem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/crpf-commando-may-be-in-maoists-custody/article34249245.ece
06 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Bridging the divide in Dhubri||A bridge tipped to be India’s longest has become an unusual issue in a polarised part of Assam often synonymous with “illegal immigrants”. Electoral politics in Assam since the 1970s has invariably been spun around the narrative of ‘Bangladeshis’ threatening to take over the State. Dhubri district in western Assam, from which South Salmara-Mankachar district was carved out in 2016, has been the peg of this storyline. But the buzz in this part of Assam ahead of the third and final phase of polling on April 6 has been around the Dhubri-Phulbari bridge across the Brahmaputra, to be India’s longest at 19.282 km. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on February 18 laid the foundation stone of this project that was once considered a bridge too far. If completed within the target of seven years and nine months, it will connect three Assembly constituencies — Dhubri, Gauripur and South Salmara — and the Phulbari Assembly constituency in Meghalaya. The Congress had won the South Salmara seat, and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) Dhubri and Gauripur in 2016. The two parties are allies this time, making these three seats and a few more beyond the domain of the Congress-led Mahajot or grand alliance of 10 parties. “No government before ours could achieve so much for connectivity. Bridges such as Bogibeel [India’s longest rail-road bridge across Brahmaputra]) and Dhola-Sadiya have underlined our commitment to development. The Dhubri-Phulbari bridge too will be our crowning glory,” BJP State president Ranjeet Kumar Dass said. But AIUDF president Badruddin Ajmal, who represents the Dhubri Lok Sabha seat that encompasses the three ‘bridge’ constituencies, said the Dhubri-Phulbari project might not have been a reality had he not pushed it since 2009.  Ajmal’s stand “I am thankful to Narendra Modiji for giving shape to an idea of the people of my constituency that I discussed in Parliament at least once a year in these 13-14 years. But I am equally thankful to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ji for believing in this idea,” he told The Hindu . Mr. Ajmal said he wrote 38 letters to various Ministries, met the Prime Minister every two months and the Ministers concerned to also revive the Rupsi Airport of Second World War vintage, and the British-era railway and inland water connectivity in Dhubri district. The airport under the Gauripur Assembly seat was inaugurated in November 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bridging-the-divide-in-a-polarised-part-of-assam/article34249518.ece
06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Tie-up with ISF a historical need’||Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly and veteran Congress leader Abdul Mannan is seeking re-election from Champdani in the Hooghly belt, comprising a mixed population of refugees, jute mill workers, minorities and Hindi-speaking settlers. Speaking of the possibility of a hung Assembly and a coming together of the BJP and the Trinamool, Mr. Mannan says though the Congress is unhappy with the tie-up with the Indian Secular Front, it is a ‘historical need’ because the Sanjukta Morcha (Left-Congress alliance) could not have fought the Trinamool and the BJP on its own.  Several Congress leaders have spoken out against the alliance with the ISF. Why are you in its favour? We understood that we could not fight the two forces — the BJP and the Trinamool — alone. That is why the ISF was roped in. Allying with the ISF was a historical need. If you recall, during the Second World War, Stalin and Churchill joined hands to take on Hitler. The ISF is not a communal party, it has fielded enough tribal and Hindu candidates. Abbas Siddique [peer of Furfura sharif who floated ISF in January] is a good orator and is popular among Muslims as well as Dalits and tribals. If Yogi Adityanath can be a political leader, why can’t Siddique? A majority of the Muslim population (27% among which 90% are Bengali-speaking) is the traditional vote bank of the Congress and we need to bring them back. What do you think of the BJP and Trinamool campaign and the bipolar contest? During the campaign what I am noticing is that the people are not seeing any difference between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress. One is raising the issue of Hindutva, the other is also toeing that line and has pitched the campaign around semi-Hindutva lines. Why is the chit fund scam not an issue in this election for the Trinamool or the BJP? It is because those accused in the scam have either joined the BJP or are with the Trinamool. Thousands of poor people lost their money in the chit fund scam and it finds no mention in either the BJP or TMC manifesto. Many people have begun to see the BJP and the Trinamool as two sides of the same coin and will vote for an alternative. We see a strong possibility of a hung Assembly. What scenario will play out in that case? If there is a hung assembly, there is no guarantee that the Trinamool won’t side with the BJP. They are natural allies. There is no guarantee on further defections either. The culture of defections in Bengal was started by the Trinamool. We had 44 MLAs of whom 24 defected to the Trinamool and in such a manner that they remained Congress MLAs on paper and assumed the district leadership of the Trinamool. There was no culture of ‘ aaya ram, gaya ram’ in West Bengal politics. Now the BJP is doing the same to the Trinamool. Therefore, people do not see any difference between Mamata and Modi. Both parties have fascist tendencies. Both the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister have been using objectionable language in their campaigns. What are the key poll issues? We are highlighting the real issues on which the elections should have been fought — spiralling petrol prices, high food prices, lack of jobs, need for industry, curbing corruption, stopping the culture of ‘cut money’ for every service rendered, and saying no to divisive politics. Champdani, for example, is part of the jute belt, and the revival of the jute industry is an imperative poll issue. As leader of the Opposition, what has been your experience of working with the ruling government? Well, it has been difficult. The Trinamool government does not believe in following rules and procedures of the House. For instance, there was no discussion on the Budget. When we wanted to bring in a no-confidence motion, we were not allowed. The Assembly was run on the whims and fancies of the Trinamool, and we could not raise the issues of the people in the House. The Congress has been in the Opposition for long in the State. What is the morale of the rank and file? We have been out of power from 1977. The Congress worker has made many a sacrifice to be with the party. It is not easy and there have been leadership failures. We need to strengthen the grassroots connect.  The chit fund scam is not an issue in this election for the Trinamool or the BJP because those accused have either of the party||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tie-up-with-isf-a-historical-need/article34249889.ece
06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Supreme Court frowns on interim heads for CBI||The Supreme Court on Monday told the government that interim appointments to the post of CBI Director cannot go on. “In-charge arrangements for CBI Director cannot go on,” a Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao told Attorney General K.K. Venugopal. The remark came during the hearing of a petition filed by Common Cause, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, objecting to the appointment of Praveen Sinha as interim CBI Director following the retirement of Rishi Kumar Shukla on February 2. The petition said the government had failed to appoint a regular Director through the high-power selection committee of the Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India and Leader of Opposition. Mr. Venugopal said the meeting of the committee was deferred till after May 2. Mr. Bhushan said the meeting should be called before May 2. He wondered aloud whether the government, by deferring the meeting, wanted to bypass the incumbent CJI, who is retiring on April 23. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta strongly objected to Mr. Bhushan's allegations. Mr. Mehta said the meeting had been deferred because of the Assembly elections in April. However, the court finally agreed to hear the arguments from both sides in detail next week. The Common Cause has argued that an interim appointment through an executive order was not envisaged in the statutory scheme of the 1946 Act. The CBI Director is a sensitive post. The Director is the final authority in the organisation. The agency should function independently outside the pale of the Executive or political powers. The NGO said this was exactly why a high-powered committee selects the CBI Director. The petition also highlighted the “determined efforts” of the Supreme Court in the past to “enhance the functional autonomy of the CBI and limit the extent of executive discretion in the matter if appointment of this key functionary”. It also urged the court to direct the introduction of a mechanism to ensure that the process of selection of CBI Director is completed one or two months in advance of the retirement of the incumbent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supreme-court-frowns-on-interim-heads-for-cbi/article34249238.ece
06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘ INS Viraat now private property of ship-breaker’||INS Viraat , the Navy’s decomissioned aircraft carrier, has become the “private property” of a ship-breaker who has already torn down 40% of its body, chiefly for scrap, the Supreme Court told a private company, that wants to turn the vessel into a maritime museum-cum-adventure centre. On February 10, the court had ordered a stay on the process of dismantling the ship. The carrier was bought by the Gujarat-based Shree Ram Group, a ship-breaking firm, in a bid. The 67-year-old iconic warship was towed to the breaking yard after over three decades’ service in the Navy. Envitech Marine Consultants Private Limited, represented by Vishnukant Sharma and Rupali Vishnukant Sharma, had first approached the Bombay High Court with a proposal to reclaim the aircraft carrier and convert it into a museum. The HC had asked the government to take a call. But the government had maintained a non-commital tone and asked Envitech to approach the Shree Ram Group with a proposal to re-purchase the ship. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan for Shree Ram Group, asked the court to lift the stay order. Ms. Sharma said warships the world around are used as museums. “We share your sentiments about warships. But it ( Viraat ) has become their property. They have spent money on it,” Chief Justice Bobde said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ins-viraat-now-private-property-of-ship-breaker/article34249250.ece
06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farm unions protest direct payment order issued by FCI||Recent orders from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) have led to a new flashpoint in the ongoing farmers protests, with farm unions warning that the Centre’s insistence on direct payment and tenancy documentation could derail the crop procurement process. On Monday, farm unions affiliated to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha protested outside the FCI offices in Punjab and Haryana, as well as some locations in other States such as Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Declaring it as FCI Bachao Divas (or Save FCI Day), farmers demanded an immediate withdrawal of the recent orders. “The government should roll back the provision of direct payment to the bank account. Implementing it in haste can lead to many complex problems that will exclude so many farmers from getting their price of the crop,” said an SKM letter to the Ministry of Food and Consumer Affairs. The FCI has insisted that direct payment to farmers’ bank accounts, bypassing the powerful arhatiyas or commission agents, will lead to greater transparency and accountability. Since arhatiyas play a key role in the Punjab and Haryana farm ecosystem by providing farm loans, the move has been opposed by a large section of farmers, as well as the Punjab government. Another FCI order stipulates that tenant farmers and sharecroppers must produce a jamabandhi, or legal agreement proving that they have the right to till leased land, in order to get paid for procured crops. Thousands of sharecroppers do not have such agreements and will be hit hard by this move. SKM is demanding that this order be withdrawn as well. The FCI’s fresh proposals to tighten quality requirements for wheat and paddy procurement from the next marketing season are also being opposed. At a broader level, farmers connected their issues with the FCI with their existing demands to repeal the farm laws and enact a legal guarantee for procurement of all crops and minimum support prices. ‘Private control’ “The Acts will increase control of the private sector in food grains storage, cold storage, food processing and marketing,” said the All India Kisan Sabha, in a letter addressed to the PM. “Ultimately the government plans to wind up subsidised food distribution under [the Public Distribution System] and reduce it to a cash transfer scheme under pressure from the [World Trade Organisation] and imperialist countries like the U.S.A. It also plans to sell off the FCI warehouses to the private sector to pay off the debts,” it added, accusing the Centre of reducing the FCI’s budget and procurement centres in recent years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farm-unions-protest-fcis-direct-payment-orders/article34249251.ece
06 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Panacea Biotec to make 100 million doses of Sputnik V||Vaccine and pharma major Panacea Biotec has joined a growing list of Indian firms cleared to produce Sputnik V, the Russian vaccine against COVID-19. The firm will produce 100 million doses per year of Sputnik V, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund RDIF (Russian Direct Investment Fund) said on Monday, announcing its fifth such partnership with vaccine makers in India. The RDIF, however, did not mention when the firm is likely to begin production of the two-dose adenoviral-based vector vaccine, with a reported efficacy of 91.6%. Registered in 59 countries, Sputnik V in India awaits emergency use authorisation from the subject expert committee (SEC) that advises the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). The regulator last week deferred a decision on grant of emergency use authorisation. A statement from RDIF said production of Sputnik V at Panacea Biotec sites will help facilitate global supply of the vaccine to its international partners. “We see a growing interest in Sputnik V vaccine. Cooperation with Panacea Biotec is an important step to produce the vaccine in India and to supply our international partners around the world,” CEO Kirill Dmitriev said. Panacea Biotec Managing Director Rajesh Jain said the company will produce the Russian vaccine at its internationally accredited facilities complying with strict GMP standards and prequalified by WHO. With this, RDIF has formed partnerships for production of 850 million doses of Sputnik V in India. The first tie-up was with Hetero Biopharma in November, while the collaboration with Gland Pharma, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech was announced last month. For the clinical trials and distribution in the country, it has partnered with pharma major Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories. Highlighting the advantages of Sputnik V, RDIF said the storage temperature of 2 to 8 degree Celsius means the vaccine can be stored in a conventional refrigerator without need for additional cold-chain infrastructure. At less than $10 a shot, the vaccine is affordable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panacea-biotec-to-make-100-million-doses-of-sputnik-v/article34249254.ece
06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Railways completes arch closure of Chenab bridge||The Railways on Monday said it had completed the arch closure of the 1315m Chenab bridge, the world’s highest railway bridge. Terming it one of the biggest civil engineering challenges faced by any project in India, the Railways added that at 359m above the river bed level, the bridge would be 35 metres higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The Chenab bridge is part of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link project (USBRL) and completion of the steel arch is an important construction milestone. Most difficult part “This was one of the most difficult part of the bridge over Chenab. This achievement is a major leap towards the completion of the 111-km-long winding stretch from Katra to Banihal,” the Railways added. The arch consists of steel boxes, which will be filled with concrete to improve stability. The bridge is being built at a cost of Rs. 1,486 crore and can withstand high wind speed up to 266 km per hour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-completes-arch-closure-of-chenab-bridge/article34249260.ece
06 April 2021||Mumbai,||Probe Param Bir’s letter, HC tells CBI||The Bombay High Court on Monday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to initiate a preliminary inquiry within 15 days into the letter by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh containing allegations of corruption against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh . In a 56-page order, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni said, “Mr. Deshmukh is the Home Minister. The police department is under his control and direction. There can be no fair, impartial, unbiased and untainted probe, if the same were entrusted to the State police force. As of necessity, the probe has to be entrusted to an independent agency like the CBI.” The court also that said a probe by an independent agency was necessary to “instil public confidence and safeguard the Fundamental Rights of the citizens”. Following the high court’s direction, Mr. Deshmukh submitted his resignation. The court was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by Mr. Singh seeking an independent CBI probe into his March 20 letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and a criminal writ petition by advocate Jaishri Patil, filed the next day, with the Malabar Hill police station and the Director ofthe Anti-Corruption Bureau of the CBI. Dr. Patil’s complaint said, “The letter [by Mr. Singh] should have been immediately given to the concerned police station as an FIR [First Information Report] under Section 154 (information in cognisable cases) of the Criminal Procedure Code, as a senior police officer and an offence was required to be registered but the same has not happened.” However, since nothing was done, she filed a criminal writ petition (CrWP) before the high court, urging for a direction to the CBI or Enforcement Directorate or any independent agency to conduct a fair investigation into the various alleged corrupt malpractices of Mr. Deshmukh. Serious issue, says court The court said, “The jurisdictional fact for setting the criminal law in motion is traceable in the CrWP of Dr. Patil... She has brought to the notice of this Court the failure of the Senior Police Inspector, Malabar Hill Police Station, to follow the legislative mandate as in Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The issue raised by her is quite serious and we do not think that it would be prudent to refuse interference only on such ground.” The court also said once the preliminary inquiry is completed, the Director, CBI, shall be at liberty to decide on the future course of action, also in accordance with the law. “Should the Director, CBI, see no reason to proceed further, Dr. Patil shall be duly informed of the same,” the court added.

06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC appoints Special Judges in coal case||The Supreme Court on Monday appointed Arun Bhardwaj and Sanjay Bansal as Special Judges to preside over two separate courts and continue trials in 41 pending cases in connection with the coal block allocation scam. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde decided on the two senior judges on the basis of a panel of names handed over by the Delhi High Court Registrar General. On March 15, the Bench asked the Delhi High Court Chief Justice to share the names of judges of “high calibre and absolute integrity” to take over the trials. The two judges will replace Judge Bharat Parashar. According to a communication from the Delhi High Court, Judge Parashar “needed to be replaced, as he has now completed more than six years in the same post”. The top court’s order referred to how the cases had been pending for about six years when the law required them to be disposed of in two years. The Comptroller and Auditor General report tabled in Parliament in 2012 pegged the losses to the exchequer due to alleged irregularities in the allocation of blocks at nearly Rs. 2 lakh crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-appoints-special-judges-in-coal-case/article34249246.ece
06 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Poll code an obstacle to revising staff salary: Transport Minister||Appealing to road transport corporation (RTC) employees to not go on strike from April 7, Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi cited the model code of conduct as an obstacle for taking a decision on hiking salaries of the staff. He also urged the staff to wait till May 4. “In the State, the Model Code of Conduct is already in place in Bidar, Raichur and Belagavi. It is mandatory to seek prior permission of the Election Commission to make any announcement on pay revision and we have already approached the commission in this regard. If the Commission does not give permission, we cannot decide on pay revision till May 4,” he said. He reiterated that an indefinite strike will cause inconvenience to the general public. Responding to questions on the State government using the MCC as an excuse , the Minister said, “We have already taken a decision to hike the salaries of the staff and we will not go back from our words. If the Election Commission gives the green signal , we are ready to make announcement tomorrow itself.” He added that a Labour Court which is doing conciliation meetings with RTCs and representatives of the Union has directed to maintain the status-quo till April 9. He further said that the Health Department, has barred protests to contain COVID-19 . He said that hiking of salaries will result in an additional burden of Rs. 3,800 crore on the corporations in four years. Six rounds of meetings have been held on the pay revision. “We need time to deliberate on several issues. The employees are demanding salaries as per the 6th pay commission. However, at present, they are getting some additional benefits, and whether they will be continued or not needs to be discussed. On the other hand, that RTCs are facing financial distress and mobilising funds to pay revised salaries also needs to be discussed. We have to seek approval of the Finance Department prior to taking a final decision,” he said. After the outbreak of the pandemic, ridership in buses dropped significantly. “Prior to the pandemic, over one crore people were travelling per day. It then dropped to 65 lakh per day. Due to the second wave, it has further dropped by 5%. COVID-19 cases are rising at faster rate and ridership will drop further.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/poll-code-an-obstacle-to-revising-staff-salary-transport-minister/article34249353.ece
06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC to take up report on ISRO frame-up||The Centre has put its weight behind a report filed by a three-member committee chaired by former Supreme Court judge, Justice D.K. Jain, tasked to unravel rogue officials responsible for the infamous Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) “frame-up” case of 1994 that destroyed the life and reputation of Nambi Narayanan, one of the country’s prominent space scientists. The Centre has applied to the top court, urging it to accept on record the inquiry report submitted by the Justice Jain Committee and take suitable action on the suggestions made against the “erring officials”. The court may take up the case next week. Mr. Narayanan, in his petition before the Supreme Court, had arraigned former Kerala ADGP Siby Mathews and former senior police officials K.K. Joshwa and S. Vijayan. At the time of his arrest on November 30, 1994, Mr. Narayanan was working on cryogenic engine technology at ISRO. Police had accused him of passing on to Pakistan documents and drawings relating to Viking/Vikas engine technology, cryogenic engine technology and PSLV flight data/drawings. The Supreme Court had dismissed the case in 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-take-up-report-on-isro-frame-up/article34249232.ece
06 April 2021||Hyderabad,||Police arrest CA for fake lockdown G.O.||A chartered accountant (CA), who tried to play April Fool prank on friends, ended up behind bars on Monday. He was nabbed by the Hyderabad police. The accused, Sreepathi Sanjeev Kumar, 48, allegedly forged and circulated a Government Order (G.O.) on COVID-19 lockdown in the State, which created panic across the State. The accused, who worked at Karvy and Co., and is a resident of Madhapur, downloaded and forged the government document on his laptop and phone on April 1, which he further circulated in the WhatsApp groups. Sanjeev is a native of Dargah Mitta in Nellore town of Andhra Pradesh. A laptop and mobile phone which were used in committing of offences were seized from his possession. “He prepared and circulated the fake G.O. vide G.O. Ms. No. 45 dated April 1 on the name of Chief Secretary to Telangana government and cheated people by circulating the same on social media,” Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said. The accused later circulated the G.O. copy to his badminton friends WhatsApp group, which was later forwarded in several groups and individuals by the participants of that group, he said. “Everyone assumed it to be an original G.O. issued by the government. A G.O. is a serious document in the government and one cannot take it in a lighter vein. Forging a government document, that too a G.O., is a serious offence, which can lead to unimaginable consequences,” Mr. Kumar said. He said that during the course of investigation, a Cyber Crimes team led by Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty, examined more than 1,800 mobile phones before zeroing in on the actual culprit. When the accused was questioned by mediapersons as to why he resorted to the act, he said: for fun.

Yediyurappa and Health Minister K. Sudhakar about the blanket ban on swimming activities announced by the State government in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases. The swimming fraternity wants at least the training facilities for competitive swimmers to be kept open. A 10-member Indian swimming team, which is currently in the city for training, is set to leave for Uzbekistan on April 9 to take part in a Tokyo Olympics qualification event. With the government recently allowing gymnasiums to function at 50% capacity after having initially asked them to shutter down, the swimmers too are hopeful of securing partial relief. If a decision is delayed, the Swimming Federation of India is considering shifting the training base to Delhi. “Both assured that they will give some relief,” said KSA secretary Satish Kumar. A few hundred swimmers, coaches and members of affiliated clubs also gathered at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium to appeal to the government to reopen the pools. “Many families depend on swimming pools for their living and careers of many coaches and pool maintenance staff are also at stake. Our sport was beginning to see some semblance of normalcy in the past few months, but the Karnataka government’s recent order will affect many lives. We requested them to reconsider it,” added Mr. Satish Kumar.

06 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Names of vaccine expert panel released||Names of the 10-member Subject Expert Committee (SEC) that approved Covaxin for restricted emergency use in clinical trial mode — after meetings on December 30, 2020, and January 1-2, 2021 — were made public by the Health Ministry on March 23. The identity of the SEC members, which has been kept under wraps, was finally disclosed by the Ministry in response to a Rajya Sabha question by Congress MP Syed Nasir Hussain. The 10 members are: Dr. Varsha Gupta, Professor, Department of Microbiology, Government Medical College Hospital, Chandigarh; Dr. Archana Thakur, Medical Director, Professor and HOD (Microbiology), G.B. Pant Hospital, New Delhi; Dr. Abhishek Agarwal, Emeritus Professor, Department of Medicine, SMS Medical College, Jaipur; Dr. Sushant H. Meshram, Professor and Head, Pulmonary Medicine Department, Government Medical College & Hospital, Nagpur; Dr. Anant Mohan, Professor and Head, Pulmonary Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. A.P. Dubey, Professor of Paediatrics, ESI (PGIMSR) Hospital, New Delhi; Dr. Arvind Bagga, Professor, Department of Paediatrics, AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. Dipendra K. Mitra, Professor and Head, Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics Department, AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. B. Gupta, Professor, General Medicine Department, NDMC Medical College and Hindu Rao Hospital, New Delhi; and Dr. D.S. Arya, Professor, Department of Pharmacology, AIIMS, New Delhi. According to the Health Ministry, nine of the 10 members participated in the virtual meeting held on January 2. Except Dr. B. Gupta from NDMC Medical College and Hindu Rao Hospital who expressed concerns about the vaccine candidate, the other eight members gave restricted use approval for Covaxin. The recommendation of the SEC meeting held on January 2, 2021 has been posted on the website of the drug regulator too. The restricted use approval for Covaxin came under a cloud as there was no efficacy data available at the time. The Committee approved the vaccine for restricted use based on the safety and efficacy data from a non-human, primate challenge study where the vaccine has been found to be safe and effective. The approval came with riders saying it was in “public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/names-of-vaccine-expert-panel-released/article34249255.ece
06 April 2021||KALPETTA,||An app to woo voters in Wayanad||In view of the COVID-19 scenario, the Wayanad district administration has come up with an innovative mobile application, ‘Poll Wayanad’, to woo more voters to polling booths and maintain the COVID protocol by controlling the crowd in booths. Perhaps the first such in the country, the application can clarify doubts voters have such as if a booth is busy and the approximate waiting time before casting the ballot at a booth, said District Collector and district electoral officer Adeela Abdulla on Monday. The idea for creating such an app that can reduce the rush in polling booths in view of the pandemic was proposed by three Computer Science Engineering students — E.P. Aslam, Abhiram K Pradeep, and P. Abhinav — of the Government Engineering College, Mananthavady, before the Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) in the district. The application has been developed with the support of the Kerala State IT Mission and the National Informatics Centre. The details of 412 polling booths of 948 booths in three Assembly segments in the district will be available at the fingertips of voters with the assistance of webcasting facilities, said Ms. Abdulla. Hourly update Starting from 7 a.m. on the poll day on Tuesday, operators of Akshaya Kendras in the selected booths with network connection would update the number of voters in queue at a specific time. This would be updated every hour until the end of polling, she said. Four control rooms, including one each in each Assembly segment, and a main control room at the Collectorate have been set up, and as many as 45 officials deployed at control rooms. The mobile application is available on Google Play Store. It is also available on the website www.wayanad.gov.in .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/an-app-to-woo-voters-in-wayanad/article34249694.ece
06 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Woman appears in court||The woman in the CD scandal involving former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi on Monday appeared before a special court to record her statement before the magistrate regarding the kidnap case filed by her parents in Belagavi, which was later transferred to R.T. Nagar police station in Bengaluru. Escorted by a team of policemen, the woman walked into the court, situated at Gurunanak Bhavan, and gave her statement. The magistrate recorded her statement for around one and a half hours, as per Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This was the woman’s second deposition before the magistrate soon after she surfaced. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) looking into the case had earlier questioned the woman about the R.T. Nagar case, but she had denied that she was kidnapped and maintained that she had gone to Goa on her own after the video was released. Soon after her deposition, she was escorted to an undisclosed location. The woman will not go to the SIT for the next few days as most of the officers are primary contacts of Mr. Jarkiholi, who has tested positive for COVID-19. She is also reportedly scared of appearing before any of the officers for fear of contracting the infection. Earlier, advocate Jagadish Kumar, representing the woman, handed over a letter written by her to Bengaluru City Police Commissioner Kamal Pant and took an acknowledgement. In the letter, she has accused the SIT of treating her as an accused in the entire episode. The same letter has been forwarded to the High Court of Karnataka. The advocate said that if the Commissioner did not take any action, the HC would take its course and the government would have to change the publicprosecutor in the case as the victim was not contacted before their appointment. He also took exception to the Chief Minister openly saying that Mr. Jarkiholi would get a clean chit in the CD case. Mr. Kumar also alleged that the entire episode of Mr. Jarkiholi testing positive for COVID-19 and getting hospitalised was a way to escape SIT questioning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/woman-appears-in-court/article34249215.ece
06 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Spectre of cross-voting worries fronts in Kerala||The spectre of cross-voting seemed to plague political fronts ahead of the Assembly elections in Kerala on Tuesday. Apprehensions about last-minute shifts in voting behaviour also appeared to niggle at the minds of candidates. As the silent campaigning ended, it seemed the electoral contest had narrowed down largely to a three-cornered race. The LDF is fighting for the continuity of governance. The UDF wants to show the “corrupt” State government the door. The BJP stressed the need for a new electoral alliance to occupy the political centre-ground in Kerala. The coalitions energetically sought votes. Automated telephone calls delivered recorded requests for support to voters. Candidates knocked on doors with supporters. Both LDF and UDF candidates seemed to focus on minority community voters. The duelling coalitions tried to sell themselves as the best defence against an emergent BJP. The BJP has emerged as a decisive third force and sought to supplant the Congress as the primary opponent to the LDF. Campaign managers did not rule out “tactical voting” on polling day. Organising last-minute cross-party voting was not difficult for most parties in Kerala. The opposing fronts traded accusations of cross-voting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/spectre-of-cross-voting-worries-fronts-in-kerala/article34249217.ece

U.S. Secretary of Defence Lloyd James Austin III during his latest visit to New Delhi had said that he had not raised the issue of sanctions with the Indian side. India is expected to receive the first S-400 system later this year. The delivery may attract U.S. sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. On the visit of President Biden’s climate envoy, the U.S. Embassy spokesperson said, “A key focus for our a0dministration is supporting and encouraging India’s decarbonisation efforts through clean, zero and low-carbon investment, and supporting India in mitigating its fossil energy use.” After India, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit Dhaka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/key-lavrov-jaishankar-talks-to-be-held-today/article34249228.ece

In the recent past, the CRPF has opened 18 new security camps in South Bastar. “New camps are being established in the area, because of which the Naxalites are panicking. The area of Naxalite dominance is shrinking rapidly. It is the first time when we have entered the den of Naxalites,” Mr. Baghel said. Mr. Shah flew to Chhattisgarh on Monday. During his day long visit, Mr. Shah visited Jagdalpur where he attended the wreath laying ceremony for the fallen personnel. On April 2 evening, a joint team of the Chhattisgarh Police, comprising the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Special Task Force (STF) along with various teams of Central Reserve Police Force, had proceeded for a combing operation in south Bastar. An exchange of fire started with the Maoists on April 3 around 12 noon and it lasted for over three hours. The bodies of jawans could only be retrieved 24 hours later on April 4. The deceased include seven from the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action unit (CoBRA) of the CRPF, and 15 from the Chhattisgarh Police.

06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jawans cannot be martyred at will: Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday said, “Jawans are not cannon fodder to be martyred at will”, and alleged that the anti-naxal operations in Chhattisgarh were either poorly designed or incompetently executed. “No Indian jawan should face an enemy without body armour in the 21st century. It needs to be made available to every soldier,” Mr. Gandhi said in a tweet. In another tweet, he commented on a media report that quoted CRPF chief General Kuldeep Singh as saying that an equal number of naxals were killed. “If there was no intelligence failure then a 1:1 death ratio means it was a poorly designed and incompetently executed operation,” Mr. Gandhi said on Twitter. The Congress also targeted Home Minister Amit Shah for “continuing to address election campaigns in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam”. “When armed forces and soldiers were becoming martyrs, the Home Minister was doing a roadshow with a former cine actress in Tamil Nadu. Thereafter, he addressed another meeting in Tirunelveli, then he went to Kerala and finally proceeded to Assam. He didn’t come to Delhi or go to Chhattisgarh. On April 4, he addressed another rally in Sorbhog in Assam,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jawans-cannot-be-martyred-at-will-rahul/article34249240.ece
06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||2 hospitals vaccinating under-45s, says Centre||Two private healthcare facilities here, Vidyasagar Institute of Mental Health (VIMHANS) and Bensups Hospital, have been registering beneficiaries below 45 years as ‘healthcare workers (HCW)’ and ‘frontline workers (FLW)’ and vaccinating them. The Health Ministry has marked this out as a “serious lapse” and has asked the Delhi government to seek an explanation from the hospitals and, if necessary, “depanel” them, according to press statement on Monday. On April 3, Health Secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, had written to health authorities in all States that “ineligible beneficiaries” were being registered as HCW and FLW and vaccinated. This led to the HCW database increasing by 24% and therefore the apex vaccination committee, the NEGVAC, had decided on Saturday to bar all registrations in the HCW and FLW category. The deadlines for these two groups, Bhushan’s letter said, had been extended multiple times. The number of daily vaccinations in recent weeks has hovered between 2 and 2.5 million due to which India, in spite of being among the countries of the world having administered the highest number of doses, is middling in terms of the percentage of the population covered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-hospitals-vaccinating-under-45s-says-centre/article34249252.ece
06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Govt. rejects Rafale report as Cong. demands probe||In the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Mr. Gandhi had made the alleged corruption in the Rafale deal as the party’s main poll plank but the BJP’s thumping victory made the issue politically ‘unsustainable’. The latest investigations by Mediapart could, however, revive the issue in the election season, especially in West Bengal where there are five more phases of voting. The French portal reported that an Indian company owned by a middleman, being investigated for another defence deal in India, received payment to the tune of € 1.1 million euros. “That middleman is now accused of money laundering in India in another defence deal. The company said the money was used to pay for the manufacture of 50 large replica models of Rafale jets, even though the inspectors were given no proof that these models were made. Yet against all apparent logic, the AFA decided not to refer the matter to prosecutors,” according to an investigation by Mediapart. Dassault had provided AFA with a “proforma invoice” dated March 30, 2017 supplied by an Indian company called Defsys Solutions which according to the AFA investigation report was related to 50% of the total order (€1,017,850), for the manufacture of 50 models of the Rafale C, with a price per unit of €20,357. However, the report claimed, Dassault was unable to provide the AFA with a “single document showing that these models existed and were delivered, and not even a photograph” when AFA inspectors subsequently found these details in mid-October 2018 and asked the company for an explanation. “The inspectors thus suspected that this was a bogus purchase designed to hide hidden financial transactions,” it said. The Indian company in question, Defsys Solutions — one of Dassault’s sub-contractors in India for the Rafale deal — specialises in assembles flight simulators and optical and electronic systems for the aeronautical industry, often under licence for foreign companies, according to the report. The company belongs to the Gupta family, one of whom is being investigated in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal. “Does it now not require a full and independent investigation into India's biggest defence deal to find out as to how much bribery and commission in reality, if any, was paid and to whom in the Indian government? Will Prime Minister Narendra Modi answer to the nation now?” asked Mr. Surjewala. “How can middleman and payment of commission be permitted in a ‘government-to-government Defence Contract’ or in any Defence procurement in India in violation of the mandatory Defence Procurement Procedure,” he added. Mr. Surjewala said the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) as well as the “Integrity Clause” in government of India’s policy regarding defence purchases explicitly bars commission for middleman or any such payments that can be construed as bribe. Dismissing the latest claims, the Law Minister suggested that the report in the French media about the alleged financial irregularity may be due to “corporate rivalry” in that country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-rejects-rafale-report-as-cong-demands-probe/article34249233.ece

The three opposing fronts traded accusations of cross-voting. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, said the Congress had struck a secret alliance with the LDF in at least 20 constituencies to defeat the BJP. The pact was evident in Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran’s statement. He had publicly sought LDF votes to defeat the BJP State president K. Surendran in Manjeswaram. In reciprocation, the Congress would help the CPI(M) in Nemom, he alleged. Mr. Ramachandran said the CPI(M) and BJP were in cahoots to defeat the Congress. The LDF had assigned a “weak candidate” in Manjeswaram to help Mr. Surendran. The National Democratic Alliance had no candidate in Thalassery, Guruvayur and Devikulam. Deliberate vacuum The BJP had deliberately created a political vacuum to aid the LDF, he said. CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said the Congress had cross-voted to ensure a BJP victory in Nemom in the 2016 Assembly elections. The symbiotic relationship has been extended to other constituencies in 2021.

06 April 2021||Bengaluru,||HC relief for Shivakumar in tax case||In a relief to former Minister D.K. Shivakumar, the High Court of Karnataka on Monday upheld a special court’s 2019 order discharging him from a case concerning alleged evasion of income tax of around Rs. 13 crore. The case was initiated against him based on financial transactions that he had scribbled on a sheet of paper that he tore during a search conducted at a resort on the outskirts of the city during August 2017. Justice John Michael Cunha passed the order while dismissing the revision petitions filed by the Income Tax Department challenging the February 28, 2019, order of the special court set up to exclusively to deal with criminal cases against MPs and MLAs in Karnataka. The special court had discharged him on the basis of a technical reason, stating that the I-T officer, who had authorised the search, had no jurisdiction for estimating the undisclosed income of Mr. Shivakumar and for launching the prosecution by filing a complaint. However, the special court had said the I-T Department was at liberty to launch a prosecution afresh against Mr. Shivakumar after the jurisdictional assessing officer estimated the undisclosed income on the basis of the material produced by the authorised officer for search and such other material available with him, if necessary. Thedepartment’s allegation was that Mr. Shivakumar had evaded tax to the tune of Rs. 3.1 crore in the assessment year 2015-16, Rs. 2.56 crore in the year 2016-17, and Rs. 7.08 crore in the year 2017-18. ‘No jurisdiction’ The special court had held that Sunil Gautham, Deputy Director, I-T Investigations, who was the authorised officer to conduct the searches, had no jurisdiction to estimate the undisclosed income, interest, and penalty payable by the accused. Pointing out that the officer should have produced all the material before the jurisdictional assessing officer within a specified period, the special court had said that the records did not disclose the production of such material as per the provisions of the Income-Tax Act. On the allegation that Mr. Shivakumar had destroyed evidence by tearing the sheet of paper, the special court had saidno case was made by the I-T Department under Section 201 of the IPC as the allegedly obliterated/destroyed piece of paper was produced by the department in the complaint and contents of the paper were used against him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-relief-for-shivakumar-in-tax-case/article34249211.ece
06 April 2021||SANGAREDDY,||IIT-H develops alternative to lithium-ion batteries||The Electrochemical Energy Storage (EES) Lab at IIT-Hyderabad has developed a 5V Dual Carbon Battery utilising self-standing carbon fiber mats as both electrodes (cathode and anode). This new model sets aside the requirement of toxic, costly and heavy transitional metals. Energy economy based on renewable sources has been put forward as a way out to reduce dependence on fossil fuel. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are projected to meet future electric mobility, electric aviation, and stationary grid energy storage targets by 2030. However, LIBs need toxic and costly metals like cobalt, nickel, manganese and other materials to function. Geologically unsymmetrical distribution of lithium and cobalt along with geopolitics and unethical child labour centered on mining causes fluctuations in raw material cost. It affects market price stability of large LIB packs used in electric vehicles. In the dual-carbon battery, both the electrodes consist of carbonaceous materials, and the ions from the electrolyte intercalate and de-intercalate into the electrode matrix. The novel dual carbon battery consisting of zero transition metal may cut down the overall battery cost by 20-25% and is expected to curb the unpredictability in market price. The use of ubiquitous carbon as electrode active material as well as current collector replacing heavy metals brings in the aspects of lightness and flexibility. The fabricated 5.0 voltage (nominal voltage 4.6 V) cell provides an energy density of 100-watt hour per kilogram approximately and can be extended up to 150-watt hour per kilogram with further modifications. The research team believes that developed cells may find potential use in high voltage applications, sophisticated battery-run medical devices, regenerative braking systems in electric vehicles, and stationary grids. “The study will be extrapolated to push the energy density limits further, and our broad vision includes introducing the dual carbon system as a cheaper LIB alternative to the Indian market,” said chemistry associate professor Surendra Kumar Martha, who led the research team.The research was carried out by Shuvajit Ghosh and Udita Bhattacharjee, PhD students at IIT Hyderabad, under the supervision of Mr Martha, in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (USA) and Naval Materials Research Laboratory (Mumbai). Naval Research Board (DRDO) supported the project.  Our broad vision includes introducing the dual carbon system as a cheaper LIB alternative to the Indian market.

06 April 2021||Kolkata,||Third phase of polls in West Bengal today||The Election Commission of India has deployed about 618 company of Central forces in West Bengal for the third phase of polling in the State in which 31 Assembly seats are going to polls on Tuesday. Of the 618 companies of Central forces, 317 companies will be deployed in South 24 Parganas, the district where 16 Assembly seats are going to polls. 167 companies of Central forces will be developed in Hooghly and remaining in Howrah. Eight seats in Hooghly and seven in Howrah will go to polls in the third phase. As many as 205 candidates are in the poll fray across the 31 seats and about 78 lakh electors can exercise their franchise in this phase across 10,871 polling booths. Twelve of the 31 Assembly segments in the State are reserved for schedule caste candidates. The Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party have fielded candidates on all 31 seats. During the day Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and BJP president J.P. Nadda campaigned for the Assembly seats which go to polls on Tuesday. Mr. Nadda held a road show in Tollygunj in the city but could not participate in other political events in the district as he had to leave for Delhi for an urgent meeting. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee held public rallies in Uttarpara and Chunchura Assembly seats. In her campaign speeches she attacked the Indian Secular Front (ISF), floated by an influential Muslim cleric and part of the alliance of the CPI(M) and the Congress, alleging that parties like it are “more dangerous than a cobra”. Referring to the BJP’s allegation that she indulged in the politics of minority appeasement, Banerjee claimed that Hindus and Muslims are living well in the state since she is there. ‘Power in Delhi’ The Chief Minister asserted that she would win the ongoing Assembly polls despite suffering an injury and eventually aim for power in Delhi. Speaking at a rally at Bhangar in South 24 Parganas district which has a considerable minority population, Banerjee asked people not to vote for the ISF candidate there, claiming that every vote for him will mean gain for the BJP. “Some say I appease the Muslims. I tell them that both Hindus and Muslims are living well since I am there. It would not have been the case had I not been there,” she said. Claiming that the CPI(M) and the Congress are friends of the BJP, the TMC supremo said that another party has surfaced to eat into the minority vote share of her party.  ‘Take BJP cash, vote TMC’ Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee also held political meeting at Pandua in Hooghly district and Bally in Howrah district. Addressing political rallies, Mr. Banerjee accused the BJP of distributing cash for votes in West Bengal and asked the people to accept the money but exercise their ballot for TMC instead. There will be anarchy in the State if the saffron party assumes power in West Bengal, he cautioned the voters. “BJP is distributing money to the people and asking them to cast their votes for the party. I ask you (the people) to accept the money and not return it, but cast your votes for the smaller flower,” Mr. Banerjee said on Monday referring to the grass flower which is the symbol of TMC and the much larger lotus, the emblem of the saffron party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/unprecedented-deployment-of-central-forces-in-bengal/article34249244.ece

06 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Filmmaker P. Balachandran passes away||P.Balachandran, screenwriter, filmmaker, dramatist and actor, passed away at his home in Vaikom on Monday. He was 69. In a creative life spanning several decades, he experimented and reinvented himself, shifting seamlessly between the stage and the screen, writing critically acclaimed and popular scripts. Even before he plunged into cinema, he had made a name for himself as a playwright, winning the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for best playwright for Paavam Usman in 1989 and the Kerala Professional Drama Award for Prathiroopangal the same year. His foray into cinema was by scripting Uncle Bun (1991) starring Mohanlal. Though the first work was a mere adaptation of a foreign film, he proved his mettle with his second film Ulladakkam (1994), which explored the strange obsession that a patient develops with a psychiatrist and wove a theme around the phenomenon of transference proposed by Sigmund Freud. 'Mahakavis'  Pavithram (1995) told the story of a man who is forced to be the brother and father of a much younger sister. Punaradhivasam , which he wrote in 2000, scooped up several State awards. In 2012, he wrote and directed Ivan Megharoopan , on the life and many relationships of poet P. Kunhiraman Nair, one of the 'Mahakavis' of Malayalam. Balachandran showed a penchant for adapting to the changes in Malayalam cinema in recent times, most evidently in scripting Kammatipadam (2016).  Though he started his film acting career as early as 1982 as an extra in Richard Attenborough's Gandhi, it was over the past decade that he became a familiar face to the audience, with performances in Beautiful , Trivandrum Lodge , Annayum Rasoolum , Kammatipadam , Charlie , Eeda and One . Born in Sasthamkotta in Kollam district, he graduated from the School of Drama in Thrissur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/filmmaker-p-balachandran-passes-away/article34249219.ece

06 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N., U.T. go to the polls today||Voters in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will on Tuesday exercise their franchise, adhering to the COVID-19 safety protocol, to elect new governments. The byelection to the Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha constituency will be held simultaneously. In Tamil Nadu, which will witness a multi-cornered contest, the AIADMK-led alliance, with Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its chief ministerial candidate, is seeking a renewed mandate. DMK president M.K. Stalin, heading a rainbow alliance, is making a strong pitch to form a government with himself as the Chief Minister for the first time. The Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK), anchored by Seeman, and the alliances led by Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) and T.T.V. Dhinakaran’s Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) are also seeking to prove themselves as credible alternatives to the two Dravidian parties. In Puducherry, where the V. Narayanasamy government fell in February, voters would choose essentially between the fronts led by the Congress and the All India N.R. Congress. Tamil Nadu Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo said on Monday that polling would begin at 7 a.m. and end at 7 p.m. At a press conference, he said 95% of the booth slips had been distributed.

Booth details Voters could obtain booth details from the National Voters Service Portal or by dialling ‘1950’ with the respective STD code prefixed. On representations for cancellation of polling for alleged cash distribution, he said a report had been sent to the Election Commission of India, and it could take a decision any time. He said 1,29,165 ballot units, 91,180 control units and 91,180 VVPAT units had been kept ready. He said the total number of booths is 88,937, as against 67,000 in the previous election.

06 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. sets up election war room||The Greater Chennai Corporation is going the whole hog to ensure a trouble-free election in the 16 Assembly constituencies in the city on Tuesday. G. Prakash, District Election Officer and Corporation Commissioner, and G. Meghanath Reddy, Additional District Election Officer, along with other senior civic officials, inspected the ‘war room’ at the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) behind the Ripon Building to monitor the election. Mr. Prakash  told The Hindu that more than 55,000 officials and police personnel would be on election duty on Tuesday.

06 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||UGC nod for online courses opens new avenues for teachers, students||In the past year, ever since COVID-19 restrictions came into force, the universities and colleges have been keeping students engaged through online classes. Although the teaching learning assessment has to be critically evaluated, the change may be here to stay. Late last month, the University Grants Commission issued a notice that institutions could offer up to 40% of courses in a particular programme in a semester through the online learning platforms such as Swayam. At the same time, the Consortium for Educational Communication signed an agreement with the University of Madras to develop multimedia course content. Senior academicians say the pandemic had opened new avenues that the National Education Policy had envisaged. “The UGC advisory is in tune with the NEP in its attempt to raise the standards of online education programmes. But it may be in a phased manner,” said S.P. Thyagarajan, Chancellor of Avinashilingam University. The UGC guidelines cannot be directly adopted by universities which were governed by statutory bodies, he said. The benefit was that the students would have access to talented teachers from across the country, he said. Universities have to strengthen their infrastructure, e-resources and its faculty before launching online programmes. First stage of activity The UGC’s recommendation would at best give avenue for the first stage of activity, he said. “We will have to take the stakeholders’ feedback, including teacher and student fraternity and critically evaluate the outcome of the quality of these programmes,” Prof. Thyagarajan said. University Grants Commission’s former Vice-Chairman H. Devaraj flagged the issue of quality. “In an online class, who will monitor the students or the quality of the courses,” he asked. Unless students show interest in learning instead of aiming to gain a degree, he sees very little change happening in the online education method. Even in programmes offered under National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) by the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M), less than 8% of those who enrol completed the course, he said. The data provided by the IIT-M, which has developed over 2,000 courses by talented teachers, is a pointer. Under the MOOCs format, the IIT-M offered 2,467 courses in the last seven years and 1.24 crore candidates had enrolled. About 11.24 lakh learners have registered for the exams so far. Of the 16.8 lakh enrolments for the current semester, 2.4 lakh learners have registered for in-person proctored exams, said Prathap Haridoss, faculty coordinator, NPTEL.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ugc-nod-for-online-courses-opens-new-avenues-for-teachers-students/article34249449.ece
06 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Coastal areas may escape high temperatures on polling day||Voters in coastal Tamil Nadu may get a respite from the scorching sun on polling day. However, the Meteorological Department forecasts interior districts will sizzle under the grip of the heatwave till April 7. With the cool, moist easterly winds returning over coastal places, the day temperature has reduced in places like Chennai. But, people may have to brace for sultry weather as high humidity will prevail on Tuesday too. On Monday, the weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded 34.5 degree Celsius and 33.6 degree Celsius respectively, which is normal for the season. However, the humidity level was at 77%. The Meteorological Department has advised people to consume more fluids and fruits to remain hydrated during such humid weather. Moreover, heatwave conditions may persist over 11 interior districts, including Madurai, Dindigul, Tiruchi, Erode, Namakkal and Karur districts, on Tuesday. The day temperature may soar by three to five degree Celsius above normal in these districts. People in these places must avoid working outdoors and exposure to direct sunlight between noon and 4 p.m. and also wear light coloured cotton clothes, officials said. As dry weather will continue over the State, the maximum temperature in other districts may increase by one to three degrees Celsius till Wednesday. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the change in wind direction had led to a dip in the mercury level and heatwave conditions, particularly in the coastal region. However, the moisture laden winds had led to higher humidity. North- easterly winds, which bring in more moisture, often prevailed over Chennai on Monday. There is a possibility of light rains in one or two areas over the interior areas of the State on April 9 owing to convective activity, he added. During the past 24 hours ending on Monday, a few places, including Edappadi in Salem district, received light rains. The Meteorological Department forecasts that the maximum temperature in Chennai will be around 36 degree Celsius till Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/states-coastal-areas-may-escape-high-temperatures-on-polling-day/article34249455.ece

06 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK for Governor’s nod to file complaint against EPS, OPS||The DMK on Monday requested Governor Banwarilal Purohit to accord permission to register a criminal complaint against Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, Revenue Minister R.B. Udayakumar and other officials for alleged alienation of a government property by abusing official position. DMK organisation secretary R.S. Bharathi, in a memorandum to the Governor, alleged that there was a criminal conspiracy and corruption. Mr. Bharathi said 10.5 acres of government land in Koyambedu village, Chennai, was alienated in favour of Baashyam Constructions Pvt. Ltd. at the rate of Rs. 12,500 per sq.ft. G.O. in a hurry According to him, the government order for alienation of land was passed in a hurry, on February 8, when the model code of conduct was looming in view of the Assembly election. “There was no need for a government, which was in the last few days in office, to issue an order to alienate prime property. The timing of the order was that the beneficiaries could get the land before a new government assumed office,” he alleged. Mr. Bharathi said the order allowing Bashyam Constructions to get CMDA approval and planning permission was a gross violation of RSO 24. “The legal opinion obtained clearing the alienation prima facie is untenable and appears to be obtained under pressure,” he alleged. Mr. Bharathi described as “spurious” the claim of the G.O. that the company could bring in an investment to the tune of Rs. 1,575 crore and generate 7,500 jobs as it had planned to construct residential complexes. Alleging that the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister and Revenue Minister had entered into a criminal conspiracy with the Baashyam Constructions, Mr. Bharathi requested the Governor to register a complaint against them.

Alagiri sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s response to the latest allegations of pay offs to middlemen in the Rafale jets deal. Mr. Modi has been insisting that there was no scam in the purchase of Rafale jets from France. The Congress leader said Mr. Modi cannot remain silent on the issue anymore after a revelation in a French media portal that Dassault Aviation, the aircraft manufacturer, had paid around Rs. 8.6 crore to a middleman. “Prime Minister’s statement that there was no corruption in the purchase of Rafale jets is contrary to the truth. Just like how Mr. Modi keeps silent on all issues, he cannot be silent on this issue as he is connected with it and must answer the charges,” Mr. Alagiri said. The TNCC president said former Congress president Rahul Gandhi had already raised the issue of corruption in the deal for which proof had now come out in the open. “There is now proof that Rs. 8.62 crore was paid to a middleman as a bribe. There must be an independent inquiry into the matter as this concerns national security,” he said. Mr. Alagiri demanded that Dassault Aviation be banned from doing business with India and a first information report be filed against the company and legal proceedings initiated. The BJP government at the Centre must also seek compensation from the aviation company, he said.

(CMRL) plans to take up work at many locations simultaneously. It wants to first start operations between Poonamallee and Power House, which is an elevated 12-km stretch and subsequently from Madhavaram to CMBT and Madhavaram to Sholinganallur, which will have a combination of elevated and underground sections running to 52 km. According to CMRL officials, tenders had been floated for the construction of these stretches last year and the contractors finalised. “But there is something called ‘Letter of Acceptance’, which is a formal contract document indicating we are issuing the contract to a respective firm. We will issue it after May 15 when the Election Code of Conduct ends. After that, it will take a month for them to mobilise a team and then establish a site office at the respective work sites,” an official said. After getting the letter of acceptance, the contractors would have to redo a survey for finding out where cables and pipelines run underneath. “Though CMRL would have already done this survey, the contractor will do it again to confirm and ensure that services are not disrupted. By the end of July, they may be able to start the ground work and by October, they may start laying the pile foundation for the elevated stretch and construct the diaphragm wall in the underground stretches,” a source said. Meanwhile, the traffic diversion will have to finalised in this time. CMRL wants to start operations between Poonamallee and Power House by the end of 2024 or early 2025.

06 April 2021||ERODE/DHARMAPURI,TAMIL NADU||Donkeys deliver ballot boxes in hill hamlets||During every election, three hill hamlets in Dharmapuri district and one in Erode get polling materials delivered by donkeys. For years, these villages have remained inaccessible to vehicles, and can be reached only on foot. As in the past, donkeys on Monday began to trek up to help in the election process. In the Anthiyur Assembly constituency, election officials, two donkeys and a few local people trekked a nine-km jungle terrain to ferry electronic voting machines (EVMs), Voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) units and other materials to Kathirimalai village that has 134 votes. Coming under the Bargur panchayat, the village is located 1,200 metres above sea level inside the reserve forest area of the Chennampatti Forest Range in the Erode Forest Division. With no power supply, only solar lamps light up the village, which does not have mobile phone connectivity either. The Government Tribal Residential Middle School serves as the polling booth at Kathirimalai. Though it is in the Erode revenue district, the village can be reached only after four hours of trek from Kathiripatti at the foothills at Kolathur in Salem district. A team, led by Zonal Officer V.S. Palanivel and comprising polling and police personnel and forest guard, travelled 58 km from Anthiyur and reached Kathiripatti. While EVMs and VVPAT units were loaded on the two donkeys, other polling materials were carried as head-load by 10 local people. The team started at 3.30 p.m. from the foothills and was expected to reach the hilltop by 7.30 p.m. After polling ends at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, officials have to climb down at night to reach the foothills, from where they can drive to the counting centre at the Institute of Road and Transport Technology at Chithode. The total distance they have to cover is 78 km. At Pennagaram in Dharmapuri district, EVMs were fastened to donkeys to reach Kottur, Kottu Alakettu and Erimalai. The run-up to the election was marked by a poll boycott threat by the villages over the lack of roads to reach the hill hamlets. Chinnaraj, 61, has been at it for 43 years, making his donkeys carry ballot boxes to the villages uphill. However, this time, a section of the Kottur residents declared a poll boycott for want of better roads. Officials visited the village that has 730 voters to promise them roads and persuade them to vote. Though a tar-top road had been promised at every election, the villagers had to contend with only a ‘kuccha’ road. And, every election, it has become a routine for Chinnaraj and his donkeys to lug ballot boxes to the village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/donkeys-deliver-evms-to-hill-hamlets/article34249416.ece

06 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||CoP told to probe use of image of youth in signboards||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Madurai Commissioner of Police to probe into a 2012 incident where the image of a youth was wrongly used in signboards to caution the devotees of thieves during the Chithirai festival. Hearing the appeal filed by the youth, A Division Bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and S. Kannammal directed the Police Commissioner to take appropriate action against the erring police personnel. The youth preferred an appeal against a single bench order that dismissed his plea for compensation and appropriate action against the erring police personnel. He said that he was booked by the police after he was involved in a scuffle with his college mates. He claimed that the police had foisted a case against him. He was arrested, remanded in police custody and released on the same day on bail in 2011. Under these circumstances, the police used his photograph in the signboards to caution the devotees of thieves. Subsequently, the youth was acquitted by the trial court. The judges observed that as per the Police Standing Order, the provisions speak of habitual offenders and convicted persons. The appellant was not a habitual offender but was an under trial at that time. There was foul play in the act and the erring police officials responsible cannot go scot-free, the court said. The judges ordered a probe into the incident and directed the Commissioner of Police to complete the probe in 12 weeks and file a report to the court. The case was posted for reporting compliance on July 9.

06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||Perarivalan’s mother moves Supreme Court||A petition was moved in the Supreme Court by the mother of A.G. Perarivalan, who is serving life imprisonment in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, seeking a copy of a communication from the Tamil Nadu Governor concerning her son’s plea for an early release. T. Arputham, represented by advocates Prabu Ramasubramanian and K. Paari Vendhan, said the letter from the Governor was read out by the public prosecutor in the Madras High Court on July 29, last year. The petition said that it contained a statement from the Governor that he was “awaiting a decision from the CBI/ Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) on a recommendation of the Council of Ministers of Government of Tamil Nadu, dated September 9, 2018”. The State Cabinet had recommended the premature release of Perarivalan. He had already spent 30 years in prison since his arrest at the age of 19. However, neither the prosecutor’s office nor the Governor’s office parted with a copy of the letter to the distressed family of Perarivalan. Violation of Article 21 “Non-serving of documents to the petitioner (Arputham) would be a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, which that states that ‘no human shall be denied of his right to life and personal liberty except if established by law’, which means that the process must be fair, clear and not arbitrarily or oppressive,” the petition filed in the apex court said. Ms. Arputham said the State government did not part with the document despite an oral direction from the High Court. “Not only the principles of natural justice but also basic human courtesy demand that the affected persons are intimated duly about the status of their application, that too in a grave case where the present petitioner’s son is undergoing 30 years of imprisonment,” the petition said. It said the Governor’s communication in question was “very vital” as a petition concerning Perarivalan’s mercy petition is pending in the Supreme Court. ‘Competent authority’ The Centre, in February 2021, had filed an affidavit stating that the Governor had refrained from taking a call on a plea for early release of Perarivalan. The Governor had said the President of India was the “appropriate competent authority” to deal with Perarivalan’s request for freedom. The affidavit had highlighted that the case against Perarivalan concerned the assassination of none other than a former Prime Minister. Forty-three people had sustained serious injuries in the bomb explosion at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu in 1991.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/perarivalans-mother-moves-sc/article34249443.ece

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy had expressed displeasure over the prohibitory orders after concluding a special sitting to hear a public interest litigation petition filed by R. Rajangam, secretary, CPI(M), Puducherry, on Sunday. “Every citizen in a free country can do anything lawful that the citizen chooses and even the slightest of restriction on the citizens’ movement has to be justified. In the present case, the impugned notice of March 22, 2021, is singularly lacking in indicating any cogent reason for imposing restrictions on citizens’ movement and how citizens may choose to go about their business. Officials must be reminded that curbs are imposed on citizens and their freedom of movement and the like only when there is an imminent need or it is in the larger public interest,” the judges said. In a clarificatory order issued in her capacity as District Magistrate, the Collector said the expression, “prohibit the unlawful assembly and movement” appearing in the order, will not stand in the way of citizens going about their life and gathering for private functions. “It is made abundantly clear that the prohibition of unlawful assembly and movement in terms of the relevant order will not affect the usual life of citizens as they go about their business and chores,” the order said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prohibitory-orders-will-not-hit-life/article34249421.ece

Jayalalithaa, written bold on the digital banner erected on an autorickshaw accompanying her. Yes, you read it right. She does bear the name of two sworn rivals — Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, the late leaders of the Dravidian parties. While most of the Independents mysteriously vanished after filing nominations, Kalaignar Jayalalithaa visited almost all parts of the Thoothukudi Assembly constituency to seek votes in the April 6 election. “Since I am a popular bow-song (‘villupaattu’) exponent in Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli districts, people used to call me ‘Kalaignar Jayalalithaa’, and I used this name for my election campaign to attract the attention of voters,” says Ms. Jayalalithaa of SKSR Colony, Thoothukudi. Ms. Jayalalithaa started performing at temple festivals when she was just 13. As the journey continues, she is quite popular among the people of Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts. Is there any significance in naming her Jayalalithaa? “No... The names of all our family members — a brother and two sisters — start with either Jayam or Jaya. And my father, a bow-song master, named me Jayalalithaa,” she says. Ms. Jayalalithaa, who is the president of the Tamil Nadu Gramiya Kalaignargal Munnetra Sangam, has given many suggestions to the State government for the betterment of folk artists, who are battling poverty because of poor patronage. “But no one is bothered about our condition. When the temple festivals were stopped during the COVID-19 lockdown, most of us starved. We had just one meal a day. No party has made any promise to secure our well being. I’m not bothered about the outcome of the election, but I want to highlight the plight of the rural folk artists, which is being discussed after I entered the political arena,” she says.

Most of them were in Pachamalai. There was no problem in transporting the EVMs and other materials to the booths as all of them were well connected by roads. She had received inputs that presiding officers and polling materials had already reached boots. Ms. Divyadharshini said the mock poll would begin at 5.30 a.m. Agents of candidates have been asked to report at their respective booths at 5.15 a.m. so as to conduct the mock poll. The presiding officers would conduct the mock poll in the presence of at least two agents. If no agents reached the booths till 5.45 a.m., the presiding officers would go ahead with the mock poll without their presence. She said each polling centre would have a voters’ facilitation centre to assist the voters to identify their polling booths. All voters would be checked with thermometer to see whether they were running temperature. If any voters were found with high temperature, they would be asked to vote between 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.. The Collector said that out of 3,292 polling booths, 156 booths were classified as sensitive booths based on law and order and other issues in the previous elections. The proceedings in 1,490 booths would be monitored with web cameras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-arrangements-in-place-to-ensure-smooth-polling/article34249532.ece
06 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Extension of deadline for sub-debt scheme for MSMEs welcomed||BHEL Small Industries Centre has expressed relief over the announcement by Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises to extend Credit Guarantee Scheme for Subordinate Debt (CGSSD) till September 30. In its announcement earlier this month, the Central Government had informed that the scheme has been extended for six months to keep avenues of assistance open for stressed MSME units from the Rs. 20,000 crore subordinate debt fund. The Distressed Assets Fund was created during May, 2020, under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package to provide credit facility through lending institutions to the promoters of stressed MSMEs. The scheme was to remain in operation till March 31. “The extension of deadline will provide breathing space for stressed MSME units for consolidation,” BHELSIA president Rajappa Rajkumar said. Last December, BHELSIA had approached the Union Finance Ministry to modify the sub-debt scheme to enable stressed MSMEs to tide over the crisis caused by COVID pandemic. The sub-debt scheme in the present form was not of utility to stressed units of Tiruchi MSME engineering cluster. Subsequently, the MSME Ministry was also sounded about the issue. The six-month extension of Credit Guarantee Scheme for Subordinate Debt (CGSSD) has come at a crucial time when the ancillary industries are struggling with the impact of rise in price of steel. The Central Government’s extension of deadline for coal-fired power plants to lower their sulphur dioxide emissions is also a welcome decision, Mr. Rajappa Rajkumar said. In its order issued on April 1, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change had pushed the deadline for thermal electricity generators to install flue gas desulphurisation technology by up to three years. The utilities were not able to take to the technology due to the huge costs before the deadline of December 2017, and were given varying time frames for compliance. The latest deadline was December 2022. The new order pushes the deadline to 2024, for plants in less populated area. Plants due to retire soon have been given time till December 2025 even if they are situated in heavily-polluted areas. The three-year extension of deadline for installation of flue gas desulphurisation technology will give a push to chemical industries, Mr. Rajappa Rajkumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/extension-of-deadline-for-sub-debt-scheme-for-msmes-welcomed/article34249524.ece

06 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||It’s curtains for Tiruchi’s oldest cinema||Ramakrishna Talkies, one of the city's oldest theatres downed its shutters earlier this week after incurring heavy losses. The theatre’s former owner Jambaka Ramakrishnan, whose father-in-law M. R. S. Srinivas set up the theatre in his son's name- M.R.S. Ramakrishnan, recollects the theatre’s glory days. The theatre was set up in 1934, the same year Mr. Ramakrishnan was born. It came up on a piece of land which Mr. Srinivas, a doctor, had purchased to set up a hospital. Mr. Srinivas’ cousin from Chennai who ran a dubbing studio had encouraged him to do it as they could release films produced at their studio. Excess metal purchased for constructing Mettur dam was auctioned off, and the frames of the building were made using that very same metal. Up to 1947, the theatre ran with help from Mr. Srinivas’ brother. However, when his wife fell ill, they decided to lease the theatre out to a family who were already running Plaza Theatre, which screened popular English films in the city. “They screened English films at our theatre too. I remember watching ‘Land of the Pharaohs’, ‘20,000 Leagues Under the Sea’ at the theatre, years before I was married into the family,” Ms Jambaka said. When the 10-year-lease was over, the theatre was dragged into legal trouble as the daughter-in-law of the man who owned Plaza had sublet the theatre to another man. By then, Mr. Srinivas had bequeathed the theatre to Ms Jambaka in his will. “An 18-year-long battle ensued, with my husband, my brother and I taking turns to appear in court,” she said. In December 1989, she won the court battle. The man who they had fought against destroyed the furniture, ruined the screen and left the theatre in tatters, she recollected. After four months of renovations, the theatre reopened to the public in July 1989. “Even though we had gone through so much trouble, the highest we charged for a ticket, even until 2012, was Rs. 20," she said. There were tickets for Rs. 15, Rs. 10 and Rs. 5. They would even give out seven tickets for free for each show. The theatre functioned under the watchful eyes of Ms Jambaka for 24 years, until 2012, when the family decided to sell it. “I was getting old, and by then the flyover had been constructed and the area was becoming notorious and unsafe,” she said. “There is a piece of me in every brick of that theatre”, she reminisced. “My father-in-law did not permit women to take up work outside the house. I had a portrait of him on the wall in my office at the theatre. Every day I would look at that picture and think of how far I had come, how a woman ran a theatre all on her own for 24 years,” she said, with pride. The theatre, despite its old-world charm was no match for the newly cropping up multiplexes and had run itself into heavy debt, said S. Venkatesh Krishnan, who purchased the theatre from Mrs. Ramakrishnan in 2012. “People prefer multi-screen theatres,” he said. The COVID-19 pandemic and lack of business for over a year pushed it into further trouble. "Though the building is being demolished, we are yet to decide on what to do with the land,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/its-curtains-for-tiruchis-oldest-cinema/article34249526.ece
06 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Bribery case booked against K.N. Nehru||The Musiri police have registered a case against former Minister and DMK principal secretary K.N.

06 April 2021||Tirupattur,TAMIL NADU||EVM unit reaches Neknamalai in a vehicle||Chinnathayi, 40, looks astonished as she sees a vehicle, carrying the EVM unit, snake up a dusty road on the Neknamalai hill in Vaniyambadi taluk. This is the first time the unit is carried up the hill in a motor vehicle. “All these years, the EVM used to be carried on donkeys or a ‘doli’ up the hill to Neknamalai, a village five km from the foothill. This time, the dirt road was created, with the rocks cleared, to give us COVID-19 relief and because Ministers visited our village,” recalls Ms. Chinnathayi, who is walking to the village with a bag of vegetables for lack of transport. Over 500 voters There are a total of 160 families in the village, with over 500 voters. The residents are farmers, and their agriculture is rain-fed because water sources are scarce. They expected some amenities in their village, and they are a little satisfied after the dirt road was laid. For the local officials too, the road is a big relief as they recall the arduous trek up the hill during elections. “I have seen five elections, and every time, we used to carry the machine on the head or on donkeys. Luckily, prior to this election, a road was created, and we took the voting unit in a mini-truck. Officials and security men travelled in two other vehicles,” says S. Sivakumar, assistant zonal officer, Neknamalai. It used to take them more than an hour to reach the village where the booth is set up in a panchayat union primary school. Last time, the residents wanted to boycott the election as their long-pending demand for a proper road was not fulfilled. “We used to carry patients, bodies, groceries or other goods on our shoulders or on a ‘doli’. Now, one person in our village has a mini-truck, we use it. However, we need a proper cement road. Otherwise, there will not be any improvement in our life. It is hard to ride up the hill,” says T. Palani, a resident.  ‘No amenities’ Devaki, another resident, says there are no amenities on the hill. “We have to go to either Vaniyambadi or Alangayam for the hospital... We need a primary health centre at least. We only have single-phase power supply, and outages are common.” Children do not have proper educational facilities. “Teachers find it hard to come up. Some families have left the village for their children’s education,” says Ezhumalai, a resident, who completed his engineering graduation at Tirupattur. He says ration shops are also far away, and the village has no proper water supply. “Every time politicians give us hope, but their promises are never kept.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/evm-unit-reaches-neknamalai-in-a-vehicle/article34249413.ece

Those with mild symptoms can go to CCCs. After April 7, we will have 10 screening centres from the present three for triaging patients. Not all patients need to be treated in hospitals and doctors will decide on that,” he said. Slow vaccination Another area of concern was vaccination. The State has so far received nearly 54 lakh doses of the vaccines but the off-take had been low, he said. Only around 15,000 people were vaccinated on Sunday. “The disease is on the rise. All those aged above 45 should take the vaccine. We could not promote vaccination on campaign mode due to the model code of conduct. However, after April 7, we will take up this on a campaign mode to motivate people who are eligible to get vaccinated... Some might get infected after vaccination. It is said to have 70 to 85% efficacy 14 days after the second dose. In such cases, it will not be a severe COVID-19,” he said. Noting that vaccine hesitancy continued in the State, he said that neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka had more takers than T.N. The average capacity of a vaccination centre was 100 persons a day. On an average, RGGGH and Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, vaccinate up to 500 persons a day but in many cities, districts and rural parts, only 25 to 40 persons are vaccinated, he said. “The Centre’s supply of additional doses depended on the three-day average utilisation. States that have higher utilisation such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are getting more vaccines supplied. There is a view that we are not utilising the already supplied vaccines,” he said. So far, 4.25 lakh doses of Covaxin and 28.30 lakh doses of Covishield were utilised, he said. The State has till now received 7.8 lakh doses of Covaxin and 47.43 lakh doses of Covishield. Daily analysis till April 4 showed that Chennai’s test positivity rate was 8.01%, Ranipet 7.39%, Theni 6.85%, Coimbatore 6.17%, Chengalpattu 5.53%, Tiruvannamalai 5.38% and Salem 5.07%. Positivity rate “Except for these seven districts, the remaining have a lesser positivity rate. As per the Centre’s direction, we should bring down the positivity rate to below 5%. We should do additional tests for which fever camps will come in handy. The Corporation on an average conducts 500 camps a day, while in districts, 100 camps will be held where additional tests will be carried out. Attention will be given to all other districts with above 2% positivity rate. Only Tirupattur has below 2% positivity rate,” he said. Due to lack of adherence of SOPs such as checking for temperature and hand hygiene in places such as the service sector, the disease was spreading from one person to many. “Elections were a challenge, but do not assume that cases would drop after April 6. We have had cases through banks, service sectors and training centres,” he said. He said although schools were closed, training centres were being run illegally. Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine T. S. Selvavinayagam was present.  All those aged above 45 should take the vaccine. After April 7, we will promote vaccination on a campaign mode to motivate people  J.

Earlier, these buildings in Veeravanallur presented a pathetic sight, which prompted then Inspector Samson, a wildlife rescue expert, to approach his friends in Tirunelveli and Kanniyakumari districts. When they came forward to bear the expenditure of painting the buildings, it was decided that the effort should also educate the children about nature, wildlife conservation, tree planting and so on. These themes took the shape of colourful pictures on the walls of the anganwadis and schools, leaving teachers, students and parents amazed. The trend started to spread wherever sponsors could be found. For instance, two schools in Melapalayam and Reddiyarpatti on the outskirts of Palayamkottai were painted like train coaches with locomotives. Come Assembly election, the structures face threat of disfacement from posters. “Election posters carrying names of candidates, their symbols and other information are pasted on these beautifully painted walls. They leave the paintings badly damaged after they are removed. It happened during the Lok Sabha election in 2019 and our buildings are facing a similar threat again,” said a teacher of a panchayat union primary school in Cheranmahadevi block. “The posters, instead, can be put up in front of the booths,” she added. The teacher’s worst fears came true when polling material arrived at the new-look schools on Monday evening. Polling personnel hurriedly put up posters on the walls carrying pictures and left the spot. “Our schools remain closed due to COVID-19. If these posters are removed after the election, we request them to do it with utmost care so that the paintings are not damaged,” the teacher said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wall-paintings-on-schools-anganwadis-damaged-by-posters/article34249567.ece

06 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||CD scandal: Father says his daughter is being coerced||The High Court of Karnataka on Monday ordered issue of notice to the State government and the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on a petition filed by the father of the woman involved in the Ramesh Jarkiholi CD scandal. He alleged that his daughter’s statement was recorded “under pressure, influence and coercion” and that it “was not of her free will and volition”. Justice Ashok G. Nijagannavar, before whom the petition came up for hearing, adjourned further hearing on the matter. The petitioner has sought a direction for quashing his daughter’s statement before the magistrate, contending that it was recorded “illegally”. “It is a well-known fact that my daughter was under extraneous influence for the last 15 days or more, and though a complaint is said to have been lodged by her, she was not allowed to appear before the investigation officer or before the court, and it was all through an advocate as her mouthpiece,”the petitioner stated. According to the petitioner, his daughter had earlier told him that she was not the one who was found in the CD and that she was under tremendous pressure and “not in a position to say anything”. ‘Statement vitiated’ The petitioner claimed that he had learnt that an advocate, Surya Mukundraj, who is also general secretary of the legal cell of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, was present at the time of the recording of statement. “The statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC is vitiated for the sole reason of the presence of Mr. Mukundraj as reported in the media,” the petitioner contended. The petitioner also stated that he had “sensed pressure” on his daughter after he came to know through the media that her statement would be recorded by a magistrate even before she appeared before the investigating agency. He appealed through the media to keep his daughter “in isolation or in my custody or in the custody of the judiciary or some independent authority” to ensure that her statement is free of any pressure. “The facts and circumstances under which she was produced before the magistrate show that no effort was made to ensure that she made her statement voluntarily,” thepetitioner claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cd-scandal-father-says-his-daughter-is-being-coerced/article34249384.ece
06 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Experts warn against changing restrictions||The State government’s repeated rollback of restrictions has irked COVID-19 experts, who say the next four weeks are most critical in the entire period since the first COVID-19 case in the country. Whatever needs to be done has to be done now to cut the transmission cycle, they assert. A day after it announced stringent measures to tackle the spread of COVID-19, the State government modified its order on 50% seating capacity in cinemas following pressure from the film industry. The restriction has been postponed till April 7. Similarly, the next day the restriction pertaining to closure of gyms was also rolled back and they have been allowed to remain open with the 50% occupancy. Confusing signals Experts, who say that such flip-flops by the government will only send out confusing signals and lead to laxity among people who are already not following COVID-19 norms, assert that the State will go the Maharashtra way in the next three weeks. “Then it will become inevitable for the government to announce more drastic measures, which could have been avoided if the restrictions were in force at the right time. If schools had been closed earlier and cinemas were not allowed to open full capacity in February itself, the transmission cycle could have been cut. We do not know under what compulsion the government rolled back its restrictions,” said a senior expert. “When the government decides to issue an Order, the Chief Minister and the State’s administrators need to discuss what will be the consequences of the Order and anticipated response from the stakeholders. The Technical Advisory Committee can only recommend but the enforcing authority is the government. We are helpless,” said the expert. Stating that the government will be known as a ‘rollback government in the history of the pandemic in Karnataka, another senior member of the TAC said soon the State will be forced to impose a lockdown. “But by then many lives would have been lost and things would have gone out of control,” the member said.       Grim situation    V. Ravi, TAC member and nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-COV-2 in Karnataka, said the situation is very grim. “Unless the public cooperates, we will soon reach figures identical to Maharashtra and that can happen in the next three weeks. Preventing the spread is everybody’s responsibility,” he said. Giridhar R. Babu, another TAC member, tweeted, “While the lockdown in 2020 was mostly avoidable, the one in 2021 is mostly preventable.” “At this rate Bengaluru will have 6,500 daily cases by April 20. Even if 10% of them require hospitalization, the health system will run out of capacity in a few days. We need action now, not tomorrow. Stay home people, wear masks if going out and get vaccinated when eligible,” he said in another tweet. “Most of the congregations are preventable. The situation is fast evolving. What could have been done locally, is fast evolving necessitating national-level mitigation measures,” he added in another tweet.

06 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||SC-appointed panel submits report against Kodihalli for misinformation||The Supreme Court-appointed committee, which is looking into lawful constructions made on land notified for formation of Shivaram Karanth Layout, has submitted a report against Kodihalli Chandrashekar of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) for allegedly spreading misinformation about the formation of the layout and “virtually trying to negate the order of the Supreme Court.” In March, the committee, headed by Justice A.V. Chandrashekar (retd), had a served notice to the farmers’ leader for spreading misinformation and dissuading people from submitting documents of buildings built on the notified land. The notice was issued based on video footages and social media messages where he allegedly asked people not to share the details with the committee. “After we served a notice to him (Mr. Kodihalli) on March 24, he held a protest at Mourya Circle against the formation of the layout. On the day of the protest, Mr. Kodihalli claimed that the Chief Minister, responding to his requisitions, assured him that an appeal would be made before the Supreme Court through the Advocate-General to drop the formation of the layout and this was reported by several media. However, BDA chairperson and MLA of Yelahanka constituency, S.R. Vishwanath, who was present when Mr. Kodihalli met the Chief Minister, refuted the claims made by him and said the Chief Minister did not make any such promises,” he said. Mr. Chandrashekar further added that after the protest, some people displayed flexes in the villages notified for the layout ‘thanking’ the Chief Minister for dropping the plan for formation of the layout. “The act of Mr. Kodihalli has led to confusion among people who were willing to submit documents before the committee. We are not getting documents from the general public as we had expected. He did not reply to notices served by the committee. We have submitted a report against him to the Supreme Court.” However, Mr. Chandrashekar did not divulge the content of the report submitted to the court. The committee maintained that as per the Supreme Court, formation of the layout will happen and the BDA is on the job of acquiring land. “Both the State government and the BDA had filed affidavit before the court that all necessary steps will be taken for formation of the layout. We appeal to the public to not believe in misinformation and come forward to submit the records to the committee,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sc-appointed-panel-submits-report-against-kodihalli-for-misinformation/article34249361.ece
06 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Decision on students’ assessment soon’||Most stakeholders at the meeting convened by Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar on Monday demanded that there was need for some form of assessment to gauge the learning outcome for 2020-2021 academic year for classes one to nine. The meeting saw school managements, educational experts, and parents’ associations discuss how assessment should be carried out as schools had to be closed due to the second wave of COVID-19 infections. Speaking after the meeting, Mr. Kumar said the department would take a decision on how the students should be assessed for this academic year in the next two days. B.N. Yogananda, member, Karnataka Private Schools Parents’ Associations Coordination Committee, said there is a need for assessment that can be done using a simple methodology. “Many private school students have not been able to access online classes and the learning curve has not been up to the mark. An assessment will show us where students stand, expose the manner in which they are lagging, and remedial measures that can be taken,” he said. School managements also batted for assessment as they said that parents were not willing to pay the fees unless an examination is conducted. “Parents are keen that we conduct the assessment as they want to know if their children have picked up lessons this year. Unless we conduct an examination, a large number of parents will not come forward to pay fees,” said D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka. He said private school managements wanted to conduct online assessment for classes one to five and offline assessment for classes six to nine. While some school managements had already completed assessment, some, he said, were midway, while many had not conducted any. “We want to conduct assessment in two shifts and will follow all COVID-19 SOPs during the examination,” he said. Department officials said they were not keen on conducting assessment for classes one to five as government students had classes under Vidyagama only between July and October 2020. “We had even decided to not conduct any form of assessment for classes one to five. But after Monday’s meeting, we may have to reconsider our decision,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/assess-how-well-students-have-learnt-demand-stakeholders/article34249358.ece

06 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Panel to be set up to decide on Karaga celebration||The historical Bengaluru Karaga is synonymous with the city’s culture, with a history of over 300 years. With several COVID-19 restrictions in place, a decision on how the Karaga is to be celebrated this year will be taken based on the report to be submitted by the festival committee. The festivities are likely to begin on April 19 and end with a grand procession through the city’s thoroughfares on April 27. However, it is unclear if it would be celebrated with the usual pomp and splendour. On Monday, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s Commissioner Gaurav Gupta, Deputy Commissioner (Bengaluru Urban) J. Manjunath, MLA Uday Garudachar, MLC P.R. Ramesh and others met to discuss the modalities for the festival. Mr. Gupta told reporters later that in the absence of a committee in the Sri Dharmarayaswamy Temple, a B category temple under the Muzrai Department, the Deputy Commissioner (Bengaluru Urban) had been directed to constitute a festival committee. “The panel, which will include prominent leaders belonging to the Tigala community, will look into whether the celebrations should be restricted to the ceremonial puja within the temple or if a procession could be taken out,” he said and added that the committee is expected to submit its report in seven to 10 days’ time. Last year, the celebrations were restricted to pujas within the temple, since it was held during the 21-day national lockdown. It was said to be the first time in Karaga’s history that the grand procession had to be cancelled. Mr. Gupta said the government’s restrictions on protests, large gatherings etc. would be in force till April 20. “However, the government may take a call on imposing further restrictions if the COVID-19 positive cases increase, in the interest of public health,” he added. Mr. Manjunath said the term of the festival committee will end with the Karaga.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/panel-to-be-set-up-to-decide-on-karaga-celebration/article34249362.ece
06 April 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||BJP, RSS ideology is poisonous, says Kharge||Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday termed the ideology of the RSS and the BJP “poisonous” and remarked that people would die soon if they consumed it. Speaking after participating in a function held to mark the birth anniversary of Dalit leader Jagjivan Ram at the Congress office here, he said, “The RSS and BJP are like poison. If you taste them, you will die.” He appealed to people not to support the BJP in the coming byelections in Karnataka and in the Assembly elections in other States. The Congress leader said the saffron party was neither respecting the Constitution nor the idea of democracy by following divisive politics to secure in various States. On Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh, Mr. Kharge said Mr. Modi went to Bangladesh and “told lies about his participation in the freedom struggle” of that country. “He should have also said that he participated in the freedom struggle of India,” Mr. Kharge scoffed. In Bangladesh, Mr. Modi had said, “I must have been20 or 22 years old when my colleagues and I took part in a satyagraha for the freedom of the people of Bangladesh. I tell this to the people of Bangladesh with great pride.” Mr. Kharge alleged that the Prime Minister and the BJP had sidelined leaders such as L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi citing their age of over 75, but had now fielded E. Sreedharan, who is over 85, in the Assembly elections in Kerala. “Why does the BJP follow different policies for different persons?” he asked. Senior leaders took part in the function and paid floral tribute to the Dalit leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-rss-ideology-is-poisonous-says-kharge/article34249386.ece
06 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP plans smaller care centres at Assembly constituency level||With the city’s caseload crossing 3,700 a day, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike is contemplating on setting up smaller COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs) at the Assembly constituency level. Nearly 80% of those who test positive for COVID-19 are opting for home isolation. However, not all have the wherewithal or necessary facilities. The BBMP has already operationalised two CCCs, one at Haj Bhavan and another at HAL. The third facility at Koramangala Indoor Stadium will also be operationalised soon. BBMP’s Commissioner Gaurav Gupta told The Hindu that the smaller CCCs could be opened in hotels and vacant homes. The zonal commissioners have been directed to identify suitable locations where these CCCs can be opened, he said. The CCCs will be opened first in areas that have reported more cases. P. Rajendra Cholan, BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Health), pointed out that with many people opting for home isolation, the infection was also spreading to family members. The BBMP has also found that citizens refuse to go to CCCs in another part of the city. “If there is a CCC in the same Assembly constituency, for instance, it may be easier for us to convince citizens to go there,” he said and added that many private medical establishments had come forward to help set up these facilities. They said the home isolation and quarantine watch teams that already existed were being strengthened in the light of violations by those who had tested positive. “Despite our efforts, there is at least 20% deviation reported from those who have tested positive for COVID-19. These are turning out to be super spreaders,” he admitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-plans-smaller-care-centres-at-assembly-constituency-level/article34249364.ece

It had asked the building owners to submit their documents at help centres or online mode. From March 1 onwards, the committee started accepting documents from the public, but only 1,850 submitted their documents out of which 350 uploaded documents online. The committee has now set April 30, 2021, as the deadline to submit the records. The chief of the committee said that the panel will involve village accountants, revenue inspectors and other Revenue Department officials to educate people on submitting records. Replying to a question on what will happen to people who have bought lands or houses in BDA-approved layouts or DC-converted layouts in the notified area, Mr. Chandrashekar said “the Supreme Court had recently asked the BDA to submit a detailed report on how compensation was paid to those who bought sites in the revenue layout while forming layouts at Anjanapura, Banashankari and others. This is an indication that the court will protect the interest of people who have legally bought properties and build houses prior to issuing the final notification.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/only-1850-applications-received/article34249372.ece

Sudhakar.   “We were having 12 lakh doses and following out request the Union Health Ministry has allotted an additional 15 lakh doses for Karnataka. Of this, 10 lakh doses have been sent to Bengaluru and 5 lakh to Belagavi,” he said. Stating that cases can be reduced if people behave responsibly, the Minister said: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has interacted with eight States and has advised them to take stringent measures. Maharashtra has imposed tougher measures, let us not push ourselves into such a situation where tough measures become inevitable. We should not underestimate the scale and speed in which infection is spreading. We need to consider the pandemic seriously till May end.” With the Centre freezing fresh registrations for vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers, several in this category are now turning up for getting immunised at the centres. However, they are being sent back as they can no longer be registered now. M.K. Sudharshan, who heads the State’s Technical Advisory Committee, said as a goodwill gesture healthcare and frontline workers should be given one last chance to get vaccinated. “There should be a forgive and forget approach. It is true that many did not register when the window was open. But the government must be magnanimous and considerate in this regard,” he said adding that vaccination should be opened up for all above 18 years soon. The State has vaccinated 45,95,086 people so far. This includes 5,69,507 healthcare workers and 2,46,972 frontline workers who have taken the first dose of vaccination. 3,48,999 healthcare and 92,613 frontline workers have taken the second dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/steep-rise-in-numbers-5279-cases-32-deaths-reported/article34249368.ece

The tutorials business is reportedly booming during the pandemic as schools are closed. The Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS) lodged a complaint with the department. Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said they would enquire into the matter. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of KAMS, said there are hundreds of tutorials conducting classes from as early as 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. “Many parents have not enrolled their children in schools the current academic year, but have paid fees to tutorials. We have pictures to show that these classes take place without social distancing and COVID-19 appropriate behaviour,” he said. Many parents said they were forced to send their children for tuitions as their school was conducting online examination during April. Children had not grasped online lessons conducted by the school, they said. Arjun S., parent of a class five student, said: “The school conducts only online classes. My son is unable to cope with online classes and my wife and I work from home and are unable to help him with online classes. So, we decided to send him for tuitions so that his learning does not dip,” he said. A senior official in the Department of Public Instruction said jurisdictional Block Educational Officers would be asked to submit a report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dept-to-look-into-complaints-of-booming-tutorial-business/article34249359.ece

06 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Ramesh Jarkiholi tests positive for COVID-19||Even as campaigning picked up for the Belagavi Lok Sabha byelection, the district witnessed interesting developments on Monday with Congress leader Lakhan Jarkiholi hinting at joining the BJP, while his elder brother and former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, who was to appear before the Special Investigation Team for inquiry pertaining to the CD scandal, was declared COVID-19 positive by the taluk health officer. The day began with Urban Development Minister Byarati Basavaraj announcing that Mr. Ramesh would not be able to participate in the election campaigning for now as he had contracted COVID-19. However giving a twist to the issue, his Cabinet colleague and poll campaign in-charge Jagadish Shettar told presspersons a little later that he was not aware of the issue. A while later, official confirmation about Mr. Ramesh being COVID-19 positive came from the chief health officer of the Taluk Government Hospital at Gokak, the Minister’s home turf. Chief health officer Ravindra Antin told presspersons that Mr. Ramesh, after his return from Maharashtra, had come for treatment for cough and fever and had tested positive. However, as there was nothing serious, he was advised home isolation, he said. “But on Sunday night, he came to us with complaints of breathlessness. We immediately shifted him to the ICU of the hospital and attended to him. His condition is stable now. He may require some more days to recover,” Dr. Antin said. However, the hospital premises witnessed some dramatic scenes with an advocate, Chandan Giddanavar, raising doubt about Mr. Ramesh being treated at the taluk hospital. Mr. Giddanavar, who visited the spot, alleged that the former Minister was not in the hospital, which sparked off strong reactions from supporters of Mr. Jarkiholi, which eventually forced him to leave the spot. Following the allegation, a video clip of Mr. Ramesh inside the ICU was circulated by officials to clarify the matter. According to sources, Mr. Ramesh’s car driver and cook too have tested positive. Lakhan’s move Meanwhile, in a setback to the Congress, Mr. Lakhan hinted at joining the BJP. The development happened after Ministers Jagadish Shettar, Umesh Katti, Shashikala Jolle, Rajya Sabha member Eranna Kadadi, and BJP candidate Mangala Angadi visited Mr. Lakhan’s house and invited him to join the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ramesh-jarkiholi-tests-positive-for-covid-19/article34249388.ece

06 April 2021||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Yatnal fires yet another salvo at Yediyurappa||Unleashing a fresh attack on Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, senior BJP leader and Vijayapura City MLA, said that the dissent in the party will shortly explode and Mr. Yediyurappa would go home. Speaking to presspersons on the sidelines of a programme organised at Veerashaiva Kalyana Mantapa in Kalaburagi on Monday, which was organised for facilitating the leaders of Panchamashali agitation, Mr. Yatnal predicted the imminent fall of Yediyurappa government in the State. “It is not the BJP government, but the Yediyurappa family that is ruling the State. Mr. Yediyurappa is too old to handle all the affairs. He is a rubber stamp. B.Y. Raghavendra [Mr. Yediyurappa’s son] is handling [government] affairs in Shivamogga and Mariswamy (the CM’s relative) is taking care of Bengaluru. B.Y. Vijayendra [Mr. Yediyurappa’s other son], is looking after the entire affairs of the government in the State interfering in the administration of all the departments. He is the kingpin in the lobby of transfers of government officers across the State. He is the one who is handling all the dealings [of Mr. Yediyurappa]. There is no freedom for the Ministers... When we built the party, Mr. Vijayendra was still at school. If he is everything, why would we need a Chief Minister? The Chief Minister should tender his resignation,” he said. Referring to the dissent letter by Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa to the party high command criticising the Chief Minister’s interference in his departmental affairs, Mr. Yatnal said that there were many more leaders waiting to rebel against Mr. Yediyurappa. “Not just Mr. Eshwarappa, there are many more leaders who would rebel against Mr. Yediyurappa. Some legislators are giving statements justifying Mr. Yediyurappa just to appease him. If the party high command decides to remove Mr. Yediyurappa from Chief Minister’s post, there would be none to support him. The dissent is likely to explode shortly and Mr. Yediyurappa would go home [quitting his Chief Minster’s post]. BJP could not win more than 104 assembly seats in the State under Mr. Yediyurappa. If he is removed, the party would get 150 seats and a leader from North Karnataka would become the Chief Minister. After May 2 [the day of declaration of byelection results], everything would be changed. It is better that Mr. Yediyurappa should respectfully resign [before that],” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yatnal-fires-yet-another-salvo-at-yediyurappa/article34249393.ece

06 April 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘Congress used Dalits as vote bank and forgot their development’||Unleashing a verbal attack on the Congress, BJP Scheduled Castes Morcha State president and party spokesperson Chalavadi Narayanaswamy has said that the grand old party had used Dalits only as its vote bank and cheated the community by doing nothing for its development in the last 70 years. He also held that the Congress’ anti-Dalit mindset forced the Dalit communities to desert the party and join the BJP that led to its [Congress] downfall in the last few years. “Dalits, including me, were under the impression that the Congress would work for their welfare and supported it in its electoral politics all these years. But, it used the Dalits as a vote-bank and forgot them after assuming power. Most of the Dalits who have realised its anti-Dalit approach have deserted the party and joined the BJP. The erosion of its Dalit support base is the major reason for the decline of the Congress and the rise of the BJP in the country,” he said. He was, along with BJP Scheduled Castes Morcha State vice-president Ambaraya Ashtagi and other Dalit leaders, addressing a media conference at Aiwan-e-Shahi Guest House in Kalaburagi on Sunday. Referring to the socio-economic and educational survey, which was also known as the caste census, conducted during the tenure of Siddaramaiah as Chief Minister, Mr. Narayanswamy said that the Dalits were the largest community in the State as per the leaked findings of the survey and the Congress had always neglected its welfare and never thought of choosing a Dalit leader for the post of Chief Minister. “Veteran Congress leaders M. Mallikarjun Kharge and G. Parameshwar were never considered for the post of Chief Minister just because they hailed from Dalit community. The leaders from the dominant castes ensured the defeat of Dr. Parameshwar to remove him from the race for the top post in the State. Mr. Kharge was cleverly sidelined when the question of Dalit Chief Minister rose in the party. I too was targeted in the party just because I demanded a Dalit Chief Minister. Frustrated by Congress anti-Dalit mindset, I quit the party after working for it for nearly 40 years and joined the BJP,” he said. Asked about the impressions that the BJP would change the Constitution and end the caste-based reservations introduced for the development of oppressed and marginalised communities, Mr. Narayanaswamy termed it as a false propaganda that was spread by the Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-used-dalits-as-vote-bank-and-forgot-their-development/article34249594.ece

06 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||KCCI seeks development of waterways in and around city||The Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) has urged the government to develop a full-fledged waterway between Bantwal and Malavoor through the Netravathi and the Gurupura (Phalguni) for the overall development of Mangaluru. In a letter to the Ports and Inland Water Transport Department, chamber president Isaac Vas said that the number of Dhows (small vessels) and yachts visiting the Mangaluru Old Port has considerably reduced. This was because no feeder cargo was generated from the industrial hinterland due to the lack of efficient waterways both on the Netravathi and the Phalguni. Waterways should be developed and connected to different ports, including Goa, Lakshadweep, Mumbai, Kochi and Karwar to improve economic activities. Mr. Vas said that a waterway has to start from Thumbe in the Netravathi, come down to Old Port and go up to Malavoor vented dam connecting the international airport here. Thus, it will form a critical link and be a catalyst for economic development along the riverbanks. Besides coastal trade with Lakshadweep Islands and fishing, the Netravathi has a huge potential for various economic activities, including tourism, agri-products and fish industries, along with the hospitality industry, he said. The Ports Department may lease out one acre each of land to entrepreneurs for boat and yacht building activities thereby helping Mangaluru to reclaim its old glory in boat building. There also exist many opportunities in ship repair activities. If good draft of about 4.5 m below chart datum was provided in river channels, vessels up to 100 m length could easily be taken alongside for repairs, Mr. Vas said. He suggested a direct dredged access to the sea where presently Bharati Defence and Infrastructure Ltd. (BDIL) was located by providing a floating bridge across the sand bar for regular vehicular movement. Sea access has to be made into a dry dock on BDIL side, resulting in connected economic benefits of ship repair and service industry. The area between Kulur bridge and Malavoor dam on the Phalguni is suitable for fish farming that provides considerable employment. Fish meal and fish oil industries too could be located to localise the industry. Non-edible catch could be transported by water instead by road to these industries. Mr. Vas said that the seven floating restaurants were unable to operate further into the two rivers for lack of waterways. The proposed waterway should promote tourism, generating employment. If riverbanks were developed to load and unload different goods, transportation will become easy. Development of water sports and river front improvement could also be achieved through developing the waterway, Mr. Vas said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kcci-seeks-development-of-waterways-in-and-around-city/article34249773.ece

Jayashankar, a Professor of Microbiology, from his office as the Director of the College Development Council (CDC) of the university. He was replaced by V. Ravindrachary, a Professor of Physics, who has, earlier, served as the Registrar (Evaluation) of the university. Prof. Jayashankar landed in controversy after he complained to the police that a conman, Prasad Attavar, cheated him of Rs. 17 lakh which he had paid to Attavar for getting the post of the Vice-Chancellor of Raichur University. In addition, he had given Attavar three blank cheques as he had promised him of getting the post. The city police, who registered a case in this connection, arrested Attavar last week. Following this, two Syndicate members, K. Ramesh and Vivekananda Paniyala, wrote to the university to take serious cognisance of the case and seek an explanation from Prof. Jayashankar before initiating appropriate disciplinary proceedings. Mr. Paniyala sought a special meeting of the Syndicate to discuss the matter and also urged the university to form a committee headed by a retired judge of the High Court to conduct an inquiry into the controversy. They said that paying money to get a university post is illegal and such acts would demean the institution, the Syndicate as well as the government. This conduct is unbecoming of a professor of a university, they said. Vice-Chancellor of the university P.S. Yadapadithaya said that a special meeting of the Syndicate will be convened on April 9 to discuss the matter. The university has issued a notice to Prof. Jayashankar. His reply would be placed before the Syndicate to take an appropriate decision.

Jagadeesha. Addressing presspersons in Udupi on Monday, he said that the session sites will keep moving to different health sub-centres. Hence, people should cross check with the health sub-centres nearest to their place whether vaccination is administered on a particular day or not. The Deputy Commissioner said that if the vaccination site, mainly in primary health centres, is far off, people tend to be lazy to turn up for vaccination. If vaccination is administered in places close to them, they will turn up in large numbers. Hence, the session sites will be made available in health sub-centres. In addition to the session sites at health sub centres, vaccination is being administered in all 61 primary health centres in rural areas in the district, he said. District Vaccination Officer M.G. Ram said that the district has 185 health sub- centres with proper infrastructure. More and more health sub centres will be covered with session sites depending on the supply of vaccine vials to the district. Initially, session sites will cover 40 sub centres. He said that 2,200 vials of Covishield and 200 vials of Covaxin were available the district as on April 5. People can walk in directly to the session sites with their Aadhaar cards to get vaccinated, he added.

06 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Somashekar defends CM’s work pattern||Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar on Monday defended Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s decision to release funds for various works through the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) by contending that the Chief Minister enjoyed absolute power to interfere in the affairs of any department when the Minister concerned does not respond to the pleas made by the MLAs or the general public. Fielding reporters queries on RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa’s letter to Governor Vajubhai Vala against Mr. Yediyurappa for alleged interference in his department, Mr. Somashekar said the Ministers concerned of the departments are expected to respond to the representations made by the MLAs or the public. If the Ministers do not respond properly, it is but natural for the complaints to reach the Chief Minister, he said. “Then Chief Minister will directly interfere in the matter. There is nothing wrong in that”, Mr. Somashekar said. The same holds good for all departments of the State government. He said the purpose of appointing Ministers is to ensure that the works pertaining to the respective departments are carried out. Mr. Somashekar said the MLAs had complained to Chief Minister that the funds were not being released by the RDPR Department even after they had been released by the Chief Minister. “So, the Chief Minister has intervened. There is nothing wrong in it.” ‘No interference’ Mr. Somashekar denied the allegations that the Chief Minister’s family members were interfering in the administration of the State. Speaking to reporters after garlanding the statue of late Deputy Prime Minister Babu Jagjivan Ram on the occasion of his birth anniversary, he said the Opposition Congress leaders were unnecessarily dragging the name of Chief Minister’s son B.Y. Vijayendra and accusing the latter of interfering in the administration. “These charges are far from the truth.” The government has Ministers, MLAs and the district administration to discharge the duties. Mr Vijayendra is only the vice-president of the party and his role is restricted to the affairs of the party, M.r Somashekar said. He said the Congress leaders of Mysuru are worried about their relevance in politics if Mr. Vijayendra contests elections from Mysuru if the party permits him. Hence, they are unnecessarily dragging his name. When his attention was drawn to the reported interference by Mr. Vijayendra in the administration of Mysuru, he shot back and asked whether he was a “rubber stamp”. He said he has been given a free hand to carry out the administration in Mysuru district as the Minister in charge of the district.The Chief Minister is capable of running the administration of the State as he has occupied the post on four occasions, besides having an experience of more than four decades in politics. Without naming former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Mr .Somashekar said he knew the role played by the children of former Chief Ministers and would make it public at an appropriate time. ‘Waste of time’ He accused the Congress of wasting the valuable time of the State Legislature by restricting the discussion only to the CD involving former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi instead of taking up issues that concerned the general public. He also recalled the alleged involvement of former Congress Minister H.Y. Meti in another such scandal during the tenure of the Congress. With regard to questions raised on the fairness of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the government to probe the issue, Mr. Somashekar said the SIT comprises eminent and capable officials, who will not succumb to interference by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/somashekar-defends-cms-work-pattern/article34249805.ece

06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||One lakh COVID-19 vaccine doses to arrive soon||Even as vaccination against the pandemic has picked up pace in Mysuru over the last few days following spike in infections, Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar on Monday said Mysuru will soon be getting one lakh doses of vaccine to meet the immunisation target. He also clarified that no tourist sites in Mysuru district would be closed but the visitors have to take appropriate precautions without any indifference to the SOPs. Speaking to reporters after reviewing the COVID-19 situation at a meeting here attended by senior officials, the Minister said Mysuru was in need of about five lakh vaccine doses as per the estimates prepared by the officials. “The State has received 15 lakh doses and I have sought nearly two lakh for Mysuru from Minister for Health and Family Welfare K. Sudhakar in view of COVID-19 spike.” Mr. Somashekar said Mr. Sudhakar has promised him to make the vaccine doses available to Mysuru as per the demand. The COVID-19 testing has been stepped up in market areas and public areas and the extent of administering vaccine to the eligible and targeted population is also on the rise. When asked about any plans of imposing restrictions on tourist entry, he said no decision had been taken and all tourist sites would continue to remain open. Festivals However, a decision had been taken to permit village festivals and jatras by enforcing certain conditions. The permission to such events would be given only if organisers agree to strictly follow the rules. The Minister told the officials to take all necessary measures to control the COVID-19 spread here and said there is no dearth of any facility for combating the pandemic. Meanwhile, the number of persons thronging the vaccination sites for taking the jab has gone up. Sources in the Health Department said the spike in infections was driving more number of eligible persons coming forward to take the shot. “From an average of 100 a day at each vaccination site, it has gone up by nearly 200-250 a day. The number of persons aged between 45 and 59 taking the jab has also seen a marked increase over the last few days.” 260 sites The district administration has set a target of vaccinating all those aged 45 years and above in the next 45 days and therefore about 260 vaccination sites had been opened across the district. These sites would function even on public holidays and the healthcare staff had been asked not to take leave this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/one-lakh-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-arrive-soon/article34249808.ece
06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Now, swimming enthusiasts demand reopening of pools||After stakeholders in the film industry and gyms protested against the closure of cinemas and fitness centres due to COVID-19, it is the turn of swimming enthusiasts including competitive swimmers and their coaches to knock on the doors of the State government seeking reopening of the swimming pools. Though most swimming pools across the State had remained closed since March 2020, the government had relaxed the order in October 2020 to permit only the competitive swimmers to practice swimming. Pools in hotels and clubs have remained closed for more than a year now. The government’s recent order on closure of swimming pools will not only keep the pools out of bounds for competitive swimmers, but also pours cold water on the hopes of recreational swimmers looking forward to beat the heat in the ensuing summer with a splash in the waters. Founder Secretary of Association of Integrated Mysore Swimmers (AIMS) Sundaresh S., who is also the Executive Secretary of Karnataka Swimming Association, said the government decision will deny an estimated 250 to 350 competitive swimmers in Mysuru of an opportunity to prepare for competitions. The competitive swimmers in Mysuru practice at the University of Mysore Swimming Pool in Saraswathipuram, besides the pools in Chamundi Vihar Stadium and in J.P. Nagar. Most of the swimmers will be left high and dry by the closure of swimming pools. “It will be a big blow to promising swimmers”, Mr. Sundaresh regretted. He expressed disappointment with the government for closing swimming pools even after premier and globally recognized health bodies including the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S., has made it clear that there is no evidence of COVID-19 spreading through water in the pools. Though more than 350 swimmers participated in the recently held invitational swimming competition in Bengaluru, not a single one tested positive for COVID-19, Mr. Sundaresh pointed out. Far from closing pools, the government should encourage swimming for people to fight COVID-19, which primarily affects the lungs. For, swimming is one activity that strengthens the lungs and heart of an individual, he said. Also, the managements of swimming pools were passing through a very tough economic phase in view of the closure of the pools for recreational purposes. The private managements depend on recreational swimming to run the show. “Even if the pools are closed, the managements have to pay the minimum bill for electricity and water, besides salaries of the life guards and others to retain them”, Mr. Sundaresh said, urging the government to reopen the pools with Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that make social distancing mandatory in the pools. The government’s decision to close the swimming pools incidentally comes close on the heels of its decision to permit swimmers above 12 years of age and below 60 years even if they do not fall into the category of competitive swimmers. Several people who engage themselves in lap swimming for health and fitness were looking forward to returning to the pools, but are disappointed now, he said. The representatives of Karnataka Swimming Association in Bengaluru would be meeting Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Health Minister Mr. Sudhakar seeking relief, Mr. Sundaresh said and hoped the gGovernment will consider their plea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/now-swimming-enthusiasts-demand-reopening-of-pools/article34249804.ece

Eshwarappa, on Monday, said former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has “gone mad” after losing the Chief Minister’s post. He was reacting to Mr. Siddaramiah’s statement seeking Governor’s rule in the State over his (Mr. Eshwarappa’s) letter against Chief Minister Yediyurappa. “Siddaramaiah has gone mad after losing power. He does not know what he is talking about. He has not been able to see the development works happening in the State”, he said in Shivamogga. Mr. Eshwarappa said he would soon give a list of development works undertaken by his department in detail. There was no truth in Mr. Siddaramaiah’s statement that the officers were not listening to him. Further, he said Mr. Siddaramaiah had lost value in his own party. “His own party workers did not listen to him during the elections to Mayor’s post in Mysuru. He stayed in a resort for four days.

06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||When the economic mainstay took a beating||The city, whose economic mainstay is tourism, received only 19.5 per cent of the tourist flow in pandemic-affected 2020-21 compared to the previous year. As against 36.28 lakh tourists who visited Mysuru during 2019-20, only 7.08 lakh came between April 2020 and March 31, 2021. The country went into a lockdown from March 25, 2020 and the restrictions were lifted in a graded manner. There were no tourists to the city and palace during April and May last year. Only 2,012 visited the palace in June and this number increased to 10,537 in August, about 45,800 in October and hit a peak of 1.83 lakh in January. In all, 708,753 visited the city during the financial year 2020-21. The statistics are from the daily ticket sales at the Mysuru palace and is presumed to be a yardstick of the tourist flow to the city as no traveller coming to Mysuru for the first time gives the palace a miss. But even these figures are a partial reflection of the picture and do not depict the entire story. For, a majority of the visitors to the palace were locals or those drawn from areas near Mysuru. These trips were mostly undertaken to cater to their pent up demand for immediate travel to beat the frustration arising out of prolonged lockdown and restrictions on travel due to COVID-19. Being locals, it is assumed that a majority of them will not have patronised the local restaurants or stayed in hotels and hence did little to change the fortunes of the stakeholders. Mysuru generally receives around 3.5 to 3.7 million tourists every year and this generates direct and indirect employment to benefit about 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh people. This includes about 180 hotels apart from resorts which provide direct employment to thousands of people ranging from housekeeping to cooks and waiters. This apart, the sector has spawned a mini industry of tour operators and taxi service providers. The other beneficiaries include various vendors and artisans producing handcrafted works to produce souvenirs for tourists. But all of them were left in the lurch as tourism went into tailspin due to the pandemic. Hundreds of guides – both registered and unlicensed – who would usher the tourists and provide information – quit the only job they had pursued for decades with many ending up as street vendors or daily wagers in the construction sector.  With the current second wave and the daily increase in the number of COVID-19 cases being reported all over the country, there are concerns that tourism sector may get derailed again.

She also alleged that police officials were leaking information to the media about the probe contrary to the directions of the apex court on investigation of criminal cases. In another petition, S. Umesh sought a direction for a court-monitored probe by the CBI or setting up of a Central Special Investigation Team to conduct probe monitored by the court to avoid any allegation of bias that could crop up owing to the involvement of the State’s political leaders in the case. He also sought a direction to the authorities to ensure that the media and the investigation agencies followed the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on March 5, 2021 based on the directions of the Bombay High Court. While alleging that certain programmes telecast by TV channels on the CD scandal amounted to a “media trial” and “interference in investigation” in clear violation of apex court’s guidelines, Mr. Umesh also said that round-the-clock programmes on the CD scandal on TV channels “ has affected the mental health of the young children who watch local TV programmes”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cd-scandal-hc-directs-sit-to-submit-status-report/article34249376.ece

Ariff, MP, made a controversial remark aimed at United Democratic Front (UDF) Kayamkulam Assembly constituency candidate Aritha Babu on Sunday. Speaking at a women’s meeting organised as part of the election campaigning of sitting MLA and Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate U. Prathibha of the CPI(M) in Kayamkulam, Mr. Ariff said this was not an election to a milk society but to the Kerala Assembly. He was referring to the UDF often highlighting the humble background of its candidate during the election campaign to woo voters. At 26, Ms. Babu is one of the the youngest Congress candidates in the State. Her candidature has made headlines as she looks after her family by rearing cows and selling milk. Ms. Babu said that the remarks had pained her. It was an insult to the entire working class. UDF leaders have sought an apology from Mr. Ariff. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala demanded an apology from the MP. He said the comment was an insult to Ms. Babu. People of Kayamkulam would give a fitting reply to it. Ariff’s response Meanwhile, Mr. Ariff in a statement said his words were deliberately misconstrued by accentuating a fraction of the speech. Mr. Ariff clarified that he made the remark while mentioning that the UDF and some media were highlighting the poor economic background of the candidate to woo voters in Kayamkulam. “I made the comment while asking whether financial constraints and personal struggles were criteria for candidature in Assembly polls, and whether the Congress would seek votes for LDF candidates in Haripad and Cherthala, who struggled a lot in their lives. I have not insulted any vocation or candidate.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/row-over-mps-remarks-on-candidate/article34249748.ece

06 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||COVID spike may delay flight restoration||With a fresh bout of rise in COVID-19 cases in different parts of the country, the restoration of full air services is unlikely this month as expected earlier. The delay in restoration of full air services with the summer schedule will affect the profitability of airports across India. The Union Ministry of Civil Aviation has said that the rise in COVID-19 cases had once again influenced its decision to restore the air services to normal levels. It was expected that the Ministry would restore full domestic services by April. However, while the services have not been fully restored, it has been made clear that there would be no cut in the number of services being operated now in the domestic sector. The outbreak of the pandemic had resulted in air services being virtually suspended in March last year except for the repatriation flights to evacuate Indians stranded in different parts of the globe because of the pandemic. Cochin International Airport sources said that the operation of flights has been tentative with the authorities allowing only a 15-day window of time for extension of the services because of the seriousness of the COVID-19 situation. The restrictions on services is expected to continue till the end of April now, sources said. Revenue loss The international airport here expected normal domestic traffic by the end of January. The pre-COVID-19 days had seen domestic passenger movement of 15,000 per day. About 60% of the level had been achieved and passenger traffic was expected to move up further. The rating agency ICRA had estimated that airport operations could lose up to Rs. 5,400 crore during the financial year 2020-21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/restoration-of-full-air-services-to-be-delayed/article34249754.ece
06 April 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Case filed over posters in Thripunithura||A case under Section 153 of the Indian Penal Code was registered by the Thripunithura police against unidentified people after posters appeared in many parts of the Thripunithura Assembly constituency asking people to “desist from voting for the BJP as it would lead to the victory of the CPI(M).” The posters were found pasted near those of National Democratic Alliance candidate K.S. Radhakrishnan and Left Democratic Front candidate M. Swaraj. Section 153 pertains to wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot. The posters issued in the name of ‘Sabarimala Karma Samithi’ were reportedly pasted on the walls on Sunday night. Following this, the BJP decided to register a complaint with the police. A BJP spokesperson said party activists were enraged and might be forced to respond with fitting posters. CPI(M) response Meanwhile, CPI(M) Thripunithura area secretary P. Vasudevan said his party had secured CCTV visuals of activists owing allegiance to the Congress pasting these posters in Thripunithura town. “It could be due to fear of losing in the poll. The development must be read with Congress leaders saying that they would get a share of votes from BJP supporters. The posters have been stuck including on the compound wall of temples,” he said. The Congress candidate from the constituency K. Babu said the matter had not come to his notice.  Public urged not to vote for BJP as the move would help CPI(M) win||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/case-filed-over-posters-in-thripunithura/article34249739.ece
06 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Cleaning of Kochi canals to pick up pace after election||Canal cleaning in the city to avoid waterlogging during the monsoon will pick up pace after the polls, according to Kochi Corporation authorities. After having been hauled up by the High Court for stalling pre-monsoon canal cleaning in the city citing the model code of conduct, the Corporation will soon begin cleaning the large canals. The tender process for drain cleaning in some divisions is complete and work has begun, while an agreement is yet to be inked with contractors for large canals such as the Thevara-Perandoor and Rameswaram-Kalvathy canals. “Paper work has been initiated for the larger canals such as the Thevara-Perandoor canal, and we are hoping to begin work by next week,” said Sunitha Dixon, chairperson of works standing committee. “There has been some delay since officials were on poll duty. But drain cleaning work in the divisions has already begun. A sum of Rs. 3 lakh has been allotted for smaller canals and Rs. 5 lakh for larger canals, while an additional Rs. 1 lakh is being made available under health circles based on the councillors’ suggestions for small drains,” she said. A round of cleaning of the Thevara-Perandoor canal had been done earlier under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), but the weeds that had covered the surface at present would have to be removed and a fresh file would have to be prepared for the same, said Mayor M. Anilkumar. The Rameswaram-Kalvathy canal, the poor condition of which had caused waterlogging in parts of West Kochi in the past, appeared to not be included under any current project, said the Mayor. Projects overlapping with those of other agencies were proposed and removed, to the effect that no project exists for the canal any more. It was included under a Cochin Smart Mission Limited project, but was later removed from it. The Corporation was attempting to get it included under a canal rejuvenation project that Kochi Metro Rail Limited was proposing, he added, but before a decision was made on that, cleaning of the canal would have to be initiated. Master plan The Corporation Council had decided in February that a master plan of the drainage network would be prepared to deal with waterlogging. “This will require time and government help, and has been put on hold till after the polls,” said the Mayor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cleaning-of-kochi-canals-to-pick-up-pace-after-election/article34249698.ece

When a petition for identifying and removing encroachers came up, the State government submitted that the demarcation process of the Edappally canal had been conducted and a survey sketch was handed over to the Kalamassery municipal authorities for action. With respect to the Kochappillythodu, it was submitted that the Kanayannur Tahsildar (LR) had constituted a team for the survey work of the canal. The government submitted that three of the eight surveyors deputed for the conduct of the survey of Kochappillythodu were inadvertently included in the list of officers deputed for election work. However, after noticing the mistake, the three officers were re-inducted into the survey team to speed up the process. It was also submitted that the survey would be completed within 15 days from Monday, and thereafter, necessary details would be furnished to the Kalamassery municipality and the Kochi Corporation for the removal of identified encroachments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-directs-corpn-municipality-to-take-action-against-encroachers/article34249699.ece

06 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||High Court directive on jacking up buildings||The Kerala High Court has directed the government to issue directives to local bodies on the procedure to deal with applications seeking permission to raise existing buildings by employing mechanical jacks. Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar issued the directive while disposing of a writ petition filed by a person challenging the raising of a villa apartment adjacent to his land. No provision The court observed that though lifting of the floor level of buildings was a work widely undertaken in the State, there was no provision dealing with the same in the Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 2019. Safety of neighbouring structures while undertaking the work of lifting the floor level of existing buildings could not be ignored. In the absence of any provision in the rules, the competent authority might not be able to take care of the safety issues. The government had the power to clarify doubts or to issue directives if any doubt arose regarding the interpretation of any provision in the Rules. The court, therefore, observed that it was for the State government to issue clarifications in this regard either under rule 109 of the Rules or by making appropriate amendment to the Rules. Mechanical jack It was all the more so since mechanical jack lifting technology was widely employed in the State to move buildings vertically and horizontally, the court added.  Safety of neighbouring structures while undertaking the work of lifting the floor level of existing buildings could not be ignored||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-court-directive-on-jacking-up-buildings/article34249703.ece

Air quality The forum called for encouraging electric vehicles to improve the air quality. Mobile units, in addition to the permanent facility in every district to monitor air quality, a law against burning of plastic, encouragement to non-polluting industries, facility for e-waste management and proper implementation of the organic farming policy have also been demanded by the forum members. The forum said that the State Climate Action Plan of 2013 was inadequate and that it needed to be revised after discussion with experts across the State. A separate project has been suggested for the coastal area of the State which often faces sea erosion. Carbon footprint Permission should be given to new projects, be it public sector or private sector, only after considering their carbon footprint.

06 April 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||10.54 lakh voters to choose their MLAs||With the authorities completing all arrangements, polling in 1,530 booths across the five Assembly segments in the district will begin at 7 a.m on Tuesday. The district has a total electorate of 10.54 lakh. Of this, 14,586 are first-time voters. As many as 2,332 are NRI voters and 3,938 service voters. A total of 7,420 officers have been deployed on election duty while 1,896 electronic voting machines and 20317 voter verified paper audit trail units too have been distributed. District Collector Narasimhugari T.L. Reddy supervised the proceedings. Officials said that two polling stations (111 and 112) set up at the Syrian Christian Seminary LP School in Thukalasssery had been shifted to the Syrian Christian Seminary High School. Silent campaign Meanwhile, the roads that had reverberated with poll rhetoric and slogans went silent on Monday as voters geared up to decide the fate of 39 candidates in the fray. The candidates, however, kept themselves busy on the day as they made some urgent visits and courtesy calls besides knocking on the doors of the voters, delivering leaflets and striking conversations with people they prioritised for micro-targeting. Of the five Assembly segments, Konni is witnessing an intense three-cornered fight while in the remaining seats, it is mostly a battle between the United Democratic Front and the Left Democratic Front. During the electioneering, the district’s poll scape witnessed an unprecedented war of words between the leading coalitions while Sabarimala retained its position as the overarching election issue. The floods of 2018 and the reconstruction of Pathanamthitta also topped the list of major election issues. Adding to the intensity of the fight, a battery of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, besides Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, visited the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/1054-lakh-voters-to-choose-their-mlas/article34249734.ece

Pronouncing the judgement, the judge found the accused, identified as Naren Deb Nath of Malda in West Bengal, guilty under IPC sections 376(3), 376(2) (n), 450. If the fine is not paid, the convict will have to serve an additional term of 15 months.

06 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Stern warning for fake voters||Attempts to cast multiple votes or impersonate another voter during the Assembly elections on Tuesday will attract stern action, election officials warned on Monday. Such offences are punishable with imprisonment up to one year or a fine, or both, under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, they said. To prevent bogus voting, the polling station-wise lists of Absent, Shifted, Dead/Duplicate (ASD) have been provided to presiding officers and candidates. As part of a standard operating procedure to prevent malpractices, presiding officers will snap photographs of all ASD voters identified in the polling booth on their mobile phones. Polling officials will also obtain a declaration from all ASD voters. Moreover, voters in the ASD category are required to provide their thumb impression, in addition to their signature. Voters will be allowed to exercise their franchise only after the indelible ink on their finger is fully dried. HC directive Disposing of a petition by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, the Kerala High Court had directed election officials to take necessary steps to prevent multiple voting by electors during the Assembly polls. On March 30, the Election Commission of India had informed the court that it had identified 38,586 DSEs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stern-warning-for-fake-voters/article34249745.ece
06 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Conclave brings forth eco concerns||Kerala needs elected representatives who are sensitive to ecological concerns, an online youth conclave for a green State has said. The conclave was organised by the city-based Sustera Foundation in association with various grassroot organisations on Saturday to engage the youth and create awareness of a green future for the State against the backdrop of the Assembly elections. Environmentalist-engineer Sridhar Radhakrishnan who spoke pointed out that despite the eco disaster that were the floods, all talk during election time was about development. The manifestos of all three fronts mentioned the environment vaguely, such as promising protection of the Western Ghats. But when it came to roads or railways or other infrastructure development, they talked about development that would not only be ecologically destructive but also economically debilitating, he said. He stressed the need to look at concerns about ecosystems and climate concerns and future sustainability and urged the youth to study and ask questions to ensure their future was safe. “Kerala has to rethink its development agenda,” he said. Renjan Mathew Varghese, State Director, WWF-India, said to sustain ourselves, other living forms, and the planet, it could not be business as usual. This was particularly true of Kerala, which was set to choose its leaders for the next five years. Close look Aspects such as change in land and sea use, species overexploitation, invasive species that destroy biodiversity, contribution to environmental pollution, and how our choices contribute to climate change needed to be looked at closely. The State’s elected leaders should understand and prioritise these five parameters for the sake of the people. He also underlined the need to give back to nature, be it by giving up single-use plastic, conserving energy and water, or checking food waste. New policies to protect ecologically sensitive areas, incorporation ecological boundaries during planning process, improving action through local bodies, increasing youth participation in grama sabhas, and environment education in schools and colleges, were some of the suggestions that arose. A beach clean-up and awareness campaign held on the Shanghumughom beach on Sunday yielded 40 sacks of plastic waste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/conclave-brings-forth-eco-concerns/article34249938.ece

06 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Thalassery may see strategic voting||Strategic voting seems to the buzzword in the Thalassery constituency in Kannur district. With no candidate of its own in the segment, the BJP appears divided on which other contestant is the next best political option. Initially, the BJP declared its support for C.O.T. Nazeer, a former CPI(M) member known for his bitter personal rivalry with the incumbent CPI(M) legislator A.N. Shamseer. The BJP had improved its vote share by 10% in Thalassery in the 2016 Assembly polls. It seemed poised to consolidate its base by fielding BJP district president N. Haridas in 2021. Nomination rejected However, the election officer put the BJP out of action by rejecting Mr. Haridas’s nomination. The Congress alleged a conspiracy to aid the CPI(M). Mr. Nazeer rejected the BJP’s overtures. He seemed apprehensive that an open alliance with the BJP would reduce his standing among Muslim voters. The BJP district committee responded to Mr. Nazeer’s stance by calling for a conscience vote. However, Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan rejected the district committee’s appeal. He said the BJP would tactically vote for Mr. Nazeer. Cong. stand Seemingly in response, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee working president K. Sudhakaran said the Congress’s primary aim was to defeat Mr. Shamseer. The United Democratic Front welcomed votes from across the political spectrum. However, it would not seek votes from the Social Democratic Party of India or the BJP. He said the CPI(M) had attempted to draw votes from both parties. “The CPI(M) is ruling the Mattannur and Muzhappilangadi panchayats with SDPI and BJP support. The parties are already in alliance in Kannur,” he said. CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said the BJP had first backed Mr. Nazeer. Then it called for a “conscience vote” cryptically. Mr. Sudhakaran’s words have decoded the BJP’s deceitful position. He has made it evident that the BJP had asked its supporters to vote in favour of the UDF to defeat Mr. Shamseer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thalassery-may-see-strategic-voting/article34249740.ece

Deployment of the State police and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) has been completed and heightened vigil ensured along the State borders, State Police Chief Loknath Behera said on Monday. Ninety-five companies of the police have been deployed across the State in view of the polls. CAPF units also have been stationed wherever necessary, Mr. Behera said.

06 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||A brisk day for candidates even without campaigning||Though the weeks of hectic campaigning for Assembly elections ended on Sunday, the candidates were in no mood to rest on the penultimate day of polling. A majority of the candidates in the district spent the day in house visits, in meeting influential voters in their constituencies, and paying visits to places of worship. Even though the candidates had done several rounds of campaigning, the last minute personal requests were seen as a way to ensure all the possible votes that could see them through in tight contests. In Nemom, Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate V. Sivankutty visited houses in Melamcode and Pappanamcode. He also spent the day attending weddings and paid a visit to a mosque in the constituency. United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate K. Muraleedharan visited houses in Kalippankulam, Manacaud and Vellayani and also visited the coastal area of Panathura. At the Aruvikkara constituency, UDF candidate K.S. Sabarinadhan made his presence felt in major areas of the constituencies and attended weddings. LDF candidate G. Stephen, unlike the others, chose to focus on meeting booth workers and planning for the polling day. In the Kovalam constituency, UDF candidate M. Vincent visited houses in Poovar and nearby areas. In the evening, he paid a visit to the Mangalathukonam Devi temple. LDF candidate A. Neelalohithadasan Nadar visited houses in Pulluvila, Uchakkada and Vizhinjam. NDA candidate Vishnupuram Chandrasekharan took part in kodiyettam (flag hoisting) at four temples, including the temple at Azhimala.

06 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||When physical distancing went for a toss||COVID-19 protocol at the poll material distribution centres in the district was confined to wearing face masks and the intermittent use of hand sanitisers on Monday. While large crowds began to swarm the 14 distribution centres spread across the district as early as 8 a.m., little effort was made to streamline the entry and exit of polling officers. Besides, the delay in allotting buses for the officials to reach their assigned polling stations resulted in a long wait for many officials at the centres. At the Government Higher Secondary Schools for Girls, Cotton Hill, where the election materials for the Nemom constituency were distributed, several hundreds of government employees had to queue up before 20 counters to receive the electronic voting machines (EVMs), voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) systems, voting compartments, documents, and stationery supplies. Kumar, a route officer who was assigned with ferrying polling officials to a school in Ambalathara, said physical distancing could not be enforced on such occasions. Nevertheless, all of those who had come to receive the poll materials wore masks all throughout. The situation was no different at the other distribution centres in the city, viz., Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Manacaud (Thiruvananthapuram constituency), St. Mary’s School in Pattom (Vattiyurkavu), and Loyola School in Sreekaryam (Kazhakuttam). Another polling official, a Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau staff who was assigned a booth in Manacaud, echoed the view. Claiming the pandemic norms were “impractical” during the election process under the existing circumstances, he said the lack of time management had also resulted in huge crowds at the centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/when-physical-distancing-went-for-a-toss/article34249946.ece
06 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||A parallel fight played out in social media to win over fence sitters||Constantly shifting narratives, controversies, positive campaigns and counter-campaigns, music videos and online challenge games – the past few weeks of electioneering for the Assembly polls have been as eventful and noisy in the online world as it was offline. It has been a race to grab the eyeballs and the mind space of the indecisive voter, the ones who can swing the results in at least some constituencies. Owning and sustaining the narrative has been a challenge for all fronts in social media, where trends hardly last a day. Right from the beginning, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) has attempted to ensure that continuity in power and developmental and welfare initiatives of the government would remain a buzzword in all discussions. The United Democratic Front (UDF), focussed its attention on a flurry of allegations raised by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala. They also attempted to harness the popularity of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, promoting his rallies, shop visits, and deep-sea diving to garner hits. Both the UDF and the Bharatiya Janata Party attempted to keep ‘faith’ in the limelight, with references to Sabarimala women entry issue. On song This campaign also witnessed popular professional vocalists lending their voices for the party campaigns. While Sitara Krishnakumar sang ‘Urappanu Keralam’ and Sooraj Santhosh composed ‘Hridayapaksham’ both for the LDF, Vaikom Vijayalakshmi crooned ‘Naadu Nannakanayi’ for the UDF. These numbers went viral on multiple social media platforms. All candidates activated their dedicated social media pages, with live broadcasting of vehicle rallies. Those who had ensured a keen following on their pages much before the elections had a clear upper hand over the new entrants to the social media. Opinion polls When the opinion polls from news channels began coming in, these were perhaps the most shared items; but even supporters of the LDF, which came on top in most surveys, have been critical of the survey methodologies. In the final week of the campaign, with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan daring the UDF to have a debate on development, the Left supporters too joined in with a development challenge hashtag campaign. The debate heated up as former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy responded with a Facebook post on development and welfare during UDF tenure. With Kerala’s penchant for the written word, Twitter, with its word limits, has not become a factor in setting the narrative in the State, unlike at the national level. WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram have remained the preferred platforms for political messaging. Now, it remains to be seen as to whose messaging has managed to sway the most.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-parallel-fight-played-out-in-social-media-to-win-over-fence-sitters/article34249743.ece

The government had last year capped the retail price of bottled drinking water at Rs. 13 a litre. A security personnel deployed to a booth in the city flagged the overcharging by the Kudumbashree. Another person who too paid Rs. 15 for a bottle of drinking water said the Kudumbashree should not have sold packaged water at a price exceeding the MRP. However, the Kudumbashree district mission, when contacted, said they had a fixed menu that included breakfast, tea, snacks, dinner, and so on, but bottled water was not a part of it in keeping with the green protocol for elections. However, when a number of people at the Pattom distribution centre asked for water owing to the sweltering heat, the Kudumbashree cafe unit purchased bottled water for Rs. 15 a litre from a nearby shop and sold it without any profit. Bottled water was not sold at any of the other distribution centre nor had any complaints been made, the district mission said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kudumbashrees-bottled-water-costs-rs-2-more/article34249940.ece

Muraleedharan’s vehicle was obstructed during campaign. The incident occurred at Studio Road in Vellayani around 9 p.m. when Mr. Muraleedharan, MP, was present in the area. While Congress sources claimed that the candidate was engaged in a last-minute assessment of the poll arrangements by interacting with booth-level polling agents, a group of BJP workers accused him of attempting to influence voters by distributing cash. The argument snowballed after BJP workers allegedly vandalised Mr. Muraleedharan’s car, following which several Congress workers congregated in the area and clashed with the BJP activists. The issue was soon brought under control by police personnel who had been stationed in the area. Three Congress workers, including Youth Congress state secretary Nemom Shajeer, were injured in the incident. The BJP, on the other hand, claimed at they were attacked by the police which did not relent to their demand to inspect Mr. Muraleedharan’s vehicle.

06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Groping partly in the dark||In the initial parts of ‘Irul’, when one sees the usual tropes of horror thrillers, complete with a grand mansion in a secluded area at night, a stranded couple, and a mysterious man who seems to own that mansion, one expects the script to have some delightful trick up the sleeve to upset our expectations. However, here, the effort seems to be to ensure that the audience will not get too much of a surprise and to not try anything out of the tested path. Alex Parayil (Soubin Shahir), a writer, takes his girlfriend Archana (Darshana Rajendran), a lawyer, on a weekend getaway. During the night ride, in pouring rain, the car breaks down in a secluded area. They take shelter in a nearby mansion, where they are welcomed by a mysterious man (Fahadh Faasil). But things, as expected, take a darker turn soon, with events paralleling those from Alex’s recent book Irul seeming to have taken place there. Right from the beginning, director Nazeef Yusuf Izuddin places the viewer in Archana’s shoes. She does not know where Alex is taking her. She has not read Alex’s book, which she learns from the conversations between him and the man at the mansion, is about a serial killer. She is also, just like the viewer, caught in the confusion of whom to trust between the two men, both of whom tell her equally convincing stories to explain the happenings in the mysterious mansion. Mysteries Yet, beyond the customary jump scares, the film never really manages to send chills down your spine, even at the heights of the confrontation between the two men or when the three of them go down to the cellar to explore the mysteries in there. One stand-out scene is a shouting match between the three characters, which might serve to disorient the viewer who is already confused about the motives of the two men. Staged feeling Some of the dialogues and exchanges have a tinge of artificiality and a staged feeling about them. This is especially so in the discussion about Alex’s book. Those discussions though throw up interesting tangents on how much the personal experiences of writers matter in the content that they produce, but these remain as mere diversions. Even in a film with just three characters, the three accomplished performers do not really get to dazzle the audience. If only at least half the attention that was paid to the sound design and the art direction was given in fleshing out the script and working on the dialogues, Irul would not have felt like a half-baked, half-hearted effort that it is now. The film is streaming on Netflix. S.R. Praveen||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/groping-partly-in-the-dark-with-poor-script/article34249674.ece

06 April 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||High-pitch campaign in Anantapur||Campaigning for MPTC and ZPTC elections in Anantapur is reaching a feverish pitch with both YSR Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidates going around the villages in their constituencies seeking votes with just one more day left for the canvassing. But, along with them, candidates of Telugu Desam Party too are reportedly continuing their campaigns, though surreptitiously. While TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu had earlier made an announcement that his party would boycott the elections, it was too late for many candidates who had already begun campaigning in Pamidi, Yadiki, Tadipatri, the strongholds of the party. The TDP candidates in Yadiki reportedly had employed young children who are going round the town in autorickshaws distributing pamphlets. But the candidates have taken care that none of the vehicles carried their posters, party flags, or other election material. At Pamidi, the TDP candidates are sure of winning five MPTCs and the Pamidi ZPTC seats and similar is the situation in Yadiki, where the TDP is sure of winning the majority of seats, but party leaders Payyavula Keshav, Kalava Srinivasulu, and the Tadipatri Municipal Chairperson J.C. Prabhakar Reddy had appealed to people to vote for the CPI(M) and CPI wherever it was contesting. The Communist parties, which got some hope in Kanaganapalli, C.K. Palli, Hindupur, Yadiki, Pamidi, Uravakonda and Rayadurg mandals, were not sure if the TDP supporters’ votes would get translated into their votes.  Meanwhile, the TDP candidate was hopeful of a victory in Kanaganapalli too. Following a good support base for the party in view of the way the former Minister Paritala Sunitha holds sway over the voters, the TDP expects a victory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/high-pitch-campaign-in-anantapur/article34249842.ece

The division had also achieved the highest revenue by collecting arrears of Rs. 17,324.32 lakh during the previous quarter. Special drives were conducted by all the 13 divisions in the State for the collection of tax arrears. The second place was bagged by Vijayawada-II Division, which secured Rs. 7,880.67 lakh for the quarter-ending March 31, 2021 and the third position went to Kakinada Division which secured Rs. 7,544.02 lakh during the same period. The arrears, other than GST, collected by Visakhapatnam Division for the last three months, are Rs. 1,644.79 lakh and profession tax arrears collected were Rs. 189.84 lakh. The GST arrears collected were Rs. 9,770.89 lakh. “The uncollected old arrears of APGST (AP General Sales Tax) and VAT (Value Added Tax), which were written off as ‘non-collectible’ as the persons concerned either could not be traced or had escaped, were tracked to the extent possible and the arrears were collected from them,” Joint Commissioner (GST-State Tax) N. Srinivasa Rao told The Hindu . “We gathered details of the absconders through various means . Out of the total of Rs. 16.42 crore old arrears (other than GST) collected, Rs. 4 crore was originally written off as ‘uncollectible’. It involved lot of resource planning, fixation of priorities and allocation of manpower. Our field officers did an excellent job,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vizag-division-of-state-gst-tops-in-revenue-collection/article34249969.ece
06 April 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Summer arrives a bit too soon in Chittoor district this year||The unforgiving summer has arrived early this year for residents of Chittoor district, with temperatures shooting up to 42 degrees Celsius in parts of the district in the last few days. The extreme heat is taking a toll on senior citizens, with few daring to venture out of their homes. Several elderly people have already been rushed to Primary Health Centres with symptoms of sunstroke in Varadaiahpalem, Satyavedu, Nagalapuram, Puttur and Nindra mandals. Horsley Hills, the popular summer resort in the district, clocked 31°C on Monday — considered to be the highest temperature recorded in April. This is definitely an indication that summer has made an early onset this year, say denizens. Several mandals in Madanapalle division, which generally see temperatures of around 33° C in April, have seen mercury rising by over three degrees than normal. Hailstorms The sudden change in weather brought heavy winds and hailstorms in Puthalapattu, Pakala, Penumuru and GD Nellore mandals during the last 24 hours, while mango growers in the region were a worried lot with considerable damage to the mango crops. The sweltering heat has forced people to remain indoors from 11 a.m. till after 3 p.m. Most roads are deserted during this time at several places, particularly in the eastern mandals. Several theatres where new movies have been released are also witnessing thin crowds. A senior official of the APSRTC at Chittoor said that the occupancy has come down by 30%, mostly in the rural areas, due to the heat. Fruit sales pick up Meanwhile, during the last one week, business has been brisk for vendors selling tender coconuts, watermelon and musk melons. The price of watermelon, which stood at Rs. 15 a kg till March-end, jumped to Rs. 25. Musk melon, which was being sold for Rs. 100 per 3 kg, has also become costlier. Lemons are also flying off the shelves, and are selling for Rs. 6-7 each. The summer heat also had its impact felt on the prices of sought-after flower varieties of jasmine and rose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/summer-arrives-a-bit-too-soon-in-chittoor-district-this-year/article34249309.ece
06 April 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Stay away from drugs, DIG advises students||Students should stay away from drugs in order to secure their future, said Deputy Inspector General (DIG), South Coastal Zone, Trivikram Varma. Addressing students of VFSTR (Vignan Deemed to be University), Mr. Varma said that drug abuse and women’s safety are two issues that are of paramount importance for the State. “Andhra Pradesh is second in alcohol consumption with 47% of alcohol addicts, and seventh in opium consumption with 3.67 lakh addicts. Students should not harbour thoughts of using any kinds of drugs as these will severely affect the physiological state of a person,” said Mr. Varma. He explained the adverse effects drugs can cause and gave details regarding the types of drugs, and the different stages of addiction that one goes through. “The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act prohibits production, manufacturing, cultivation, possession, sale, purchasing, transport, storage, and consumption of any narcotic drug. And for each and every mentioned crime, there are varying degrees of punishment,” Mr. Varma told the students. “A complaint box would be installed on the campus to enable students to voice their complaints or grievances. Students can also directly contact 7382296118, the CID’s Narcotic Cell, via WhatsApp,” Mr. Varma said. The DIG further asked the girl students to make use of the Disha app which can help women during a time of crisis. “With the introduction of the Disha Act, the crime rate has gone down by 7.9% from 2019-2020. Before the introduction of Disha Act, it took nearly 200 days to complete the investigation. Now, the average timespan has come down to 53 days, and 457 cases were investigated within seven days,” the DIG said. SP, Guntur Urban, R.N. Ammi Reddy advised the staff to sensitise the students about women harassment and the adverse effects of drug abuse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stay-away-from-drugs-students-told/article34249311.ece

Speaking to newsmen at a press conference at his residence, Mr. Kannababu referred to the results in the recent elections to the gram panchayats and urban local bodies where the TDP suffered a debacle and said that the party’s decision to boycott elections came from the fear of seeing a repeat of events. On the fight for the Special Category Status (SCS) for Andhra Pradesh, Mr. Kannababu said: “The TDP has always supported the special package and undermined the SCS during its rule, whereas the YSRCP has been fighting for the SCS.” “Jana Sena Party president K. Pawan Kalyan chooses to be silent instead of demanding the SCS for the State. Mr. Pawan Kalyan should have raised the demand for the SCS at the recent Tirupati public meeting,” said Mr. Kannababu, adding that the JSP chief should question the Centre, instead of the State government, on issues of VSP privatisation or hike in fuel prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidus-decision-from-fear-of-defeat/article34249659.ece

RajeevHYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Meeting of chief secretaries of Telangana, A.P. deferred by a day||The crucial meeting of the Chief Secretaries of two Telugu States – Telangana and Andhra Pradesh – has been deferred by a day by the Union Home Ministry. The Union Ministry had conveyed its willingness to hold the meeting on March 31 initially and it had been deferred to April 6 subsequently. The Ministry had now communicated its decision to convene the meeting on Wednesday in a late evening communication sent to the two State governments. The Union Ministry said the meeting too stands postponed and would be held at 5 p.m. through video conferencing on Wednesday, April 7. The meeting is expected to discuss among other things bilateral issues arising out of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014 regarding allocation of posts in different departments as well as division of assets and liabilities between the two States post bifurcation. There has been no forward movement with regard to the division of assets and liabilities between the two successor States since the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had decided to hand over the physical possession of major establishments including the parts of State Secretariat located in Hyderabad that have been apportioned between the two States through the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. According to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India submitted to the State Legislature during the recent budget session, an amount of Rs. 1,51,349.67 crore under Capital Heads, Rs. 28,099.69 crore under Loans and Advances, Rs. 4,474.04 crore under Deposits and Advances, Rs. 238 crore under Suspense and Miscellaneous and Rs. 310.24 crore under Remittances was yet to be apportioned between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana by the end of 2019, even after more than five years of State Reorganisation.

06 April 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Panabaka Lakshmi blames YSRCP, BJP for rise in prices of essential commodities||Former Union Minister and TDP nominee for Tirupati Lok Sabha byelection Panabaka Lakshmi blamed the BJP government at the Centre and the YSRCP government in the State for rise in prices of essential commodities. During her campaign in the Venkatagiri Assembly segment of Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency in Nellore district on Monday, Ms. Panabaka Lakshmi grabbed the attention of people by turning herself into a vegetable vendor at Sydapuram village. Highlighting in recurrent increase in the prices of essential commodities including vegetables, she sold vegetables to the villagers. “The essential commodities have gone beyond the reach of commoners. The BJP at the Centre and the YSRCP in the State remain indifferent to such issues concerning the people,” she said. Ms. Panabaka Lakshmi claimed that the sand that was easily available during the TDP rule had become a difficult commodity and blamed the new sand policy of the YSRCP government for it. “Both the Union and State governments are competing with each other to impose heavy taxes on petrol and diesel,” said the former Union Minister for Petroleum, adding that she had tried her best to keep the fuel prices within the reach of common people. Plight of weavers Interacting with a group of handloom weavers at Balayapalli, she blamed the ‘wrong policies’' of the NDA government for the spate of suicides, by not just weavers but also farmers. “I am well-versed with your problems. Given a chance, I want to raise your issues in the Parliament and work for their resolution,” she said and recalled that during her tenure as the Union Minister of State for Textiles, she had sanctioned 300 worksheds for weavers in and around Venkatagiri. Civic infra The civic infrastructure here needs upgradation, said a group of people at Bangarapeta while referring to the bad condition of the roads and inadequate drinking water supply in the area. Ms. Panabaka Lakshmi also assured a group of social forestry planters to fight for better market prices of casuarina, whose rate had fallen from Rs. 4,500 per tonne during the previous TDP regime to less than Rs. 1,000 per tonne now. She promised to ensure a remunerative price for papaya when a group of farmers complained about the falling price for the crop. Ms. Panabaka Lakshmi was accompanied by former Minister G. Surya Rao, TDP MLA from Parchur Yeluri Sambasiva Rao and former MLA P.Srinivasa Rao during the campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/panabaka-lakshmi-blames-ysrcp-bjp-for-rise-in-prices-of-essential-commodities/article34249825.ece
06 April 2021||Nivedita Ganguly,ANDHRA PRADESH||Zoo officials take special steps to keep animals cool this summer||As the city sizzles under soaring day time temperatures, the authorities of Indira Gandhi Zoological Park are gearing up with special arrangements to protect the 810 animals of 90 species from the sweltering heat. From putting cool roof paints on night houses to covering enclosures with palmyra leave shades and setting up water sprinklers, the zoo keepers are ensuring that the animals are kept cool and well hydrated. In the aviary section that houses many exotic birds like varieties of macaw and other small birds, the cages are kept cool with khus khus mats and periodical spraying of water. The animals are at present housed in 77 enclosures spread across the 625 acres of the zoo park. “We are setting up fans in enclosures for animals like wild dog, panther, chimpanzee, white tiger and hyena. Apart from these, we are also preparing sheds in the enclosure to provide protection from the heatwave,” zoo curator Nandani Salaria told The Hindu.  This time special water sprinklers for reptiles have also been kept in place. According to the zoo veterinarians, when the atmospheric temperature rises, the metabolic rate of animals goes down. A reduced appetite is the first sign of an animal being gripped by the summer heat. In addition to the usual food, summer specials like watermelon and cucumber which have a rich water content are fed to the animals. “In addition to these, we also provide glucose and B complex in the diet,” Ms. Salaria said. Challenging for old animals The summer can be particularly challenging for the oldest animals of IGZP — white tiger Sirish and Indian Gaur Raja. “A set of routine has been put in place for the oldest animals such as administering supplements like Vitamin B Complex. We are also closely monitoring them to ensure their good health,” Ms. Salaria added. Like most zoos across the country, the IGZP is battling the challenges due to fund crunch as gate revenues remain low compared to pre-COVID times. In summer, power consumption for zoo is generally high. Every year during the summer months, power bills alone amount to Rs. 2 lakh in Indira Gandhi Zoological Park.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/zoo-officials-take-special-steps-to-keep-animals-cool-this-summer/article34249847.ece

Speaking at a meeting on sensitisation on NALSA schemes with focus on women and children presided over by Prakasam District Principal Judge P. Venkata Jyotirmayi, he observed financial assistance to the victims did not suffice. “They need to be imparted skills so that they can stand on their own legs.” It was found that in 97 to 98% of cases relating to child trafficking and sexual offences, the offenders turned out to be relatives and close acquaintances. He emphasised the need for forming an exclusive national-level investigation agency to crack such cases. Sunita Krishnan of Prajwala, a Hyderabad-based non-governmental organisation, said data showed that one woman got trafficked every 10 minutes across the country. Women themselves were involved in about 45% of trafficking cases. The rescue rate of the victims of trafficking was a poor 3% of the total offences, she lamented. Deputy Inspector General(Technical) Paul Raj said Disha mobile app had evoked a good response from women who could now register a complaint any time and from anywhere. District Collector P Bhaskar said the district administration was striving its best to step up awareness in close coordination with the District legal Services Authority.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/skill-training-important-for-trafficking-victims-hc-judge/article34249315.ece

Chandrababu Naidu’s decision to boycott elections was a political blunder and no party would take such a step. “Mr. Chandrababu could not digest the unprecedented defeat in the municipal elections. The TDP could not win respectable number of wards leave alone chairperson and Mayor posts. Due to the fear of further deterioration of vote bank in rural areas, he boycotted the elections with silly reasons. People of the State will forget TDP even before 2024 general elections,” said Dr. Kruparani. “Many TDP leaders opposed the boycott decision since it would ruin their political career in the respective constituencies. Staying away from the political battle field is not a good decision for any party,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdps-poll-boycott-decision-a-political-blunder-says-killi/article34249845.ece

The TDP workers waved party flag and put up festoons in the temple city as the Mr. Lokesh took part in a door-to-door campaign across the arterial roads, under the banner of Telugu Nadu Students Federation (TNSF). Even as the party’s campaign vehicle moved ahead playing music number ‘Kadalirandi Telugu Desa Karyakarthalara...’, Mr. Lokesh covered the busy and commercial localities in Tirupati. The passers-by vied to meet him, while youth took selfies. Mr. Lokesh gave anxious moments to the party’s in-house security personnel and the police by veering away to the roadside to greet women, senior citizens and children. Addressing a public meeting, Mr. Lokesh confronted the YSRCP government with issues pertaining to corruption, land mafia, attack on women and Dalits, vanishing red sanders trees on Seshachalam hills among others. He mentioned soaring prices of sand, power, petroleum products and essential commodities, putting the blame on the YSRCP government. He also mentioned the skyrocketting prices of liquor. Unemployment Claiming that there is ‘rampant unemployment’ in the State, Mr. Lokesh said, “During his tenure as the Information Technology Minister, I had brought 3,0000 jobs. The YSRCP regime has not added a single new job. Instead, it has rehabilitated party sympathisers as volunteers for a meager pay of Rs. 5000 per month. Is it an achievement at all?”, he questioned. Mr. Lokesh said that the development had taken a backseat after the YSRCP assumed the office. “Many multinational companies are walking out of the State one after the another, rendering many people joblessness. The liquor policy as flawed due to which the State is unable to meet its pre-election promise of enforcing prohibition,” he said and drummed up support for party candidate Panabaka Lakshmi. Only the TDP would be able to voice the State’s concern in New Delhi, Mr. Lokesh added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/development-in-state-has-taken-a-backseat-in-ysrcp-rule-lokesh/article34249835.ece

Chandrababu Naidu was in power for over two months after the incident. Suspicions were raised against Adinarayana Reddy, who was a Minister in the TDP Cabinet and is now in the BJP. Pawan Kalyan, who was recently sharing the dais with Adinarayana Reddy during a campaign for the Tirupati bypoll, alleged that Jagan was doing nothing to further the probe into Vivekananda’s death, despite knowing well that the case is now being investigated by the CBI,” Ms. Vijayamma said. She hit out at the TDP and the media for ‘spreading lies’ over the attack on Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy at the Vizag airport in October 2018. “Jagan has written letters to the Centre to expedite investigation into these cases,” Ms. Vijayamma said. Ms. Vijayamma said that her son, despite being Chief Minister, could do little to expedite the probe into Vivekananda Reddy’s death. “Jagan cannot get involved while a Central agency is investigating the case. When my husband died in 2009, we were unsure whether it was an accident or if he was murdered, but we were not in a position to do anything,” she said. ‘No differences in family’ Ms. Vijayamma also clarified that there were no differences between Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and her daughter Y.S. Sharmila over the latter’s decision to float her own political party in Telangana. “Jagan had made it clear that he would not be able to lead the YSR Congress Party in Telangana as he felt that it was important to have cordial relations with Chief Ministers of neighbouring States for the betterment of Andhra Pradesh. Sharmila decided that she should be in the service of people of Telangana as a daughter-in-law of the State. Just because they hold different opinions does not mean that there are differences between the two of them,” Ms. Vijayamma said,,||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/want-killers-of-viveka-brought-to-book-vijayamma/article34249841.ece

ChandrashekharHYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Seed traceability to be operational from kharif||Seed certification and traceability in the country is set to enter a new era from the coming kharif (vanakalam) season with the introduction of Quick Response (QR) code for the first time in Telangana. The traceability system would come into effect for the seed certified by Telangana State Seed and Organic Certification Authority (TSSOCA) and TS Seed Development Corporation (TSSDC). Although the Ministry of Agriculture has announced the introduction of the traceability system in 2019 to ensure supply of quality seed to the farming community in line with the system followed in the developed countries, it could not take off at the national level due to various reasons. First in country However, the Telangana government has started working on the system immediately. To take the seed traceability concept forward, the State government has been holding meetings with other government departments and the seed industry for the past few months for shaping an efficient system. “The system of traceability is ready for implementation and it would be a first of its kind in the country and the model would pave the way for other States to introduce it to control the menace of spurious seed,” Director of TSSOCA K. Keshavulu told The Hindu .  Credibility The seed certified by the TSSOCA and TSSDC, including that of several seed companies who get certification from the two agencies, would have an added advantage in the seed market with its credibility (genuineness) factor with the further value addition of the traceability factor. The seed certified by the two agencies is supplied to about 10 other States in the country besides within the State. Being the seed bowl of the country, Telangana meets about 60% of the country’s seed needs besides meeting its own requirement. During 2019-20, about 33 lakh quintals of seed of various crops certified by the two agencies was produced and processed in the State and made available for 2.03 crore acres of cultivation. Two generations’ record “The traceability of seed certified by the two agencies with help of the QR Code will include information on who, when and where the seed is produced, date of expiry, when and where the seed is processed and packaged. Further, it will also have the information on who supplied the seed to the producing farmers or the origin of the breeder seed. In all, the code will have the information about two generations of the seed,” Mr. Keshavulu explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/seed-traceability-from-this-kharif/article34249645.ece

Asking the party leaders not to see the byelection to Nagarjunasagar just as another byelection, AICC in-charge of party affairs in Telangana Manickam Tagore wanted them to put in all out efforts during the 10 days time remaining for electioneering so that the party candidate and senior leader K.

Bhatti Vikramarka, Mr. Jana Reddy, MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, TPCC working presidents Ponnam Prabhakar and J. Kusum Kumar and others too spoke at the virtual meeting.

06 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Is transfer a reward or punishment: High Court||Is transfer of an officer facing disciplinary proceedings a reward or punishment? Telangana High Court posed this question to State government on being informed that Adilabad Municipal Commissioner Maruti Prasad, against whom an inquiry was launched for permitting construction of a commercial complex in a land meant for hostel for students, was posted as Jagtial Municipal Commissioner. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, recently hearing a PIL petition on illegal constructions in government land allotted to build hostel for students, expressed dissatisfaction over the delay in initiating action against the officer responsible for allowing the illegal structure to come up. State government allotted land to Munnuru Kapu Sangham in Adilabad for construction of hostel for students. In September of 2019, a person filed PIL petition alleging that the Sangham began constructing a commercial complex in the allotted land. Notices issued The HC issued notices to the officers concerned and the State government to explain their stand. In February of 2020, the government informed the court that Municipal Commissioner had stopped the illegal construction taken up by the Sangham. The HC, however, observed that it was surprising that the Commissioner did not take any action against the Sangham for undertaking unauthorised construction. The HC then instructed the Municipal Administration Principal Secretary to act against the Commissioner. During the next hearing, it instructed the Principal Secretary and the Commissioner to personally appear before the bench for failing to initiate steps against the unauthorised construction. As per the court order, Principal Secretary Arvind Kumar and Commissioner C.V.N. Raju, who had taken charge replacing Maruti Prasad, appeared before the court. When the matter came up for hearing recently, the bench headed by CJ Hima Kohli wondered if the government rewarded Maruti Prasad when Special Government Pleader Sanjeevi Kumar informed it that he was posted as Jagtial Municipal Commissioner. “What is the status of the disciplinary inquiry against him? Any action taken against him?” the Chief Justice asked. The SGP sought time to furnish further details on the matter. The bench instructed the government to file status report on the matter along with details of action initiated against officers responsible for permitting illegal constructions by July 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/is-transfer-a-reward-or-punishment-hc/article34249648.ece

06 April 2021||hyderabad,TELANGANA||Pandemic compounded woes of already struggling TSRTC||The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation’s fortunes have plummeted from FY 2014-15 to FY 2020-21, owing to various factors such as the continuous rise in fuel prices, and since last year, due to the COVID–19 pandemic. As per an official document, in FY 2014-15, the losses were approximately Rs. 299 crore, and in FY 2020-2021 they rose to Rs. 1,959 crore. According to the document, the lockdown, which saw a complete halt in inter-State operations in the Greater Hyderabad Zone (GHZ) from March 22, 2020, only to resume partially from September 24, 2020, the number of kilometres operated took a hit on account of the pandemic. Up to January 2021, the TSRTC operated 726.59 lakh kilometres which compares poorly with the previous year’s 2,381.27 lakh km. This also led to a reduction in occupancy which was approximately 47 up to January 2021, as compared to little over 70 in the previous year. The earnings per kilometre also dipped which was Rs. 29.93 up to January 2021, as compared to Rs. 35.74 in the previous year.

06 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TSMFC beset with low allocations for bank-linked schemes||The Telangana State Minorities Finance Corporation (TSMFC), an agency of the Minorities Welfare Department, which deals with economic support schemes - on the one hand is beset with lower budgets and a large number of applications, and on the other, paucity of staff. According to information obtained under the Right to Information Act, 2005, by ASEEM, a non-governmental organisation, the sanctioned strength of the agency is 60, and there is a vacancy of 41 people. The document also lays bare the allocation and the actual expenditure of bank-linked schemes. The scheme hands over loans to applicants with a subsidy, depending on the amount applied for. In FY 2020-21, the allocation for this was Rs. 28.31 crore. While Rs. 21.23 crore was released, the expenditure was Rs. 15 crore. According to sources, while there has not been a halt in disbursal of these loans, the TSMFC is overwhelmed by the number of pending applications. “The corporation has not stopped these loans. It is just that disbursal now depends on the allocation. At the moment, the corporation wants to clear the old applicants, which are thousands in number, on priority. A file has been circulated to this effect, and we are positive that it will come through,” the source said. “The case of the bank-linked schemes is like the driver-cum-owner (driver empowerment) scheme. The plan was to hand over fixed number cars to drivers, but the number of applications received was around 14,000,” the source explained. In another case, that of the Centre for Educational Development of Minorities, which delivers coaching to students from minority communities for competitive exams, as well as for job seekers, too has seen a reduction of allocations. While the budget from FY 2014-15 to 2017-18 was Rs. 3 crore, in 2019-2020, the allocation was Rs. 1.32 crore and the expenditure was Rs. 1 crore. Speaking to The Hindu , an office-bearer of the NGO said, “While it is a good thing that substantial budgetary allocations are being made to the Telangana Minorities Residential Educational Institutions Society, there is also a need to foster entrepreneurship to those who want to take up small businesses by means of the bank-linked schemes. It appears that the CEDM should do more to publicise and attract students.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tsmfc-beset-with-low-allocations-for-bank-linked-schemes/article34249667.ece

06 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Severity of COVID less post vaccination: Allu Aravind||Telugu film producer Allu Aravind, who tested positive for the novel coronavirus after taking first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, has urged people to get inoculated since it helps in mitigating severity of the disease. Detailing the sequence of events prior to testing positive, Mr Aravind said he had visited a village with two friends after taking the first dose. While he and one of the two friends developed mild fever, which stayed for around three days, the other friend had to be admitted to hospital. “The difference is, the person who got admitted to hospital had not taken the vaccine, while the two of us had been immunised,” the film producer said in a video clip, adding that he is an example that severity of COVID is less if vaccinated. Around a week ago, Telangana’s Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao had said that health officials had come across a few cases of people testing positive despite taking two jabs. Citing the example of an 80-year-old man who had been immunised but was detected with the virus, Dr Rao had stressed that the infection would not be as severe after vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/severity-of-covid-less-post-vaccination-allu-aravind/article34249622.ece

Mr. Shah, who flew to Chhattisgarh on Monday, two days after the April 3 attack at Tarrem in Sukma where 22 security personnel were killed, said the killings were “an act of desperation by the Maoists” and the fight would soon take a decisive turn. “I reviewed the security today. The officers here said there should not be any let-up in the fight against the Naxals. The loss of lives of jawans will not be in vain. In the past five or six years, many security camps have been opened in core areas of Naxals. This attack is a result of their desperation. The Chhattisgarh government and the Centre are working together,” Mr. Shah told mediapersons in Jagadalpur. He was accompanied by Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, who said more security camps would be established in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas at a rapid pace, and development works would also be accelerated. As many as 14 of the 27 districts in Chhattisgarh are affected by LWE violence. In the recent past, the CRPF has opened 18 new security camps in South Bastar. ‘Shrinking dominance’ “New camps are being established in the area because of which the Naxals are panicking. The area of Naxalite dominance is shrinking rapidly. It is the first time when we have entered the den of Naxalites,” Mr. Baghel said. Mr. Shah flew to Chhattisgarh on Monday. During his day-long trip, he visited Jagdalpur where he attended the wreath laying ceremony for the fallen personnel. On April 2 evening, a joint team of the Chhattisgarh Police, comprising the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Special Task Force (STF) along with various teams of Central Reserve Police Force, had proceeded for a combing operation in south Bastar.

The increase in the rate of transmission of COVID-19 across the country has, he stated, presented new concerns and challenges and the vaccination campaign needed to move more rapidly. “If rules for opening new centres are simplified and everyone is allowed to be vaccinated irrespective of age, the Delhi government can vaccinate all Delhi residents within three months. In the fight against COVID-19, the Delhi government has had the support of the Centre at every step,” Mr. Kejriwal wrote. Positive response Expressing faith in the Prime Minister and hoping that he would look into his requests, Mr. Kejriwal said he hoped for a response in the affirmative. “There is an urgent need to increase the number of vaccination centres. For this, the pre-conditions placed by the Centre regarding vaccination centres need to be relaxed,” he stated. For example, according to the instructions of the Central government, Mr. Kejriwal said, vaccination centres can only be set up in hospitals or dispensaries. Initially, this was done to ensure that if someone had an adverse reaction to the vaccine, they could be treated immediately in the hospital. The vaccination drive in the last three months, he wrote, had shown that the vaccine was safe. Therefore, he stated, his request was that this condition be removed so that largescale vaccination centres can be built in schools, community centres and other places. It will be necessary to take precautions to ensure these relaxations do not put the citizens in harm’s way and the Delhi government will ensure that it takes all necessary precautions, he said. “It [the vaccine] should be made available to everyone by removing the age limit. Except for those who cannot get vaccinated medically, we should start vaccinating everyone. The more people get vaccinated, the more we will be able to reduce the spread of the disease,” he stated.  If rules for opening new centres are simplified and age limit removed, the Delhi govt. can vaccinate all residents within three months   Arvind Kejriwal Delhi Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/can-give-jab-to-all-within-3-months-kejriwal/article34249507.ece

She said there is a “scam” of Rs. 1,400 crore. The BJP termed the allegations a “cover up” by the AAP. “In 2017, the North body hired an agency — Data World Company — to survey and quantify the number of properties. Following this, it came to light that more than 12 lakh properties had to pay property tax to the civic body. In 2017, it collected property tax from 5,75,000 properties, but in 2020 it collected property tax from only 4,25,000 properties,” said Atishi at a press meet. She said these 12 lakh properties were given a Unique Property Identification Code (UPIC) through which the property tax collection mechanism would work. She said when a survey of 12 lakh properties has been conducted by the civic body, then why has property tax been collected only from one-third of that figure. “The BJP-ruled civic body has done Rs. 1,400 crore property tax scam. This scam worth crores has been running in the north body for years now. If we go by their 12 lakh plus figure, elicited by their own survey, then property tax worth Rs. 2,000 crore should have been collected by the North body. Where is the balance of Rs. 1,400 crore? Where is the property tax of the remainder roughly eight lakh properties? Who has pocketed this amount? This is what we want to know,” she said. ‘Release funds’ Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that on Monday, the Delhi High Court has reprimanded the Delhi government for not releasing funds to municipal corporations. He said Ms. Atishi’s statement alleging property tax scam is an effort to “cover up” the damage caused by High Court’s reprimand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/atishi-accuses-north-civic-body-of-rs-1400-cr-property-tax-scam/article34249516.ece

As per the notification, religious places will remain closed due to the rise in cases, and the Saibaba temple will remain closed for devotees from 8 p.m. Monday till further orders, said Ravindra Thakre, officiating chief executive officer, Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust. “However, the daily affairs on the temple premises will go on as usual, though accommodation and ‘prasadalay’ (dining hall for devotees) will remain closed,” he said. The State recorded a surge of 47,288 COVID-19 cases on Monday as its active case tally breached the 4.50 lakh mark to reach 4,51,375. A total of 155 more fatalities pushed the State’s cumulative death toll to 56,033.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/shirdi-temple-shut-till-further-orders-as-covid-19-cases-rise/article34249723.ece

06 April 2021||Amman,||I’m not going to obey, says Jordan Prince||Jordan’s Prince Hamzah, accused of a “wicked” plot against his elder half-brother King Abdullah II, has struck a defiant tone, insisting he will not obey orders restricting his movement. The government has accused Prince Hamzah of involvement in a seditious conspiracy to “destabilise the kingdom’s security”, placed him under house arrest and detained at least 16 more people. But 41-year-old Hamzah, who says he has been ordered to stay inside his Amman palace, vowed he would defy limits on his movement and communications, in an audio recording posted on Twitter late on Sunday. “I don’t want to make moves and escalate now, but of course, I’m not going to obey when they say you can’t go out, you can’t tweet, you can’t communicate with people, you’re only allowed to see your family,” he said. Prince Hamzah — a former Crown Prince who was stripped of that title by King Abdullah in 2004 — has emerged as a vocal critic of the monarchy, accusing Jordan’s leadership of corruption, nepotism and authoritarian rule. In a video he sent to the BBC on Saturday he bemoaned “incompetence that has been prevalent in our governing structure for the last 15 to 20 years and has been getting worse”. He charged that “no one is able to speak or express opinion on anything without being bullied, arrested, harassed and threatened”. ‘Wicked slander’ Prince Hamza denied being involved in any “nefarious” plot, but said he had been placed under house arrest, with his phone and Internet cut, by Jordan’s military chief, General Youssef Huneiti. In the recording released on Sunday, Prince Hamzah said that “when the head of the joint chiefs of staff comes and tells you this ... I think it’s kind of unacceptable”. He added that when Gen. Huneiti visited his home, “I recorded what he said and sent it to my friends abroad and to my family, in case anything happens”. According to residents, the Internet has been cut off for two days in the posh district of Dabouq, in the west of the capital Amman, where Prince Hamzah and other royals live. King Abdullah, 59, named Hamzah Crown Prince in 1999, in line with their father’s dying wish, but stripped him of that title five years later and named his own son Prince Hussein, now 26, heir to the throne. Prince Hamzah’s mother, American-born Queen Noor, defended her son, tweeting that she was “praying that truth and justice will prevail for all the innocent victims of this wicked slander”. The crisis has laid bare divisions in a country usually seen as a bulwark of stability in West Asia. Washington, major Gulf powers, Egypt and the Arab League were all quick to pledge their support for King Abdullah and all his steps to ensure stability, and a similar message came from Russia Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/im-not-going-to-obey-says-jordan-prince/article34249204.ece
06 April 2021||Kabul,||Afghan President to unveil new peace proposal: officials||Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has drawn up a new proposal for peace with the Taliban ahead of an international conference aimed at jump-starting faltering talks between the two warring sides, official sources said. It comes after the U.S. — backed by Russia and other stakeholders — said in its own leaked proposal that it wants to see some form of transitional government involving the Taliban, although Mr. Ghani has insisted leaders can only be chosen at the ballot box. According to official sources, Mr. Ghani intends to present his three-stage plan at a UN-backed conference in Turkey to be attended by the U.S., Russia and other key regional countries. A date for the event has not been finalised. Early election The U.S. is just weeks away from a May 1 deadline to withdraw all foreign troops from Afghanistan as part of a deal agreed with the hardline group last year — a date U.S. President Joe Biden has said will be tough to meet. Mr. Ghani’s three-stage proposal includes reaching a political settlement with the Taliban and announcing an internationally monitored ceasefire. He then proposes holding an early presidential election in which the Taliban could take part to form a “government of peace”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/afghan-president-to-unveil-new-peace-proposal-officials/article34249205.ece
06 April 2021||Moscow,||Putin signs law that could keep him in office till 2036||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed a law allowing him to potentially hold onto power until 2036, a move that formalises constitutional changes endorsed in a vote last year. The July 1 constitutional vote included a provision that reset Mr. Putin’s previous term limits, allowing him to run for President two more times. The change was rubber-stamped by the Kremlin-controlled legislature and the relevant law signed by Mr. Putin was posted on Monday on an official portal of legal information. The 68-year-old President, who has been in power for more than two decades — longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin — said he would decide later whether to run again in 2024. He has argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants focused on their work instead of “darting their eyes in search for successors.” The constitutional amendments also emphasised the primacy of Russian law over international norms, outlawed same-sex marriages and mentioned “a belief in God” as a core value. Nearly 78% of voters approved the constitutional amendments during the balloting that lasted for a week and concluded on July 1. Turnout was 68%. Following the vote, Russian lawmakers have methodically modified the national legislation, approving the relevant laws. The opposition criticised the constitutional vote, arguing that it was tarnished by widespread reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities. In January, Russia imprisoned the country’s most prominent opposition figure, Alexei Navalny upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Authorities have rejected the accusation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/putin-signs-law-that-could-keep-him-in-office-till-2036/article34249280.ece
06 April 2021||Jerusalem,||Netanyahu sees prospects fade as his graft trial resumes||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial resumed on Monday, with a key witness painting a picture of an image-obsessed Israeli leader forcing a prominent news site to flatter his family and smear his opponents. The testimony came as Mr. Netanyahu’s chances of securing another term in office following last month’s parliamentary elections appeared to be dwindling as President Reuven Rivlin began consultations with the various parties elected to Parliament before choosing a candidate to form a new government. With a majority of lawmakers opposed to giving Mr. Netanyahu another term, Mr. Rivlin could give the task to a different candidate, possibly as soon as Monday night. Taken together, the court testimony and political consultations pointed to an increasingly uphill struggle for Mr. Netanyahu as he fights for his political life. The consultations “make it more difficult for the President to give the mandate to Mr. Netanyahu,” said Yohanan Plesner, President of the Israel Democracy Institute. The session focused on the most serious case against Mr. Netanyahu — in which he is accused of promoting regulations that delivered hundreds of millions of dollars of profits to the Bezeq telecom company in exchange for positive coverage on the firm’s popular news site, Walla. Ilan Yeshua, Walla’s former chief editor, described a system in which Bezeq’s owners repeatedly pressured him to publish favourable things about Mr. Netanyahu and smear his rivals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/netanyahu-sees-prospects-fade-as-his-graft-trial-resumes/article34249206.ece
06 April 2021||WASHINGTON,||Biden’s massive infrastructure plan hits Republican blockade||Republicans in Congress are making the politically brazen bet that it’s more advantageous to oppose President Joe Biden’s ambitious agenda to rebuild America than to lend support for the costly $2.3 trillion undertaking for roads, bridges and other infrastructure investments. Much the way Republicans provided no votes for the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief Bill, they plan to sit on the sidelines for this next big lift by the White House, forcing Democrats to take full ownership of the massive package of spending and corporate tax hikes that Mr. Biden wants approved over the summer. The tension could mount this week as Mr. Biden shows no signs adjusting to satisfy Republican leaders, instead appealing directly to their constituents for support. “I think the Republicans’ voters are going to have a lot to say about whether we get a lot of this done,” Mr. Biden said. That leaves Mr. Biden and congressional Republicans on a collision course, the outcome of which could define the parties and his presidency. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell set the defining tone for his party when he flatly declared last week he will fight Mr. Biden’s agenda “every step of the way.” Recent polling by The Associated Press-NORC Public Research Center found Americans have responded favourably to the President’s approach, with 73% approving of his handling of the pandemic. That includes about half of Republicans. Senator Roy Blunt, a member of Senate GOP leadership, said on Sunday a smaller package of about $615 billion, or 30% of what Mr. Biden is proposing, could find bipartisan backing from Republicans if the White House found a way to pay for it without raising the corporate tax rate. He pointed to potential user fees on drivers and others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bidens-massive-infrastructure-plan-hits-republican-blockade/article34249202.ece

Palma was taken in a coordinated attack on March 24, in a major escalation of an insurgency that has been raging in Cabo Delgado province for more than three years. Thousands have fled the town of some 75,000 people and dozens killed, according to an early government toll, and French energy giant Total has abandoned a site where a multi-billion-dollar gas project is under way. On Sunday, the Army escorted officials and journalists through Palma. Commander Chongo Vidigal, leader of military operations to regain control of Palma, told state television TVM the area was “safe,” although he fell short of declaring the Army had regained control. “The airfield area was the only one we needed to clear and we did that this morning. It’s completely safe,” Vidigal assured. “I think that it is a significant number of terrorists who were shot down,” he said, adding the authorities would clarify the exact number later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/palma-safe-from-jihadists-says-mozambique-army/article34249207.ece

The vessel sank less than an hour after it had departed Narayanganj, 20 km from the capital Dhaka, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bangladesh-ferry-disaster-toll-rises-to-28/article34249208.ece
06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The alchemy of anti-incumbency||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in West Bengal is a unique specimen in understanding anti-incumbency. Welfare schemes that usually make incumbents popular have added to the anti-incumbency woes of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, as the workers of her party made those the easy and only option for rent-seeking. ‘Cut money’, or the cut for TMC local leaders on welfare disbursement, is the most important reason for anti-incumbency in the State. The unaccountable nature of power at the panchayat level after the 2018 elections were rigged by the ruling party, made it into an apparatus of extraction rather than a dispenser of patronage. The balance between patronage and extraction, which sustains political parties, was lost. Second, Ms. Banerjee, sought to compensate for her past alliances with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), by an overuse of Muslim symbolism, which has caused a backlash among Hindus and Muslims.  Usually, smart politicians use a crisis to neutralise accumulated resentments and reinforce their popularity. In Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan could turn two floods (2018 and 2019), a cyclone and the COVID-19 pandemic as opportunities to demonstrate his governance; in Assam, pandemic relief helped the BJP government quieten any public dissatisfaction and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma became the face of a caring government. In contrast, Ms. Banerjee’s wayward workers made the Amphan cyclone (2020) in the midst of the pandemic a spectacle of corruption and inefficiency. The weakness of the state in West Bengal that the CPI(M)’s organisational capacity could camouflage earlier became more pronounced under the TMC. The key strategist of the party has acknowledged that anti-incumbency is a major factor. In fact, it is the overarching theme. Ms. Banerjee is trying to control the damage. Welfarism is an important tool in her kit — the TMC is offering a universal basic income for all families, if elected to power for a third term in West Bengal. She also realises that economic promises without emotional appeals are just not good enough. She is appealing to Bengali exceptionalism, and questioning Delhi imperialism, invoking the fear of the outsider, accompanied by a show of her Hindu anchorage. Political impact The existence of strong anti-incumbency is not a question of debate, but its impact is. Who are the new claimants to power? Which one among them has the capacity to harness anti-incumbency in its favour? The Left-Congress-Indian Secular Front (ISF) alliance and the BJP are relentless in attacking Ms. Banerjee. There are two mobilising issues at play — one is the TMC’s governance and the other is the Hindu-Muslim religious divide. The Left-Congress campaign focuses on the TMC’s track record; while the BJP is going on a no-holds-barred, double-barrel mobilisation on anti-incumbency and along the religious divide. In fact, the Left-Congress-ISF alliance can be of help to the BJP in two ways — it provides an alternative to those who are tired of the TMC, but would not vote for the BJP; and the emergence of cleric Abbas Siddiqui as a prominent face of the alliance fulfils the fear of the Muslim theme that headlines the BJP campaign. In certain circumstances, a new claimant can spook voters to an extent that they would rather stay with the detested incumbent. Cases of Gujarat, Bihar Two recent examples, of the Congress in Gujarat in 2017, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Bihar in 2020, are instructive. The BJP government in Gujarat after being in power for 20 years; and the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar after 15 years in power faced massive anti-incumbency among their respective core voters. The capacity of the challengers, the Congress in Gujarat and the RJD in Bihar, was limited, significantly due to the strong-arm measures of central agencies. But the defining turning point in both elections was a reframing of the campaign by the incumbent, from anti-incumbency to the basest instincts and fear of a threshold population. In Bihar, the non-Yadav Other Backward Classes groups would rather stay with the National Democratic Alliance than risk the possibility of Yadav domination under a new RJD government. In Gujarat, where the basest appeal is religion and not caste —the spectre of a Muslim Chief Minister, the BJP’s rhetoric in the last days of the campaign, held back enough flock in the incumbent’s tent. Ms. Banerjee’s strategy is premised on a belief that Bengalis think as Bengalis first; and they cannot be communally polarised to the extent of Gujarat or Uttar Pradesh. The TMC strategy relies on demography — a fourth of West Bengal’s voters are Muslims — and the assumption of a Bengali exceptionalism that is less permeable to intellectual ingress from the east. While demography is a strong barrier, Bengali exceptionalism could be an exaggeration. Bengal has been a recipient and originator of ideas in its interconnections with territories to the east. Some formative ideas of Hindu nationalism originated in Bengal in the works of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and U.N. Mukherji. In today’s West Bengal, roughly 10% of the population is non-Bengali. The presumption that a latent, universal resentment against the ‘national’ is the leitmotif of Bengal politics is overwrought. In fact, Ms. Banerjee’s emphasis on Bengali identity could backfire on her. The cross-border factor Ms. Banerjee’s calculation is that Bengali nationalism could blunt the communal appeal of the BJP’s politics, but the way the debate is playing out could further religious polarisation. There is a cross-border Bengali identity that connects the populations of West Bengal and Bangladesh. The BJP too has a cross-border politics that connects Bangladesh and West Bengal as one theatre, but its basic premise is Hindu cultural nationalism. This idea was reinforced in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh recently. In the Hindutva imagination, West Bengal — and India — is a location of the Hindu refuge, while Bangladesh is a place of their persecution. The BJP has promised in West Bengal the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh. The BJP campaign in West Bengal has portrayed Ms. Banerjee’s Bengali nationalism as illegitimate affinity towards Bangladesh. The BJP said West Bengal would become the next Kashmir under the TMC — suggesting that Bangladesh was also Pakistan until 1971. At this juncture, Bengali identity gets divided, not along the international border between India and Bangladesh and India, but as Hindus and Muslims who live on both sides. In other words, far from catalysing any Bengali renaissance against Hindutva, the invocation of Bengali nationalism may have invoked traumatic memories of communalism, separatism and violence that pulverised the region for decades, thanks to the BJP’s retelling. Ground realities While the incumbent’s strategy has evident weaknesses, the challenger’s capacity is not beyond doubt, despite help from central agencies. It has been pointed out that the BJP performs weaker in Assembly elections compared to Lok Sabha elections. The argument goes that if it goes lower than its 2019 performance, the BJP cannot win in West Bengal. But each election has unique factors at play, and history also tells us there is always a first time. The BJP has no baggage of history in West Bengal. However, the party’s organisational capacity is limited in West Bengal, and it has no ground game — so much so that several of its high-profile rallies came a cropper. Comparing one election to another is always fraught with problems, but the situation in West Bengal is broadly comparable to Assam in 2016 — a besieged incumbent, a triangular fight in some regions, and the BJP led by defectors from other parties. varghese.g@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-alchemy-of-anti-incumbency/article34249188.ece
06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The pillars of an equitable post-COVID India||COVID-19 in the last one year has once again reminded us of the growing inequalities in India. A recent Pew Research Report shows that India’s middle class may have shrunk by a third due to the novel coronavirus pandemic while the number of poor people earning less than Rs. 150 per day more than doubled. The Pew report also warned that the situation may actually be worse than estimated because of worsening inequalities. International organisations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the International Labour Organization have also warned about rising inequalities in several countries including India due to the pandemic. Made worse now Inequalities in India have been high even in the pre-COVID-19 period. The economic shock due to the pandemic has been much more severe for the country for two reasons. First, pre-COVID-19, the economy was already slowing down, compounding existing problems of unemployment, low incomes, rural distress, malnutrition, and widespread inequality. Second, India’s large informal sector is particularly vulnerable. Inequalities were increasing earlier also but the pandemic has widened them further. For example, the share of wages declined as compared to that of profits. The big companies and a large part of the corporate sector could manage the pandemic. The quarterly net profit of the BSE200 companies reached a record high of Rs. 1.67 trillion in the third quarter of FY21 and was up by 57% year-on-year. But the informal sector and workers have suffered a lot with loss of incomes and employment in the last one year. In other words, the recovery is more k-shaped with rising inequalities. The economy recovered in the third quarter of FY21 with a positive GDP growth of 0.4% as compared to minus 24.4% in the first quarter and minus 7.3% in the second quarter. For the year FY21, the economy would contract by 8%. GDP growth is likely to increase by 10%-11% in FY22. But the levels of GDP show that it will grow only around 1.1% in FY22 as compared to FY20 levels. According to the Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy, the employment rate is still 2.5 percentage points lower now as compared to the level before the lockdown last year. Women lost more jobs and many are out of the workforce. Inequalities have increased in health care and education. A three-step plan As the British economist Anthony Atkinson says, “much is written about the 1 per cent and the 99 per cent. But, if we are serious about reducing income inequality, what can be done?” Reduction in inequalities is important for its own sake and for improving demand which can raise private investment, consumption and exports for higher and sustainable economic growth. We concentrate here on a three-pronged approach for reducing inequalities. These are: focus on employment and wages; raising human development, and quasi universal basic income and other social safety nets. First, creation of quality or productive employment is central to the inclusive growth approach. At the macro level, the investment rate which declined from 39% in 2011-12 to 31.7% in 2018-19 has to be improved. Investment in infrastructure including construction can create employment. In the recent Budget, the central government has rightly focused on capital expenditure for infrastructure. There are seven challenges in employment: creating productive jobs for seven to eight million per year; correcting the mismatch between demand and supply of labour (only 2.3% of India’s workforce has formal skill training as compared to 96% in South Korea, 80% in Japan, and 52% in the United States; Structural change challenge (manufacturing should be the engine of growth. Here, labour-intensive exports are important and manufacturing and services are complementary); focusing on micro, small & medium enterprises and informal sectors including rights of migrants; Getting ready for automation and technology revolution; Social security and decent working conditions for all; raising real wages of rural and urban workers and guaranteeing minimum wages. Fixing dichotomies The second approach is in creating equality of opportunity by improving human development. Increasing public expenditure on health and education is another form of redistributive measure. COVID-19 has supplied us several lessons on the health sector. Public expenditure on health is only 1.5% of GDP. Apart from spending on vaccines and other related measures, we need to move towards universal health care and spend 2%-3% of GDP on health. Education and health achievements are essential for reducing inequality of opportunities. Much dichotomy exists in both these sectors. In education, there are islands of excellence that can compete internationally even as a vast majority of masses of children are churned out with poor learning achievement. We also have the experience of a digital gap in education during the pandemic. One has to fix this dichotomy in health and education. The third approach is in providing a quasi-universal basic income and other safety nets. For example, C. Rangarajan and I had suggested three proposals on minimum income for the poor and the vulnerable in the post-pandemic period. These are: cash transfers to all women above the age of 20 years; expanding the number of days provided under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and a national employment guarantee scheme for urban areas. In all these proposals, there is no problem of identification. A combination of cash transfers and an expanded guarantee scheme would provide income support to the needy. Apart from the ideas above, increasing farmers’ income especially for small and marginal farmers is needed to reduce inequalities and create demand. Farmer producer organisations should be strengthened. States have to be given a bigger role in agri-marketing reforms. The terms of trade for agriculture have to be improved. Tax base, budgets Enhancing tax and non-tax revenues of the government is needed to spend on the above priorities. The tax/GDP ratio has to be raised, with a wider tax base. Richer sections have to pay more taxes. Similarly, the inequalities between the Centre and States in finances should be reduced. State budgets must be strengthened to improve capital expenditures on physical infrastructure and spending on health, education and social safety nets. Apart from economic factors, non-economic factors such as deepening democracy and decentralisation can help in reducing inequalities. Unequal distribution of development is rooted in the inequalities of political, social and economic power. We have to find opportunities and spaces where the power can be challenged and redistributed. In the post-COVID-19 world, addressing inequality is important for higher and sustainable economic growth and the well-being of the population. S.

06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||In Kerala, the Church is a crucial political player||Going into the final lap of the Kerala Assembly election campaign, the million-dollar question is whether the Left Democratic Front (LDF) can buck the four-decade-old trend of the electorate voting out the government in the State. Even as pre-election surveys and opinion polls predict a second term for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the outcome would still depend on many factors, including the polarisation of Christian votes in central Kerala. While pollsters generally tend to take the Christian community as a monolith, or distinguish only between Syrian Christians and Latins, it is important to analyse the historic role played by the Syro-Malabar Church in Kerala politics to establish the root cause of this vote shift. Switching of loyalties Syrian Christians, or Saint Thomas Christians, are further divided into the Syro-Malabar Church (Catholics), the Jacobite, Orthodox and Mar Thoma factions of the Malankara Rite, apart from the Protestants. The long-standing dispute between the Jacobite and Orthodox factions had been sought to be capitalised on by both the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kerala for a while, but it is the tectonic shift in the political stance of the numerically strong Syro-Malabar Church which jolted the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) in the preceding local body polls. The significance of the switching of loyalties of the Syro-Malabar Church needs to be underscored by the fact that it has been a crucial political player in the State right from the 1950s. In fact, the Catholic Church was at the vanguard of the Vimochana Samaram (Liberation Struggle) which felled the first E.M.S. Namboodiripad-led Communist Party of India (CPI) government. The formation of the Kerala Congress, the Congress breakaway party, in 1964, was the first instance of the Church ditching the Congress in Kerala. But when the Congress split at the national level in 1969 and Youth Congress leaders such as A.K. Antony and Vayalar Ravi assumed leadership of the party with their progressive policies in Kerala, the Church went back to supporting the Kerala Congress. When the Kerala Congress joined the Congress-CPI alliance government led by C. Achutha Menon in 1975 during the Emergency, it backed that government, and its support for Congress has continued since. Even as recently as the tenure of the previous LDF government led by V.S. Achuthanandan, the Church and the CPI(M) were at each other’s throats, with then Education Minister M.A. Baby regularly baiting the Church. However, some developments during the latter half of the tenure of the Achuthanandan government led to a gradual change in this equation. The Kerala Congress faction led by P.J. Joseph was increasingly getting marginalised in the LDF and the 2008 delimitation exercise saw Malappuram district, the stronghold of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), getting additional seats. The IUML had been politically isolated in Kerala politics until 1967 when the Left gave it political representation. The party made steady progress in extending its clout. Post the 2008 delimitation exercise, the Syro-Malabar Church took the initiative to broker a truce between the Kerala Congress factions of K.M. Mani and P.J. Joseph leading to their merger in 2010 to try and ensure parity with the IUML in their political representation in the UDF. However, the Congress refused to concede extra seats to the unified Kerala Congress and the merged party ended up contesting much fewer seats than the IUML in the 2011 Assembly polls. In that close election, the UDF prevailed over the LDF. The IUML, which had a good strike rate compared to other parties, demanded a fifth ministerial position, thereby breaking the power equations prevailing in the UDF. Not only did IUML’s flexing of muscles have an impact on the majority community, it also riled the Church which saw the once dominant Kerala Congress, a party it identified with, being reduced to a small player in the UDF. Nevertheless, as the Congress had the advantage of being in power in New Delhi, it managed to keep things in check for the time being. Following the Congress’s ouster at the Centre and the UDF’s loss in Kerala in 2016, stray cases of Christian girls running away with their partners to join the Islamic State began to occupy the minds of the clergy and the BJP’s high-pitched ‘love jihad’ campaign began to resonate with the Church during this period. This phase also coincided with a steep fall in prices for rubber, a crop synonymous with the Syrian Christian community in central Kerala, and an increase in Gulf remittances and growing affluence among the Muslim community.  Fear of IUML domination Meanwhile, the Kerala Congress also came out of the UDF and the ball was set rolling for the party’s LDF entry before the next election. With K.M. Mani’s demise, the official faction was led by Jose K. Mani, his son, and joined forces with the LDF. This brought the Church closer to the Communists. For a long time, K.M. Mani was the Church’s pointsman in the UDF. His demise meant that the UDF no longer had a line of communication open with the Church. The Congress’s tactic to bring Oommen Chandy, hailing from the Orthodox faction, to the forefront in the run-up to the Assembly election had absolutely no impact on the Church whatsoever as Mr. Chandy no longer enjoyed the Church’s trust. The wresting of three extra seats by the IUML in the UDF, up from 24 in 2016 to 27 in 2021, further raised the hackles of the Church even as the P.J Joseph-led Kerala Congress faction had to settle for just 10 seats. Meanwhile, the LDF was magnanimous in allotting more seats to the Jose K. Mani-led Kerala Congress faction, sending a clear signal to the Church that its representative in the LDF would get decent accommodation. An article by a key IUML leader in the party organ on Hagia Sophia’s re-opening as a mosque in Turkey and the Congress’s confused response on the issue of reservations for economically weaker sections following IUML’s posturing had exacerbated the Church’s schism with the UDF even before the local body polls. The LDF’s win defying all predictions in those polls was clearly aided by the Christian vote shift away from the UDF in Central Travancore, among other factors. The Church reckons that it is in its interest to back the LDF this time around. Its fear of IUML dominating the UDF is also parroted by the LDF propagating this theory with abandon. The UDF is the ultimate loser here as any polarisation in its Christian vote will upset its plans of coming back to power. The Congress hasn’t also helped its cause by failing to open a channel of communication with the Church following K.M. Mani’s demise. Unless the laity chooses to defy the Church in large numbers, the UDF will end up paying a heavy price for failing to arrest matters following the setback in the local body polls.

06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. and China need each other||U.S. President Joe Biden has called Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean President Kim Jong-un “thugs”, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan an “autocrat” and Russian President Vladimir Putin a “killer”. Like individuals, nations too are prone to using epithets, but are vexed when paid back in similar coinage. Therefore, the U.S.-China Foreign Ministers’ meeting in March at Alaska was instructive in many respects. The public is accustomed to read-outs about conversations between international leaders. These often portray a righteous West instructing the world on how to behave by constructing a media narrative for the domestic audience. It cannot be assumed that foreign leaders who receive diatribes from western counterparts listen penitently without response. It is noteworthy that there are few read-outs of conversations between non-western leaders, who do not pontificate and have no global media at their disposal. Confrontation and competition Former U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of unfair trade practices and pursued a dual policy of offering deals and threatening sanctions, but China continued to extend its influence and counter American increases in military funding by expanding its own military power. The U.S. and Europe have imposed sanctions against China, Russia and others. The U.S.-sponsored Quad with Japan, India and Australia will prove an uphill effort because even some of the U.S.’s formal allies have re-shaped their foreign and economic relations with China. Confrontation and competition between the U.S. and China will dominate this century. Mr. Biden has censured China for human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, aggression in the South and East China Seas, intimidation of Taiwan, intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and cyberattacks, but these homilies are incidental to U.S.-China tension, which is due to China’s rise that is transforming power settings and the U.S.’s attempts to constrict China before it becomes a peer competitor. China will surpass the U.S. as the world’s largest economy, has established a worldwide network of economic ties and set up multilateral and financial institutions like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, New Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to compete with the West-dominated International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Sharp exchanges Preliminaries for the Alaska meeting were not promising: Beijing saw it as the start of a strategic dialogue, while Washington diminished it as a one-off event. The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, hoping to seize the initiative, opened the meeting with a charge sheet against China, comprising attacks on values; threats to a rules-based order that maintains global stability; China’s actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan; cyberattacks on the U.S.; and economic coercion against U.S. allies. To this, Chinese Communist Party leader Yang Jiechi countered that China would strongly oppose interference in China’s internal affairs, referred to the U.S.’s struggling democracy and poor treatment of minorities, and criticised U.S. policies as seeking military and financial hegemony to impose extra-territorial jurisdiction and suppress other countries. He concluded that the U.S. abuses definitions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges. These sharp exchanges were intended for respective domestic audiences. The American media were bewildered about how to portray this accusation of their country’s policies and resorted to calling the Chinese position intemperate. Despite the bombast, the Americans require the Chinese to deal with certain issues, and the meeting ended with anodyne agreement to work together on issues like climate change, COVID-19, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and G-20, health, cyber-security, the Iran nuclear issue, Afghanistan, Korea and Myanmar. The U.S.-China rhetoric masks the reality that both countries need each other not only for world stability but growth, supply chains, jobs, services, investments and market access. China’s rise generated booms for numerous Asian and Western economies and accelerated the transition of the U.S. towards the lower end of manufacturing.  Sanctions used indiscriminately against China are unlikely to engender any change of behaviour, and it is clear that hectoring will not be left unanswered. The U.S. deals for the first time with an economic and military rival it cannot browbeat, and economic interdependence today makes the war of words confined to words. Mr. Putin correctly summed up this situation: “They (the Americans) think that we are like them, but we are different. We have a different genetic, cultural and moral code.” With the prevailing mistrust across regions, every possible solution becomes an insuperable problem.

06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Free and unhindered justice||It is ironic that it has taken a pandemic to acknowledge the significance of fair and equal access to the Supreme Court, or the lack thereof. While the lockdown limited people’s movements, it opened new vistas for litigants and lawyers across India to approach, through technology, the country’s highest court with relative ease. It is no wonder then that despite demands for a return to physical hearings by the Bar in Delhi, there are calls for virtual access to the Supreme Court to continue. Increasing reach Even at the time the Constitution was being debated by the Constituent Assembly, geographical access to the Supreme Court was flagged as a concern. The B.R. Ambedkar-led Drafting Committee was nevertheless of the view that the Court must have a specified place of sitting and that litigants should “know where to go and whom to approach”. However, the framers of the Constitution agreed that the volume of litigation from different parts of the country may require the Supreme Court to increase its reach and hold court elsewhere. Accordingly, in recognition of the same, the Constitution empowered the Chief Justice to hold sittings of the Supreme Court through Circuit Benches in places other than Delhi as well. However, despite an increasing caseload and repeated pleas by litigants and governments, successive Chief Justices have refused to invoke this constitutional power for reasons best known to them. In India, given the unified, single-pyramidal structure of the judicial system, all types of cases can potentially make their way to the Supreme Court, irrespective of the place or forum of the original institution. It is the effective exercise of that right, however, that is curtailed by the court assembling exclusively in Delhi. According to a report by the Centre for Policy Research, a disproportionately high number of cases filed in the Supreme Court originated in High Courts closer to Delhi. For instance, cases from States like West Bengal, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, which collectively account for around a fifth of India’s total population, contribute to less than 10% of the court’s docket. On the other hand, almost 18% of all cases in the Supreme Court originate from Punjab and Haryana, with less than 5% of the total population share. Geographical constraints have also meant that appearing before the Supreme Court has inescapably become the domain of a select few lawyers in and around Delhi. Such implied exclusivity consequently translates into steep and often prohibitive monetary costs for litigants. Without the option of a local advocate of their choice, litigants are forced to choose from what the Bar in Delhi offers, both in terms of quality and costs. A Court for everyone Thus, the pandemic, although for different reasons, has compelled the Supreme Court to attempt to overcome physical constraints in an effort to increase access, albeit virtually. Over the past year, with virtual hearings, what was seen as the exclusive domain of a limited number of lawyers in Delhi has opened up to advocates from all over India, most of whom could only ever have dreamt of addressing the Supreme Court in their lifetimes. Litigants now have the option to engage a local lawyer of their own choice and convenience, including the same lawyer who argued their case before the lower court. Indeed, virtual hearings may not be the perfect alternative, but such imperfections must be preferred over a denial of the right to access justice itself. It is only when each person in India is provided unhindered access to its corridors can the Supreme Court be said to have fulfilled its constitutional promise. More than one Law Commission and Parliamentary Committee have recommended Circuit Benches of the Supreme Court to be set up around the country. Nonetheless, till the judiciary acts on such proposals, virtual hearings should be allowed to continue, if not as a matter of right, then at least as a matter of just and equitable policy. Anhad S.

06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||South phase||The States of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, along with the Union Territory of Puducherry, are going to the polls today after an extremely competitive campaign. Voting in all 234 Assembly constituencies in Tamil Nadu and 140 in Kerala is taking place in a single phase. In T.N. and Kerala, the DMK and the Congress respectively, can ill-afford to lose another election. The AIADMK government in T.N. is seeking a third straight mandate while the CPI(M)-led LDF government in Kerala is seeking a second consecutive term. After being out of power for 10 years, the DMK hopes to be back in the saddle in T.N. Meanwhile, there is a search for new alignments in both States. The fragmentation of Dravidian politics, following the passing of Jayalalithaa of the AIADMK and M. Karunanidhi of the DMK, has opened up possibilities. Actor-turned politician Kamal Haasan and film-maker and Tamil nationalist Seeman also fancy their chances as they jostle for space in the changed scenario. Though the BJP is far from gaining a foothold in either State, its looming influence is evident in the resonance of religious appeals in the public sphere. In Kerala, the BJP and the Congress promised to keep the Sabarimala shrine out of bounds for women of menstruating age citing tradition while the LDF quietened its stance fearing a Hindu backlash. A constituent of the LDF said ‘love jihad’ was a matter of concern; in T.N., the DMK sought to give itself a makeover as a party not antithetical to customs and traditions. In the rivalry between the Dravidian camps in T.N., the Congress used to be the swing power. Whether it retains that role is to be seen. With Rahul Gandhi’s personal fortunes too at stake, the ripples of its performance in Kerala will be felt for the Congress across the country. The campaigns in T.N. and Kerala were thankfully not centred around communalism, but misogynistic statements by representatives of progressive parties were unfortunate. Parties and the people must put a cost on leaders who make offensive statements. All parties in both States appeared to support welfarism through various modes, but less attention was paid to discussing economic and development issues. Unless the focus is on growth, the incoming governments in both T.N. and Kerala may find the present welfarism unsustainable. The role of the central agencies during the campaign was controversial for several reasons. True, it is their duty to investigate illegal activities, but if they do so in a manner that seemingly helps the ruling party at the Centre and constrains its political opponents during the campaign, the election gets vitiated. The Election Commission of India must take note of this increasing unhealthy trend, and do what is essential to ensure a level-playing field in elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/south-phase/article34249182.ece
06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Persistent mindlessness||The deaths of over 20 paramilitary personnel in an encounter with the Maoists in the Tarrem area near Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district once again puts the spotlight on the long-running conflict in this remote tribal region. Reports indicate a Maoist ambush of the paramilitary personnel from different units – the Special Task Force, the District Reserve Guard of the Chhattisgarh police besides the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)’s elite COBRA unit — who had proceeded to perform combing operations in Maoist strongholds. The units had embarked upon their combing exercise at a time when Maoists were trying to disrupt the construction of a road near Silger-Jagargunda. The lack of road and telecommunications infrastructure in these remote areas has been one of the reasons for the Maoists being able to use the terrain to their advantage. Questions will be asked as to how such a large force failed to anticipate the ambush and were attacked by insurgents reportedly belonging to the Maoists’ “1st Battalion” led by a tribal, Hidma. The encounter has raised the number of security forces killed in Bastar to more than 175 since the killing of 76 CRPF personnel in the Chintalnar attack in April 2010. It is now quite clear that despite facing losses to its cadre and leadership across central and east India and being hemmed into possibly its only remaining stronghold of south Chhattisgarh, the Maoists are still a formidable military threat. The Maoist insurrection which began first as the Naxalite movement in the 1970s and then intensified since 2004, following the merger of two prominent insurgent groups, remains a mindless guerrilla-driven militant movement that has failed to gain adherents beyond those living in remote tribal areas either untouched by welfare or are discontents due to state repression. The Maoists are now considerably weaker than a decade ago, with several senior leaders either dead or incarcerated, but their core insurgent force in south Bastar remains intact. The recourse to violence is now little more than a ploy to invite state repression which furthers their aim of gaining new adherents. While the Indian state has long since realised that there cannot only be a military end to the conflict, the Chhattisgarh government’s inability to reach out to those living in the Maoist strongholds remains a major hurdle, which has resulted in a protracted but violent stalemate in the area. The Tarrem attacks came in the wake of a recent peace march held by civil society activists who had urged a dialogue between the Maoists and the Chhattisgarh government to end the violence that has claimed more than 10,000 lives since 2000 alone, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal. While a military response and recriminations will inevitably follow the ambush, the civil society plea must not be ignored if a long-lasting solution to the conflict is to be achieved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/persistent-mindlessness/article34249183.ece

A PTI correspondent, who visited Kushtia town, 120 km from here yesterday, found the liberation forces heavily guarding the bridge with an anti-aircraft gun and a contingent of 60 men on each side of it. The correspondent who reached Kushtia via Shikarpur and Pragpur also witnessed heavy bullet marks on several buildings in the town, including those of the police lines, zilla school, wireless centre and dak bungalow. Returning via Varamara, he came by roads blocked by felled trees and static goods wagons at the railway crossing. Meanwhile, Mr. Jaharul Haque Raja Miah, Awami League member of the East Bengal Provincial Assembly from Varamara, told the correspondent that the district was under the full control of the League. He said the League authorities of the district had issued an order to all government employees of the area to resume their duties by April 5, failing which they would be severely penalised to the extent of termination of service or even capital punishment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/bridge-over-padma-safe/article34249193.ece

Ltd. have jointly developed a software that helps automate the legal and bureaucratic part of the patent process for intellectual property developed by Indian academicians in large and small institutes. The software is not only better suited for the use of academicians, but also comes at a fraction of the cost of software developed outside India — which was the only choice available until now. “Such a solution that is customised or can be customised to Indian academic needs, at a price point that is affordable does not exist,” said Srinivasan Raghavan, chair, Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, IISc. Work on the software, named ProrIISe, was initiated when he was heading the Intellectual Property and Technological Licensing section (IPTeL) of the institute, in 2016. Since then, the software has been tested for more than three years at the IISc itself, to the satisfaction of its faculty. Govindan Rangarajan, director, IISc, said the feedback from faculty had been ‘highly positive,’ and ‘they appreciated having everything logged in one place.’ Kaustubh Karandikar, a director at Prorigo Software, said the solution would cost about a few lakh rupees. Version 2.0 of the software, which is slated for release in 2021, would automate the financial part also.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/iisc-prorigo-build-software-to-automate-legal-process-for-ip/article34249163.ece
06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Flexible inflation targeting working well, says FinMin||The flexible inflation targeting monetary policy regime has been successful in leashing the inflation rate within a range along with providing a favourable environment for economic growth, the finance ministry said, explaining its decision to stick to the same ‘tried and tested’ model. The government last week retained the 4% inflation target with upper and lower tolerance bounds of 6% and 2% respectively, adopted first in 2016, for the five-year period from April 2021 to March 2026. While the repo rate dipped from 6.5% in October 2016 to 4% by March 2021, headline inflation averaged 3.9% during this period compared with 7.5% during 2013-16, the ministry pointed out. The flexible inflation targeting led to a decline in price fluctuations, halved the volatility of core inflation, and moderated the median inflation expectations of urban households over a one-year ahead horizon. Volatility in interest rate and exchange rate also decreased during 2017-20, the ministry said in its monthly economic report for March. “Until the pre-COVID period, there was only one occasion [Q4 of 2019-20] when inflation exceeded the upper tolerance level,” the ministry said. “The breach was due to a sharp spike in food inflation [9.7%] on a combination of adverse developments, i.e., the late withdrawal of the monsoon, unseasonal rains and associated supply disruptions,” the ministry added.

After plunging more than 1,400 points earlier in the day, the 30-share BSE index pared some losses to finish at 49,159.32, down 870.51 points, or 1.74%. The broader NSE Nifty sank 229.55 points, or 1.54%, to 14,637.80. Top laggard Bajaj Finance was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, plunging about 6%, followed by IndusInd Bank, SBI, M&M, Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto and ICICI Bank. On the other hand, HCL Tech, TCS and Infosys were among the gainers. “The market witnessed a huge sell-off today as India’s second wave of COVID-19 is getting bigger than anticipated and is expected to ruin the pace of economic recovery,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services. “High valuation added further concern due to a possible downgrade in Q1 earnings,” Mr. Nair added. A policy decision in the upcoming MPC announcement and Q4 earnings will define the market volatility in the coming days, he said. The rise in COVID-19 cases in India is a sobering reminder that challenges to recovery still remain, said Lalitabh Srivastava, AVP research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

06 April 2021||London,||Fakhar run-out stirs a hornet’s nest||Pakistan's Fakhar Zaman's run-out in the second One-Day International against South Africa has sparked a debate on spirit of the game with Marylebone Cricket Club saying it was "up to the umpires to decide" whether Quinton de Kock had attempted to mislead the batsman. In a stiff chase of 342, Fakhar smashed a spectacular 193 before being run-out in controversial fashion. The controversy Wicketkeeper de Kock pointed towards the bowler’s end, but Aiden Markram broke the stumps at the ’keeper's end with a direct hit. Fakhar had slowed down at the end of his second run and was out of his crease. Replays showed that de Kock had seemed to convince Fakhar into believing that the throw was going to the non-striker's end. "Law 41.5.1 states: It is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive or obstruct either batsman after the striker has received the ball," the MCC, custodians of the game, tweeted. The debate around de Kock's gesture was whether he was intentionally attempting to deceive Fakhar into thinking that the throw was headed for the other end, leading to the batsman slowing down. Many in Pakistan cricket circles blamed de Kock for "deliberately distracting" Fakhar, leading to his dismissal. Former captain Waqar Younis and fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar have raised questions on Twitter. ‘My fault’ However, Fakhar, who made the highest score by a batsman in an ODI chase, refused to blame de Kock. "The fault was mine as I was too busy looking out for Haris Rauf at the other end. I felt he'd started off a little late from his crease, so I thought he was in trouble. “The rest is up to the match referee, but I don't think it's Quinton's fault," he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fakhar-run-out-stirs-a-hornets-nest/article34249326.ece
06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Can CSK rise from unaccustomed darkness to more familiar light?||Hauling yourself up from a hole is never easy. It not just examines the strength and flexibility of your frame as you try to emerge from the dark pit but also asks questions of your character. Chennai Super Kings, following a disastrous 13th edition, finds itself in a similar situation. It has to plug the holes that punctured its campaign the last time around and present a fresh outfit that can land weighty blows. CSK has the ability to hit back under its charismatic skipper M.S. Dhoni. And do so hard. Addressing the issue Batting was a major problem area for CSK last season and the franchise has addressed the issue. Crucially, Suresh Raina, the franchise’s most successful batsman, is back. His shock departure ahead of the last IPL hurt the side. The left-handed Raina at No. 3 will provide the innings the momentum it requires. But then, he hasn’t played much cricket of late. In fact, several CSK cricketers suffer from the same drawback and this is a worry for the franchise. Simulating match situations and the CSK players dividing themselves into two teams in practice games are two quick-fix solutions. The smooth-stroking Ruturaj Gaikwad, a ‘find’ for CSK last season, could open with the more explosive Moeen Ali. One of the two big buys along with K. Gowtham for CSK this season — both off-spinning all-rounders — Moeen will also lend variety to the attack and be handy against southpaws. CSK has roped in the experienced heavy hitter Robin Uthappa. He adds value to the side along with the strokeful Ambati Rayudu. It will be interesting where CSK slots Faf du Plessis, among Dhoni’s favourites for his commitment. He could be asked to surface in the middle-order and shore it up in the event of a crisis.  And Dhoni’s form will be critical for CSK. He is someone who can surprise the doubters. The pulling out of Aussie paceman Josh Hazlewood is a blow; Lungi Ngidi too will miss early games. However, Sam Curran and Dwayne Bravo are capable seamers who can also lend batting depth. And the Indian duo of Deepak Chahar and Shardul Thakur are wicket-taking pacemen. Mitchell Santner, the left-arm spinning all-rounder, can be used better by CSK. Imran Tahir and Karn Sharma are the leg-spinners. CSK is a well rounded side but the wheels have to move in cohesion.   X-Factor   Sam Curran: An impact player, the 22-year-old Curran can leave the opposition bleeding. A left-arm swing bowler who operates with verve and an attacking lower middle-order batsman whose astonishing 95 not out for England almost derailed India in the recent ODI series decider. He’s got shock value.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/can-csk-rise-from-unaccustomed-darkness-to-more-familiar-light/article34249278.ece
06 April 2021||MUMBAI,||Rajput seeks reinstatement of CIC||Lalchand Rajput, who was involved in a bitter tussle with the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) office-bearers during his brief stint as the chairman of the Cricket Improvement Committee (CIC), has filed a complaint to the MCA Ombudsman, (retd.) Justice Vijaya Tahilramani, alleging wrongful termination of the CIC and requesting reinstatement of the three-member committee. Rajput, the former India opener and a reputed coach, was appointed in the CIC on August 20 last year, along with former Test cricketers Raju Kulkarni and Sameer Dighe. The CIC is authorised to appoint coaches and selectors of various Mumbai teams. New committee After being at loggerheads with office-bearers over the appointment of Mumbai senior men’s selectors and coaches, the CIC was dissolved by the MCA office-bearers in February and a new committee was constituted. Pointing out in his complaint that only the AGM, and not office-bearers or apex council, has the right to appoint the CIC, Rajput’s petition, accessed by The Hindu , alleges MCA has “followed the unethical and illegal process of appointing a new CIC by dissolving on the same day without any power of doing the same and thus they have violated the MCA constitution.” Rajput has also complained against the MCA secretaries of interfering in the CIC’s working and has requested the Ombudsman to refrain them from doing so in future. Besides, Rajput has also sought to stay new CIC and other cricket-related appointments. He has requsted the Ombudsman for seven “immediate interim actions” including reinstating his CIC, declaring “the appointment of of New CIC under the chairmanship of Jatin Paranjape invalid till next AGM” and to stay “new appointment for Mumbai team in any category”. Ever since the MCA appointed Justice Tahilramani on March 24, Rajput’s is the second major complaint filed to the Ombudsman. On March 31, Ravi Mandrekar, representative of the Gaud Saraswat Cricket Club, had filed complained against alleged improprieties in awarding maintenance and repair works contracts for the Wankhede Stadium amounting in excess of Rs. 7 crore. MCA suspends local cricket A day after the State government ordered closure of all sports complexes and grounds, except for the IPL, till April 30, the MCA has suspended all the tournaments and player registration till further notice. It was announced through the association’s website on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rajput-seeks-reinstatement-of-cic/article34249788.ece
06 April 2021||Madrid,||Will Liverpool exact revenge on Real?||Liverpool’s last dance with Real Madrid ended in painful defeat, with Madrid snaring a 14th European triumph in the 2018 Champions League final. A year later Liverpool hoisted the Champions League trophy. But that high has been followed by a fall from grace as Liverpool prepares to face Real again in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal in Madrid on Tuesday. Jurgen Klopp’s men are in a scrap just to make it into next season’s Champions League via a top-four finish in the Premier League. Injury toll Injuries have taken their toll. Captain Jordan Henderson and centre-backs Virgil Van Dijk, Joe Gomez, Joel Matip will all miss both legs of the Real tie and are unlikely to play again this season. However, there could yet be a happy ending to a difficult season after Liverpool’s comprehensive win at Arsenal in the Premier League. Real might have taken more comfort from Liverpool’s problems were it not confronting its own period of introspection. Since winning a third consecutive Champions League three years ago, the team has stalled, a failure to update and refresh seeing it tumble down the European pecking order. Tried and trusted For now, Zinedine Zidane will turn again to his tried and trusted for the first leg at Valdebebas, with Luka Modric, Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Karim Benzema all three years older than the last time they played Liverpool.  Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund is experiencing another bout of reflection, self-criticism and doubt just before it takes on Manchester City. It has become a regular occurrence at the club in recent seasons, and usually strikes when everything appears to be going well, with Dortmund’s Bundesliga loss to Eintracht Frankfurt over the weekend leaving it outside Champions League qualification spots. Dortmund will look to Erling Braut Haaland to carry it past his father’s old club. Haaland has scored in each of his six appearances and is the competition’s top-scorer with 10 goals. He will be keen to add to that tally but he cannot do it alone. City meanwhile will arrive for the game fresh as manager Pep Guardiola made six changes over the weekend in the league win over Leicester. With no big injury worries, City should enter the game as favourites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/will-liverpool-exact-revenge-on-real/article34249328.ece
06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Aces Awards: the stars who picked the winners||The first-ever virtual ceremony of the Sportstar Aces Awards was successfully held between April 1 and 4. The annual event had 31 winners, across sporting disciplines. The winners were selected by a jury headed by World Cup-winning batting maestro Sunil Gavaskar. The other jury members were Olympic gold medal-winning former hockey player M.M. Somaya, nine-time National badminton champion Aparna Popat, five-time World chess champion Viswanathan Anand, Commonwealth Games gold medal-winning shooter Anjali Bhagwat and veteran Indian footballer Bhaichung Bhutia. “The experience of jury discussions virtually was certainly different, but under the leadership of Mr. Gavaskar, we were able to have a meaningful debate and arrive at our winners this year,” said Bhutia, the newest member of the jury, describing his experience. “The decision-making process was tough and it's a good problem to have. Being athletes ourselves, we know the amount of hard work these players put in. Picking one over the other was harder than you would imagine,” said Popat. “A lot of data was made available to the jury, courtesy the Sportstar and The Hindu team, and it made our jobs easier,” noted Somaya. “We considered the possibility of sharing the awards for a few categories — it goes to show you the level of competition this time,” said Bhagwat. Gavaskar listed the categories rewarding corporates, public sector undertakings and States as the hardest ones to adjudicate. “It's difficult to assess the impact of corporates, PSUs or State on sport if you're not there in that State or area of work to see it for yourself. So, these three were definitely the hardest to pick,” he said. With the award process having ended, Anand is optimistic about India sustaining performances at the highest level, especially in 2021 which has a packed itinerary. “What I'd like to see is India excelling in sports we don't do much in. The more sports I'm surprised by, the happier I'll be,” said Anand, who had recused himself from decision-making during the jury meet for the two categories he was nominated for.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/aces-awards-the-stars-who-picked-the-winners/article34249274.ece
06 April 2021||MUMBAI,||Maharashtra government gives permission for Mumbai matches||On a day when severe restrictions were imposed all over Maharashtra to curb the COVID-19 outbreak, the Government of Maharashtra made an exception for the Mumbai leg of the IPL. The Wankhede Stadium is scheduled to host 10 matches, including three afternoon games, from April 10 to 25. With a Statewide night curfew to be implemented from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. till April 30, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had sought special permission to allow matches to be conducted and the training of other teams to be held. Besides, the BCCI had also requested vehicular movement for the teams, broadcast crew and staff involved in the league. “Accordingly, permission is being hereby accorded for the said request subject to scrupulous adherence to the bio-bubble,” Srirang Gholap, Under-Secretary of the Disaster Management, Relief and Rehabilitation department, wrote in a letter to the BCCI on Monday. The letter, accessed by The Hindu , states that the teams will train at the Cricket Club of India and Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA). The four teams that will play in Mumbai have been training at the CCI, MCA’s facility at Bandra Kurla Complex besides Jio Stadium and Dr. D.Y. Patil Sports Stadium, both in Navi Mumbai. Two more test positive Meanwhile, two more staffers at the Wankhede Stadium have tested COVID-19 positive. It is learnt that a groundsman and a casual labourer have contracted the virus on Monday. A dozen MCA personnel at Wankhede have so far been found to be COVID-19 positive.

06 April 2021||Karachi,||Pakistan keen on revival of bilateral ties with India||Top officials of the cash-strapped Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) will push for revival of bilateral ties against India during the 47th FIH Congress in New Delhi next month. PHF officials will be taking up the issue of resuming bilateral series against India at neutral venues on the sidelines of the 47th International Hockey Federation (FIH) Statutory Congress. The meeting is scheduled from May 19 to 23 in the Indian capital. A top PHF official said it is an important meeting as the FIH president and executive board members will be elected for the next four years. “The meeting will give us an opportunity to talk to the Indian hockey federation officials on the possibility of reviving bilateral ties that could benefit Pakistan and India and the hockey followers in both countries,” he said. PHF president Brig (retd) Khalid Sajjad Khokhar and secretary Asif Bajwa are preparing to fly out for the meeting and have already applied for Indian visas. Neutral venues The official said that Pakistan is keen to revive bilateral series even at neutral venues as it is badly in need of finances and believes only a series with India can allow it to earn good money from broadcasting rights, sponsors, advertisers etc. Pakistan and India have not had any bilateral hockey ties in the last decade and PHF officials want to “convince their Indian counterparts of the financial benefits for both federations” from playing against each other. He recalled that 10 years ago both Pakistan and India were regularly playing home and away series.

06 April 2021||Madrid,||LaLiga title race split wide open||Atletico Madrid stumbled again in LaLiga on Sunday as it was beaten 1-0 by Sevilla. Marcos Acuna headed in the winner for Sevilla at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, with Atletico’s grip on first place loosening even further and its in-form rivals primed to take advantage. It means Spain’s title race suddenly appears wide open, two months after Atletico sat 10 points clear of both Barcelona and Real Madrid, with a game in hand. It has managed only four wins in 12 games since then, with defeats to Chelsea costing it its place in the Champions League and regular slips in LaLiga potentially squandering its shot at the title.  Sevilla deserved its victory and it might have been more comfortable had Lucas Ocampos not missed a first-half penalty. Manchester United came from behind to beat Brighton 2-1 on Sunday to cut Manchester City’s lead at the top of the Premier League to 14 points. Not for the first time this season, United needed a second-half fightback after a dismal first 45 minutes to take all three points thanks to goals from Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood.  The results:   Premier League: Aston Villa 3 (Trezeguet 78, 81, Watkins 87) bt Fulham 1 (Mitrovic 61); Manchester United 2 (Rashford 62, Greenwood 83) bt Brighton 1 (Welbeck 13).   LaLiga: Elche 1 (Milla Pena 36) drew with Real Betis 1 (Iglesias 14-pen); Cadiz 2 (Cala 14, Mauro 88) bt Valencia 1 (Gameiro 19); Sevilla 1 (Acuna 70) bt Atletico Madrid 0.

06 April 2021||Buenos Aires,||Harmanpreet confident ahead of Argentina tour||Confident that the Indian hockey team is capable of troubling the reigning Olympic champion Argentina, vice-captain Harmanpreet Singh says they will utilise the tour of the South American nation to build momentum ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. The 22-member Indian team arrived here last week for the six-match tour against the Olympic champion. Four practice matches The tour includes four practice matches apart from back-to-back FIH Hockey Pro League matches against Argentina on April 11 and 12. Harmanpreet observed that adapting to the host nation’s style of play will be key to success for the Indian team. “Argentina’s style of play is slightly different compared to the teams we played in Europe," said Harmanpreet in a release issued by Hockey India. “We will certainly be using this tour as an opportunity to gather momentum ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. Teams around the world are trying to get as much match practice before the Olympics and we are no different. “We are grateful to be getting more games under our belt and need to make the most of it. To play the Olympic champions will be challenging but I believe we have the experience and the talent in our ranks to come out victorious,” he added.  In form He was in fine form during last month’s Europe tour, where the side finished unbeaten in what was its return to international hockey after COVID-forced break. “We are very happy with the way the Europe tour shaped up for us. Whether in quarantine or back home, the past year we worked hard on our fitness with high-intensity body-weight training in our rooms and I'm glad it paid off,” the drag-flicker said. “We have also worked on the tactical side of the game as well as our finishing. Hopefully, we can produce more good performances here in Argentina as well.” Encouraged by the 2-1 win over Argentina the last time they met (in the 2018 Champions Trophy in Breda), Harmanpreet believes India will give the hosts a run for their money in the upcoming matches. He also feels the return of senior players, including skipper Manpreet Singh, had added teeth to the squad. “I would say we are evenly matched in terms of quality. It is great to have the likes of Manpreet Singh and Rupinder Pal Singh back in the side. “The presence of senior, experienced players like them, who have seen many highs and lows in their careers, has only boosted the morale of the side,” Harmanpreet said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/harmanpreet-confident-ahead-of-argentina-tour/article34249322.ece

06 April 2021||Los Angeles,||Clippers thrash Lakers in LA showdown||Los Angeles Clippers didn’t have to lean heavily on its superstar duo against the defending NBA champion on Sunday, getting help from the supporting cast in a 104-86 rout of the short-handed Los Angeles Lakers. The Clippers got a game-high 22 points from Marcus Morris while All-Stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George finished with 19 and 16 points respectively. “We were great defensively. We set the tone early. We were physical and we got into bodies,” said Clippers coach Tyronn Lue. Stepping in Luke Kennard and Terance Mann have stepped in nicely to fill the void left by an injury to starting guard Patrick Beverley. It doesn’t get any easier for the Lakers. Sunday’s defeat was their final home game before embarking on a five-game road trip that begins on Tuesday against Toronto Raptors. The loss of James and Davis has jolted the Lakers season. James has been out two weeks nursing a right, high-ankle sprain suffered on March 20 against Atlanta Hawks. Davis has missed over two dozen games this season, the last 22 due to a strained right calf. They tried to fill the void by signing centre Andre Drummond, but he has not played since injuring his toe in his Lakers debut last Wednesday. Elsewhere, Zach LaVine scored a game-high 25 points as Chicago Bulls snapped a six-game losing skid with a 115-107 win over the under-manned Brooklyn Nets in Chicago.  The results: Atlanta Hawks 117 bt Golden State Warriors 111; Houston Rockets 115 lost to New Orleans Pelicans 122; Philadelphia 76ers 100 lost to Memphis Grizzlies 116.

06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The greatness of Yadu||Krishna’s leelas began even before the avatara began, said V.S. Karunakarachariar in a discourse. Parikshit refers to Yadu as the embodiment of dharma. Yadu was the first son of Yayaati, through Devayani, daughter of Sukracharya, guru of the asuras. Because of a quarrel, Devayani asked the asura king to make his daughter Sharmishtha her servant. Later Yayaati married Sharmishtha too. When Yayaati was cursed to become an old man, he asked Devayani’s eldest son Yadu to exchange his youth for Yayaati’s old age, but Yadu and his brothers refused. Sharmishtha’s son Puru agreed to his father’s request. Sons are classified into four — those who guess their father’s thoughts and act accordingly; those who guess a father’s wish from his body language; those who fulfil the father’s wishes when asked; and those who turn down their father’s request. Sons of the fourth category are looked down upon. Yadu belonged to the fourth category. How could Parikshit then refer to him in positive terms? The answer is simple. Would the Supreme One have chosen to be born in Yadu’s lineage, if it had not been a good one? Yadu’s refusal of Yayaati’s request made amends for Devayani’s ill treatment of Sharmishtha. Because of Yadu’s refusal, Yayaati made Sharmishtha’s son his successor. The greatness of Yadu had to be brought to the notice of the world. That is why the Lord decided to incarnate in this clan. Andal, in her ‘Ambarame, thanneere’ pasuram, says Nandagopa was generous. If the foster parent of Krishna were so generous, one can imagine the generosity of family in which He was born. Vedanta Desika’s kavya about Krishna is titled Yadavabhyudaya, to show the intention of the Lord in being born in the Yadu vamsa. This choice too is among His leelas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-greatness-of-yadu/article34249263.ece

06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The culture of fear||Anand Patwardhan’s Reason is like The Scream — it hollows you out. Edward Munch’s late 19th century work was the outcome of a moment of mind-numbing angst; Patwardhan’s was the outcome of the killings of social worker Dr. N.A. Dabholkar and Left-leaning politician Govind Pansare, both rationalists. Screened for the first time in India with English subtitles, the version with Hindi subtitles is already on YouTube. The 2018 documentary film is 218 minutes long, and is best watched with pauses — either after each of the chapters, to read about the incidents, or between the first and second segment (after the 95th minute). “I‘d like people to watch Reason on a big screen with good sound, preferably with some friends,” says Patwardhan, describing himself as a projectionist, “not just a filmmaker”. Excerpts from an edited interview: How did Reason get triggered? I knew Dr. Dabholkar personally and his murder in 2013 was shocking, but it was only after Comrade Govind Pansare was shot dead in 2015 in a strikingly similar way — both rationalists were gunned down while on their morning walk by men on motorcycles — did I decide to take up the camera. It felt like a war on reason and so we began to investigate. By the time the film concluded, Professor M.M. Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh were also killed in an almost identical manner. How long did the whole process of movie-making take?  Reason/Vivek took almost four years to shoot and edit and it no longer remained just about the murder of rationalists as we realised that a hate driven, largely upper-caste led majoritarian ideology that had begun over a century ago, was now rapidly growing in different parts of the country. When the OTT platforms declined to show the film, what were the reasons they cited? No OTT platform will ever admit on paper that they are afraid of being shut down and shunted out if they go anywhere near the truth. So they just say this is not what audiences want to see. In the past I took the government-controlled Doordarshan TV to court, and forced them to show my films on the twin grounds of “freedom of expression” and the “public’s right to information”. We won all our cases and many of my films were telecast by court order. These days that option is less effective. In the case of private players, it is the market, or at least the excuse of the market, that becomes the real censor. Do you fear for your life? I get asked this often, but the truth is, I don’t. Not because it is completely inconceivable, but because I have filmed people who are in far greater everyday danger than I am, and yet they never flinch from their duty to their own conscience. I belong to a privileged section of society and must use my privilege to act as a witness. I don’t have the right to be afraid to speak the truth as I see it. Reason will be streamed on April 11, 2.30 p.m. on in.bookmyshow.com; this will be followed by a discussion with noted musician T.M. Krishna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-culture-of-fear/article34249473.ece
06 April 2021||April 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Champion with a challenger mentality||Journey is a word that resonates with Bobby Lashley; it took the 44-year-old wrestling veteran 15-odd years before he could finally claim the WWE title — one of the two flagship titles the US-based wrestling promotion offers — as his. On March 1, 2021, Lashley — a hulk of a man whose intimidating physique has no relation whatsoever with the warm personality he exudes during a video interaction — beat The Miz to become WWE champion for the first time in his career. “You have to love the journey. Everything I did, leading up to this point, is what that got me here. So I have got to appreciate every step of the way,” he says. The talented grappler that he is, Lashley’s absence from WWE’s main event scene has for long confounded wrestling fans; the sport has a strong following online aided by the many industry dirt sheets that keep the speculations — about storylines, gossip and everything in between — flowing. Lashley agrees that he could have had the title years ago but “I was never one of the people who got upset” when things did not go his way. “I always asked myself what was I not doing right and so I kept training. I don’t think anyone on the [WWE] roster trains harder than me. Look, some things are out of my control but the one thing that is in my hands is how hard I work to get there. That is what I tell other people too. Never hang your head because if you are doing everything that you need to be doing, you cannot be denied,” Lashley says. Taking on a favourite But Lashley is not walking into WrestleMania — WWE’s annual flagship event — this year as a challenger. That label belongs to Drew McIntyre, the Scotsman who won the title last year takes on Lashley on day one (WrestleMania is scheduled as a two-day event due to COVID-19 restrictions). This year’s WrestleMania is also special for all the performers. To be held in the open roof Raymond James stadium in Tampa, Florida, it will be the first time in over a year that fans will be admitted to a live WWE event. Bobby Lashley punches the air when asked what it is like to be performing in front of fans again. “I take my hat off to the entire roster because we didn’t skip a beat when we were asked to go and perform in a building with no fans. A lot of guys in the locker room tell me that they can’t wait for the fans to be back and on social media, there are fans telling us that they can’t wait to go to a live event. I think it will be like a love story where we come together in an embrace at WrestleMania,” he says. Facing off against Brock When it is about WrestleMania, there tends to be speculation about which way a particular match goes, who would win the title. One such is the rumour about Lashley facing off against Brock Lesnar. One of the biggest draws in the wrestling business even in his part-time capacity, Lesnar has not been involved in any promotion so far nor has his involvement in any storyline been made public by the company. But the rumour mill refuses to stop. So what does Lashley think about facing off against Lesnar, someone with whom he has been routinely compared to due to similar bulking physiques? “I don’t know Brock. I have met him like once, and it was just in passing — a casual shake of hands. So the speculation... that is on the fans. But if this is what they want, I am willing to give it to them because I am the champ,” he says. Whether it is Brock or Drew, anyone wanting to lay their hands on the title that Lashley currently holds captive would have to do so after breaking ‘The Hurt Lock’ — a submission hold that the grappler employs to make his opponents quit, almost immediately. “When I put The Hurt Lock on, it is comical to me because it is the one time that I have to hold back a laugh. Once I snatch these guys, you could almost hear them go ‘Aaahh’ in this little, high pitch voice,” he laughs. “I can then feel the life coming out of their bodies. I felt it with Drew, I felt it with Sheamus and with Brawn Strowman, and those are three of the biggest, baddest people in the business. If those guys can’t break it, nobody can,” Lashley says, to which we ask — Not even Brock Lesnar? And pat comes the reply: “Not even Brock!”  Watch WrestleMania 37 LIVE on SONY TEN 1 (English) and SONY TEN 3 (Hindi) channels on April 11 and April 12, 2021 from 5.30 a.m.   Bobby Lashley will be facing Drew McIntyre on day one of WrestleMania 37||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/champion-with-a-challenger-mentality/article34249478.ece
06 April 2021||New Delhi,||SC stays corruption case against Yediyurappa||The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a Karnataka High Court order restoring a corruption complaint filed by a private investor against Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in connection with a housing project proposal for middle and low income groups on 26 acres of land in Bengaluru. In January, the Supreme Court had protected Mr. Yediyurappa from arrest on the basis of the complaint by A. Alam Pasha, alleging that the project was devised and suddenly withdrawn in 2011 to make “illegal monetary gain”. Mr. Pasha’s infrastructure development company had applied for the Rs. 600 crore project before it was withdrawn. Prior sanction In January, Mr. Yediyurappa had raised the question of law as to whether “a court can proceed under Prevention of Corruption Act against a public servant without prior sanction on the ground that he had allegedly demitted office which he was alleged to have abused”. On January 5, 2021, the High Court had restored the complaint filed by Mr. Pasha on the ground that “no sanction for prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act is necessary after demitting office or retirement of the public servant”. The High Court had ordered the case to be proceeded in accordance with law. Table of events The table of events began in April 2012 when Mr. Pasha, who is the managing director of Pash Space International Pvt. Ltd., filed a complaint with the Bengaluru Lokayukta accusing Mr. Yediyurappa, former State Industries Minister Murugesh R. Nirani and other senior officials of corruption. He alleged that a project proposal to build and establish ‘value homes for the middle and low income group’, generating employment to 500 people, was approved by the Yediyurappa government via a notification in July 2010. Twenty-six acres at Devanahalli Industrial Area in Bengaluru rural district was allotted for the project. Mr. Pasha’s company had applied for the project. However, the plug was pulled on the project in January 2011. Mr. Pasha claimed it was done with an alleged intention to divert the project to some other firm in order to have an illegal monetary gain. Mr. Pasha also alleged that a letter with his signature was forged to show that his company was not interested in the project. Mr. Pasha said no such letter was rendered by his company. Further, the complaint alleged that the 26 acres was carved out of 4,500 acres in the Hardware Park, IT Park and Aerospace at Devanahalli Industrial Area. The original owners were ignored and ineligible claimants were paid during the acquisition. Lokayukta probe Subsequently, the special judge had ordered an investigation by the Lokayukta in May 2012. In June 2013, the special judge took cognisance of the chargesheet and registered a case of corruption and issued summons to Mr. Yediyurappa and the others. In October 2013, the High Court quashed the case for lack of previous sanction for prosecution of public servants. Two months later, in December 2013, Mr. Pasha filed another complaint on the same allegations. This time the special judge dismissed the complaint for lack of prior sanction. Following this, Mr. Pasha had moved the High Court against the dismissal to win a favourable order on January 5 this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sc-stays-corruption-case-against-yediyurappa/article34249350.ece
06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘We feel neglected, our horses need sheds’||Nihang Sikhs, who have been leading from the front at the Singhu border protest site, said that they feel neglected and that their horses need sheds, but no leader is paying heed to their difficulties. The Nihangs have been camping at the front of the protest site since it began, and the horses were brought shortly after. On Monday, they took the stage to share their grievances and said that they will continue to support the movement but as the temperature is rising, their horses need attention. Speaking to The Hindu , Amanpreet Singh Nihang said that they are here for the truth and have no vested interest in favouring the farmers or standing against the government. “We are not farmers. We are not against the government. The truth is that black laws must be repealed and that’s the reason we are here,” he said. Sitting inside an open tent with a cooler, which barely worked, he said that there are about 50 horses at the Singhu border, and they have been able to build makeshift sheds for only a few of them. The rest of them are tied in the open. “At least we can speak for ourselves. These horses cannot tell us about their pain. In extreme heat, they get fever. Even at places where they stay originally, they have permanent sheds,” he said. Nihangs said that over the last 15 days they have told the leaders and people on the stage about their grievances for at least three times, but no one listened to them. “What kind of leaders are they? They do not think about their own people? They get money from abroad and so many other people. Can’t they construct sheds for our horses?” he added. Another Nihang Sikh, who did not wish to be named, said that no one had ever asked them how they were managing the fodder for the horses. “Farmers from Haryana are kind enough to bring it for us, but the leaders or their people have never asked us,” he complained. “They can say that we have come on our own and we can leave if we want. They can say it is not their responsibility, but that is the ideal attitude leaders should have,” Mr. Amanpreet said. Nihang Sikhs said that they would support the movement till it ends, and they are not scared of anyone either. “If sheds are not created, then we will just take the horses and tie them near the main stage,” he said. 40-bed hospital In another development, a 40-bed hospital behind the main stage was all set to be inaugurated on Tuesday. The makeshift hospital is being made by Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Chautala and will be named Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal Kisan Hospital. “There will be two doctors present at all times and the hospital will be open 24x7,” said Ashok Kaushik, an INLD member.  Farmers from Haryana are kind enough to bring fodder for our horses, but the leaders, or their people, have never asked us about the same A Nihang||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/we-feel-neglected-our-horses-need-sheds/article34249502.ece
06 April 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Centre encroaching upon States’ rights: Amarinder||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government, accusing it of encroaching upon the rights of the States by its one-sided decision to impose the recent farm laws and the Direct Benefit Transfer on the State’s farming community. “States never faced such problems earlier,” he said. Captain Amarinder also accused the Centre of trying to destroy the existing relations and systems in the name of the so-called reforms, which they were trying to impose without taking the stakeholders into confidence. “Punjab’s farmers and commission agents ( arhtiya ) have age-old cordial ties, which the Centre was hell bent on damaging,” he said, terming the Centre’s tough posturing and ill-conceived decisions as being against the basic spirit of federalism. Solidarity with farmers Virtually launching the two-day Kisan Mela organised by the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, the Chief Minister expressed his solidarity with the farmers against the farm laws. “The Centre has deliberately impinged upon the State’s power, thus jeopardising the basic structure of democracy. The Centre should have taken the farmers into confidence before enactment of these contentious legislations. Had the Centre been sincere about finding a workable solution to this problem, it would have either consulted the State government or the farmers, as Punjab alone contributes over 40% of foodgrains to the national pool,” he said. In his address, pointing to the growing problem of scarcity of surface as well as underground water, the Chief Minister urged the farmers to go for drip irrigation to save the State from becoming a desert in the near future. “The fast depleting water table, resulting from the melting glaciers, is a major challenge for the State and the only solution is to get out of the paddy-wheat cycle to save this precious resource,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/centre-encroaching-upon-states-rights-amarinder/article34249483.ece
06 April 2021||New Delhi,||SC calls Maudany a ‘dangerous man’||Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court, on Monday orally referred to People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leader Abdul Nasir Maudany as a “dangerous man” while hearing his plea to relax his bail condition and permit him to stay in his home town in Kerala till the pendency of the trial in the 2008 Bengaluru bomb blast case in which he is an accused. “You (Maudany) are a dangerous man,” Chief Justice Bobde addressed senior advocate Jayant Bhushan, appearing for Maudany. Mr. Bhushan said the PDP leader had lost a leg and referred to his medical condition to justify the plea for a relaxation of the bail conditions. “Your Lordships, in 2014, had granted him bail but ordered him to stay back in Bengaluru,” Mr. Bhushan submitted. However, the hearing was cut short when Justice V. Ramasubramanian, also on the Bench, voiced doubts about appearing for Maudany at some point in the past. The court adjourned the hearing for next week in order to verify Justice Ramasubramanian’s query. The Supreme Court had granted Maudany, represented by advocate Haris Beeran, bail in 2014 till the conclusion of the trial before a court at the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail in Bengaluru. In 2014, the Supreme Court had granted the PDP leader bail on the ground that he had already undergone judicial custody for four years since August 2010 and was suffering from various health ailments. The Supreme Court’s bail came after the Karnataka authorities had undertaken to complete the trial within four months from November 14, 2014. ‘Protracted trial’ “More than six years have elapsed and the trial has still not been concluded. The trial was protracted on account of the lethargic attitude of the respondent (State of Karnataka). The case before the trial court is crawling at snail’s pace and the progress of the trial was hampered on several occasions due to various reasons such as recall and re-examination of witnesses, transfer of special public prosecutor thrice, transfer of presiding officer thrice and now on account of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic,” Maudany’s present application said. It highlighted that the health of Maudany was getting worse and suitable health care was not available due to the pandemic situation. Besides, the stay in Bengaluru was causing an excessive financial burden on him, the application said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/maudany-is-a-dangerous-man-says-sc/article34249354.ece
06 April 2021||New Delhi,||Kejriwal misleading farmers by playing victim card: Bidhuri||Leader of the Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Monday asked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to stop playing “the victim card” on amendments to the GNCTD Act as these were required to put an end to the “misuse of such powers” by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and fast-track the wheels of “administration and justice” in the city. ‘Bunch of lies’ Mr. Bidhuri said that Mr. Kejriwal had been calling himself a victim in front of protesting farmers and was misleading them by stating that he had to face the ire of the Central government as he had come out in support of the agitation. “At the farmers’ rally in Jind, the Chief Minister said he was being targeted and the government’s powers were taken away for standing with the farmers and fighting for their rights. This is a complete bunch of lies as Mr. Kejriwal had in the past made many claims and promises to the farmers but had not fulfilled even one of them,” Mr. Bidhuri alleged. “He is again trying to bankroll on their agitation to revive his falling political fortunes,” he alleged. Four years ago, during the Punjab Assembly elections, Mr. Bidhuri alleged that Mr. Kejriwal had “misinformed the farmers and the people” that the Delhi government was paying Rs. 2,600 per quintal minimum support price for wheat and Rs. 2,700 per quintal for rice and the same would be extended to the farmers of Punjab if the AAP came to power. “Whereas the reality is that, till date, the farmers of Delhi have not gotten any MSP support. The Rs. 200 crore earmarked for the welfare of the farmers has also not been spent,” he alleged. “The administrative powers have been given to the Lieutenant-Governor now so that the power is not misused to help criminals,” the senior BJP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kejriwal-misleading-farmers-by-playing-the-victim-card-bidhuri/article34249490.ece
06 April 2021||LUCKNOW,||‘Ansari will be brought to U.P.’||A senior Uttar Pradesh police officer said on Monday that BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari would be brought to the State from a jail in Punjab with adequate security in place following the directions of the Supreme Court and as per the Rules for Guards and Escorts, 1970. The State police had termed the apex court’s direction to the Punjab government to hand over the custody of the MLA from Mau to U.P. as an “important success”.

06 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||DUTA holds awareness drive on funds disbursal||The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) on Monday held a “Jansamvad” — an outreach programme — to raise awareness on the delay in disbursement of funds, insufficient funds and the pattern of assistance in the 12 DU colleges that are fully funded by the Delhi government. CM’s constituency The awareness drive was carried out in Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s constituency, including Gole Market, R.K. Ashram metro station and Janpath metro station. DUTA president Rajib Ray said, “The 12 colleges are facing an unprecedented ordeal for many months now. The Delhi government has repeatedly failed to give timely grants-in-aid with the result that employees of these colleges have been forced to go without salaries for many months. Former employees have also been struggling as their pensions have been stopped.” During the Jansamvad, DUTA activists distributed leaflets on the implications of privatisation on the cost of education. “Activists also talked to people about the issues facing the employees of the 12 DU colleges where the government has been systematically delaying the payment of salaries and other dues. A similar programme is proposed in Deputy CM Manish Sisodia’s constituency on April 9,” said Mr. Ray. The DUTA also called for an emergency Executive Council meeting to pass resolutions against the Pattern of Assistance document and appointment of senior administrative officers in the 12 colleges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/duta-holds-awareness-drive-on-funds-disbursal/article34249491.ece

06 April 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Akali Dal holds protests against Punjab govt.||With an eye on the Assembly elections due in Punjab early next year, the Shiromani Akali Dal staged protests across the State on Monday against the Congress government for ‘failing to perform on all fronts in the past four years’. SAD leaders accused the Amarinder Singh government of not being able to save the interests of the farming community, besides failing to fulfil its 2017 Assembly election promises. Former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, addressing a gathering in Bathinda, accused the Congress of playing a ‘fixed match’ with the Central government to undermine the interests of the farming community. “What is stopping the Chief Minister from resigning from his post in solidarity with the farming community,” she asked. She added her opponents were spreading a rumour that she had delayed in resigning from the Union Ministry. “The truth is the Congress had assisted in getting the three laws passed in the Parliament by staging a walkout instead of voting against them.” SAD leaders and workers held dharna at many places in the State and levelled allegation of a ‘fixed match’ between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party on the issue. Ms. Badal alleged the Congress was aware about the Centre’s intention to introduce the DBT scheme which seeks to bypass the commission agents. “Similarly, the AAP government in Delhi was the first one to notify a farm law,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/akali-dal-holds-protests-against-punjab-govt/article34249486.ece
