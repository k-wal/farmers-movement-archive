21 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Use lockdown only as absolute last resort, Modi tells States||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged the States to only resort to lockdowns as an absolute last resort and said that were everyone to observe COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, there would be no need for stringent reactions. “We have to save ourselves from a lockdown and do our best to avoid it and I request the States to pay more attention to effectively managing micro-containment zones,” Mr. Modi said in his 20-minute address to the nation. “Were we to observe COVID-appropriate behaviour with collective enforcement, then we wouldn't need curfews and containment zones. Then, a lockdown would simply be out of the question,” he said. In his first address to the nation this year, Mr. Modi said the government’s decision to make vaccines more widely available would translate to affordable vaccines for all adults. “I would appeal to workplaces to use this as an opportunity to vaccinate their workforce so that nobody would have to move and leave the cities and their places of work,” he said. The Prime Minister alluded to the prevailing oxygen supply crisis and said Indian industry as well as the transport sector was working hard to ensure that it was available as quickly as possible in the places needed. ‘Collective effort’ He said that the second wave was a major challenge but with collective enterprise the country could overcome the challenges it posed. Referring to the ongoing month of Ramzan as well the festival of Rama Navami, Mr. Modi said just as these occasions were reminders to be compassionate, restrained and to exhibit self control, in the same way it was imperative on everyone to follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. He appealed to the children to ensure that elders do not step out without cause. Unlike a year ago when the pandemic hit and India had inadequate testing kits, PPE suits and little understanding of how it could be managed, there was much more knowledge now, Mr. Modi said. He added that youth in residential areas should form committees to enforce appropriate COVID behaviour and discipline. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Modi interacted with vaccine manufacturers from across the country via video conferencing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/use-lockdown-only-as-absolute-last-resort-modi-tells-states/article34371732.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||HC order for lockdown in 5 U.P. cities stayed by top court||The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the Allahabad High Court order directing the Uttar Pradesh government to impose strict restrictions till April 26 in five cities due to the surge in COVID-19 cases. A Bench, headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde, passed the order after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Uttar Pradesh, said the State had issued several directions to contain the spread of the coronavirus but to “lock down five cities by a judicial order may not be the right approach”. Mr. Mehta, while arguing that the High Court order would create “immense administrative difficulties”, said the State government had taken adequate precaution and actions on its own. “Issue notice. Until further orders, there shall be an ad interim stay of the impugned order passed by the High Court,” said the Bench, also comprising Justices A.S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian. “However, the petitioner-State government shall immediately report to the High Court about the steps it has taken and proposes to take in the immediate future within a period of one week in view of the current pandemic,” the Bench said. The top court appointed senior advocate P.S. Narasimha asamicus curiaeto assist in the matter and posted it for hearing after two weeks. The Bench directed the top court’s registry to furnish a copy of the petition, filed by the U.P. government challenging the High Court's order, to the amicus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-order-for-lockdown-in-5-up-cities-stayed-by-top-court/article34371734.ece

Law-enforcing agencies had been asked to carry out intensive checks to restrict the movement of citizens during the curfew. However, State Police Chief Loknath Behera said genuine citizens stepping out for emergencies and for travelling will not have to face any difficulties due to checking. RT-PCR negative certificates are not mandatory for inter-district travel. Smooth movement of freight and essentials would be ensured. A core committee meeting headed by Chief Secretary V.P. Joy reportedly ruled out imposing a total lockdown on weekends for now. However, the police will stringently restrict civic life in five districts with a higher than 20% test positivity rate. They are Kannur, Malappuram, Kasaragod, Palakkad, and Kottayam. Autorickshaw drivers and taxi drivers can admit only two and three passengers respectively.

21 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Northeastern States restrict public activities||From urban lockdown in Mizoram to advanced summer vacation for schools in Arunachal Pradesh and partial attendance in educational institutions and offices in Assam, the north-eastern States have taken diverse actions in a bid to check the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases. Data with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said COVID-19 claimed nine lives in three of the eight north-eastern States on April 19 — seven of them in Assam — as the region recorded 1,333 active cases. Officials in States such as Meghalaya said the rate of infection over the past few days has been six times more than the corresponding period in 2020. The surge has forced Meghalaya and its north-eastern neighbours to go for a series of restrictive measures to contain the spread of the “new strain” of the novel coronavirus. Apart from night curfew, Meghalaya has closed down all schools in State capital Shillong till May 3, besides barring the entry of tourists for 14 days from April 23. Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma justified the restrictions. “It took 114 days for Meghalaya to cross 600 COVID-19 positive cases in 2020, but it has taken only 25 days this time to record 680 cases,” he said. Lockdown in Aizawl Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura governments have also closed down all educational institutions — up to Class 8 in some cases — for periods ranging from seven days to an indefinite period. Mizoram has also imposed lockdown in State capital Aizawl and 10 district headquarters while asking smaller towns and rural areas to carry on with public activities by adhering to COVID-appropriate behaviour. Arunachal Pradesh, among the least affected States, has decided to advance the summer vacation of schools by a month. Educational institutions, including Rajiv Gandhi University, have been asked to complete all physical classes and examinations by April 30. “We are not going for night curfew and lockdown, but all educational institutions up to university level will remain closed indefinitely ,” said Tripura Education Minister and government spokesman Ratan Lal Nath. Curbs in Assam The Assam government too has ruled out lockdown, but has ordered all shops and business establishments to be closed by 6 p.m. This was among a slew of restrictions “with immediate effect” that Chief Secretary Jishnu Barua announced on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/northeastern-states-restrict-public-activities/article34371912.ece
21 April 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra Cabinet favours total lockdown||As Maharashtra’s health infrastructure cracks under the onslaught of the second COVID-19 wave, the Cabinet on Tuesday requested Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to impose a stern lockdown to break the virus chain. The Cabinet decided to cancel Class X exam of the State board scheduled to begin April end. It also sanctioned measures to increase the availability of oxygen including utilisation of oxygen produced by power plants. Talking to journalists after a Cabinet meeting, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said all Ministers were of the view that a complete lockdown was the need of the hour. “We have requested the Chief Minister to officially announce a complete lockdown from Wednesday 8 p.m. Now, it is up to the Chief Minister to take the final decision,” said Mr. Tope. Urban Development and Public Works Minister Eknath Shinde said all Ministers were ‘unanimous’ in their view that the restrictions imposed by the government a week ago were not having the desired effect. “The Class XII exam will certainly be held, but we have decided to give relief to Class X students,” he said. “While we hoped that the fresh curbs announced last week would help reduce cases, this is not happening. Regrettably, we still see a lot of people and vehicles moving about freely. As a result, the number of patients has been rising dramatically, imposing a big strain on the health infrastructure,” said Mr. Shinde, adding that the State was facing an acute shortage of oxygen. On oxygen availability, Mr. Tope said the State was “managing with 1,550 metric tonnes of oxygen” per day at present. “The State has been allowed to get 300 MT of oxygen from other States. The Centre can allot us another 300 MT, but we can not get more than 2,000 MT, overall,” he said. The Cabinet also decided to purchase a minimum of 200 oxygen concentrator machines for each of 36 districts, Mr. Tope added. Mr. Shinde said the Cabinet was of the opinion that if the chain had to be broken, a lockdown was essential. “The lockdown imposed last year did help in bringing down cases…now, calls for a lockdown are not only emanating from the Cabinet but also from sections of citizens,” Mr. Shinde said. Before the Cabinet meet, Ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Rajendra Shingne, among others, said they were in favour of a 15-day lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maharashtra-cabinet-favours-total-lockdown/article34372319.ece
21 April 2021||New Delhi,||Some Delhi hospitals down to 4-5 hours of oxygen||Multiple government hospitals in the city said that their oxygen stock will last only for “7-12 hours” and COVID-19 patients will succumb if the situation isn’t addressed on priority basis. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal again sought help from the Central government. “I again urge centre to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi. Some hospitals are left with just a few hours of oxygen (sic),” he said in a tweet. Around 10.20 p.m., Health Minister Satyendar Jain, tagging Union Minister Piyush Goyal in a tweet, said oxygen supply in Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, the second largest Delhi government hospital, may not last beyond 2 a.m. on Wednesday. A list shared by the AAP government showed that in some hospitals, the oxygen stock will last only for four to five hours. “We need oxygen very badly. Have enough to last only seven to eight hours,” Dr. D.S. Rana, chairman of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, one of the city’s largest private hospitals, toldThe Hindu. “Around 120 patients in the ICU are heavily dependent on oxygen,” he said. Supply lines Dr. Jyoti Mishra, medical superintendent of Aakash Healthcare, another private hospital, said the situation was similar in almost all hospitals. “We do not have oxygen to last more than 12 hours,” he said. The CM had alleged on Sunday that the oxygen quota of the city has been diverted to other States. A Ministry of Home Affairs official said on Tuesday that oxygen supply for Delhi was mainly sourced from the neighbouring States, particularly Uttar Pradesh. “We are coordinating with the State governments to ensure that the trucks and vehicles carrying oxygen are not halted or stopped unnecessarily at the borders, but the Delhi government has to place the order,” the official said. An official working with the CM’s office said that the government has already placed orders with the Central government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/some-delhi-hospitals-down-to-7-12-hours-of-oxygen/article34372008.ece

Why wait till April 22 to decide?” the HC said, adding, “At this point of time, the highest priority has to be saving lives.” “The government imposed a lockdown last year, which faced a lot of criticism, but if we look back, it was probably the wisest decision the government made,” the Bench said. “The situation today is much more demanding. If there was justification for lockdown last year, it is four times more today,” it added. The Bench also took note of news reports that there is daily wastage of “6% of vaccines, and till now 44 lakh vaccines out of 10 crore have been wasted”. The HC said wastage of even a single shot of the COVID-19 vaccine was a “criminal waste” and directed the Centre to vaccinate whomsoever it can, to ensure each vial is used fully.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ban-industrial-use-of-oxygen-now-hc-tells-centre/article34372225.ece
21 April 2021||Bengaluru,||Weekend curfew, curbs on businesses in State||The Karnataka government on Tuesday imposed weekend curfew and night curfew across the State and prohibited a range of businesses from functioning to contain the surge of COVID-19. The restrictions will be in place till May 4. While the night curfew will be between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., the weekend curfew will be between 9 p.m. on Friday and 6 a.m. on Monday.

Educational institutions, cinema halls, shopping malls, gymnasiums, yoga centres, spas, sports complexes, stadium, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres, and bars have been brought under prohibited list till May 4. The guidelines ban social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious gatherings, and large congregation.“While the curfew will bring life to a halt barring essential services, the rest of the days will see restrictions on business activities,” an official explained.

21 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘U.S. currency watchlist an intrusion into policy’||Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan on Tuesday questioned the rationale behind the U.S. government’s decision to put India on the watchlist for currency manipulators, and said the list constituted an intrusion into the policy space needed by central banks around the world to meet their mandates. High dollar purchases The U.S. Treasury Department had recently retained India on a watchlist for currency manipulators submitted to the U.S. Congress, citing higher dollar purchases (close to 5% of the gross domestic product) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Another trigger for the inclusion on the currency watchlist is a trade surplus of $20 billion or more. India’s trade surplus with the U.S. grew by about $5 billion to $23 billion in 2020-21, from around $18 billion in the previous fiscal year, as imports fell more sharply than exports in the COVID-affected year. In response to a question on the U.S .move, Mr. Wadhawan said the RBI had been taking necessary steps to maintain stability in the financial markets and not accumulating forex reserves like China did in the past. “I think the central bank’s activity in the foreign exchange market has been perfectly balanced and completely legitimate within the accepted monetary policy mandate of central banks across the world. This watchlist is a recent phenomenon [and] it is an intrusion into policy space of central banks. I personally don’t understand its rationale” he said. To provide stability “These are, in my view, very legitimate market-based operations of a central bank. It is a mandate of the central bank to provide stability in the currency as a result of which central banks buy and sell foreign currency. Our overall reserves have been fairly steady at $500 billion to $600 billion. We are not accumulating reserves like China, which at one point had reserves of $4 trillion,” he pointed out. India, the Commerce Secretary asserted, had a steady holding pattern of forex reserves “with ups and downs” based on market-based transactions that central banks may undertake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/us-currency-watchlist-an-intrusion-official/article34371735.ece

21 April 2021||Bengaluru,||No exam for classes 1 to 9||The government has decided to cancel year-end examinations for students in classes one to nine. Instead, they will be assessed based on the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE), which will be the deciding factor for their promotion. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar said schools had been directed to complete the assessment process by April 30, while reiterating that students must not be asked to physically attend any examination. Bridge courses He also said that the CCE should be used only as a tool to assess a student’s learning capabilities and help teachers identify gaps in learning that can be addressed as part of bridge courses at the start of the next academic year. Last year, following the outbreak of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, students had been promoted without any assessment. “Promoting students without any assessment for the second consecutive year will send a wrong signal. Teachers will assess the children and address the deficiencies through the bridge courses,” said the Minister. However, he added that all students from classes one to five must be promoted, as they had not attended any physical classes. For students from classes six to nine, who attended both online and offline classes, assessment should be based on class interactions, project work, homework, and learning capabilities. The Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka welcomed the decision, but urged the government to allow schools to hold online assessments for students in classes six to nine. “Summative and normative assessment under the CCE is better than just promoting all children without considering their learning capabilities. However, online assessment should be held for students in classes six to nine. Some schools have already begun the assessment process. We have already apprised the Commissioner of Public Instruction in this regard,” said D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary. He also pointed out that many parents had pulled their children out of schools, and said that the government should bring them back into the fold for the next academic year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-exam-for-classes-1-to-9/article34371872.ece

21 April 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi faces oxygen emergency||Multiple government hospitals in the the national capital have said their oxygen stock will last only for seven to twelve hours and “people will die” if they do not get oxygen. A list shared by the government showed that in some hospitals, oxygen will last only for four to five hours. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also reiterated there was a serious oxygen crisis and again sought help from the central government. “Serious oxygen crisis persists in Delhi. I again urge Centre to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi. Some hospitals are left with just a few hours of oxygen,” he said in a tweet. “We need oxygen very badly. Have enough to last only seven to eight hours,” Dr. D.S. Rana, chairman of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a private hospital, told The Hindu . “If we don't get oxygen on time then many will die. 120 patients in ICU are heavily dependent on oxygen. 80% of the other patients are also dependent on oxygen. We have informed about it to both central and state governments,” Dr. Rana said. Sir Ganga Ram Hospital is one of the largest private hospitals in the city and has 485 COVID-19 beds and 475 of them are currently occupied, as per government data. Dr. Jyoti Mishra, Medical Superintendent of Aakash Healthcare, a private hospital, said that the situation was similar in almost all hospitals.  “We do not have oxygen to last more than 12 hours. Forty-five people in ICU are heavily dependent on oxygen. We convey the oxygen stock on a daily basis to the State government. Right now, the supply is also less,” Dr. Mishra said. Quota diverted: CM The Chief Minister had said on Sunday also that Delhi is facing an “acute shortage” of oxygen for COVID-19 patients and alleged that the quota of the city has been diverted to other States. “In most hospitals in Delhi, oxygen is available only for the next 8 to 12 hours. For one week, we have been asking to increase oxygen supply quota for Delhi, which the central government has to do. If oxygen does not reach the hospitals in sufficient quantity by tomorrow morning, there will be commotion,” Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said in a tweet in Hindi. Delhi government said it procured oxygen cylinders from Noida and Rajasthan, and the supply is stopped in various States before it reaches the capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-faces-oxygen-emergency/article34371675.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Border situation cannot be swept under carpet’||Maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas is the “essential basis” to take forward India’s ties with China, Vikram Misri, India’s envoy to China, said on Monday. There needed to be “respect for mutual concerns and sensitivities and for each other’s priorities”, Mr. Misri said in an interaction with Chinese scholars from think tanks and universities in the southern city of Guangzhou, according to a statement from the Indian Embassy in Beijing. Mr. Misri said, at another dialogue last week hosted by the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) and the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA), there was “a tendency in some quarters to sweep this situation under the carpet and characterise it as just a minor issue and a matter of perspective”. “This, too, is inadvisable as it can only take us further away from a sustained solution to present difficulties and deeper into an unfulfilling stalemate,” he said. “In fact, it would be tantamount to running away from the problem and in a direction opposite to that where the promise of our closer development partnership lies.” Remain deadlocked Talks between military commanders appear to remain deadlocked over carrying forward disengagement in the Gogra and Hot Springs areas following the completion of the first phase at Pangong Lake. China’s state media reported on Monday that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) “has deployed an advanced long-range rocket launcher to the Himalayas”. “It is the first time that the PLA has confirmed the deployment of long-range rocket systems to the border with India,” the South China Morning Post quoted a front page report of the official PLA Daily as saying, adding that “an artillery brigade stationed 5,200 metres above sea level in Xinjiang military district has intensified its drills using a rocket system during full-wing combat-ready training”. The Indian envoy’s comments indicated the difference in how New Delhi and Beijing view the way forward to restore normalcy in the relationship. At the same dialogue, Sun Weidong, China’s Ambassador to India, said, “What happened over the past few decades has proven once and again that highlighting differences will not help resolve problems.” “Rather, it will erode the foundation of mutual trust,” he said. “The boundary dispute is a reality and should be given sufficient attention and taken seriously. However, the boundary question is not the whole story of China-India relations and should be put at a proper place in the overall bilateral relations.” Mr. Misri, however, said both countries “worked out elaborate mechanisms and parallel structures for border control and for the management of issues that cropped up on the ground on a regular basis” and “though they were tested on multiple occasions, these mechanisms and structures helped maintain the all important peace and tranquillity on the borders, thereby helping create the environment in which the India-China relationship grew spectacularly between 1988 and 2019”. “It is tempting today to remember this period with a touch of nostalgia, and to argue that we should shelve our differences and things should immediately go back to the way they used to be,” he said. “But we must acknowledge that these enabling structures and the fundamental premise of the closer developmental partnership have been placed under considerable strain by the serious incidents and the resultant violation of peace and tranquillity at the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh in April 2020 and thereafter.” The two envoys also offered differing takes on multilateralism. Mr. Sun said, “China and India need to practise true multilateralism, abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and an international order based on international law” and “reject ‘small circles’ of closeness and exclusion targeting other countries”, a phrase some Chinese experts have used to refer to groupings such as the Quad. Mr. Misri said, “In a post-pandemic world of altered equations, multipolarity is probably more important than ever, both in the Indo-Pacific and beyond” and “in a multipolar world, no country can set the agenda by itself without prior agreement and consultation, and then expect everyone else to come on board”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/border-situation-cannot-be-swept-under-carpet/article34371636.ece
21 April 2021||Kolkata,||43 seats at stake in phase 6 of Bengal poll||From the narrow stretch of land connecting north and south Bengal, often referred to as “chicken’s neck”, to the constituencies bordering Bangladesh in Nadia and North 24 Parganas districts, the sixth phase of polling in the State will be held across interesting geographies. The 43 Assembly seats that will go to the polls are spread across both north and south Bengal. During this round, polling will be held in both Uttar Dinajpur district of north Bengal and Bardhaman Purba, Nadia and North 24 Parganas districts of south Bengal. Nine seats in Uttar Dinjapur and Nadia will go to the polls on April 22, along with 17 constituencies in North 24 Parganas district and eight in Purba Bardhaman district. Several Assembly constituencies of Uttar Dinajpur, such as Chopra, Islampur, Goalpokhar and Chakulia, border Bangladesh on one side and Bihar on another. The narrow stretch called “chicken's neck” has a strategic importance and is also inhabited by people of all religions and ethnicities. Some of the constituencies in North 24 Parganas, particularly those located on the banks of the Hooghly, has centuries-old jute mills in places such as Naihati, Bhatpara, Jagaddal and Barrackpore, and an electorate comprising all communities of all religions. In North 24 Parganas, and also in parts of Nadia such as Bongaon Uttar, Bongaon Dakshin, Swarupnagar, Bagda and Krishnanagar Dakshin, there is a high concentration of Matuas. Most of the Assembly seats are reserved for the Scheduled Castes. Of the 43 Assembly seats, nine are reserved. The poll plank of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and steps against infiltration, particularly in the border areas, whereas the Trinamool Congress, along with highlighting its welfare schemes, has been campaigning against the implementation of the CAA and the National Register of Citizens. In seats of Purba Bardhaman such as Katwa, Purbasthali Uttar and Purbasthali Dakshin, Ketugram, agrarian issues dominated the discourse. Despite the spike in the number of COVID-19 infections, there was a hectic election campaign, with several BJP leaders, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J.P. Nadda, participating in rallies and roadshows with a host of State and central leaders. For the Trinamool, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek Banerjee, a Member of Parliament, were the star campaigners. The campaigning ended on Monday. The ECI has extended the silent period from 48 hours to 72 hours for the remaining phases. The poll body will deploy 779 companies of central forces for this phase. A total of 306 contestants are in the fray, including Trinamool Ministers like Jyotipriya Mullick from Habra and Chandrima Bhattacharya from Dum Dum Uttar seats in North 24 Parganas. Senior BJP leader Mukul Roy is contesting from Krishnanagar Uttar and Rahul Sinha from Habra. Sitting MLAs of the Samyukta Morcha, Ali Imran Ramz of the All India Forward Bloc and Tanmoy Bhattacharya of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), are contesting from Chakulia in Uttar Dinajpur and Dum Dum Uttar respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/43-seats-at-stake-in-phase-6-of-bengal-poll/article34371663.ece
21 April 2021||Washington DC,||U.S. denies vaccine inputs ban||The Biden administration has denied that there are any ‘outright bans’ on the export of vaccine raw materials. The denial comes in response to an appeal by vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India’s (SII) owner, Adar Poonawalla, to U.S. President Joe Biden, asking him to lift an embargo on exports. “The Biden-Harris Administration’s top priority is saving lives and ending the pandemic. We reject any statement referring to a U.S. export ban on vaccines. The United States has not imposed any ‘outright bans’ on the export of vaccines or vaccine inputs. This assertion is simply not true,” an administration official told The Hindu . Mr. Poonawalla, on April 16, had asked Mr. Biden to “lift the embargo” on raw materials to assist the production of COVID-19 vaccines. SII, which produces Covishield, a version of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, uses bio-reactor bags from U.S. firms ABEC and GE Healthcare to grow cells for the vaccine, according to reports. It also uses filters, microcarrier beads and cell culture media — all of which are in short supply. “Respected@POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details,” Mr. Poonawalla had tweeted. Emergency legislation The U.S. is a major source of these materials, with reports suggesting that shortages are a consequence of the U.S.’s Defense Production Act — an emergency law that requires domestic manufacturers to prioritise federal (central) government purchase orders. Both Mr. Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, had invoked this law. “The United States has clearly committed to using all available tools, including the Defense Production Act, to expand domestic vaccine manufacturing and prioritise the supplies that can serve as bottlenecks to vaccine production in order to ensure that all Americans can be vaccinated quickly, effectively, and equitably,” the administration official told The Hindu . India’s Ambassador to the U.S. Taranjit Singh Sandhu has met with his counterparts and other senior U.S. administration officials to discuss the specific concerns raised by vaccine manufacturers. U.S. officials said they will “positively consider” the concerns raised by the Indian side, sources within the (Indian) government told The Hindu . Foreign ministers of the two countries — S. Jaishankar and his counterpart Antony Blinken — spoke on the phone on Monday. Both sides alluded to cooperation on “COVID-19” or “health” in descriptions of the call.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-denies-vaccine-inputs-ban/article34372148.ece
21 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Northeastern States restrict public activities to check COVID-19 surge||From urban lockdown in Mizoram to advanced summer vacation for schools in Arunachal Pradesh and partial attendance in educational institutions and offices in Assam, the northeastern States have taken diverse actions in a bid to check the surge in COVID-19 cases. Data with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said COVID-19 claimed nine lives in three of the eight northeastern States on April 19 — seven of them in Assam — as the region recorded 1,333 active cases. Officials in States such as Meghalaya said the rate of infection over the past few days has been six times more than the corresponding period in 2020. The surge has forced Meghalaya and its northeastern neighbours to go for a series of restrictive measures to contain the spread of the “new strain” of the virus. Apart from night curfew, Meghalaya has closed down all schools in State capital Shillong till May 3, besides barring the entry of tourists for 14 days from April 23. Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said: “It took 114 days for Meghalaya to cross 600 positive cases in 2020, but it has taken only 25 days this time to record 680 cases.” Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura governments have also closed down all educational institutions — up to Class 8 in some cases — for periods ranging from seven days to an indefinite period. Mizoram has also imposed lockdown in State capital Aizawl and 10 district headquarters while asking smaller towns and rural areas to carry on with public activities by adhering to COVID-appropriate behaviour. Arunachal Pradesh, among the least affected States, has decided to advance the summer vacation of schools by a month. Educational institutions, including Rajiv Gandhi University, have been asked to complete all physical classes and examinations by April 30. “We are not going for night curfew and lockdown, but all educational institutions up to university-level will remain closed indefinitely,” said Tripura Education Minister and government spokesman Ratan Lal Nath. Curbs in Assam The Assam government too has ruled out lockdown, but has ordered all shops and business establishments to be closed by 6 p.m. This was among a slew of restrictions “with immediate effect” that Chief Secretary Jishnu Barua announced on Tuesday. While students up to Class 5 have been asked to stay home, educational institutions have been told to conduct classes with 50% of students on alternate days. The 50% rule has also been applied to public modes of transport and to government and private offices too, barring banks and other essential services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/northeastern-states-restrict-public-activities-to-check-covid-19-surge/article34372322.ece
21 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘Remove offending online content’||“The Internet never sleeps and the Internet never forgets,” the Delhi High Court remarked on Tuesday while issuing a slew of directions to deal with the complications in removing offending content such as photographs and videos from pornographic websites. Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said a court, when approached with such a grievance, should issue a direction to the website or online platform on which the offending content is hosted to remove such content forthwith, and in any event, within 24 hours of the receipt of the court order. “A direction should also be issued to the website or online platform on which the offending content is hosted to preserve all information and associated records relating to the offending content... at least for a period of 180 days... for use in an investigation,” the High Court added. The case stems from a petition by a woman who claimed that her photographs and images, though not in themselves obscene or offensive, were taken from her Facebook and Instagram accounts without her consent, and were uploaded on a pornographic website with derogatory captions added to them. Justice Bhambhani noted, “The true enormity of this fact has dawned over the course of hearings conducted in the present matter, when it transpired that despite orders of this court, even the respondents [Internet service provider, search engines], who were willing to comply with directions issued to remove offending content from the World Wide Web, expressed their inability to fully and effectively remove it.” ‘Errant parties’ The judge said, “Errant parties merrily continued to repost and redirect such content from one website to another and from one online platform to another, thereby cocking a snook at directions issued against them in pending legal proceedings.” During the hearing, Google had stated that it had no opposition in removing access to the offending content as may be directed by the court. Facebook, which also owns the social media platform Instagram, submitted that it had a robust privacy policy. It pointed out that though it was the woman’s allegation that her photographs and images had been taken from her Facebook/Instagram social media accounts, she did not claim any relief against Facebook/Instagram. The woman claimed that she had already filed a complaint on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal as well as to the jurisdictional police, but to no avail. She claimed that the photographs had received some 15,000 views within a week of being posted. Noting that a solution to the problem needed to be crafted so that legal proceedings of the nature faced by the court did not turn futile, Justice Bhambhani said for an order directing the removal or access disablement of offending content to be effective even within India, a search engine had to block the search results throughout the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/remove-offending-online-content/article34371646.ece
21 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM cancels Europe trip, amid surge||With an uncontrollable surge of COVID-19 cases in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cancelled his travel to Europe next month, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced. The decision was taken after discussions with the European Union (EU) leadership and the Portuguese government, which was going to host the summit in Porto and had invited the leaders of all 27 countries that comprise the EU to attend the meeting with Mr. Modi. “In view of the COVID-19 situation, it has been decided, in consultation with the EU and Portuguese leadership, to hold the India-EU Leaders’ Meeting in a virtual format on 8 May 2021. The India-EU Leaders’ Meeting in the EU+27 format, the first time that such a meeting is being held, reflects the shared ambition of both sides to further deepen the strategic partnership,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. The cancellation comes a day after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson cancelled his visit to India in view of the pandemic. Both the U.K. and the U.S. have also announced travel restrictions and advisories to citizens against travelling to India at this time. Mr. Modi was expected to travel to France during the same visit, which has now been put off. In the run-up to the proposed meeting, Mr. Modi had held a number of bilateral meetings with European leaders, including those of the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg, Italy and others, in which future EU-India cooperation was discussed. Indo-Pacific strategy India and the EU are also expected to discuss progress on the long-pending Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), which has made little headway in more than seven years, and are likely to forge an agreement on cooperation on the Indo-Pacific strategy during the now-virtual meeting. “To fulfil our potential, we need to be more ambitious in our cooperation on preventing climate crises, promoting human rights, building connectivity, sustainable trade and defending a multilateral international order,” an EU official, quoted in a report on the road ahead for India-EU ties, said. On April 12, the EU and Indian officials also held the 9th ‘Human Rights dialogue’, where they discussed “strengthening the human rights mechanisms for the promotion of human rights and the role of national human rights institutions, civil society actors and journalists,” the MEA had said. A day later, the foreign affairs committee of the European Parliament, which had introduced several discussions critical of India on the issue of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and restrictions on NGOs in the past year, cleared the report on India-EU ties, which contained stringent language expressing “concern at the deteriorating human rights situation in India”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-cancels-europe-trip-amid-surge/article34371648.ece
21 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rajnath reviews preparedness||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday called upon the armed forces to be in touch with the State governments and be ready to provide assistance. He also delegated emergency powers of procurement to ensure that critical needs were met, the Defence Ministry said. This was conveyed at a review meeting Mr. Singh held through video-conference with top officials of the Ministry, the Chief of the Defence Staff and the chiefs of the Army and the Navy, along with all Secretaries. Separately, the Defence Ministry also directed that cantonment general hospitals maintained by Cantonment Boards across the country must extend all necessary medical assistance and service to patients approaching them for treatment, irrespective of whether they are Cantonment residents or not. Mr. Singh was briefed about the measures taken by the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS), the Defence Research and Development organisation (DRDO), the Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and other departments in providing aid to the civil administration. “He urged the DPSUs, OFB and DRDO to work on a war footing to provide oxygen cylinders and extra beds to civil administration/State governments at the earliest,” a Defence Ministry statement said. G. Satheesh Reddy, Chairman, DRDO, informed Mr. Singh that a COVID-19 facility set up by his organisation had once again been made functional in New Delhi and efforts were being made to increase the number of beds from 250 to 500. Dr. Reddy added that the ESIC Hospital in Patna, which was converted to a COVID-19 hospital, had started functioning with 500 beds. He said at the meeting that work was ongoing to set up a 450-bed hospital in Lucknow,a 750-bed hospital in Varanasi and a 900-bed hospital in Ahmedabad, the Ministry said. Mr. Singh was also informed that based on the on-board oxygen generation technology developed for the light combat aircraft Tejas, a 1,000 litre per minute capacity oxygen generation plant technology had been given to the industry and the Uttar Pradesh government had placed order for five such plants with the industry. Dr. Reddy said more plants could be supplied by the industry to cater to hospital requirements. SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation)-based supplemental oxygen delivery system developed for soldiers posted at extreme high-altitude areas could be used for COVID-19 patients, as their conditions become similar. The product would be available soon in the market from the industry, the Defence Ministry statement said. “Medical services should be provided to all Cantonment resident and non-resident patients in 67 Cantonment Board hospitals across India. The Ministry reiterated the instructions in this regard to the Director-General, Defence Estates (DGDE),” Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar said on Twitter. The Army announced that the Base hospital in Delhi Cantoment was being converted into an exclusive COVID-19 facility for the armed forces and veterans with effect from April 22. “All Out Patient Departments (OPD) will shift and function at Army Hospital Research and Referral with effect from April 22, 2021,” the Army said on Twitter. Due to the prevailing situation, Army recruitment rallies in the northeast had been postponed till May 31. A fresh date for the common entrance exam, earlier scheduled for April 25, would be announced at an appropriate time, the Army said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajnath-reviews-preparedness/article34371658.ece
21 April 2021||Hyderabad,||Covaxin production scaled up||Covaxin maker Bharat Biotech on Tuesday said it had scaled up manufacturing capacity to produce 700 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine a year. “Manufacturing scale-up has been carried out in a stepwise manner across multiple facilities in Hyderabad and Bengaluru to produce 700 million doses...,” said the company, which had previously pegged the capacity at 200 million doses a year. A release from the company said, “Capacity expansion in vaccines manufacturing is a long and tedious process, requiring investments of several million rupees and several years. Bharat Biotech is able to expand Covaxin manufacturing capacity in a short timeline, mainly due to the availability of new specially designed BSL-3 facilities.” Technology transfer Further, Bharat Biotech said it had partnered with Indian Immunologicals to manufacture the drug substance for Covaxin. The technology transfer process is under way and the IIL has the capabilities and expertise to manufacture inactivated viral vaccines at commercial scale and under biosafety containment. Manufacturing partnerships are also being explored with partners in other countries, the release said. Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech CMD Krishna Ella at an event said that the company will produce 30 million doses of Covaxin next month against around 20 million doses this month and 15 million in the last month. “We are ramping up the production and by July-August we will be able to reach 700 to 800 million doses production capacity per annum,” Mr. Ella said. The release from the company said it used a proprietary adjuvant Algel-IMDG. The synthesis and manufacture of the IMDG component has been successfully indigenised and will be manufactured at commercial scale within the country. This is the first instance where a novel adjuvant has been commercialised in India, it added. Stating that emergency use authorisations for Covaxin has been received in many countries and the process of getting them is on in the U.S and several European countries, the company said pricing for international markets and supplies to governments under the EUA had been established between $15-20 a dose.

21 April 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Ensure buffer stock of oxygen to meet demand: CM||Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday directed officials to ramp up beds with oxygen system and stay prepared for all related accessories. With the daily spike fast approaching the 5,000-mark, Mr. Patnaik took stock of the COVID-19 situation here. “Though there is no problem of beds and oxygen currently, we will have to remain prepared. Our oxygen supply situation has to be closely monitored. Eensure that all related accessories at the hospital level are available on priority,” he said.  Special focus Observing that the second wave has seriously affected many States and the health system in some cities was under severe strain, the Odisha CM said special focus should be on providing maximum possible number of beds with oxygen support and the system has to work on war-footing to ensure this within committed timelines. “Many States are facing critical medicines shortage. Though we have sufficient medicines stock, we must ensure buffer stock to tackle higher demand in coming weeks.” As the return of migrant labourers looked imminent, Odisha was likely to return to system put in place last year. “With lockdowns imposed in seriously affected States, the Collectors should be prepared for the return of the migrants. The protocols followed earlier should be reactivated by the Collectors immediately based on the existing database,” Mr. Patnaik ordered. “The quarantine norm and testing should be ensured for all the returnees. Senior officers assigned as observers and other responsibilities should put their best effort like last year.” The CM said, “Due to our alert preparedness and pro-active measures, we have been able to manage the situation to a large extent. However, we need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario and ensure that every patient is treated with dignity and put in best efforts to save precious lives.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ensure-buffer-stock-of-oxygen-to-meet-demand-cm/article34371920.ece
21 April 2021||Kolkata,||Centre evading responsibility on vaccines, says Mamata||Describing the Centre’s decision of universal vaccination for COVID-19 as “hollow and without substance”, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said the decision was a “regrettable show of evasion of responsibility at a time of crisis”. “Now, when the number of cases in the second wave is spiralling like anything, the Centre has chosen to tactically indulge in empty rhetoric and shy away from its responsibility of making available vaccines to the people of the country,” Ms. Banerjee said in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Chief Minister also cited her letter of February 24, requesting the Centre to permit the State to allow free vaccination for the people of West Bengal, adding that there was no response from the Central government on the communication. In the letter, Ms. Banerjee pointed out that the announcement by the Centre does not address major issues like “ensuring the quality, efficacy, stable flow of supply of required number of vaccines by the manufacturers and also the price at which vaccines are to be purchased by the States”. She also expressed apprehensions that the announced policy might lead to unscrupulous mechanisms in the market, including pricing of vaccines, as it appeared to be based on market prices, which may put common people under a huge financial burden. The Chief Minister highlighted the shortage of vaccines and called for a “fair, transparent and credible vaccination policy”, which would enable people to get vaccines urgently and at affordable prices. “More importantly, the supply would also become very erratic because the vaccine manufacturers are hardly prepared to scale up their production capacities to the desired levels to meet the nationwide demand,” she said. West Bengal, which is in the middle of a marathon eight-phase Assembly election, has seen a sharp spike in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Vaccination and related issues of managing the pandemic have become important poll issues. On April 18, Ms. Banerjee had written to the Prime Minister on the shortage of medicines, oxygen cylinders and vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-evading-responsibility-on-vaccines-says-mamata/article34371653.ece
21 April 2021||Gwalior,||Two migrants killed in M.P. accident||Two migrant workers were killed and eight were injured after an overcrowded bus overturned on a highway near Gwalior district in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday, a police official said. The bus was on its way to Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh from Delhi, Superintendent of Police Amit Sanghi told presspersons. “While the driver was negotiating a turn, the bus overturned at the Jourasi Ghat on Gwalior-Jhansi highway around 9 a.m. Two labourers were killed and eight others injured in the accident,” he said. The injured persons had been admitted to a government hospital in Gwalior. Ganpatlal, a passenger, claimed that nearly 100 people were travelling in the vehicle and a number of them were sitting on its roof. He said the bus conductor had charged Rs. 700 per passenger for ferrying them from Delhi to Tikamgarh. He also claimed that the bus staff, including the driver, had consumed liquor after having dinner at Dholpur in Rajasthan on Monday night. “The bus hit a truck in Dholpur. Later, after it reached near Gwalior, the driver lost control over the wheels and the vehicle overturned,” he said. State Additional Commissioner, Transport, Arvind Saxena and other senior officials rushed visited the spot. “We have contacted officials in Delhi and other States and asked them to inform in advance about migrant labourers going back to their States so that they can be sent to their respective places safely,” Mr. Saxena said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/two-migrants-killed-in-mp-accident/article34371679.ece
21 April 2021||New Delhi,||Centre tells Union Territories to plan for crucial three weeks||The Centre has informed all the eight Union Territories that the next three weeks were crucial in the management of the second wave of the pandemic. The UT administrations, including the Delhi Government, “were advised to plan in advance for three weeks”. Delhi raised the issue of a shortage of beds at a meeting held by the Union Secretaries of Home and Health to review the status of COVID-19 management in all the UTs on Tuesday. Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired the meeting with Chief Secretaries of all the UTs. The meeting, held through video conference, was also attended by V.K. Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog; Balram Bhargava, Director-General of the Indian Council of Medical Research; and the Directors-General of Police of all the UTs. Mr. Bhalla pointed out that India had reported almost 10 times more cases since January 1 and more than 2,00,000 cases were being reported daily since April 15. In the past 11 days, new cases have almost doubled from 1.31 lakh (on April 9) to 2.73 lakh cases on April 20. “The UTs shared their present efforts for containment and management of the positive cases. Ladakh, J&K, and Lakshadweep pointed to the rise in cases due to a large number of inbound travellers. Lakshadweep has seen a sudden spike after April 14 primarily due to travel of large number of people to the mainland to shop for the recent festive occasions,” the Health Ministry said in a statement. “Chandigarh said that they are conducting door-to-door counselling for increasing vaccination. 90% of the patients are in home isolation being monitored by mobile teams,” the statement said. Delhi discussed a shortage of beds and the present efforts to augment this through Central Government infrastructure and support through the DRDO’s recently operationalised COVID Hospital. Dr. Paul pointed out the criticality of next three weeks for COVID response measures. “The UT administrators were advised to plan in advance for three weeks,” the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-tells-union-territories-to-plan-for-crucial-three-weeks/article34371680.ece
21 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Congress for ‘one nation, one price’ on COVID-19 vaccines||A day after the Centre opened up the COVID-19 vaccination policy to expand coverage and include everyone above 18 years of age, the Congress on Tuesday alleged that the modified policy allows the Centre to run away from its responsibility, overburdens the States and encourages vaccine manufacturers to profiteer. Former Union Ministers P. Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh and Ajay Maken, addressing a joint virtual press conference, claimed that “nowhere in the world has any government left its vaccination programme to be determined by the vagaries of market forces” and said the new policy in crucial aspects is “regressive and inequitable”. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, on Twitter, called it the government of India’s “vaccine discrimination” policy and also claimed that India was now gasping for oxygen because of the Centre’s “incompetence and complacency”. “No free vaccines for 18-45 yr olds. Middlemen brought in without price controls. No vaccine guarantee for weaker sections. GOI’s Vaccine Discrimination- Not Distribution- Strategy!” said Mr. Gandhi on Twitter. Under the new policy, to be implemented from May 1, producers are free to supply 50% of doses to State governments and in the open market, for which they will have to make an advance declaration of the price before the roll out date. “This is a government that believes in ‘one nation one tax’, ‘one nation one election’, but it does not believe in ‘one nation, one price’,” Mr. Ramesh said. “Why can’t we have ‘one nation, one price’ for vaccines. I think this is a legitimate demand ... This is inequitable. We want States to get greater responsibility. But this is actually not giving the States any responsibility. So, ‘one nation, one price’. We cannot have ‘one nation, multiple prices.” Mr. Chidambaram said the new policy would not only put additional burden on the already cash-strapped State governments but could also lead to the practice of bidding and profiteering by manufacturers. “States with limited resources will be at a considerable disadvantage. States that are already weighed down by shrinking GST revenues, lower tax devolution, reduced grants-in-aid and increased borrowing would have to bear this additional burden,” he said, questioning where the funds collected under PM CARES have been spent. With several States going for restrictions and lockdowns, the Congress reiterated its demand to provide Rs. 6,000 to migrant workers and other people who live on daily incomes.  States that are already weighed down by increased borrowing would have to bear this additional burden P.

21 April 2021||New Delhi,||Rahul Gandhi tests positive for COVID-19||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said he had tested positive for COVID-19. “After experiencing mild symptoms, I’ve just tested positive for COVID. All those who’ve been in contact with me recently, please follow all safety protocols and stay safe,” Mr. Gandhi said on Twitter. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first few leaders who wished him speedy recovery. “I pray for the good health and quick recovery of Lok Sabha MP Shri Rahul Gandhiji,” he tweeted. On Sunday, the former Congress chief had announced that he would suspend his political rallies in the wake of the rapid spread of the virus and also appealed to other parties to do so. Former Finance Minister P. Chidamabaram said on Twitter, “Learned that Mr. Rahul Gandhi has tested positive and has isolated himself. Deeply concerned. I wish him a full and speedy recovery.” “Please take care. With someone with your level of physical fitness should be a breeze. @RahulGandhi,” said Lok Sabha member Manish Tewari on Twitter. Wishing the Congress leader fast recovery, party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Twitter, “In these challenging times, the nation needs your leadership more then ever.” Mr. Gandhi’s results come a day after former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had tested positive and was shifted to the trauma centre of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Senior leader Anand Sharma had also tested positive and was admitted to a private hospital in Gurugram. He said he was feeling better and his vital parameters were fine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-gandhi-tests-positive-for-covid-19/article34371656.ece

Unlike a year ago when the pandemic hit and India had inadequate testing kits, PPE suits, and little understanding of how it could be managed, there was much more knowledge now, Mr Modi said. He added that youth in residential areas should form committees to enforce appropriate covid behaviour discipline. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Modi interacted with vaccine manufacturers from across the country via video conferencing. He applauded the vaccine manufacturers for their achievements and professionalism. he also said that the biggest strengths of our vaccine industry are its ‘Samarthya, Sansadhan and Seva Bhaav’, and these are what makes them a vaccine leader in the world On Monday, with over new 270,000 cases being added everyday — the most in the world — and hospital facilities in several States strained, the government said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine from May 1. Several States had imposed weekend and days-long lockdowns in an attempt to halt the transmission of the virus and ease the burden on healthcare. Half the approved vaccines could be bought by states by directly negotiating with vaccine companies. The Centre would however continue its ongoing free vaccination programme of healthcare workers, frontline workers, the old and those over 45.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/use-lockdown-only-as-absolute-last-resort/article34371640.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||HC order for lockdown in 5 U.P. cities stayed by SC||The High Court had directed the Uttar Pradesh government to impose strict restrictions, including closing of malls, shopping complexes and restaurants, till April 26 in five cities — Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar and Gorakhpur — but stopped short of calling it a “complete lockdown”. During the arguments, Mr. Mehta said, “Several directions have been issued, some of which the State has already taken steps, but to lock down five cities by a judicial order may not be the right approach.” The Bench noted the submissions of Mr. Mehta, who said the State has issued several directions to contain the spread of COVID-19. “He [Mehta] further submits that the directions issued by the High Court vide the impugned order are as rigorous as a lockdown, though the High Court has observed that ‘they are nowhere close to a complete lockdown’,” the Bench noted in its order. When the Bench said the State shall report to the High Court about the steps that it has taken and proposes to take on the issue, Mr. Mehta said the government can also apprise the apex court about it. In its petition filed in the apex court, the State government has said, “Though the intention behind the impugned order passed by the Division Bench is both laudable and salutary, the High Court has completely failed to appreciate that while passing the direction of the nature as quoted above the High Court has effectively encroached upon the executive domain and has passed a mandamus which is incapable of being executed at the present stage, and if executed, is capable of creating panic, fear and law and order situation in the State”. It said the modalities that need to be worked upon before imposing a lockdown or curfew essentially fall within the domain of executive. The petition, drawn by advocate Rajat Nair, said there was no empirical data before the High Court to compel it to arrive at a conclusion that a lockdown/total curfew for a week was the only way to break the chain of the COVID-19 infection. “In absence, therefore, it is axiomatic that the solemn consideration behind passing of the said order was an irresistible belief of the court that imposition of lockdown was the only way to break the chain of infection,” it said. Earlier in the day, the apex court agreed to hear the petition of the Uttar Pradesh government against the High Court order after the State requested for urgent listing of the matter. The High Court had slammed the State government for “not planning” for a second wave of the pandemic, and criticised the State Election Commission for holding the panchayat elections at this time and “exposing” poll officials to the threat of virus. It had also directed the government to “consider the imposition of a complete lockdown in the entire State for at least two weeks”. Reacting to the order, the U.P. government had said there would be no “complete lockdown” in the cities for now. The High Court had said if people were restrained from going out of their homes for a week in the first instance, the current chain of the spread of COVID-19 could be broken.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-order-for-lockdown-in-5-up-cities-stayed-by-sc/article34371644.ece

High dollar purchases The U.S. Treasury Department had recently retained India on a watchlist for currency manipulators submitted to the U.S. Congress, citing higher dollar purchases (close to 5% of the gross domestic product) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Another trigger for the inclusion on the currency watchlist is a trade surplus of $20 billion or more. India’s trade surplus with the U.S. grew by about $5 billion to $23 billion in 2020-21, from around $18 billion in the previous fiscal year, as imports fell more sharply than exports in the COVID-affected year. In response to a question on the U.S .move, Mr. Wadhawan said the RBI had been taking necessary steps to maintain stability in the financial markets and not accumulating forex reserves like China did in the past. “I think the central bank’s activity in the foreign exchange market has been perfectly balanced and completely legitimate within the accepted monetary policy mandate of central banks across the world. This watchlist is a recent phenomenon [and] it is an intrusion into policy space of central banks. I personally don’t understand its rationale” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-currency-watchlist-an-intrusion-says-official/article34371649.ece

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Reducing Earth’s burden||Why did Lord Narayana choose to live among cowherds in His Krishna avatara? It was because He wanted to show that He was going to lessen the Earth’s burden, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. Bhooma Devi’s burdens were increasing, for kings who ruled lacked righteousness. So, She took the form of a cow and went to Brahma for help. There were tears in Her eyes, and She looked worn out. She prayed that She should be relieved of Her burden and that good kings should rule the Earth. But why did She go as a cow? The cow gives its milk not only to its calves, but to everyone. In the same way, Bhooma Devi yields Her wealth to everyone. We dig the Earth and cultivate crops. We mine the earth for gold and precious stones. Fertile earth provides us with the food we need. Bhooma Devi Herself is green in colour, indicating Her fertility. Andal is considered an avatara of Bhooma Devi. And Vedanta Desika, describing Andal, says that Her colour was that of bunches of grass swaying in the breeze. It is said that the following seven support the Earth: cows, Vedic scholars, the Vedas, women who are devoted to their husbands, honest people, those who give daana generously and those who adhere to dharma. If not for these seven, the Earth will be destroyed. As is clear, among the seven supports the Earth has, cows are the foremost. It was to stress this point that Bhooma Devi took the form of a cow, when She went to meet Brahma. And it was only natural that the Lord should incarnate as Gopala to show that He was going to reduce the Earth’s problems. So, Krishna chose to be a cowherd, because He wanted to show that He was going to reduce the Earth’s burdens by helping the virtuous, by destroying the wicked and by re-establishing dharma on Earth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/reducing-earths-burden/article34371664.ece

Srinivas has become a go-to platform for people seeking help. In the past two weeks, the IYC has received nearly 60,000 SOS messages from COVID-19 patients, Mr. Srinivas said on Tuesday. “Based on the demands, we have now identified three categories. People mostly need plasma donors, hospital beds and oxygen cylinders.

Apart from counselling such people, the IYC chief said they have even had to bring in donors from Bengaluru and Raipur to handle two emergencies in Delhi.  The IYC, that had run a community kitchen for migrant workers and homeless people in Delhi for over six months, is now running a SOS centre that functions for 16-18 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/youth-cong-pitches-in-with-covid-19-aid/article34371651.ece

The Centre, the party said, failed to ramp up the supplies for a year. The new policy is a recipe for exclusion of crores of people who will find it unaffordable to procure the life-saving vaccine, it said.. “Further, vaccines were so far free of cost to the States. Now States have to ‘procure’ them from the ‘open market’ without any price regulation. The vaccine providers, according to this latest policy, will declare their ‘self-set price’.

21 April 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra imposes additional restrictions||A week after it imposed lockdown-like curbs across the State, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday imposed additional restrictions by curtailing the timings of shops selling essential food items like groceries, vegetables and poultry. Such shops are to be kept open only between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. An order issued by Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Disaster Management Act, 2005 states that “all groceries, vegetables shops, fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries, confectionaries, as well as all other types of food shops (including chicken, mutton, fish and eggs)” are to be kept open only between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. Shops related to agricultural implements and farm produce, pet food shops, and those related to materials for the impending rainy season are to follow this rule as well. A number of districts across the State like Satara, Solapur and Amravati, among others, have already curtailed timings of essential shops owing to a massive surge in infections. According to the new order, the restrictions will come into effect from 8 p.m. on Tuesday and will last until 7 a.m. on May 1 until further notice. The order further permits local disaster management authorities to include any additional entities/ services as “essential” under the previous order of April 13 (when the lockdown-like curbs were announced) after consultation with the State Disaster Management authorities. The purpose of the latest curbs is to discourage large congregations before grocery, vegetable and fruit shops still witnessed in Mumbai, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Pune, among other cities in the State. With the State recording an average 60,000 cases and 400 deaths daily for the last 10 days, Maharashtra’s active case tally — the highest in India — is nudging the alarming figure of seven lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-imposes-additional-restrictions/article34371668.ece

21 April 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||Not right time for transport strike, says Karnataka HC||Observing that it was not the right time for anyone to go on strike, the High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday said the strike by the employees of four public road transport corporations (RTCs) amid the COVID-19 pandemic violated the fundamental rights of other citizens. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, while hearing a batch of PIL petitions pointing to the sufferings of the public due to the strike, said it was perhaps the “worst time” to go on strike even if the demands were assumed to be legitimate. Taking note of the fact that the bus services offered by the four RTCs appeared to be the cheapest mode of transport available to the people, the Bench said that bus services were very essential for the vital needs of people, particularly to travel to vaccination centres, and to go to their workplaces, when the State was facing a surge in COVID-19 cases and fatalities. “We are not on the legality or illegality of the strike; we are concerned by the difficulties faced by citizens,” the Bench said while observing that it “hopes and trusts that without prejudice to their demands the employees would resume the operation of buses services so that the common man, who is already under huge stress due to the pandemic, is not put to further hardship”. Stating that the issue would have to be resolved at the earliest in the interest of the public, the Bench adjourned further hearing till April 22 while ordering issue of notice to the State government, the employees’ unions, and the four public RTCs. The Bench also orally observed that early resolution to the issue could be attempted through mediation. Earlier, Advocate General Prabhuling K. Navadgi told the Bench that the labour court had already declared the strike as illegal and several actions had been initiated against the employees on strike. He also pointed out that the number of schedules of the four corporations was gradually on the rise, but a large number of buses remained off the road. He indicated that the government was unlikely to accept the demand of the employees for absorption into government services as it was “unreasonable”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/not-right-time-for-transport-strike-says-karnataka-hc/article34371687.ece

21 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Adherence to COVID-19 norms poor in public transport||Fear of contracting COVID-19 has made many opt for bikes and cars over public transport. However, for those forced to travel on Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses, the fear still remains. Many passengers feel that though there has been an improvement when it comes to wearing masks and ensuring physical distancing, stricter enforcement from the MTC is needed to ensure that sanitisers are provided in all buses and the vehicles are sanitised after each trip. With COVID-19 cases increasing steadily in the State, the government reintroduced certain restrictions from April 10. As per the order, private and government buses plying between the districts and MTC buses running in Chennai should be operated only with seated passengers. Each bus has the capacity to accommodate 44 seated passengers and 25 standing passengers. To enforce the restrictions, the MTC has rolled out 400 additional buses on busy routes. The passengers and the bus crew are expected to wear masks, and sanitisers are supposed to be provided in all buses. “On Tuesday, I was travelling on [bus route] 23E. But only the driver was wearing a mask. Most buses do not have sanitisers. The number of standing passengers has reduced to some extent due to enforcement,” said M. Somasundaram, a consumer activist. A bus conductor said the crew do not allow people to board the bus without a mask. “Some listen, but many argue. Sometimes, the traffic policemen enter the bus and fine those who do not wear masks or ensure distancing. However, we need sanitisers on the buses. We are at risk as we interact with thousands of passengers every day,” he said. According to MTC officials, before the lockdown began, 34 lakh passengers used to travel on 3,300 MTC buses every day. However, after COVID-19 restrictions were imposed, the number of passengers dropped to 21 lakh, and now it is around 18 lakh. “It will drop even more due to the night curfew and Sunday lockdowns. But we are operating around 2,900 buses every day,” an official said. He said some buses, especially those plying through industrial areas, were still crowded during peak hours. “This happens primarily when bunching of buses on the same route occurs. But since the number of passengers has dropped, the crowd has dwindled,” the official added. Regarding sanitisers on buses, the officials claimed that they did not have the funds to procure them for each and every bus. “Initially, the Health Department provided us with sanitisers. Later, they asked us to procure it ourselves. We do not have the funds as we are already staring at huge losses. But we ensure that the buses are cleaned regularly,” an official said. A senior MTC official said steps were being taken to vaccinate the staff at the earliest. “There are a total of 21,000 MTC staff and of them, 11,000 fall under the above 45 category. Vaccination is for their safety as they have to interact with many passengers every day,” the official said. Autorickshaws and cabs Besides, the government order also stated that rental taxis and cabs should operate with a maximum of three passengers, apart from the driver. Autorickshaws can carry a maximum of two passengers, apart from the driver. “Regular autorickshaw drivers are following the government rules, taking public health into consideration. There are 1.1 lakh autorickshaws in the city. But the police and the government should tighten enforcement of share-autorickshaws,” said M. Sampath, general secretary, All Auto Driver Associations. S. Ezhumalai, president of the Chennai and Suburban Share Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union (CSSADU), claimed that crowds had reduced. “People are frightened to travel in crowded vehicles. But no norms are followed in unauthorised vehicles that ply as share autorickshaws, especially in the suburbs,” he said. P.R. Samy, general secretary, Tamilaga Call Taxi Matrum Anaithu Vaagana Otunar Sangam, said all the drivers were following the norms strictly. “There is strict enforcement from the police. Our members, who drive for different app-based taxi aggregators, also inform the customers to wear masks and follow the rules,” he said. K. Bhavaneeswari, Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic, said the traffic police personnel were conducting awareness programmes on the importance of wearing masks and ensuring physical distance at traffic signals. “We also ensure strict enforcement,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/adherence-to-covid-19-norms-poor-in-public-transport/article34372186.ece
21 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||After Railways, MTC makes vaccination must for staff||Days after circulars issued by Southern Railway and the Integral Coach Factory, asking staff to take the COVID-19 vaccine or proceed on leave triggered a controversy, the Metropolitan Transport Corporation, Chennai, has asked its employees to compulsorily get the jab. In a circular issued on Monday, the MTC’s general manager said that if employees failed to take the vaccine without a doctor’s approval for any specific medical reason, they would not be entitled to special medical leave if they test positive for COVID-19. He said the Transport Department was a service sector working directly with the people. Drivers and conductors had to be in close proximity to thousands of people on a daily basis, he said. “With the onset of the second wave of COVID-19, the State government has advised compulsory vaccination — either Covishield or Covaxin — for all those aged 45 and above to protect them from the virus,” he said. ‘Sensitise staff’ Senior officials, supervisors and others were told to sensitise employees aged 45 and above and take steps to ensure that they get vaccinated. All transport employees should wear masks, maintain physical distance and follow other safety norms, the official said. Centre of Indian Trade Unions Transport Federation general secretary Arumuga Nainar said it was not correct on the part of the management to force the staff to get the jab. Instead, awareness camps should be organised to educate the employees on the benefits of vaccination, and they should be persuaded to take the vaccine, he said. “The vaccination drive covering the 18,000-strong workforce should be planned in such a way that an employee gets the jab the day before his/her weekly off. In case anyone develops fever or pain, an additional day’s rest or leave should be allowed. The same pattern of vaccination should be followed for all State Transport Undertakings,” Mr. Nainar said. After the Railways issued a similar order, the All India Railwaymen’s Federation protested against the move and urged the general manager of Southern Railway and the Integral Coach Factory to withdraw the circulars, arguing that there was no provision to force employees to get vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-railways-mtc-makes-vaccination-must-for-staff/article34372206.ece
21 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Thunderstorms may continue over Western Ghats, northwest districts||The Meteorological Department has forecast that thunderstorms are likely to continue over Western Ghats districts and northwest parts of the State till Saturday. A north-south trough running up to interior Tamil Nadu across Vidarbha between 0.9 km and 1.5 km above mean sea level triggered thunderstorm activity over parts of the State. During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, Pechiparai, Perunchani dam and Puthan dam in Kanniyakumari district received 7 cm of rain, the highest amount in a single day.  Scattered rain Officials of the Meteorological Department said there would be scattered rain on Wednesday in various districts, including Salem, Tiruchi, Erode, Madurai and Krishnagiri. One or two places in the Western Ghats districts have a chance of thunderstorms with heavy rain, owing to the wind instabilities. However, thunderstorms may cover a lesser area from April 22 and would be limited to the Western Ghats districts. Dry weather may prevail over other parts of the State and Puducherry, and residents may feel sultry weather as humidity levels may be around 50%-80%.  Hot weather Day temperatures had breached 40 degrees in some districts, including Kancheepuram, Vellore and Tiruvannamalai, on Monday. On Tuesday, southerly and south-easterly winds that prevailed during the most part of the day helped in bringing down the soaring day temperature. Tiruchi and Vellore recorded the highest day temperature of 39 degree Celsius. The weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam registered 35.5 degree Celsius and 37.4 degree Celsius. Residents may have felt uncomfortable weather as the humidity level was at 79%. Officials noted that thunderstorms would occur due to convective activity, which was seasonal. The change in wind pattern and dry weather also influenced peaking temperature.   There may be scattered rain on Wednesday in Salem, Tiruchi, Erode, Madurai and Krishnagiri||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thunderstorms-may-continue-over-western-ghats-northwest-districts/article34371785.ece
21 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||U.K. variant in 14 samples from community clusters||A total of 14 samples that were lifted from community clusters that surfaced in some parts of the State and were sent for whole genome sequencing (WGS), have returned positive for the U.K. variant of COVID-19. According to official data, eight samples from the Thanjavur school cluster (two each from schools in Ammapettai, Kulichapatti and Thiruvisainallur, and one each from schools in Thalavapalayam and Puthur); two samples from the Commercial Tax Staff Training Institute, Nandanam; two from the Omandurar Medical College; and two from the IT cluster - AGS Health Pvt Limited, Kandanchavadi and Taramani, were referred to InSTEM, Bengaluru for WGS. The 14 samples returned positive for the U.K. variant. Earlier, public health officials decided to send randomly selected samples from clusters for WGS. A total of 69 COVID-19 samples from community clusters were referred for WGS. The results of 14 samples were received, while those of 55 others are pending. All 14 cluster samples were tested at the State Public Health Laboratory, and it was found that the S-gene (spike protein) was missing in them. Further analysis “This finding needs further analysis. We need to work with academic institutions like the Indian Council of Medical Research,” T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, said. The State has so far referred 127 RT-PCR-positive samples to InSTEM, Bengaluru, and the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for WGS. These were samples lifted from U.K. travellers and their contacts, and community clusters. Of these, the State has received the results of 62 samples, while those of 65 others are awaited. A total of 29 samples — 15 from U.K. travellers and their contacts and 14 from community clusters — returned positive for the U.K. variant. Another 25 samples returned negative for the variant, while the results of eight samples were inconclusive, according to the data.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/uk-variant-in-14-samples-from-community-clusters/article34371811.ece
21 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Anna University’s new exam pattern comes with its set of challenges||Anna University’s decision to change pattern of examination has come as a surprise to students and some affiliated college faculty. The university will conduct end-semester exams in the online mode for first, second and third year students. Final year students will take the multiple choice questions-type paper. Under the new pattern, each question paper will be for 50 marks, lasting 90 minutes. Students must answer five 2-mark questions and five 8-mark questions, which will be analytical in nature, requiring them to be thorough with the subject. The university has said students may refer to textbooks or resources on the web. Teachers are awaiting more clarity though. They wonder how subjects such as Total Quality Management, Management Principles or Communication English would fit in the new pattern. The new pattern has come in the middle of the semester when colleges have completed two of the three assessment exams.  New experience A. Ramesh, principal of Chennai Institute of Technology, said: “It will be a new experience for faculty as setting the question paper will require them to ensure answers are not easily accessible to the students,” he said. The college would use the new pattern for the upcoming third assessment tests and train them for the final exams, he said. Teachers are concerned about the lack of textbooks, particularly among students in rural and remote areas. The college plans to make notes of lectures and send it as PDF to students. The principal of another affiliated college in a western district said the institution had arranged to courier the textbooks to students. “We regularly purchase books for students as they have already paid the fees for books. We have 142 students,” he said. “The students should be conversant with the text and anticipate tough questions. The tentative date for exams for second and third year is May 25 and June-end for the first year students. The final year students are expected to take their exams on April 25 but so far we have received no information,” he said. K.G. Parthibhan, principal of Aditya Institute of Technology, believes the change will augur well for students. The faculty in his institution had been downloading textbooks from the internet to provide to students. “Students should attend online classes and be attentive. In rural areas students have taken up part time jobs to overcome their economic conditions. It will take time to bring them back to pre-COVID-19 times. If we mentor them we can ensure good results,” he said. Not all are as enthusiastic, however. The principal of a college in Kancheepuram district said in his college around 85% of students were from rural areas and as much as 70% of them were the first generation graduates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/anna-varsitys-new-exam-pattern-comes-with-its-own-set-of-challenges/article34372197.ece
21 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State receives 6 lakh doses of Covishield||Tamil Nadu on Tuesday received six lakh doses of Covishield. Health minister C. Vijayabaskar, who inspected the consignment, told reporters that the State was awaiting a consignment of five lakh doses of Covaxin. Till date, the State has received 55,85,720 doses of vaccines and 48,07,148 doses have been administered. Dr. Vijayabaskar said wastage of vaccines was inevitable as the State did not want to deny anyone who wanted a dose. Besides, awareness about vaccination was low and there were also rumours being floated about the vaccines, he said. He said a person who may walk into a clinic in a rural centre could not be denied vaccination, fearing wastage. Wastage would reduce when more people were administered the same, he explained. From May 1, when everyone aged over 18 would be permitted to take the vaccines, wastage would automatically reduce, he said. So far, 8,82,130 doses of Covaxin have been administered and the State has received one lakh additional doses. It is expecting another five lakh doses shortly, health officials said. Till date, 41,21,783 people have received the first dose of Covishield and 6,85,365 people the second. As on date, the State has 1.45 lakh doses of Covaxin. “We have a sufficient stock of vaccines, and 4,487 COVID-19 vaccine centres are functioning in the State. We got 1 lakh Covaxin doses two days ago and have distributed it to all centres. Today, we got six lakh Covishield vaccines. So far, the State has received 55,88,720 doses of vaccines and 48,07,148 have been fully administered,” Dr. Vijayabaskar said. The State has a capacity to manufacture 400 tonnes of oxygen and a storage capacity for 1,200 tonnes, whereas the State’s medical facilities consume only around 240 tonnes, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-receives-6-lakh-doses-of-covishield/article34371813.ece
21 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. to permit private COVID-19 Care Centres||The Greater Chennai Corporation is planning to permit the private sector to start COVID-19 Care Centres for patients with mild symptoms. Private hospitals have been asked to contact the Corporation for getting permission to run the private care centres through tie-ups with private hotels or other agencies that own property. Currently, the Corporation has more than 12,000 beds in COVID-19 Care Centres. Of them, 1,487 beds are occupied. With the city registering more than 3,700 cases every day, the demand for care centres is expected to increase. Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash on Tuesday announced that the civic body would give clearance for private COVID-19 Care Centres. “Blanket clearance has been given to the private sector to start private care centres with the required medical team and infrastructure,” he said. Ensuring more facilities “This is to ensure more facilities across the city in a short span of time and also to lessen the pressure on the health infrastructure,” he said. The civic body would offer free services at its care centres and would not regulate prices at the private COVID-19 Care Centres. “It is the market that will decide. Besides, this is purely based on the choice of the individual. The GCC expects that the number of private care centres would be known only after the rollout happens,” Mr. Prakash said. “A tie-up between hospitals and hotels is not necessary for getting a permit for a COVID-19 Care Centre. If the hotels have in-house medical teams, that’s enough,” he said. Pointing to an increase in regulation by civic officials, Mr. Prakash said compliance with wearing masks had gone up in the past few days. “The establishments that are having high footfalls are behaving with more discipline. Vaccination for all above 18 has been planned with specific target groups that have the potential to become super-spreaders,” he said. GCC Joint Commissioner (Health) Alby John Varghese said the Corporation had decided to actively encourage private practitioners to refer symptomatic people for free testing at Corporation centres. “So, if you have symptoms, you can tell the fever survey worker, who will guide you to get tested. Walk-ins are also permitted. Residents are advised to go to a fever camp or urban primary health centre and get tested. Residents can go on their own to one of the centres of the Corporation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-to-permit-private-covid-19-care-centres/article34372193.ece

Telecommunication and related activities, warehousing functions, including loading, unloading and storage of goods, have also been permitted during the night curfew and Sunday lockdowns, a G.O. issued in this regard by Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan stated. “In the case of other industries that are not exempted, essential maintenance for purposes of fire, machine and worker safety shall be permitted on Sundays,” it said. Units manufacturing drugs, pharmaceuticals, sanitation materials, oxygen, medical devices, medical textiles, their raw material components and their intermediates, food-related/food processing industries, including food for poultry, pets and animal husbandry and units engaged in the production of agricultural inputs including fertilisers, agricultural machinery and their components, could be considered “industries manufacturing essential commodities”, and hence, the night curfew and Sunday lockdowns would not apply to them, it stated. All export units, those with export commitments or orders and their vendor units providing inputs to such industries, units that supply components/equipment for the defence sector, industries of automobiles and their components used in defence, agriculture and health sectors and those that produce packaging materials for all the above categories would also be considered “industries manufacturing essential commodities”.

21 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Southern Railway keeps 299 isolation coaches ready on tracks||With infections surging in the State, the Southern Railway has kept 299 of its coaches, converted into isolation wards, ready on tracks across its network to accommodate over 4,500 persons requiring quarantine facilities. Though 573 coaches were modified during the first wave of COVID-19 last year, 274 were inducted back for passenger train operations. Last March, the Ministry of Railways had approved the conversion of second-class coaches into isolation facilities, with oxygen and other basic medical infrastructure. Workers needing stay The Southern Railway has been witnessing a sharp increase in the number of migrant workers seeking accommodation in trains to travel back to their home States. The zonal chief, in a note, appealed to the workers not to panic as a sufficient number of trains were being operated to several States from the southern destinations. A total of 45 trains would be operated per week, on various days, from the 11 originating points in Tamil Nadu and Kerala to Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Assam and Jharkhand. These are considered key States from where migrant workers arrive to the southern region. Care centres With an increase in the demand for beds, the Tamil Nadu government has revived COVID-19 Care Centres in the State. Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said 35,118 beds were made available so far, though only 5,784 people had got admitted. “We are appealing to asymptomatic people who test positive to move to COVID-19 Care Centres because beds in hospitals are required for patients with moderate or severe conditions,” he said. Dr. Vijayabaskar said the flattening of the curve would not be possible without full-fledged public participation. Complacency remained an obstacle in achieving a reversal of the ongoing trend since a large number of people seemed “relaxed” when it came to wearing of masks.

Despite organising awareness programmes at important railway stations and making announcements on suburban trains on the need for wearing masks and maintaining physical distance, the Chennai Division of the Southern Railway found that a majority of commuters were not adhering to the rules. As a result, the Southern Railway, based on the Railway Board’s recommendations, announced that a fine of Rs. 500 would be imposed on commuters not wearing masks. The collection of penalty was effected from April 17 under the Indian Railway Rules (Penalties for activities affecting cleanliness at railway premises), under which a group of railway officials, including the Station Master/Manager, Railway Protection Force personnel and commercial staff, were empowered to enforce it. A senior official of Southern Railway said that since the announcement on fines was made, more than Rs. 2.5 lakh had been collected from 500 passengers. More than Rs. 1.5 lakh was collected on Sunday alone. Fines were collected from commuters who were found not wearing masks at railway stations and on trains (both express and suburban). The Southern Railway has also formed a special squad to inspect and penalise non-compliant commuters. The official said the penalty drive was implemented only to educate and make the commuters aware of the importance of following COVID-19-appropriate behaviour on railway premises, and not with the intention of collecting fines as a source of income.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/commuters-fined-for-flouting-rules-on-trains/article34372188.ece

Mounds of unsegregated garbage have been piling up in the garbage segregation yard belonging to Pallavaram Municipality, with waste strewn on the road margins. Early on Tuesday, a fire in the garbage yard resulted in thick smoke polluting the nearby localities, causing hardship to residents and motorists. With several high-rise residential apartments and commercial establishments on the radial road, the fire inconvenienced thousands of residents. It was later put out by the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services personnel. Malini Narasimhan, a resident of a multi-storeyed apartment on the radial road, said the thick smoke emanating from the garbage dumpyard caused headache and breathing problems. She wanted the municipal authorities to take steps to prevent such fire accidents in the future. Rise in incidents Social activist V. Santhanam complained about frequent fire accidents occurring in the garbage transit yard, and said officials were yet to take any preventive steps.

21 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MNM wants more protection to counting centres||Raising doubts over certain alleged activities near strong rooms, where Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) containing votes polled in the Assembly elections are being kept ahead of counting on May 2, Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan on Tuesday asked for additional protection at the counting centres. Speaking to reporters at the Secretariat premises in Chennai after submitting a petition in this regard at the office of the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Haasan said strong rooms should be true to their names. The repeated malfunctioning of the CCTVs in the counting centres, the “mysterious” movement of containers near the counting centres, the unannounced installation of Wi-fi facilities near the strong rooms and the movement of unauthorised persons with laptops near the strong rooms, among others, raised suspicions among the minds of the people and candidates, Mr. Haasan claimed.  Voters’ confidence “The rules [for protection of safety of EVMs] have to be followed strictly. The voters should have the confidence of the Commission in this regard. As it is, 30% of the voters did not vote. These incidents would raise doubts among the people and it poses the danger of people losing trust. It poses a danger to democracy,” the actor-turned-politician said. Mr. Haasan said his party was receiving several complaints of other natures, and claimed that movement of vehicles near the counting centres during unearthly hours and unannounced construction activity near them, only added to the doubts of the people. Referring to an incident in Chennai in which EVMs were taken on a scooter by unauthorised persons, he said: “We cannot say that EVMs are sanctimonious. They have been in unauthorised possession.”  The rules [for protection of safety of EVMs] have to be followed strictly. The voters should have the confidence of the Commission in this regard||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mnm-for-more-security-at-counting-centres/article34371786.ece

A release said the 39-year-old patient was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease four years ago, which affected the small intestines, causing severe ulcers, abdominal pain and weight loss. S. Arulprakash, senior consultant and clinical lead - gastroenterology and hepatology, MGM Healthcare, said after a detailed examination, it was decided that an enteroscopy would be performed using the novel motorised spiral equipment. “A narrowed part of the intestine was dilated. This new endoscopic technique helped us in avoiding a major surgical procedure that would have included removal of the affected part of the intestine.

Thirumavalavan on Tuesday said the Chief Secretary, as the head of the “caretaker government”, must take appropriate steps to bring the second wave of COVID-19 under control. In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan said the Chief Secretary must take immediate steps to procure testing kits, oxygen cylinders and vaccines after the Union government removed its stranglehold on the State government. “Any further delay will lead to more deaths. COVID-19 infections are expected to peak in May. It is important to vaccinate the majority. The shortage of vaccines is resulting in medical infrastructure in Tamil Nadu not being put to proper use,” he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said Tamil Nadu would need to procure three crore vaccines to inoculate those aged 45 and above, and this number would increase from May 1 as the Union government had allowed vaccines to be given to everyone aged 18 and above. “Adequate vaccines should be procured and sent to the districts. A substantial number of people should be vaccinated before April 30. The Chief Secretary has a responsibility to act swiftly during a medical emergency,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/act-now-to-arrest-spread-vck-chief/article34371817.ece

The court refused to grant any such exemption after observing that the court would not interfere in an informed decision taken by the State government to ban the nets in toto to conserve marine resources. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy rejected the PIL petition filed by Fishermen Care, a private organisation, after observing that the State government, in its counter affidavit, had categorically stated that it was only the affluent fishermen owning mechanised fishing boats who use purse seine nets to scoop out fish from the territorial waters. The judges said it was the prerogative of the executive to take decisions in public interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-rejects-plea-to-let-fishermen-use-banned-nets/article34372353.ece

21 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Don’t go in for total lockdown’||The Tamil Nadu government should not consider imposing a full lockdown to combat the COVID-19 spread as it will cause immense hardship to more than 3.5 crore daily wage labourers, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said on Tuesday. “Full lockdown will not be a solution for the rising number of COVID-19 cases. The Tamil Nadu government should give up such an idea. We saw last time itself that the daily wage workers, drivers, taxi drivers, lorry drivers, farm workers and others were the most affected. If the government implements a full lockdown, it cannot provide food to all of them all the time,” he said. Mr. Alagiri also announced that the party has set up a committee to help COVID-19 affected patients across the State find hospital beds and get medical treatment. The 24-hour helpline number is 98844 66333, he said. According to him, on Tuesday morning itself, the helpline number received a call and the party members coordinated a hospital bed for the person.

21 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Industries and businesses cut down working hours||Micro units, small-scale industries, traders and hoteliers here are shutting down businesses early as restrictions related to operation at night hours came into effect on Tuesday. The State government has announced curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. till April 30 in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19. According to the hoteliers, they should shut down at 9 p.m. So, the hotels will close for customers at 8.30 or so. “Most of the customers walk in for dinner between 8.30 p.m. and 10 p.m. The restrictions will impact dinner service. There will not be parcel services too after 9 p.m.,” said a hotelier here. The Federation of Trade Associations, which includes nearly 15 associations, has asked its members to down shutters by 7 p.m. from Wednesday. The Federation represents traders in hardware, electrical, paper, textile machinery, clothing, jewellery, etc. While textile and jewellery retailers have sought exemption from the night hour restrictions, the others are expected to close down business early, said C. Balasubramanian, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. For the clothing, jewellery, and FMCG retailers, weekend sales are high. They will have to close down on Sundays. Hence, they may not be able to down shutters early on weekdays too, he said. Night shifts The Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) are expected to operate night shifts as usual. “We met the Collector on Monday and had appealed to the MSME Department officials too. Units that operate night shifts will need to ensure that there is no movement of workers outside and the unit owners will give an authorisation letter to the workers,” said MV Ramesh Babu, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association. No overtime work J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, said the micro units normally operate two shifts and allow overtime work in the morning and evening hours. “Now, overtime work during evening hours will not be possible. Micro units doing job work to sectors such as automobiles and pumpsets will be affected,” he said. In the case of textile units, following a representation from the industry, the State government has permitted vertically integrated and export units to operate at night. The other units will adjust the shift timing so that the restrictions are not violated. However, the industry has again appealed to the State government to consider spinning, weaving, and processing units as continuous process sectors and permit night operations, said K. Selvaraju, secretary general of Southern India Mills' Association.   While textile and jewellery retailers have sought exemption from the night hour restrictions, the others are expected to close down business early C.

21 April 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Broadcast veteran introduces podcast to senior citizens||With an experience of five decades in radio and television and having been closely associated with the community radio movement since its inception in India, R. Sreedher is a veteran in broadcasting. A resident of a retirement home near Coimbatore, he recently started a podcast by and for the senior citizens. Mr. Sreedher, then the Head of the Department of Media Sciences at Anna University in Chennai, was instrumental in setting up the Anna Community Radio in 2004, which is regarded as the first community radio in India. Having lived in New Delhi, he said that he moved to Tapovan Senior Citizen’s Foundation in Madhampatty about five months ago “Senior citizens are a community themselves,” he told The Hindu on Tuesday. With podcasts now burgeoning across country, the 74-year-old Mr. Sreedher decided earlier this year to set up a podcast for those residing in the retirement home and named it ‘Tapovani’ after the retirement home. He uploaded the first podcast episode on the audio streaming platform I-Radio on March 13 featuring a violin performance of a senior citizen V. Sridhar. As of April 18, there were 47 different episodes uploaded that featured performances of devotional songs, storytelling and interviews, all by the residents of Tapovan. Around 15 members are involved in recording, editing and uploading these podcasts on a voluntary basis, Mr. Sreedher noted. Apart from I-Radio, the podcasts are also available at platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. “Making them (senior citizens) tech-savvy is our success,” he remarked, when asked whether the senior citizens faced difficulties in coming to grips with the technology of podcasting. Mr. Sreedher added that he is planning to feature residents of the villages close to the retirement home to broadcast their music and their issues. According to P.G. Sampathkumar, a resident of Tapovan, who assists Mr. Sreedher in uploading the podcasts, the response from the residents has been positive. “When we began this project, we were not sure whether there would be any interest,” he said. M.N. Varadarajan, chairman of Tapovan Senior Citizen’s Foundation, commended this initiative. “He has given the senior citizens an opportunity to express themselves,” he said. Every retirement home could set up a podcast at a low cost to showcase the talent of the senior citizens there, Mr. Sreedher suggested. “They have some energy left. They have some creativity also. Let them use their creativity well,” he signed off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/broadcast-veteran-introduces-podcast-to-senior-citizens/article34371849.ece

21 April 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. to shift onion traders to Eru Company||From Wednesday, wholesale onion traders would function from Eru Company, Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian said on Tuesday after inspecting the MGR Wholesale Market and a few other places. Officials, who accompanied him, said the shifting was to decongest the MGR market to ensure traders and visitors adhered to COVID-19 safety protocol. The Corporation considered the possibility of moving them to the Mettupalayam Road bus stand, as it had done in 2020 when the lockdown was in effect, but decided against it because the bus stand was in use. The Corporation chose Eru Company because wholesale tomato traders from the Market continued to use a portion of the bus stand. Asking the onion traders to move to the bus stand would decongest the Market, and lead to overcrowding in the bus stand. The officials said the Corporation would provide toilet facility and water connection to the traders, who would have to erect temporary shelters to store goods and conduct business. MGR Wholesale Market trader A. Subramani said around 30 traders dealt with onion. Though they were only one-third of the total trader strength, the volume of onion they traded overshadowed other vegetables. The market saw 600 tonnes onion exchange hands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-to-shift-onion-traders-to-eru-company/article34372207.ece

K. Joshua, and S. Vijayan, in the course of investigation. The infamous ISRO espionage case has its genesis in a case registered at the Vanchiyoor police station on November 13, 1994.

Owing to the depleting stocks, persons who lined up to get the jab were turned away in many government and private hospitals. R. Bhama, a 59-year-old resident from Doak Nagar, who went to Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) on Tuesday to receive her second dose of Covishield, was asked to return home due to shortage in availability of vaccine. Sources say that there are no vials of Covishield available in GRH for the past couple of days. "We have informed the authorities about the shortage, and they have informed that they will send the next batch soon," said Medical Superintendent M. Balasubramaniam. The shortage is also reported in private hospitals too. Varun Ramamurthy, Consultant Intensivist, Corona Care Team of Velammal Medical College Hospital and Research Institute, said that there is a shortage of vaccine at the hospital too. "We get the contact number of the beneficiaries and promise to inform them when the vaccines are available," he added. With the government's announcement to vaccinate all those aged above 18 from May 1, there is a need for better planning and availability of sufficient vaccines, say health department sources. V.P. Manikandan, a social worker, said that the shortage of vaccines was causing severe inconvenience to the public. "The government must publicise the contact details of the health officials in each of the Urban Primary Health Centres, so that the public can check about the vaccine availability," he said. S. Sridhar, a resident of Simmakkal, said that the government must establish a separate website to help the public know about the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. However, Deputy Director of Health Services K.V. Arjun Kumar said that Covishield vaccines had been dispatched on Tuesday to various districts. A total of 22,190 doses of Covishield have been dispatched to Madurai. "The vaccines will reach Madurai on Wednesday," he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shortage-of-covid-19-vaccines-causes-concern/article34372287.ece
21 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Closure of tourist spots hits stakeholders||Acting on the State government's orders, popular tourists destinations in Madurai district have closed their gates to visitors in the wake of rising COVID-19 positive cases. This has impacted the livelihoods of various stakeholders of the tourism industry. Major tourist destinations like Thirumalai Nayak Palace, Gandhi Memorial Museum, Government Museum, World Tamil Sangam and other spots with historical significance have been closed. Devotees are allowed to enter Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple only at fixed timings and through two gates.

Kaniraj, a tourist guide for the past 25 years, said that there had been a significant drop in the inflow of tourists from other districts and States since April 1. "With no income last year due to COVID-19 lockdown, we started to earn income slowly from January. But, the imposition of new restrictions now will mean that we will have no income for the next few months," he said. He complained that the government did not provide any help to the tour guides last year. Suthagar Selvaraj, Founder of Madurai Eco Tourism- a tour booking operator, said that various stakeholders like taxi operators, autorickshaw drivers, shopkeepers, tour guides, restaurants and hotels are affected because of the new restrictions imposed by the government. "The government must hold talks with the stakeholders to identify ways to provide relief to the stakeholders," he added.

21 April 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court dismisses pleas pertaining to toll plaza, collection||The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court dismissed a petition that sought a direction to the authorities not to collect toll at the Chittampatti toll plaza for those vehicles that use the State Highway 191 (Melur, Thiruppathur, Karaikudi, Pudukkottai, etc). The court was hearing the petition filed by advocate R.M. Arun Swaminathan who sought an exemption of the vehicles using SH 191. He said that the vehicles proceeding towards Melur, Thiruppathur, Karaikudi, Pudukkottai do not pass through the entire stretch of the toll road. These vehicles use less than 15 km of the road, but were compelled to pay the toll amount. An adjustment should be made so that the road users are charged according to the distance travelled by them and not the full distance, he said. A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi took note of counter affidavits filed in the case that said the concessional rates of toll were available for different categories of road users who frequent the toll road. If an individual had to frequently travel through the toll road but not the entire distance then a concession was given, the court was told. Taking note of the submissions made in the case, the court dismissed the petition filed by the advocate. The court also dismissed a petition filed by S. Joel, who sought direction to the authorities to shift an existing toll plaza on the Madurai Thoothukudi expressway, to its original location as per the concession agreement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-dismisses-pleas-pertaining-to-toll-plaza-collection/article34372282.ece

21 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Officials ramp up monitoring of home isolation cases||With the recent spike in new cases in the second coming of the coronavirus, health officials have ramped up monitoring of home isolation cases through a combination of remote and door-to-door outreach measures designed to guide recovery by avoiding a hospital visit as far as possible. Proportionate to the spurt in new COVID-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic has been the enlargement of the pool of home isolation cases in the Union Territory. Health officials estimate that there has been a 20-fold increase in COVID-19 cases compared to the figures in early March. This trend has simultaneously pushed up the number of home isolation cases in the Union Territory. As on Tuesday, of the 5,073 active cases, 4,169 patients were in home isolation. “With 80% of patients testing positive for COVID-19 remaining asymptomatic, the focus is on guiding their recovery without the need for a hospital visit, ” said T. Arun, Health Secretary. The first point of triaging is at local PHCs, where a patient who tests positive is evaluated to determine between hospitalisation or home isolation, based on ICMR guidelines. If closely monitored and followed by at the level of each PHC, very few home isolation patients experience aggravation of symptoms to a state of emergency that warrants their hospitalisation in a critical care facility. “This is more or less the strategy everywhere as hospitalising an asymptomatic patient will use up precious resources, from beds to clinical care, that are otherwise critical for the treatment of the moderate-to-severely ill coronavirus patients,” he said. A team of over 300 anganwadi workers has been tasked with carrying out door-to-door visits to check on the health status of patients on a daily basis. In addition to this, ASHA volunteers are carrying out daily house visits as part of surveillance measures. Consultation services The outreach measures also include consultation services over the IVRS and a round-the-clock helpline 104. At a recent video call with ICMR experts, chaired by Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, the home monitoring strategy was one of the elaborately-discussed issues. The expert advice of an ICMR panel, led by Prabhdeep Kaur, was to equip anganwadi workers with pulse oximeters to check oxygen saturation levels of patients on alternate days and to develop intermediary care (COVID care centres) in between hospital and home isolation points of care. Mortality analysis “What we are also seeing from our death audits is that during surveillance visits, people hesitate to disclose whether they are running a temperature or suffering from a headache or body pain. Many of these persons may have been infected and by the time they turn weak and require hospitalisation, precious time in diagnosis and treatment is lost,” Mr. Arun said. In fact, mortality analysis in the second wave is virtually mirroring the 2020 pandemic pattern. Late diagnosis and delay in reporting to hospital is contributing to 75% of recent COVID-19 fatalities, the Health Secretary said. In a majority of recent deaths, patients who died with 24 hours to 48 hours of hospitalisation had waited for five or six days without undergoing a test for their symptoms and reached a healthcare facility only after severe breathing difficulty. Health officials have appealed to everyone to visit a PHC and get tested for coronavirus symptoms, such as a persistent cough, running nose, or fever. Officials also urged for utmost compliance with safety protocols — masking, hand sanitising and social distancing, along with the fourth pillar of vaccination — as one of the distinguishing features of the second wave of the pandemic has been its unusually high transmissiblity. Street-level zoning and partial restrictions in a radius around areas with high number of home isolation cases is also being implemented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/officials-ramp-up-monitoring-of-home-isolation-cases/article34372358.ece

21 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Jipmer issues advisory on referrals of critically-ill COVID-19 patients||JIPMER has issued an advisory for referral of critically-ill COVID-19 patients from other hospitals in the wake of an increase in the number of serious and critical patients requiring hospitalisation. A press note from JIPMER said that the institution was trying its best to accommodate such patients while also trying to maintain its non-COVID operations as far as possible. It also stated that in recent days, many critically-ill COVID patients referred from other hospitals have arrived at JIPMER’s COVID-care facility without any prior intimation. “This leads to unnecessary delay and affects patient care adversely, particularly when the receiving facility is exceptionally busy or a vacant bed is not available,” JIPMER Director Rakesh Aggarwal said. In the interest of patient safety, JIPMER has urged that any hospital or clinic wishing to refer a serious patient, who needs oxygen or intensive care or has significant co-morbidities, should contact the institution in advance over phone — the numbers were being shared directly with the neighbouring hospitals — and over the email covidreferraljipmer@ gmail.com The transfer may be initiated only after JIPMER confirms that a bed with appropriate facilities has been earmarked for that particular patient. Patient’s interest This would avoid the unpleasant situation of a serious patient reaching JIPMER and having to return because of lack of a bed. The press note also stipulated that only a referring doctor who knows the patient’s clinical details should call the shared numbers. Patients or their relatives are advised not to contact on these numbers or email ID, and their queries would not be entertained, the press note said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jipmer-issues-advisory-on-referrals-of-critically-ill-covid-19-patients/article34372356.ece
21 April 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||U.T. to revive Rs. 500 fine for violating home quarantine norms||The administration will revive the Rs. 500 fine for those violating home quarantine norms, Health Secretary T. Arun said on Tuesday. The fine, which was in place during the 2020 pandemic phase, would be re-notified shortly, he said at a press conference. Last year, the government had imposed Rs. 500 for those jumping home quarantine and Rs. 1,000 for violators of isolation norms as part of stringent measures to cut the spread of the virus. The Health Secretary said a dedicated ambulance fleet had been made available for the smooth transportation of COVID-19 patients from home to hospital or in between healthcare facilities. As part of this, an ambulance each has been provided to a cluster of three PHCs across eight zones for transportation of COVID-19 patients to a healthcare facility, he said. All that had to be done for anyone testing positive was to contact the helpline 104 and the ambulance would be despatched to the house of the patient. Mr. Arun pointed out that there has not been a single adverse reaction reported since the COVID-19 vaccination programme was rolled out in the Union Territory and had benefited over 1.7 lakh persons to date. Appealing to those who were yet to take the COVID-19 vaccination to utilise the service, which had been made available across multiple facilities, and the process simplified, Mr. Arun said there was no need for hesitancy or anxiety to take the jab as there had been no adverse incident even after vaccinating an estimated 12 crore of the population in the country so far. He also pointed out that while many States faced a shortage of vaccines, the Union Territory had stocks available. The proven strategy against coronavirus was to follow the simple measures of wearing mask, sanitising and social distancing and now, taking the vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ut-to-revive-rs-500-fine-for-violating-home-quarantine-norms/article34372359.ece

21 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Teachers from DIETs shifted to govt. colleges of education sans NCTE nod||The Department of Higher Education is understood to have transferred 31 lecturers from DIETs (District Institute of Education and Training) to government colleges of teacher education without the official sanction of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE). The National Council for Teacher Education has, so far, not given any written consent to the request made to that effect by the Higher Education Department of Tamil Nadu, official sources said. The Higher Education Department had effected the transfers earlier this year to ensure continuity of student admissions in the government colleges of teacher education during this academic year, after the NCTE barred admissions citing faculty shortage. The Principal Secretary of Higher Education had, in a letter addressed to the Chairperson of NCTE last November, requested for relaxation of the number of faculty in government colleges saying the recruitment process was underway. Later, a request was made seeking permission to proceed with admission process in government run colleges of education. Against the backdrop of the Model Code of Conduct for the Assembly elections, the transfer of teachers from DIETs to the government colleges was depicted as a stop-gap arrangement. “In the first place, the idea to transfer teachers from DIETs to government colleges is ill-conceived,” Jitendra Sharma, a former teacher in a government B.Ed. College in Rajasthan, who had sought a response from the National Council for Teacher Education on the issue through an RTI (Right to Information) petition, said. “he DIETs that were established with funds from the Centre after the adoption of National Education Policy 1986 function as nodal agency for providing academic and resource support for universalising education and catering particularly to elementary level education. Also, there is the issue of whether teachers of DIETs have been posted to the colleges with the approval of the affiliating Universities concerned,” Mr. Jitendra said. "No formal letter has been issued by the office of Regional Director of Southern Regional Council, NCTE, permitting the colleges to admit students in B.Ed. course after posting teachers of DIETs in the colleges,” Mr. Jitendra said. He added: “The NCTE must consider this whole issue in its entirety, and must not allow anything which is not as per its regulations. Else, it will set a bad precedent in other States.”  The idea to transfer teachers from DIETs is ill-conceived Jitendra Sharma Former teacher Government B.Ed.

The same flight would depart for Colombo at 11 a.m. The airline, which had been operating regular services daily in the Colombo- Tiruchi -Colombo sector prior to COVID-19 pandemic, suspended them in March last due to spread of the viral infection leading to nation-wide lockdown clamped all over the country. The Standard Operating Procedures and COVID-19 -related guidelines issued by both countries would be strictly adhered to, the sources said. Bookings had commenced. One of the conditions under the air bubble was that only passengers headed for Sri Lanka should be allowed to travel on the flight from Tiruchi.

21 April 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||This budding poet saw the pandemic lockdown as an opportunity||Vaishnavi Viswanathan, a 19-year-old college student from Rockfort City, has published a collection of poems with the hope of sharing her insights on the myriad experiences that have shaped her personality. Titled ‘Lilies of Life,’ the anthology of 42 poems explores themes related to the self and man’s role as a social being. “I have always preferred to express my innermost thoughts through poetry,” Ms. Viswanathan, who is pursuing her final year BA Literature and Language from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetam in Coimbatore, told The Hindu . “All my poems are about me, but they don’t actually speak directly about me. I like poetry because you don’t have to write everything out in detail to be understood,” she added. Currently attending online classes from home in Tiruchi, Ms. Viswanathan said she was excited by the whole process of publishing her work. Positive response “It took me two months to put the collection together. The lockdown gave me an opportunity to organise my poems and write some more to round out the anthology,” she said. “The initial response from my readers has been quite positive; most have remarked on its serious and philosophical tone. But I am open to criticism and honest feedback too, as that is what improves the work of a writer,” according to Ms. Viswanathan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/this-budding-poet-saw-the-pandemic-lockdown-as-an-opportunity/article34371794.ece
21 April 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Open book examination the best option in current situation?||Open book online-proctored test announced by Anna University seems to have caught the attention of senior professors of Bharathidasan University. Further refining the initiative pioneered last year by Delhi University in the country, Anna University has allowed students to refer to course material in print and in the web, but considers any form of discussion among students as malpractice. All questions, according to engineering college heads, will be of analytical type for which no direct answers could be found in reference books. ‘Not easy as it sounds’ According to a senior professor of Bharathidasan University, open book exam is not as easy as it sounds. It requirespresence of mind on the part of students to know how to chaff out the answer from reference books within the specific time duration. “There is a misconception about open-book exam is easy. Since this type of exam tests students' ability to quickly find relevant information based on an understanding and analysis of the subject with a frame of critical thinking, it is, in fact, tougher than closed book exams,” K. Parthasarathy, Vice-Chancellor of Tamil Nadu Open University, said. The open book examination is the best option in the current situation, Mr. Parthasarathy said. Teachers of affiliated colleges where students from remote villages study do have an apprehension that open book examination may not be suitable in a situation where internet connectivity is not uniform. Factoring in these concerns, Bharathidasan University has decided to go ahead with conducting exams in the descriptive mode for this semester. “The question papers for multitudes of subjects have already been set and the scope for trying out examination in MCQ [multiple choice question] format does not exist,” Gopinath Ganapathy, Registrar, BDU, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/open-book-examination-the-best-option-in-current-situation/article34371795.ece
21 April 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Only a few passengers opt for long-distance travel||As the restrictions imposed by the Tamil Nadu government a couple of days ago in the wake of ‘second wave’ of COVID-19 had adverse impact on the long-distance travellers as only a few passengers travelled in the long-distance buses operated during the day on Tuesday. The restrictions enforced on the operation of long-distance buses from Tuesday onwards had adverse impact on the number of passengers travelling in the State Express Transport Corporation buses. As the SETC operated the long-distance buses to destinations like Chennai from 7 a.m. on Tuesday, only a few passengers undertook the daytime journey from Tirunelveli. “The first bus to Chennai left Tirunelveli at 7 a.m. and the last bus at 10 a.m. since we’ve to reach Chennai before 10 p.m. as stipulated in the newly imposed restrictions on operation of buses. Since most of the travellers don’t prefer the tiresome daytime travel under scorching heat, the number of travellers is very low. Most of the buses left for their destinations with less than 25% of their total capacity,” said the driver of a SETC bus leaving for Chennai. On noticing the number of passengers travelling to Chennai is very small, the conductors took the passengers even to Kovilpatti or Virudhunagar the towns situated en-route. However, the buses operated from Tirunelveli to places like Coimbatore, Tiruchi, Salem and Tirupur had a sizable number of passengers. At the same time, the passengers expressed concern over the non-availability of buses to Nagercoil after 8 p.m. Collector V. Vishnu, who had a virtual meeting with senior subordinates on Tuesday on implementing the curbs imposed by the State Government and the total lockdown on Sundays, said the regional and taluk level surveillance teams should act tough against the violators by slapping fine on them. He said the officials should monitor the number of persons participating in weddings and funerals for which the government had given a guideline to curb crowding. Participants of these events should strictly follow the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Moreover, the marriage halls, community halls, cinema theatres, markets, restaurants, shopping malls, supermarkets should be forced to scrupulously follow the norms stipulated by the government to check the spread of viral infection. “If any violation is noticed, seal the business establishments,” said Mr. Vishnu adding that Rs. 55.96 lakh had been collected as fine so far from the violators. The Collector said ‘kabasurakudineer’ was being given to the public when they come to the Corporation or the Collectorate to avail the official services. The inter-district check-posts and the police outposts across the district had been strengthened so as to check the travellers for COVID-19. He said that the public could get their doubts clarified by calling the control room via 0462 – 2501070 and send message (SMS or WhatsApp) to 63740 13254 or 94999 33893. Police Commissioner of Tirunelveli City T.S. Anbu, Superintendent of Police, Tirunelveli District, N. Manivannan, Tirunelveli Corporation Commissioner G.

21 April 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Migrant workers leave before completing quarantine period||A group of 16 migrant workers from Jharkhand, who were employed in a private spinning mill in Vellakoil and tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in April, have allegedly left for their hometowns a day before their 14-day quarantine period ended. According to sources in the Health Department, the 16 men aged between 19 and 27 tested positive on April 6 and were admitted to the Tiruppur Government Medical College Hospital. Upon their discharge after a week, the workers were asked to quarantine themselves for one more week till Tuesday. However, the mill authorities allegedly allowed the 16 migrant workers to be a part of a batch of 40 workers who left for Jharkhand in a bus on Monday, the sources said. While Health Department authorities launched efforts to trace them, the migrant workers were unlikely to spread the virus as the infectivity of most of the COVID-19 patients would come down by the 12th day, the sources said. Officials in Jharkhand would be alerted about their arrival, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/migrant-workers-leave-before-completing-quarantine-period/article34372214.ece
21 April 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Former bank manager arrested on charges of swindling Rs. 1.8 crore||The Tiruppur City Police arrested a former chief manager of a nationalised bank in the early hours of Tuesday at Coimbatore on charges of misappropriating Rs. 1.8 crores. Police said T. Dhandapani (60) was the chief manager at the S.R. Nagar branch of Indian Bank from August 2019 to May 2020. During this period, he allegedly misappropriated money from the fixed deposits of 12 customers. The accused allegedly forged documents to show that these customers took loans, and even changed their mobile phone numbers while withdrawing the cash so that the customers would not be notified of the change in their account balance. He was suspended in May 2020, following which the Regional Manager (Erode) of Indian Bank S. Senthilkumar conducted an audit based on complaints from the 12 customers, who were told by the bank that they took loans when they visited to withdraw cash on maturity. Upon confirming the misappropriation of Rs. 1.8 crores, Mr. Senthilkumar submitted a complaint to Tiruppur City Commissioner of Police G. Karthikeyan in February this year, the police said. Subsequently, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) police registered a case against Dhandapani under Sections 409 (Criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (Using as genuine a forged document), 477 A ( Falsification of accounts) and 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code. Based on a tip-off that the accused was residing in a gated community on Nanjundapuram Road in Coimbatore, a team from CCB led by Assistant Commissioner of Police K.

Popular spots including the Government Botanical Garden in Udhagamandalam, the Rose Garden, the arboretum, as well as the Sims Park and Kattery Park in Coonoor, were all closed to tourists. Officials from the Department of Horticulture said that workers living near the parks and gardens would continue to maintain these. Gudalur was largely crowd-free as tourists from Kerala and Karnataka were also prevented from travelling to the district. The Ooty Municipal Market saw a decrease in the number of visitors. Many shopkeepers and tradesmen were seen without masks. They said that other protocols such as physical distancing and limitations to the number of people visiting each shop were difficult to enforce. Police as well as officials from various local bodies maintained a strict vigil, ensuring that the few remaining tourists and residents wore masks and maintained physical distancing. Boatmen at the Ooty Lake and Boat House staged a protest on Tuesday, stating that the restrictions announced by the government had put their livelihoods at risk. Thulasi Das, a boatman, said that they were suddenly told that the Boat House would be closed from Tuesday onwards. “The Tourism Department charges Rs. 680 for a boat ride with eight passengers, and Rs. 1,150 for 15 passengers. But they give us only Rs. 50 per ride. We have to make do with this income. Now even this has been taken away from us,” he said. The protesters demanded a minimum wage for the duration of the lockdown either by the district administration or the Tourism Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/towns-wear-deserted-look-as-the-nilgiris-closes-to-tourists/article34371843.ece
21 April 2021||VIRUDHUNAGAR,TAMIL NADU||When a differently abled man stands for his right||The latest directive of the Election Commission to have one table per 250 sq. feet at each counting hall and other new procedures for completing formalities for each round of counting of votes polled in the Assembly election have forced Virudhunagar district administration to convene a meeting on Tuesday to seek opinion from the candidates to have an additional counting halls. But there was no consensus among the candidates. At the meeting held at the conference hall in the Collectorate, a differently abled man, appointed as a counting agent by a candidate, stood firm on his demand for proper facilities at the counting centre on May 2. Superintendent of Police P. Perumal sought cooperation from the candidates and their agents in parking vehicles. “Vehicles should be parked 100 metres away from the counting centres and all will have to walk to the centres from there,” the SP said. It was then that the differently abled man got the microphone and sought help from the officials. He said he should be allowed to get dropped closer to the counting centre. It was then, someone in the meeting hall said, “Please don’t bring more differently abled persons for counting.” Many of the participants laughed at the comment. The differently abled man quipped: “It is not something to be laughed at. I am only asking for my rights.” His statement was so powerful that the entire hall fell silent. Collector R.

21 April 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Cheques given to family members of fireworks accident victims bounce||Cheques issued by Mariyammal Fireworks licencee and lessees to family members of 27 workers, who were killed in a gory fire accident reported on February 12, have bounced because of insufficient funds. The kith and kin lodged a complaint with Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan, seeking the district administration to initiate criminal proceedings on cheque bounce charge against the owner/lessees to ensure that the compensation of Rs. 4.50 lakh each reached them. According to Virudhunagar District Fireworks and Match units Workers’ Association, affiliated to Centre of Indian Trade Unions, the accident at Achankulam near Sattur was a direct fallout of flouting of safety norms and illegally leasing out the fireworks unit. Its district secretary M. Mahalakshmi said that revenue officials received the cheques from the owner/lessees and after proper verification of the legal heirs handed over the post-dated cheques. “Even then, we had objected to issuing cheques dated March 5 fearing that the owners/lessee could cheat the family members of the kin. We also wanted the revenue officials to take responsibility for the issue,” she said. However, the officials were keen only to make the family members take over the bodies in order to solve the problem then. Stating that the family members were illiterate and poor, and that they could not take legal measures against the defaulting persons, the association sought the intervention of the Collector to take legal course and ensure that the families are suitably compensated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cheques-given-to-family-members-of-fireworks-accident-victims-bounce/article34371836.ece
21 April 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Counting of votes may take over 24 hours||The counting of the votes for the April 6 Assembly election is likely to take over 24 hours due to the latest directive of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to restrict the number of counting tables to one per 250 sq ft and other new procedures for completing the formalities for each round of counting. The Virudhunagar administration had earlier planned to use 14 tables for each round in each counting hall, measuring 1,900 sq ft to 2,700 sq ft. It had also chosen new venues with bigger rooms to ensure adherence to the COVID-19 norms stipulated by the ECI, Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan told the candidates of various political parties and their representatives at a meeting held to discuss the counting procedure on Tuesday. The ECI had stipulated that the size of the counting halls should be at least 2,000 sq ft to ensure distancing. Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, the poll panel brought in the 250 sq ft norm for counting tables. In the case of the Virudhunagar Assembly constituency, the officials had planned to use 14 tables for each round in the counting hall, measuring 2,225 sq ft. With 325 polling booths, it would have taken 24 rounds to complete the process. But with the new ECI norms, only eight tables are allowed in the hall.  Candidates divided When the District Election Officer convened a meeting to get feedback from the candidates on having an additional counting hall for each of the seven Assembly constituencies in the district, there was no consensus among the candidates on the matter. While the DMK’s representative agreed to have a second counting hall, other candidates opposed the idea, claiming it would create confusion. Some were apprehensive about having two counting halls for the same constituency in different buildings or on different floors. “We will inform the ECI that no consensus was arrived at with regard to increasing the number of counting halls. We will follow the decision of the ECI on this issue,” Mr. Kannan said. Verifying numbers The official also explained to the candidates and the counting agents that after each round of counting, the general observer would have to verify the numbers in two counting units in each round. Besides, only after the details are uploaded on the ENCORE (Enabling Communications on Real-time Environment) system of the ECI would each round be officially declared by the Returning Officers. “Till such time, the next round of counting will not be taken up. Hence, each round will approximately take 40 minutes,” Mr. Kannan said. An official said it would take at least 27-and-a-half hours to complete the EVM-based counting for 41 rounds in the Virudhunagar Assembly constituency. However, another official expressed the confidence that after the initial rounds, the process could be expedited. “If the ECI increases the number of tables or permits additional halls, the process could be completed much faster,” he added. After the completion of the final round of counting on the control units, the officials will randomly pick five VVPATs in each Assembly constituency and manually count the printed votes and verify them with the EVM-based count. This process will take more time.  If the ECI increases the number of tables or permits additional halls, the process could be completed much fasterAn official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/counting-of-votes-may-take-over-24-hours/article34371822.ece

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Patients unhappy with lack of basic facilities at care centres||As fresh cases of COVID-19 continue to surge, health authorities have set up two more COVID care centres in Tiruchi. But there are concerns over lack of basic facilities at the venues. The Nehru Memorial College at Puthanampatti near Thuraiyur and Kurinji Engineering College near Manapparai are the new centres identified to accommodate patients. It is learnt that each of them can accommodate 120 to 150 patients. The hostels used by boys were identified to convert them as care centres. It was aimed at accommodating patients with mild symptoms belonging to the surroundings of Manapparai and Thuraiyur at the new centres. They were in addition to the two centres established in Tiruchi such as the city campus of Bharathidasan University at Khajamalai and Government College of Engineering at Sethurapatti. They have the capacity to accommodate about 740 patients at any given time. It is alleged that they do not have basic facilities except drinking water and toilets. Most of them are common toilets. Moreover, the centres do not have other facilities such as oxygen and hot water. “During a pandemic situation like this, most patients have no other option but to accept facilities offered by the government. But we need separate toilet facilities for patients. It is a must,” said a patient discharged from the COVID care centre at Khajamalai. Many of them are of the view that makeshift centres can be established with sufficient water, toilet and basic medical facilities to treat patients with mild symptoms. There should be foolproof arrangement to clean the toilets frequently to check spread of infection. N. Jamaludeen, a social activist, says patients are often asked to drink hot water and inhale steam. But the patients admitted to COVID care centres are hardly given hot water. The services of the hospitality industry can be roped in to provide basic amenities to the patients, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/patients-unhappy-with-lack-of-basic-facilities-at-care-centres/article34371801.ece

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Horticulture farmers express concern over transport of produce||Horticulture farmers in delta districts fear that imposition of night curfew might affect their business since vegetables and other produce are transported only during the late hours to major markets in far off places. Pointing out that their business has just started picking up after relaxation of lockdown regulations, the farmers say the night curfew will push them back to square one. Perish in the fields? “We will be left with no option other than to leave the produce in the fields to perish as traders will not be interested in purchasing them in the absence of public transport,” says G. Srinivasan, a progressive farmer of Ganapathi Agraharam. Such a situation prevailed in the delta region during the nationwide lockdown imposed last year. Hence, the State government should relax the night curfew regulation for movement of perishable commodities, which will not only help farmers in marketing their produce but also ensure uninterrupted supply of vegetables and other perishable commodities to consumers in urban localities. AC buses “If that is not possible, air-conditioned buses available with State Express Transport Corporation can be operated as goods carriers after removal of seats to transport vegetables and other horticulture produce to major cities and towns from rural pockets,” he adds. Meanwhile, inquiries with Southern Railway sources reveal that enough space is available in goods wagons attached to passenger trains operated to several destinations within and outside the State. A slight modification in rules pertaining to delivery of goods can be worked out considering the pandemic situation, the sources say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/horticulture-farmers-express-concern-over-transport-of-produce/article34371796.ece

If that does not succeed, then we can think of other measures,’’ he said. He was speaking to journalists after a meeting to review the COVID-19 situation in the district. He said that the situation was under control. “We are vaccinating 5,000 people per day and testing around 3,000 per day. There is no need for a war-room as of now. It can be set up if needed,” he said.

21 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Centre approves ORR and airport lines||The city has taken another step towards realising its dream of metro connectivity to the airport. The Union Cabinet on Tuesday finally approved Namma Metro’s Phase 2A (ORR Line) and Phase 2B (Airport Line) totalling a length of 58.19 km at an estimated cost of Rs. 14,788.1 crore. While the State had given its approval for the two crucial lines for transit in Bengaluru two years ago, the delay in Union government clearance had held up the project. If all goes as planned, the project will be completed in five years. The proposal was included in the 2021-22 Union Budget and was accorded Cabinet approval on Tuesday. Railways minister Piyush Goyal, who briefed the media after the Cabinet meeting, and Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, hailed the project for its “transformative impact on the city’s commute”. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa took to Twitter and thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While Phase 2A will connect Central Silk Board Junction to K. R. Puram via Outer Ring Road (19.75 km and 13 stations), Phase 2B will connect K.R. Puram to Kempegowda International Airport via Hebbal Junction (38.44 km and 17 stations). The two phases put together will connect key hubs such as Electronics City, Bellandur, Marathahalli, K.R. Puram, Nagavara, Yelahanka and KIA. It will come as a boon to office goers as it will connect the IT corridor of the city to the airport. “Once completed in the estimated 54 months, this project will play a key role in decongesting the city which contributes 40% to India’s IT exports and is home to a large number of IT parks, hubs and industries; many of which are located on the route,” Mr. Puri tweeted. Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) had already begun preparatory works for the project and work on Phase 2A can start in a short while. Sources in BMRCL said land acquisition for Phase 2A is complete, and tenders for civil works finalised but were kept in abeyance for the Union Cabinet approval. “Now that the Union Cabinet has approved the project, the work orders can be issued soon,” a senior BMRCL official said. Meanwhile, land acquisition for Phase 2B is 90% complete and the financial bids for the tenders yet to be opened. While there has been no clarity on the Centre’s share, sources said it will be around Rs. 2,000 crore. The State government is expected to invest 35% of the project cost, sources said. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had approved a loan of USD 500 million (approximate Rs. 3,860 crore) in December 2020 and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) signed an agreement with Government of India in March 2021 to give a loan of estimated Rs. 3,717 crore for developing an estimated 80 km of metro line including Phase 2A and Phase 2B. BMRCL has signed agreements with tech and real estate firms under innovative financing schemes to build metro stations at various locations.  Once completed in the estimated 54 months, this project will play a key role in decongesting the city which contributes 40% to India’s IT exports and is home to a large number of IT parks, hubs & industries; many of which are located on the route Hardeep Singh Puri, Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/centre-approves-orr-and-airport-lines/article34372166.ece
21 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Oxygen shortage: Hospitals ask families to shift patients||Although the State government has been claiming that there is no shortage of liquid medical oxygen, many hospitals continued to ask their admitted patients to shift to other facilities as they are running out of stock. Government helplines 108 and 1912 were flooded with calls seeking help. Since Tuesday morning, the Emergency Response Team (ERT), a volunteer group, has been getting many calls from desperate families. ERT volunteers said they have got several calls from families of patients admitted in as many eight hospitals in various parts of the city on Tuesday, requesting help in finding oxygenated beds. At Athreya Hospital in Chandapura, families of five critical patients had been informed on Tuesday morning that oxygen stock would not last more than half an hour. “Following our desperate pleas, the Bengaluru Urban District Health Officer (DHO) G.A. Srinivas visited our hospital and made some temporary arrangements to last for a day. On his assurance, we have sent a truck with 20 jumbo cylinders for refilling from the Peenya Refilling plant. However, we lost one of the five patients,” said Narayan Swamy, hospital medical director. Prasanna H.M., president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), said many smaller hospitals are shelling out five-six times more than the regular price for procuring oxygen from vendors in neighbouring States. “It is difficult to get even if we are ready to pay the high cost. I managed to buy 2 kilolitres from a vendor in Hosur on Tuesday paying Rs. 95 per metric tonne as against Rs. 22 per metric tonne. If the situation continues, my hospital will stop admitting patients from Wednesday,” he said. Disputing the government claims of ‘no shortage’, Dr. Prasanna said, “Let the health officials visit each hospital to check the ground reality. Unless the liquid re-fillers supply more to the vendors, they cannot supply to us.” He hoped the government’s assurance of diverting industrial oxygen for medical purposes would materialise soon. “The oxygen war room that has been set up to facilitate supply to hospitals is of no use. Hospitals who call up the war room are being reprimanded for the high consumption,” he claimed. Bengaluru Urban DHO Srinivas said he visited several hospitals on Tuesday and assessed the demand. “The problem is many smaller hospitals is that they do not have storage capacity for more oxygen. They have to refill their existing cylinders as and when they become empty. We have made arrangements for these hospitals to send their cylinders to be refilled at the Peenya plant,” he said.  Call centre Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said that a round-the-clock call centre to monitor supply of oxygen and Remedisivir to hospitals has been set up. “We have deputed 29 personnel who will work in three shifts from Wednesday itself to ensure smooth supply,” he said. JSW Steel to help JSW Steel has agreed to supply 400 tonnes of liquid oxygen per day to the State to treat COVID-19 patients. This comes after a meeting between Mines and Geology Minister Murugesh R. Nirani and the representatives of JSW Steel led by Deputy Managing Director Vinod Nowal. The Minister, who convened a meeting with representatives of several steel companies who produce liquid oxygen for their use in steel production, called upon them to produce oxygen in huge quantity to address the public health emergency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/oxygen-shortage-hospitals-ask-families-to-shift-patients/article34372171.ece
21 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘720 minors begging or hawking on city streets’||A survey conducted on the direction of the High Court of Karnataka has identified 720 minor children engaged in begging or hawking in 432 hotspots across the city, and 27 of these children appear to be forced to do so by a mafia. While pointing out that 492 of these children are below the age of 10, the survey has pointed out that 52 children are engaged in begging as a profession, 219 children are begging or hawking on account of family problems, 76 infants are being carried by their mothers or caretakers either for begging or hawking. As many as 337 children are connected to persons who are engaged in construction and other small works, and nine children are handicapped or disabled, the report stated. On a mafia controlling 27 children, the survey report said: “Upon talking to them, the children were found speaking different languages. There is a strong doubt with regard to these children belonging to their handlers as there are major differences in colour, mannerism and language of these children, and these children were found frequently revealing different names to the public.” The report recommended immediate action to rescue these children from their handlers. “If proper investigation is carried out in respect of these suspicious groups with 27 children, the issue of missing children can be cracked,” the report stated. The Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA) submitted the report after conducting the survey during January-March 2021 with the help of various NGOs, law students, para legal volunteers, officials of the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the city police, and other departments of the State government. The survey used a mobile app – We are 4 child – developed with the help of Kochi-based Abhishek Krishnan, a founder of Strofes Technologies, for collection of data.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/720-minors-begging-or-hawking-on-city-streets/article34372163.ece
21 April 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Differing voices emerge on lockdown, other measures||The all-party meeting chaired by Governor Vajubhai Vala on the COVID-19 situation in the State had leaders reaching no consensus on the “strong measures” to be taken by the State government for containing the rise in cases. While the Congress favoured stricter implementation of the recommendations of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), the JD(S) suggested a total lockdown for 15 days. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, who opposed the meeting chaired by the Governor to start with, suggested that the government put off all upcoming elections to urban and rural local bodies such as zilla and taluk panchayats. Testing should be made mandatory for people visiting from other States, he said. He also said the government should go for stricter implementation of the recommendations of the TAC, while night curfew and lockdown were not solutions. The government showed laxity in the implementation of the suggestions made by the TAC in November last on the possible second wave of COVID-19, he charged. Another former Chief Minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy, strongly favoured a total lockdown and urged the government to provide financial support to the poor for one month for the purchase of essential items. He suggested that the government stop development works this year and focus on providing better health infrastructure. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar said the government had failed to contain the virus since it was unable to fix the accountability among the Ministers. He suggested stricter execution of actions based on the TAC report andalsostoppage of development works forthe next one year. The Governor and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who is undergoing treatment for COVID-19 and participated in meeting virtually, heard the various suggestions made by the leaders of the Opposition parties. In his address, he said the government would take further steps considering the directions of the Governor and the Opposition leaders. During the past one year, infrastructure development in government hospitals was taken up on priority basis and as a result, there was a 12% increase in beds while the number of oxygenated beds had increased manifold with 29,667 beds. “An order has been issued to reserve 50% of the beds in private hospitals for COVID-19 patients. There is also no shortage of Remdesivir,” he said. Earlier, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar presented a report about COVID-19 cases in the State and the measures taken to control further spread of infections. Governor’s advice The Governor suggested that the State government to take strong steps for “a healthy Karnataka and not wealthy Karnataka”. In a press release, he said he had suggested to the government to take some strong steps and precautionary measures. The Governor chaired the 150-minute virtual meeting from the Raj Bhavan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/differing-voices-emerge-on-lockdown-other-measures/article34371891.ece
21 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||ULB polls: As COVID-19 cases rise, SEC restricts campaigning||In the midst of a pandemic expanding its tentacles further, parts of the State will be facing another election on April 27, close on the heels of the byelections to a Lok Sabha and two Legislative Assembly seats. Caught between a High Court order to hold elections and a demand for cancellation of polls from a section in political leaders, the State Election Commission (SEC) is in a fix. The rapid surge of COVID-19 cases has forced the commission to direct the candidates to restrict their campaigning to door-to-door visits with less than five persons. Elections to as many as 10 urban local bodies (ULBs) in Ballari, Bengaluru Rural, Hassan, Chickballapur, Shivamogga, Ramanagaram, Bhadravathi, Madikeri, and Bidar districts are scheduled on April 27. Districts such as Chickballapur, Bidar, Ballari, and Hassan have a high active caseload already. As the elections heated up with local politicians campaigning and crowds swelling, an anxious SEC on Monday restricted campaigning. ‘Put them off’ Early last week, in light of COVID-19 spreading in Bidar, Janata Dal (S) Legislative Party deputy leader Bandeppa Kashempur had urged that the elections be put off. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) this week demanded the same. However, sources in the SEC defended the elections to ULBs, stating that it was a High Court-mandated election that they had to hold.“Elections are being held to ULBs in these districts after a gap of over two years. The elections had been stalled because of legal wrangles over reservation,” a source told The Hindu . A senior official said, “If we put off the elections, there is a fear of facing the wrath of the court. Before deciding to go ahead with the schedule, we consulted legal experts on the implications of putting off the elections after the notification was issued.” The official said that the Election Commission was still holding Assembly elections in West Bengal. “If the second wave had hit before the notification of the schedule, the commission would not have announced the dates.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ulb-polls-as-covid-19-cases-rise-sec-restricts-campaigning/article34371895.ece
21 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Nodal officers for apartments to prioritise testing||With an increasing number of apartment complexes and multi-dwelling units becoming hotspots, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has now decided to test residents living in these communities. In this regard, the civic body has appointed nodal officials for each zone, who will coordinate with the representatives of the zonal apartment welfare associations. On priority The nodal officials have been instructed to test residents of apartments and multi-dwelling units that have evinced interest in getting tested for COVID-19 on priority and later rope in the remaining residential communities in the zones. Bed availability The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike will also be deputing nodal officers across all hospitals to ensure that beds are available for those in need. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, BBMP’s chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that these nodal officials, under the supervision of the jurisdictional medical officers of health, will be directed to check if patients admitted in the hospitals needed medical intervention. Admission of those who don’t need medical intervention was one of the main reasons for shortage of beds, he said. Mr. Gupta estimated that with the active case load increasing by the day, nearly 11,000 beds may be required. Demand for oxygen Shortage of beds isn’t the only the concern. “The demand for oxygen has increased nearly fivefold. We will have the nodal officers also look into whether oxygen is being administered only in cases that need it,” said Mr. Gupta, adding that the government has constituted a committee to address this shortage. Some hospitals are yet to hand over the beds. “We have already issued notices to such medical facilities. We will not hesitate to initiate stringent action against such institutions. We also considering closure of out-patient departments in such private medical facilities,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nodal-officers-for-apartments-to-prioritise-testing/article34372169.ece

21 April 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Extensive damage even after negative report: Autopsy||An autopsy on a 68-year-old female COVID-19 patient’s body, who died on April 5 in a city hospital, has revealed that her vital organs - lungs, brain and kidneys - had been damaged extensively although she had tested negative on the 12th day. The autopsy revealed that the cause of death in this case was Acute Myocardial Infarction. The autopsy, the second in the city, was done on April 7 by Dinesh Rao, who heads the Department of Forensic Medicine in Oxford Medical College and Research Institute. “We did the autopsy following a request from the patient’s son as he wanted to know the exact cause of death,” Dr. Rao said. The patient, who was admitted for three days, was advised home isolation despite her comorbidities - diabetes and hypertension. However, she developed respiratory complications after 12 days and was rushed to the hospital again when she tested negative. She died on April 5. “Unlike in the first autopsy on a 62-year-old patient in October last year when RT-PCR swabs revealed the virus was active in the mouth, throat and nasal area 18 hours after death, the swabs from six regions in this second body were RT-PCR negative. But her lungs, brain and kidneys were extensively damaged,” he said. “She had developed lung fibrosis and together both the lungs weighed around 900 grams. The virus that had infected her brain and kidneys could not be detected by RT-PCR,” he added. “Her comorbidities were the underlying causes, while COVID-19 was the main factor. The RT-PCR negative reports of the six swabs indicate the possibility of different mutated strains of the virus or the delay in postmortem sampling,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/extensive-damage-even-after-negative-report-autopsy/article34372172.ece

These failures are resulting in an egregious violation of the Fundamental Right to Life of all persons in India,” said a statement. They pointed out that seriously ill patients are running from pillar to post to get admitted even while some private hospitals are refusing to take them. “Those admitted have received exorbitant bills ranging from Rs. 3-5 lakhs. Hospitals in turn are discharging seriously ill patients on the premise that oxygen is not available.” The collective noted that civil society and volunteer groups, that are trying to bridge the gap, are “overwhelmed with the endless demands for oxygen, sometimes from hospitals”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-under-fire-for-failure-to-prepare-for-second-wave/article34372168.ece

In response, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said such meetings led by the Governors were taking place in all the States. “The Prime Minister has spoken to the Governors of all the States and asked them to join hands in tackling COVID-19,” Mr. Bommai said. “It is not that the Governor is holding a meeting only in Karnataka. Even in the Congress-ruled Rajasthan, the Governor is holding such a meeting. Can we say that the elected government there has failed?” He also asked the Congress to desist from “politicising the issue”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/is-state-under-governors-rule-asks-cong/article34371898.ece

21 April 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Wild elephant chased back into the forest||Operation Jumbo launched by the Forest Department to send back a wild elephant that had strayed onto Karnatak University campus on Saturday night finally succeeded on Tuesday. After entering the university campus, the pachyderm subsequently moved to Lakmanhalli locality on Monday giving a sleepless night to foresters and also the residents of the surrounding areas. On Monday afternoon, the rescue team of foresters sensed that the pachyderm was getting dehydrated and splashed water on it. A team of 50 forest officials and employees was deployed to keep a watch on the movement of the elephant and it camped behind the Police Training Academy on Kalghatgi Road where the elephant was spotted on Monday. Subsequently, during early hours of Tuesday, the tusker was spotted at Nayakanhulikatti and the forest officials, led by Deputy Conservator of Forest Yashpal Ksheersagar, launched an early morning action to chase the tusker back into the forest. Traditional drums were used to scare the elephant and as the movement of vehicles on the Hubballi-Dharwad Bypass Road was reduced during the early hours, they managed to get the elephant cross the bypass road and then chased it towards the forest. They finally succeeded in getting the pachyderm enter the forest region through Mandihaal. Mr. Ksheersagar said that much to the relief of the residents, the elephant had been chased back into the forest and there was no need to panic now. After getting separated from a herd, the bull elephant had strayed onto the university campus in search of food, he said. In fact, the forest officials had summoned expert mahouts and veterinary doctors from Binkadakatti Zoo near Gadag and also three pachyderms, two bull elephants and a cow elephant, from Sakrebailu Elephant camp in Shivamogga. But the officials did not press them into service as before they could do so, they managed to get the tusker cross the bypass road and send it back into the safety of the forest. Mr. Ksheersagar lauded the efforts of all those, including the foresters, involved in the operation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/wild-elephant-chased-back-into-the-forest/article34371884.ece

21 April 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Off-loading of passengers from overcrowded bus criticised||Monday’s action by Udupi Deputy Commissioner in getting excess passengers from an overcrowded bus offloaded at Kallianpur-Santhekatte for defying COVID-19 protocol came under severe criticism after the video of a student airing her difficulties went viral on social media platforms. The girl, apparently an undergraduate student, said that she went to her college in Udupi as there was a semester examination. “Otherwise, I would have stayed home,” she said. There are very few direct buses to her place, Shiriyara near Siddapura, from Udupi operating at a frequency of about half an hour each. “Every bus during the peak hours get overcrowded and getting us off the bus without offering any alternative arrangement was inhuman,” she lamented. The girl also said that even the next bus to her destination came fully packed and there was little chance of her reaching home before nightfall. In a surprise drive on Monday evening, Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha flagged off a private bus operating from Udupi to Siddapura in Kundapur taluk at Kallianpur-Santhekatte and made passengers travelling standing to alight. They included many women, students and the elderly. Besides imposing fine on the bus operator for violating COVID-19 protocol, Mr. Jagadeesha also asked the conductor to refund fare to passengers who were off-loaded. Though keeping a check on occupancy in buses was good in view of the spread of the pandemic, the administration should have made elaborate plans to enforce the rule, said those responding to the girl’s video. Some said checking should be done at the starting point of the service instead of midway so as not to inconvenience passengers. The administration should also ensure that adequate buses were available for passengers to follow norms. Sufficient buses Meanwhile, Udupi Additional Deputy Commissioner B. Sadashiva Prabhu said that the administration has asked the Transport Department to ensure buses operated at high frequency during morning and evening peak hours. Enough buses already operate on the said route and there was no need for overcrowding at this juncture, he said.  On Monday evening, Udupi Deputy Commissioner stopped a private bus that was overcrowded and got those standing and travelling on it alighted keeping in view COVID-19 norms||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/off-loading-of-passengers-from-overcrowded-bus-criticised/article34372300.ece

Vedavyas Kamath on Tuesday urged the police not to randomly tow away vehicles parked in No Parking zones. He suggested that personnel entrusted with towing such vehicles should make an announcement before lifting them, he told the police. A communiqué from MLA’s office here said that Mr. Kamath gave this suggestion at a meeting with senior officials, including Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar and Deputy Commissioner (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar, regarding traffic management in the city. The MLA said that residents were complaining about random lifting of vehicles even if they are parked for an emergency, including buying medicines from a chemist and the like. He said that vehicles should not be towed away without first asking owners to remove them from No Parking zones. Towing of vehicles without intimation to owners frustrate vehicle users as they have to approach different police stations without any clue about the whereabouts of their vehicles, he said. As such, police should fine tune the towing system, the MLA added. Fisheries Development Corporation Chairman Nitin Kumar, the former Mayor Divakar and others were present with the MLA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fine-tune-lifting-vehicles-from-no-parking-zones-mla-tells-police/article34372302.ece

Somashekar on Tuesday said there was no dearth of beds and medical oxygen for COVID-19 patients in Mysuru. Speaking to reporters after a surprise inspection of K.R. Hospital where critically-ill COVID-19 patients are treated, the Minister said though the cases are surging in Mysuru, the pandemic situation was still under control.

The present 13 kl liquid oxygen supply capacity tank would meet the needs of the patients admitted to K.R. Hospital, the doctors told the Minister. Mr. Simha also said there was no shortage of oxygen for the patients at this juncture. The people, instead of showing laxity, must strictly follow the rules for controlling the spread. “Earlier, infected persons used to stay indoors but now they are moving out of their homes. This will affect the steps being taken for controlling the situation.” On the vaccine availability, the Minister said as many as 47,000 doses of vaccine had been supplied to Mysuru to meet the immediate vaccination needs in fight against the pandemic. “The situation is not alarming in Mysuru despite the spike. I will discuss with officials what steps are necessary to be taken foreseeing further spikes in cases. It could be making more beds available, oxygen supply, medicines and so on.” The Minister later visited the Trauma Care Centre on KRS Road which will be treating COVID-19 patients from Wednesday. Mr. Somashekar, the MP and others inspected the building, beds, and reviewed all other arrangements made by the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute.

21 April 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Vishwanath lashes out at govt. over its ‘failure’ to tackle COVID-19||Former Minister and BJP MLC A.H. Vishwanath on Tuesday lashed out at his own party government in the State for its ‘failure’ to tackle the situation arising out of COVID-19 pandemic. Expressing concern over worsening of the situation, he criticised the government for “behaving as though nothing was wrong” even when a large number of people in the State, particularly in Bengaluru, were dying following the ‘collapse’ of medical infrastructure. “Even the last rites are being denied to the dying”, he bemoaned. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, Mr. Vishwanath referred to Health Minister’s reported statement that people were themselves responsible for roaming around freely and causing a spike in the number of cases. “It is an irresponsible statement from the Minister”, Mr. Vishwanath said before cautioning the Minister against blaming the public. Reacting to a statement by another Minister that the situation in Karnataka was not as bad as it was in a few other States, Mr Vishwanath wondered whether the Minister was waiting for a worse situation than the present when the afflicted patients are not finding hospitals, beds and oxygen. Mr. Vishwanath said that he was making such statements against the government even though he was part of the ruling party as he would be deceiving himself if he does not say so. The BJP MLC said the Ministers had not been given any powers by the Chief Minister to take any decision. All the decisions had to be taken by the Chief Minister, he said and claimed that the IAS officers were not listening to the Ministers. “What is the need for a Cabinet when even the Ministers themselves say that the Chief Minister will decide ?” ‘No coordination’ Also, there is no coordination between the Ministers, Deputy Chief Ministers and the Chief Minister, he claimed. Taking serious exception to Governor Vajubhai Vala chairing an all-party meeting to discuss the COVID-19 situation in the State, Mr. Vishwanath said the Governor intervenes only when an elected government fails to deliver. “Has the government failed in tackling COVID-19? Is that the reason why the Governor is stepping in?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vishwanath-lashes-out-at-govt-over-its-failure-to-tackle-covid-19/article34371988.ece

The civic body will be floating a fresh tender to complete the 2.5-km elevated corridor. BBMP Chief Engineer (Projects) N. Ramesh told The Hindu that the work, which was to be completed in 30 months by November 2019, is far from complete. Of the 81 pillars, only 67 have been constructed. Just around 50% of work has been completed. “We have already initiated the process of terminating the tender. We will have to float a global tender for the remainder of the work,” he said. The work had been contracted to M/s Simplex Infrastructure Ltd. and the work order was issued in May 2017. “Despite several notices to the contractor, there was no progress on the ground, which was inconveniencing many motorists and residents of surrounding areas,” said BBMP sources. Incidentally, Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) had terminated a contract with the company for pending work on an elevated section of the Pink Line on Bannerghatta Road. BMRCL floated a new tender and had pointed out that the contractor could not execute the work as per the tender conditions. B.T.M. Layout MLA Ramalinga Reddy said that the elevated corridor, which was taken up at a cost of Rs. 203.20 crore, was initially planned to reduce traffic congestion, besides reducing commute time by at least 30 minutes. “Several meetings were chaired by the BBMP Chief Commissioners and even the Administrator. The roads were in poor condition due to the ongoing work. For three years, there were no street lights on the 2.5-km stretch. The contractor just could not adhere to the tender conditions despite several notices,” he said, and added that he had utilised some special funds to repair the roads that had been dug up for shifting utilities, apart from installing new street lights along the entire stretch. “All that remains now is footpath repair. Hopefully, whoever bags the new tender will expedite the work.” Seven junctions along the corridor The elevated corridor from Ejipura to Kendriya Sadan will cover seven junctions – Ejipura Main Road-Outer Ring Road junction, Sony World junction, Kendriya Sadan junction, Koramangala 8th Main junction, Koramangala 60 feet road junction, Koramangala 5th Block, 1st A Cross junction, and Koramangala BDA junction. It is expected to ease vehicular movement to Tavarekere, M.G. Road, Halasoor Road, Agara, B.T.M. Layout, Koramangala, Sarjapur Main Road and Vivekanagar via Kendriya Sadan junction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-to-go-in-for-new-tender-for-ejipura-elevated-corridor/article34372160.ece

T. Somashekar. After reviewing the COVID-19 situation here on Tuesday, Mr Somashekar said the Mysuru district administration is fully prepared to face the resurgent pandemic. The government had been requested to supply another 4 lakh doses of vaccine to cover the targeted population. “The focus is on testing and vaccination since Mysuru happens to report the highest number of cases after Bengaluru.

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||No exam for classes 1 to 9||He also stated that the CCE should be used only as a tool to assess a student’s learning capabilities and help teachers identify gaps in learning that can be addressed as part of bridge courses at the start of the next academic year. Last year, following the outbreak of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, students had been promoted without any assessment. “Promoting students without any assessment for the second consecutive year will send a wrong signal. Teachers will assess the children and address the deficiencies through the bridge courses,” said the Minister. However, he added that all students from classes one to five must be promoted, as they had not attended any physical classes. For students from classes six to nine, who attended both online and offline classes, assessment should be based on class interactions, project work, homework, and learning capabilities. The Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka welcomed the decision, but urged the government to allow schools to hold online assessments for students in classes six to nine.

21 April 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||1,510 cases in Kottayam||Even as the emergency situation triggered by a second wave of COVID-19 continue unabated, a depleting stock of vaccine has put the health authorities in Kottayam on their toes. According to Jacob Varghese, District Medical Officer, Kottayam, the concerns over a community spread during the second wave coupled with the reports on increasing test positivity rate has pushed up the demand for vaccines to unprecedented levels. While the average daily demand for vaccines in the district stands around 14,000 doses, the doses actually supplied remains just over 8,000. The authorities are now planning to regulate the crowd by limiting the supply of vaccines to only those registered with the COWIN portal. The district on Tuesday reported 1,510 fresh COVID-19 cases and of this, 1,489 people contracted the virus through local transmission. The boarding dormitory of the regular batch of the KE School at Mannanam has been declared as an institutional cluster. The district currently has 9,115 patients.

21 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Garment major in the dock for misleading claims in ad||Two advertisements – one being featured on television channels about the “anti-viral properties” of a particular brand of shirts, vests and briefs, and another published in prominent Malayalam newspapers recently on an allergy detection camp – have drawn criticism from public health activists for their misleading claims. Case registered While the Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) has sought suitable modification or withdrawal of the ‘MCR antiviral shirts’ advertisements by May 4, the Kerala State Human Rights Commission has filed a case against the second one based on a complaint. The advertisements featured in prominent Malayalam newspapers last week said Chennai-based Specialty Diagnostic Laboratories would organise allergy detection camps at low charges for four days from April 16. The CCC observed after viewing the “antiviral shirts” advertisement that the claims “anti-viral shirts vests and briefs” and “each shirt has anti-viral technology, which throws away viruses” were not substantiated with technical data or test reports for product efficacy. “The claims are misleading by exaggeration and are likely to lead to grave disappointment in the minds of consumers,” said Manali Kulkarni, Executive-Complaints Handling, ASCI, in a mail. ‘Mislead viewers’ Given the current situation, the visual resembling coronavirus in the advertisement would also mislead viewers that the usage of the product would remove the virus. The CCC also observed that the disclaimers were not in the same language as the audio of the advertisement, and where the claim is presented as voice over, the disclaimer should have been displayed in sync with the voice over. Meanwhile, the Campaign Against Pseudo Science Using Law and Ethics (CAPSULE), Kerala, a wing under the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad, filed complaints with the Chief Minister’s Office, the State Police Chief, and the rights panel, pointing out that these events were held at a time when big gatherings were being avoided in view of the second wave of the pandemic. CAPSULE functionaries claimed that there was no information on the large-scale presence of an allergic disease in Kerala. However, most of the people might be allergic to one thing or the other. They might tend to avoid COVID vaccination if they detect it at the camp. The advertisement also does not clarify what type of blood tests were done, and the name, address, and authentication of the institution which conducted the tests. It was also not clear if the excess blood collected would be used for some other purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/garment-major-in-the-dock-for-misleading-claims-in-ad/article34371955.ece

According to him, the residents of about 400 houses in Mattuvayal, Padannayil and Azheekal areas of Elathur have been affected.A sand bund created near the estuary is blocking the flow of water into and from the streams. As a result, the water is stagnated and is filled with worms and waste. During the rain, the polluted water entered the courtyards of houses, said Mr. Mangariyil. Mr. Mangariyil suggested to the Council that a new canal should be built in the region, opening into the river, so that the high tide and low tide would ensure free flow of water into the streams, thus purifying them.

21 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Desperation as many fail to get vaccine||Desperation appeared to have set in among people in the district as they went from one vaccination centre to another in search of COVID-19 vaccines on Tuesday. The sharp surge in COVID-19 cases during its second wave, along with the gradual imposition of curbs, has sparked fear among large sections, especially the senior citizens. With the district’s vaccine reserve reaching its nadir, vaccination had to be confined to around 30 hospitals. Most of these health-care centres had less than 20 doses available for supply. Private hospitals have mostly run out of the vaccine. The vaccination drive took a massive blow as health authorities suspended vaccine supply at the Jimmy George indoor stadium, leaving many people who came even from far-off places return empty-handed on the day. Some of them came after collecting tokens the previous day. Satheesan, a Poojappura native, said he had come with the confidence of receiving vaccination at the centre after failing to obtain a token for a drive that was under way in his ward. Komalam from Chengalchoola had to return without getting vaccinated the previous day too. The 72-year-old woman had waited for three hours outside the General Hospital on Monday, but to no avail. Many elderly citizens claimed their second dose was due, after taking the first dose over a month ago. According to official sources, the district vaccine store has received 4,500 Covishield doses from the State’s reserves that would enable a few major public health institutions in the city to sustain the drive for five days, albeit in a low-key manner. Supply to four centres The health authorities have decided to allocate 500 doses per day to the General Hospital, 200 to the Government Medical College Hospital and SAT hospital combined, and 200 to the Women and Child Hospital, Thycaud. None of the other institutions will receive any more stock until the district receives the next batch. Other centres Besides the four hospitals, Covishield will be administered at the Peroorkada district model hospital, Chirayinkeezhu taluk hospital, Pozhiyoor primary health centre, Pallichal family health centre, Military Hospital at Pangode and in the Mudavanmugal ward of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation with the available stocks on Wednesday. The primary health centres at Panavoor, Poozhanad, Chettivilakam and Pangappara, and the Fort taluk hospital will provide Covaxin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/desperation-as-many-fail-to-get-vaccine/article34372370.ece
21 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Scramble for vaccination in all districts||Rising disease transmission and fears of vaccine shortage have led to a scramble for vaccination in all districts, raising the prospects of vaccination sites becoming COVID-19 dissemination centres. There is also the fear that unless the government takes steps to complete the vaccination of those above 60 years first, vaccine shortage may lead to many in the vulnerable group remaining partially immunised beyond the eight-week margin. Since the State’s primary concern is to protect the elderly , priority should be given to vaccinating them, it is pointed out. New concerns The current mess is likely to worsen when the Centre makes COVID-19 vaccination universal for all above 18 years from May 1. “When vaccination was opened up for the public on March 1, we began by vaccinating those above 60 years. After it was opened up for those above 45 years, there is no separate category for senior citizens. Many senior citizens who had taken their first dose in the first two weeks of March are now due for their second dose but many have had to go back disappointed from vaccination sites,” G.S. Vijayakrishnan, president of the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association, says. He says the dosing interval of Covishield is six to eight weeks after the first dose and even those senior citizens who got vaccinated on March 1 still have plenty of time to get their second dose, by which time, the vaccine supply position is expected to improve. Steps to avoid crowding Following a meeting called by the Chief Secretary on Tuesday, it has now been decided to streamline the process better to avoid huge gatherings at mass vaccination centres. Officials say the demand for vaccines just shot up after the vaccine supply situation in the State became precarious. “The rise in COVID cases and the concurrent situation of depleting vaccine stocks have had everyone rushing to take the vaccine. People are queuing up at mass vaccination sites since early morning. Registering everyone itself takes a long time,” says a senior official. It has now been decided to stop walk-in registrations, so that vaccines can be distributed in limited quantities to more vaccination sites. This will ensure crowd control and vaccines can be reserved at each site for those with registration. Senior citizens whose second dose is due can also schedule an appointment through CoWin. “The Thiruvananthapuram region is expected to receive 2.5 lakh doses on Wednesday. Mass camps cannot be run any more but all those who register online can get their shots by appointment,” says an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/scramble-for-vaccination-in-all-districts/article34371969.ece
21 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Provide vaccine free, PM urged||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide a sufficient number of COVID-19 vaccines free of cost to the States while expressing concern over certain aspects of the Centre’s new vaccine policy. In an open letter to Mr. Modi on Tuesday, Mr. Vijayan said the State had requested 50 lakh doses. However, it had received only 5.5 lakh vials. The scarcity had caused the government to stop mass vaccination camps and on-the-spot registrations. Mr. Vijayan requested Mr. Modi to allot the balance vaccine doses to Kerala at the earliest. The Centre should reassure the States that they would not have to compete with open market players to procure vaccine vials, he said.  Mr. Vijayan said the Centre had asked the States to get the vaccine from manufacturers at a price. However, State governments are weighed down by additional financial commitments precipitated by the pandemic. Given the present situation, the States required to provide vaccine free to the public. The additional burden of purchasing vaccine would strain State finances further. The economic downturn precipitated by the pandemic persisted, he added. Affordable price The Centre should fix an “affordable price” for the vaccine quota allocated to manufacturers to sell in the open market to insulate the public from “unscrupulous players,” Mr. Vijayan said. It is imperative the Centre provided the vaccines to the States as a “public good, free of cost.” The Centre’s new vaccine policy states that the Government of India would provide free to States. “Instead of having a GOI channel, we need to have a government channel, which will include State governments through whom the vaccine will be distributed,” Mr. Vijayan wrote. Mr. Vijayan also welcomed the Centre’s decision to make the vaccine available for everyone above 18. Kerala, like other States, is witnessing a rise in the infection curve as a new wave of the virus sweeps the country, he said. Health Minister K.K. Shylaja also demanded that the State be provided a bulk supply of 50 lakh doses of vaccine on an emergency basis for the State to complete the vaccination of those in the 45 plus age group||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/provide-vaccine-free-pm-urged/article34371953.ece
21 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Restrictions being strengthened||Restrictions in the district will be strengthened with the help of the police and the sectoral magistrates in the wake of the worsening COVID-19 situation, District Collector Navjot Khosa has said. A meeting of the district disaster development authority will be convened every day to review the situation, the Collector said. She appealed to the people to step out of their homes only if necessary. Children, the elderly, and pregnant women should remain indoors.

21 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||New high as 19,577 more test positive||Kerala’s ride over the second wave of COVID-19 is proving to be quite agonising with the epidemic curve rising at an alarming pace, putting more and more people in hospital beds and ICUs on a daily basis. On Tuesday, when the results of 1,12,221 samples, which are part of the first round of augmented testing, came in, the State set another record in a single day’s spike, recording 19,577 new cases. The cumulative case burden of the State has now risen to 12,72,645. The active caseload is rising alarmingly and now has 1,18,673 cases. There were also 3,880 recoveries, taking the tally to 11,48,671. The test positivity rate seems more or less steady for the past three days at 17.45%. Though the active case pool has over a lakh patients, at present, total hospital admissions number 13,221. On Tuesday, 2,470 persons were admitted to hospitals. The proportion of critically ill patients requiring ICU care has risen to 937, with the number of those requiring ventilator assistance rising to 277. This is a hike not seen during the first wave and by all indications, this is likely to climb further. In almost all districts, ICU beds earmarked for COVID-19 patients are getting filled up fast and there is almost 60% to 70% occupancy in most hospitals. The State added 28 new deaths to the official list on Tuesday. The cumulative toll has risen to 4,978. Thrissur reported six deaths, Ernakulam four, Thiruvananthapuram, Palakkad, and Kannur three each, Kozhikode, Malappuram, and Kollam two each, while one death each was reported from Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha. Ernakulam’s case graph shot through the roof on Tuesday, recording 3,212 cases, followed by Kozhikode 2,341, Malappuram 1,945, Thrissur 1,868, Kottayam 1,510, Thiruvananthapuram 1,490, Kannur 1,360, Alappuzha 1,347, Palakkad 1,109, Kasaragod 861, Kollam 848, Idukki 637, Wayanad 590, and Pathanamthitta 459 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-high-as-19577-more-test-positive/article34371964.ece
21 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Choice left to cinema owners||Cinema theatre owners in the State as well as the Malayalam film industry are staring at yet another crisis with a majority of the theatres temporarily shuttering for an indefinite period considering the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. The theatres started functioning only in January this year after a gap of nine months following the first COVID-19 outbreak. In an online meeting on Tuesday, the Film Exhibitors United Organisation of Kerala (FEUOK) decided that the cinema owners can take a call on whether to continue functioning or not. “When we talked to the owners, some are of the opinion that they don’t want to keep the theatres open. However, some others said a few of the new releases are still returning average collections and that closing down now would create losses for the producers. So, we left the choice to the owners. But we have made it clear that they have to follow all protocols and end the shows before 7.30 p.m,” said Sumesh Joseph Manarkattu, general secretary, FEUOK. Only two shows a day The latest round of curbs imposed by the State on Monday, requiring the cinemas to close by 7.30 p.m, also seems to have led to a rethink on the part of the owners. With the opening time stipulated at 12 noon, it left time enough to fit in only two shows a day. “The collection has fallen ever since the Ramzan season began, so with just two shows there will not be much revenue coming in. Also, the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases makes it risky to continue to organise shows. So we closed down on Monday evening,” says Gireesh Chandran, partner, Sree Padmanabha and Devipriya theatres in the capital.  Big releases Some big releases including Priyadarshan’s Marakkar and Mahesh Narayanan’s Malik are set to release in the second week of May. However, with the cases peaking again, these releases could be postponed yet again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/choice-left-to-cinema-owners/article34371966.ece

A meeting convened by Chief Secretary V.P. Joy on Tuesday decided to intensify testing at the panchayat level and to test everyone in those panchayats where the test positivity rate (TPR) has been high. In all panchayats where the TPR is more than double that of the district’s average TPR, every house would be subjected to COVID testing.  Second round The second round of augmented testing, with a target of collecting three lakh samples, will be done over Wednesday and Thursday. The strategy is to continue mass testing rigorously across districts in the hope that the State’s current TPR of over 17% can be brought down to 3%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-to-bank-on-mass-testing/article34371967.ece

Though the LDF representatives were selected to the posts with the UDF support twice, they refused to take power. Following this, Mr. Hari and Ms. Geetha approached the High Court, citing that the delay in the election of president and vice president was affecting the functioning of the panchayat.

During a factcheck by The Hindu based on complaints from people, it came to light that there was a shortage of digital entry operators at the GGH Out Patient COVID-triage centre in the city. The Government General Hospital at Anantapur runs a 24X7 sample collection centre with 500 to 800 persons giving their samples every day. A couple of persons, who had given their samples on April 15 (Thursday), had come on Tuesday to the GGH asking for the result as they had not received any SMS either of their sample getting accepted or the result. ‘Backlog’ The data entry operators said only one person was working per shift and that there was a backlog. “My worry is I had a journey scheduled for Tuesday and did not get my result or certificate even after two days of giving the sample,” said V.K. Rinas, who was supposed to go to Kerala for Ramzan. Kerala government is insisting on getting a COVID-negative certificate for entry into the State. When asked, District Medical and Health Officer Y. Kameswara Prasad said that all the Urban Health Centres in Anantapur and Primary Health Centres in the rural areas were collecting COVID samples and entering data there itself.

Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pvt. hospitals declining admissions, allege relatives of patients||A private hospital in the city refused to admit an elderly woman, who had tested positive for COVID-19, on the plea of ‘lack of beds’. Three other private hospitals also declined admission. There are allegations of some private hospitals are trying to make hay while the sun shines. The staff of a private hospital were reportedly caught when they were allegedly trying to shift Remdesivir stock from the hospital for sale in the black-market. They were caught in a vigilance raid, on Monday. “My father, is an ex-serviceman, and hence my mother is eligible for reimbursement of medical bills but they declined,” says Anita Rao, an artist, who tried to admit her mother into a private hospital. Her 28-year-old son had also tested positive for COVID-19 and she is attending to him at home. She went around four private hospitals but she could not get a bed. There were no COVID beds at Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) also and she finally managed to get a bed for her mother at the King George Hospital (KGH). “At least five staff members are required to attend to meet the needs of patients in each ward at the COVID block in KGH. The bathrooms are, no doubt, dirty but going by the number of patients undergoing treatment at the CSR Block and shortage of cleaning staff, one cannot blame them,” says A. Chandrasekhar of Purushottapuram area, who underwent treatment at KGH two weeks ago. “The services of doctors and staff are excellent in the COVID ward, but there was lack of coordination among the staff and monitoring by the higher authorities. The washrooms were stinking with no cleaning for four to five days. Though there are CC cameras, there is no monitoring. More doctors should be appointed and monitoring of ICU is essential,” he says. A total of 6,775 beds, including some in the private hospitals, have been allocated for COVID-19 patients in the district, District Medical and Health Officer P. Suryanarayana said on Tuesday. “There is no shortage of oxygen and 62,000 doses of vaccine have arrived and they will meet the requirements of all frontline and health care workers in the district. An additional 10 lakh doses will be required for the general public,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pvt-hospitals-declining-admissions-allege-relatives-of-patients/article34372392.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday said that his government had provided a financial assistance of Rs. 65,000 crore to the farmers under various schemes. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was speaking after launching the YSR Zero Interest Crop Loan Scheme. Under the scheme, an amount of Rs. 128.47 crore was directly credited into the bank accounts of the 6.27 lakh farmers who had availed themselves of crop loan of up to Rs. 1 lakh during the 2019-20 rabi season and repaid the amount within stipulated time. ‘Promises fulfilled’ “I am happy to note that all the promises made in Navaratnalu pertain to the farmers, and we have hand-held the farmers right from providing seed to selling their crops. I feel that we have implemented every promise made to the farmers. I urge all the farmers to register the details in e-crop as it ensures easier access to all the schemes. I urge all the farmers to provide details of the crop patterns in kharif,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Stating that there were four reasons behind the travails of the farmers, the Chief Minister said the government was committed to mitigating the sufferings of the farmers. The government had already paid all the arrears, he said. “The welfare of the State is entwined with the welfare of the farmers and farm workers. If the farmer is doing well, the farm workers will be happy. A recent FAO study showed that 62% of the population in India is still dependant on agriculture. I am happy to note that we have done our best to make the lives of farmers better. We are crediting the zero interest subvention amount of Rs. 128.47 crore directly into accounts of 6.30 lakh farmers. So far, we have provided Rs. 1,132.54 crore as zero interest subvention to 61.22 lakh farmers. If we take the amount credited on Tuesday, it is almost Rs. 1,300 crore. I have taken these decisions after seeing the travails of the farmers during my padayatra,” he said. Minister for Agriculture K. Kanna Babu, Special Chief Secretary Poonam Malakondaiah, and Secretary (marketing) Y.

21 April 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Glimmer of hope as Endowments Dept. takes over rare Rama temple in Kadapa||The temple dedicated to Lord Rama at Peddaputha village in Valluru mandal is unique in its own right. Apart from its architectural grandeur, the temple, dating to the Vijayanagara period in 1400 CE, has the idol of the presiding deity seated in a yogic posture, which is a rarity. The idols of Lord Rama carrying bow and arrow is common. However, the idol in this temple does not have these weapons. The Lord is seen sitting in ‘Padmasana’, with his right hand in ‘Chinmudra’. In yoga, ‘Chinmudra’ is considered as a posture in which the practitioner holds the hand close to heart, palm closed, thumb and forefinger brought together. The left hand of the idol is seen touching the ground in ‘Bhumisparsha mudra’. Goddess Sita sits to the left of Lord Rama, holding a lotus; while Lord Lakshmana, carrying his bow and arrows, stands to the right of the presiding deity. Lord Anjaneya is seen sitting in front of the Lord Rama in reading posture, referring to the ‘Brahma Sutra’ inscribed on palm leaves. “The idols symbolically show that Lord Rama is keenly listening to the Vedic recital by Lord Hanuman,” explains V. Ramabrahmam, an academician at the Department of History and Archaeology of the Yogi Vemana University, Kadapa. Similar iconography can be found in Singanamala in Anantapur district and also at the 500-year-old temple at Nedungunam, 24 km south of Vandavasi town on Kanchipuram-Chetput route in Tamil Nadu, at the foot of Dheergajala mountain. Dilapidated condition Yet, the temple at Peddaputha village is in ruins and hardly known to people. The shrine used to be in a dilapidated condition for over three decades, but after its takeover by the Endowments Department last month, a glimmer of hope has emerged among the devout as well as the archaeologists that it would be revived. “This is not enough. The State or Central archaeology departments should consider taking over this temple for preservation,” says Mr. Ramabrahmam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/glimmer-of-hope-as-endowments-dept-takes-over-rare-rama-temple-in-kadapa/article34372338.ece

21 April 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Shortage of vaccine, test reagents hits COVID-19 treatment plan||The second wave of COVID -19 is raging through the State and the district, and at this juncture, the district is facing an acute shortage of vaccines and due to deficiency of reagents the numbers of tests per day also have been reduced. In this month so far, the district has recorded over 6,700 cases, averaging over 350 cases per day. The second wave is now full blown and on an average about 20% of the tests are turning out to be positives, said district COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar. At this juncture, when the only panacea is said to be mass inoculation, the programme is hit by shortage of doses. The most importantly, it is affecting those who are awaiting the second jab. Speaking to The Hindu , a senior professor from Andhra University College of Engineering said that he was due for the second jab on April 17, but was turned down from at least seven private hospitals, as there was no stock. Forced to reach the DMHO, he was informed by the officials that only frontline workers were being vaccinated and was told to call the State help desk Spandana. “When I called Spandana, I was told to contact 104. And the response from 104 was to register in the Cowin App, wherein I will be indicated where I can get vaccinated, but unfortunately the App has no such indication,” he said. The same was the case with six persons, who contacted this correspondent in the last two days over the same issue, and a former professor from AU alleged that the vaccination planning has gone wrong. “They are running short of vaccines, as the Union government has failed to provide the State its requirement, and the State has failed to branch the stock under ‘first’ and ‘second’ dose category. Forced with the scenario to vaccinate more numbers, they missed the ‘second dose’ demand,” said the former professor. Meanwhile, as the second wave is sweeping the district, getting tested has become a worrisome factor. Almost all private hospitals and diagnostic centres have stopped conducting tests and have hung ‘no test’ boards, stating that there is a shortage of reagents. The tests are only being done in limited numbers at government facilities. Sources say that since infection rate is around 20% in the community, more number of tests will show a higher figure. From averaging around 6,000 tests per day, it is learnt that the testes are brought down to 3,500 to 4,000 per day.Meanwhile, admitting that the second wave is raging and the virus is more virulent, the district administration has said it was ready to handle an outbreak. They claimed that around 6,500 beds in Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS), King George Hospital (KGH) and Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD), are kept ready, with at least 2,000 with oxygen facility and a number of private hospitals have been notified to function as category A and B COVID hospitals. Officials also said that efforts are on to see that the tests go up and added that vaccination depends on supplies from the Union government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/shortage-of-vaccine-test-reagents-hits-covid-19-treatment-plan/article34372403.ece

Khajavali said that commercial establishments, including cinema halls and fuel stations, will remain open only between 5 a.m. and 7 p.m. Mr. Khajavali asked people to go for shopping only before 7 p.m. However, medical shops will be exempted from the restrictions, he said. Only 100 persons per gathering will be allowed and permission should be sought from the municipal commissioner in urban areas and the Tahsildar in rural areas by the organisers in advance, he said. He also asked medical shop owners to pass on the information of people buying medicines to treat COVID symptoms so that the government can trace and test them.  No curfew  “All commercial establishments should be closed between 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. but it is not a curfew. People can go out if there is an emergency,” Bandar DSP M. Ramesh Reddy said. He said Iftar feasts and pandals for Srirama Navami will be not be allowed in the division.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/shops-petrol-pumps-to-be-closed-from-7-pm-to-5-am/article34371736.ece
21 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cancel SSC and Intermediate examinations, Pawan tells govt.||Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan on Tuesday found fault with the government’s decision to go ahead and conduct the SSC (class 10) board examinations as per schedule. In a statement, he said the “irresponsible” decision would put the lives of lakhs of students and their families to risk at a time when there was a sharp spike in the COVID-19 cases. Pointing out that the CBSE too had cancelled its examinations, he urged the government to cancel both the SSC and Intermediate examinations and promote the students to the next level. Stating that the students and teachers in schools, welfare hostels, junior colleges and private coaching centres were at risk of contracting the virus, he said the medical experts had been warning that the second wave was more dangerous than the first. He said the decision would put the health of nearly 16.5 lakh people (6.4 lakh SSC students and 10.5 lakh Intermediate students) in jeopardy. “Moreover, who will take the responsibility for the health of the older people and perennially ill members of the families of these students?” he asked. Alleging that there were mistakes in the SSC certificates issued by the Education Department last year, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said to avoid a repeat, the department was trying to thrust the examinations on the students in these difficult times. The JSP chief said the preparedness level of the government to battle the second wave was far from satisfactory. “Its failure has resulted in spurt in cases and shortage of beds in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cancel-ssc-and-intermediate-examinations-pawan-tells-govt/article34372343.ece
21 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Congress blames Centre, State for ‘alarming’ spread of virus||APCC president S. Sailajanath on Tuesday blamed the BJP-led Centre and the YSRCP government in the State for the alarming spread of COVID-19. Addressing the media, he alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had failed to put in place a proper plan to battle the second wave of infections. Mr. Modi, who claimed availability of the vaccine in abundance, failed to match the supply with the growing demand. The existing vaccine shortage reflected the shoddy handling of the pandemic, he said. ‘Ramp up production’ The manufacturers of the vaccine, Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech, were in need of funds to boost production as infections spread at a record speed, but the government did precious little to ramp up the production, he alleged. The elections in various parts of the country had contributed to the rapid spread of the virus, he said. The Congress had appealed in vain to the Election Commission to desist from holding polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congress-blames-centre-state-for-alarming-spread-of-virus/article34372341.ece

21 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Governor asks V-Cs to hold awareness rallies||Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan on Tuesday said that the Vice-Chancellors of universities in the State should take up awareness campaigns on COVID-19 in a mission mode. In a video-conference he held with the Vice-Chancellors, the Governor informed that in view of the alarming situation in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reviewed the pandemic situation with the Chief Ministers and Governors in two separate meetings, where he had stressed the need for implementation of a five-fold strategy – Testing, Tracing, Treatment, COVID-Appropriate Behaviour and Vaccination, and called for a united fight against the pandemic. “The pandemic poses a serious challenge to the institutions of higher education and the role of the Vice-Chancellors is crucial in putting in place effective measures for safety of the students and staff, without compromising on the academics,” the Governor said. Besides, they also had a larger responsibility to create awareness among the public on the protective and preventive aspects by utilising the services of the NCC and NSS cadre. The Governor said students should educate their parents and people in their neighbourhood on the importance of using mask, maintaining physical distance and frequent handwash.  They should visit at least five houses every day and take up community surveillance. He said the 10 best performing colleges in each district and three best universities in the State would be suitably rewarded for their work. He said students had the power to reach out to society and create awareness, and appealed to them to come forward and take up the fight against the virus. Mr. Harichandan said the State was in second position in terms of conducting COVID-19 tests during the first wave, and this time, it was much ahead in terms of testing, tracing and treatment in the country. Education Minister A. Suresh said people should avoid the three ‘Cs’ – Closed environment, Crowded places and Contact with others, while the three ‘Ts’ – Testing, Tracing and Treatment – should be adopted effectively to contain the spread of the virus. Special Chief Secretary, Department of Education Satish Chandra, Secretary to the Governor Mukesh Kumar Meena, and Chairman, AP State Council of Higher Education, K. Hemachandra Reddy, attended the programme.

BJP Mahila Morcha Vizianagaram district president Gandikota Shanti alleged that the administration was adopting a casual approach in informing test results. “The District Medical and Health Department’s staff is taking at least four days to confirm whether one has tested positive to COVID. What’s the use if the result comes after four days? The delay would not just lead to further deterioration of one’s health but also lead to spread of the infection among others,” said Ms. Shanti.

Close to 6,000 cases and 18 deaths were recorded on Monday, both new records in the State. While samples were put to test on Monday, a total of 5,929 turned up positive for coronavirus.

21 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||TIMS wants RT-PCR report, Gandhi accepts RAT result for admission||“The hospital staff are insisting on a RT-PCR positive report before admitting the patient. Even a High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) report showing damage to lungs is being ignored,” lamented a patient’s relative at the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research on Tuesday. In contrast, a healthcare worker at Gandhi Hospital informed that the Rapid Antigen Test conducted in the facility is being used to admit COVID-19 patients at the tertiary care centre. “Most of the cases are from the city. They are from all over the city. Earlier RT-PCR was being insisted on but as it is taking a lot of time, patients are being admitted with just a RAT report,” said the healthcare worker in the emergency ward. “We are continuously processing patient admissions. While we are doing the paperwork, there are patients waiting in ambulances around the building block,” said the healthcare worker unwilling to go on record. Patients are being admitted in multiple locations at Gandhi Hospital to speed up the process. The RT-PCR test report is taking upwards of 24 hours before patients know their status and on weekends, it is taking more than 48 hours. On Sunday afternoon, when Ali (name changed to protect identity) reached a corporate hospital in Secunderabad with his elderly in-laws having a breathing problem, the staff insisted on a RT-PCR report. They took the patients to TIMS Gachibowli and waited in their hired ambulance with personal oxygen concentrator for three hours to be sent back for the RT-PCR report. Another private hospital near Mehdipatnam too, refused to admit the patients without a positive report. “We paid Rs. 30,000 for the five-hour ambulance ride through the city with two breathless patients. We took a HRCT test that showed a CO-RAD score of +4 at Shaikpet. The oxygen saturation was dropping to 80-85 without support, but still they wanted a positive RT-PCR report,” said the patient’s attendant. The patients are now in ICU at a private hospital near L.B. Stadium. According to sources at TIMS, for every 100 patients getting admitted with a positive RT-PCR report, an equal number are being turned away. Physical access to both medical facilities has been been cut off for journalists, with a posse of police officials allowing only patients or medicare personnel to enter the premises. At Gandhi Hospital, entry and exit are from a single gate. The mortuary at the rearside of the building has been turned into a high-security facility with police officials guarding it round the clock.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tims-wants-rt-pcr-report-gandhi-accepts-rat-result-for-admission/article34372176.ece

Accordingly, screening of movies in theatres across the State should close by 8 p.m. in line with the restrictions imposed on shops, offices and other establishments across the State. Steps should be taken to ensure that all persons including staff, audience and vendors wear masks and hand sanitisers are placed at entry/exit points and common areas in the theatres. Managements were directed to follow physical distancing and put in place COVID-19 management measures. Sanitation of the premises was made mandatory after every screening and show timings should be staggered in such a way that intervals of different shows did not occur simultaneously. The restrictions would be in place till 5 pm on May 1, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar said in the orders issued on Tuesday evening. In the wake of the orders, exhibitors’ association of the State held a meeting and decided to close down theatres from Wednesday. However, a few cinema halls will continue screening the film, Vakeel Saab , till Thursday, as per prior agreement between the distributors and the exhibitors. The Telugu film industry had been counting on the big summer releases to draw in packed halls. But that will have to wait. The recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases had forced a few big films scheduled for release in April, namely, director Sekhar Kammula’s Love Story , Nani starrer Tuck Jagadish and Rana Daggubati starrer Virata Parvam, to defer their release dates. Meanwhile, the Telugu Film Producers Council issued a statement directing film units to go ahead only with emergency film shootings with not more than 50 workers and adhere to safety protocols.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/with-curbs-exhibitors-decide-to-suspend-operations/article34372258.ece

Three ICUs are located on the ground floor, second floor and fourth floor of the institute. “Since we work in a government hospital, we can’t ask people to take their patient to a private hospital. We are going through traumatic times. As cases are increasing fast, more number of patients will require ICU beds. But there are enough number of beds with oxygen supply. The institute is serving its purpose. But nothing more can be done about the overwhelming demand,” said a doctor at the hospital. Hospital sources said due to the overwhelming demand for ICUs, some crucial patients are forced to wait. “Some families come to TIMS after exhausting all their finances. They can’t knock on the doors of corporate hospitals, which are also running out of the intensive care beds,” sources said. Doctors said a solution must be worked out to avoid tragedies. “Government hospitals alone cannot manage the huge rush for COVID services. Private medical colleges have more than 10,000 beds and have to get involved. Barring a few, colleges are staying away,” said another doctor from the institute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tims-overwhelmed-by-rising-demand-for-icu-beds/article34372241.ece

21 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP forms panel to probe leaders’ visit to Pragati Bhavan||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party has formed a three-member fact-finding committee consisting of three senior leaders to conduct a full-fledged “probe” into the reasons behind some of the senior leaders meeting TRS working president and Minister for Municipal Administration & Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao to seek support for electing a family member of deceased victorious candidate A. Ramesh Goud from Lingojiguda division of Rangareddy district without the consent of top leadership, in the Pragati Bhavan recently. Party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar issued a press statement on Tuesday and did not mince words in stating that the senior leaders including former MLC N. Ramachander Rao and P. Shekar Rao had “erred” in taking the son of Ramesh Goud to meet KTR and it went against the party’s principles and stand. The meeting had sent wrong signals to the cadre especially as it happened just before the Nagarajunasagar bypoll. “The initiative was taken unilaterally without informing the leadership. Neither I nor Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy, former president K. Laxman, senior leader P. Muralidhar Rao, vice-president D.K. Aruna have been kept in the loop. The meeting was ill-advised because the party had won handsomely in all the divisions of L.B. Nagar in recent elections and is in a position to win on its own,” he claimed. At the same time, he stated that the TRS had agreed not to field any candidate against Mr. Goud in the byelection. The three-member fact-finding committee consisting of Malla Reddy, Laxminarayana and S. Kumar would be submitting a report after looking into the incident so that there was no need for others to speculate, Mr. Sanjay Kumar maintained. Party sources informed that the BJP leaders in the dock did not expect such a backlash as they had also met Congress MP Revanth Reddy seeking the party’s cooperation in avoiding a contest. However, this meeting did not attract as much attention as the one in Pragati Bhavan leading to much furore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-forms-panel-to-probe-leaders-visit-to-pragati-bhavan/article34372259.ece

21 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Haleem makers caught off-guard by curfew order||The sudden announcement of night curfew in the State caught haleem makers in the city off-guard. “We begin making the dish in the morning. The announcement was made in the afternoon. I don’t know how we will deal with today’s product,” said M. A. Majeed of Pista House when asked about the curfew order. Haleem is unique to Hyderabad as it is made by big restaurants only during the month of Ramzan according to Islamic calendar. “We start selling by 4 p.m. and most of the people who pick up parcels or stand and eat start coming by 8 p.m. and it goes on till 11 p.m.,” said a teller at a restaurant near Lakdi-Ka-Pul. While last year there was no commercial sale of haleem by big restaurants due to COVID-19 lockdown, this year only a few restaurants ventured to set up the clay ovens used to cook gargantuan quantities of the special dish that has a GI tag. Some restaurants even set up a countdown to the month of Ramzan but this year that was also missing. “The State government has taken the correct call. We can celebrate a festival only if we are alive. Our business will be affected but the safety of people is very important. Though we are following all the SOPs dictated by the government we will obey the order to close by 8 p.m.,” said Mr. Majeed, whose restaurant chain is one of the biggest haleem makers in the city. However, haleem makers said they will continue to make and sell the dish albeit in smaller quantities before the curfew kicks in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/haleem-makers-caught-off-guard-by-curfew-order/article34372247.ece

Positivity rate The positivity of new cases also jumped to 32.82%, which means that 32 out of 100 people taking the test are now positive. Of the total cases, 8,07,328 people have recovered and there are 85,575 active cases. A total of 59,491 beneficiaries took the COVID-19 vaccination in the city in 24 hours, as per the bulletin.

21 April 2021||New Delhi,||Health workers stretched as cases mount||From increased working hours to doctors and nurses testing positive, doctors of several hospitals said they were stretched for resources due to the record spike in COVID-19 cases in the city. Some doctors said there is heavy rush in the emergency and others said that they have no option but to turn patients away as they do not have any vacant beds. A doctor at Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH) said their manpower is stretched due to increased workload. All 450 ICU beds of the hospital were occupied as on Tuesday night. “We have been working at full capacity for about 10 days. People are working for longer hours and our resources are stretched. The Delhi government is providing us with medical officers [doctors]. But we need specialist doctors,” she said. The doctor said they are also trying to increase the oxygen capacity of the hospital to meet the increased workload. She said that patient satisfaction is another issue. “Since the attendant is not with the patient, she gets uneasy and complains about things which may be a non issue. That pressure also comes to us.” ‘Like a war zone’ Vikas Maurya, Head of Department of Pulmonology at Fortis Hospital in Shalimar Bagh, said that beds are filling up as soon as a patient is discharged. They have a waiting list of patients. “The manpower is the same and many staffers are also testing positive. We don’t have any choice, but to work more hours and during weekends. It is like a war zone and we all are on our toes,” Dr. Maurya said. 100 queries a day He said that the 60 beds in the ICU have been full for more than a week and they get more than 100 queries a day for beds. “We are taking one day at a time. All our beds have been more or less full for the past one week. People are working extended hours and on Sunday and on odd hours. But still we have to turn away some people as beds are full. It is inevitable,” said a senior doctor from Aakash Healthcare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/health-workers-stretched-as-cases-mount/article34372230.ece

After completing his night duty, he returned home and felt feverish. He had fever for three days, but on Sunday evening, he started facing breathing problems,” said deceased’s cousin Sanjay Kumar. Tried many hospitals Recalling the ordeal, Harish’s brother Ompal, a DTC staffer who was with him throughout this time, said that he and a few others tried over five hospitals in Delhi starting Sunday evening till late into the night but couldn’t get help. “All his seniors were aware of his situation and knew that we were looking for a hospital but nobody helped. But who can you blame when everyone else is facing the same problem,” the brother said. “Because we couldn’t get a bed here in Delhi, we had to take a huge risk of taking him in that situation to Meerut. There as well, we had to make many calls to get admission in hospitals,” Mr. Ompal said. Harish was first admitted in Santosh Hospital where his COVID-19 test was conducted. “The doctors said that his lungs were 90% damaged and they referred him to a better facility,” Mr. Kumar said. Later, Harish was taken to IIMT Life Line Hospital where the family was allegedly told that they don’t have ventilator support but the hospital helped them find a bed in Sudha Hospital where the required system was available. “Harish’s oxygen level kept dropping and he died around 2 a.m.,” Mr. Kumar said. A total of 38 officers have died of COVID-19 in the force so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/head-constable-dies-as-kin-scramble-to-find-bed/article34371997.ece

In order to ensure that nobody in the city sleeps hungry, food for thousands of people is being prepared and packed at Bangla Sahib,” said Mr. Singh. The DSGMC has started providing cooked meals to COVID-19 patients who do not have caregivers at home. Stating that several requests had been received by the DSGMC from such families and patients, Mr. Singh said: “We received hundreds of calls to help patients who have no one at home to look after them. We have set up a mechanism to pack and send food for them. On the first day itself, we had around 100 volunteers delivering across the city.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/gurdwara-panel-begins-langar-services-at-railway-bus-stations/article34372002.ece

21 April 2021||Mumbai,||HC asks Maharashtra about steps to decongest prisons, vaccinate inmates||The Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court on Tuesday that currently around 35,124 prisoners were lodged in jails across the State and there were 188 COVID-19 cases among inmates and prison staff. Advocate General (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni appearing for the State informed a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni that there were 47 jails across Maharashtra, and they had a capacity to lodge 23,127 inmates. The Bench asked Mr. Kumbhakoni if a large number of inmates could be granted emergency parole to decongest prisons, and would it be possible to vaccinate those above 45 years of age? The Bench further inquired if those arrested recently were tested for COVID-19 and then produced before the magistrate. The court also asked about the number of people arrested after the Chief Minister announced #BreakTheChain on April 13. The AG said they were reclaiming the temporary prisons and had already acquired 14 of them. He said a vaccination programme had already been commenced for those eligible. The HC took suo motu cognisance of newspaper reports on the increase in COVID-19 patients inside prisons. The Bench directed the State to respond to its questions and come up with its suggestions by April 22 and posted the matter to be heard on April 23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-asks-maharashtra-about-steps-to-decongest-prisons-vaccinate-inmates/article34371934.ece

21 April 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Two fake call centres in name of Bajaj Finance busted, 5 held||The Vashi police, acting on a complaint from the fraud control unit of Bajaj Finance Group, have recently busted two fake call centres run in the name of Bajaj Finance and arrested two persons from Mumbai and three from Delhi. The fraud control unit received complaints from people that they were approached by the customer care executives of the finance company who would offer loan at 4% interest and take payments in the name of processing fee and GST and later switch off their phone numbers. “We got information about two suspicious call centres operational at Haware Infotech Park and Vashi Plaza. Along with the fraud control unit of the company, we raided the call centres and verified their documents and found that they were fake,” assistant police inspector Sachin Dhage from Vashi police station said. Later, the police arrested two managers — Imtiaz alias Sohail Maulana Qureshi (29) and Shabana Sohail Charniya (25) — who ran the call centres. Senior police inspector Ramesh Chavan from Vashi police station said, “Following their arrest, we traced the main three accused to Delhi after looking at the trail of money transfers. Two more accused are wanted in the case.” Till now, the police have received 75 complaints of people who were cheated of around Rs. 15 lakh in total. The modus operandi of the accused was to take a commercial space on rent for the call centre and then hire girls for speaking to the ‘customer’ by putting up an advertisement in OLX and quicker. The girls would be told that they were employees of Bajaj Finance and given the training. They would target people from rural areas who were mostly farmers and labourers and were in need of loan, Mr. Dhage said. “They have targeted people from Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Pune Rural, Buldhana, Aurangabad and Satara. The loan was offered between Rs. 1 lakh and Rs. 25 lakh and then the person would be asked to send their Aadhaar and PAN details on WhatsApp. The caller would then send their ‘employee ID card’ on WhatsApp to win the customer’s confidence. After procuring some money in the name of processing fee, bank charges, and GST, the callers would switch off their phones and then change their numbers before targeting new customers,” he said. He added that the victims included a farmer who had taken a loan for his son’s MBA  and another farmer who had wanted to purchase a tractor and got a loan of Rs. 4 lakh. Till now, the police have found seven bank accounts used by the accused. The managers worked on a 10% commission and the rest of the money was transferred to the main accused in Delhi. All  the five accused are in police custody till April 23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/two-fake-call-centres-in-name-of-bajaj-finance-busted-5-held/article34371931.ece
21 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Migrant labourers press panic button, find ways to head home||Despite the Capital literally locked down with checkposts on all major roads preventing people from moving out without a reason, inter-state transport hubs were brimming with migrant workers making a desperate dash for their home States. While at Anand Vihar ISBT and railway station the crowd had thinned from the footfall soon after the lockdown was announced, migrant workers continued to try and find ways to manage transport to ferry them out of the city. Some had camped overnight at the terminal hoping to find a commute to reach home while hundreds continued to arrive. Mohd. Faizan, a resident of Gaya who is a construction supervisor, said he did not have a confirmed ticket but was willing to pay “double fine” to reach home as his employer had told him that he was not going to be paid during the week. “My employer clearly told me that I will not be paid. What is the use of staying back? If things get better, I can return within a few days but without work, what is the point of staying back? We are only here to earn money,” said Mr. Faizan, adding that he was scared of the virus but getting infected at home was better than falling ill in the city. For many, the announcement of the six-day lockdown took them back to last year’s lockdown when trains and buses were halted immediately. “With no income, what will we do staying here? This virus has ruined our lives and will ruin it further. My family tells me that the situation back home is not as bad as it is in Delhi, so I am going home. Most people are here out of fear and are willing to take the risk of travelling home,” said Prashant, who works as a help in a hardware shop, and is looking to head back to Almora. With autorickshaws still allowed to ply, people arriving at transport hubs were taking them till the nearest barricade and walking to the station from there. Mahesh Kumar, an auto driver, said that police at barricades were taking a humane view on those trying to reach transport hubs. Long queues At the New Delhi Railway Station, long queues had formed outside with people jostling to get onto a home-bound train. Those without a ticket were hopeful to get access to the platform and board a train heading out of the city but said that they were determined to leave the city as staying back was pointless. “Trains and buses are still running. It is better to leave now than getting stuck here for a long time. I do not believe in the assurances by the govt. that they will not extend it,” said Ram Kishan, waiting for a train to Darbhanga.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/migrant-labourers-press-panic-button-find-ways-to-head-home/article34371929.ece
21 April 2021||New Delhi,||CM, L-G appeal to workers to not leave city; panel constituted||Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal decided to constitute a committee for the welfare of migrant workers in the Capital on Tuesday. Principal Secretary (Home) Bhupinder Singh Bhalla would head the committee as nodal officer while Special Commissioner of Police (Central Range) Rajesh Khurana would be the nodal officer from Delhi Police. According to government sources, measures such as direct cash transfer of Rs. 5,000 into the bank accounts of workers registered with the government and arrangements for food and lodging at over 200 night shelters would begin by Wednesday. “I appeal to all the migrant citizens of Delhi not to leave Delhi in panic. I assure you that the government will take care of your needs. All necessary arrangements are being ensured. You run Delhi with your tireless hard work and this city is your own,” Mr. Baijal said in his appeal to migrant workers. Floating tenders Government sources said Mr. Baijal had on Tuesday directed the Divisional Commissioner and the Delhi Chief Secretary to float tenders to select NGOs to step up provisions for food and lodging to migrant workers fleeing the city. The L-G also directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to instruct personnel to counsel workers to stay back. According to the Delhi government, direct cash benefits of Rs. 10,000 were transferred to the accounts of 47,247 registered workers as COVID relief in two separate instalment during the nation wide lockdown last year. The total number of registered workers in the city as on date was 1,71,861. The cash benefits would be provided from the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board. Contractors providing food to government schools under the mid-day meal scheme would be roped in to provide food to workers and daily wagers and 24x7 helpline would also be set up to act as a grievance management system, which would be shared through SMS. While 207 night shelters would initially accommodate workers, government schools and other facilities would soon be converted into lodging. BJP knocks at L-G’s door Meanwhile, State BJP leaders held a videoconference meeting with L-G over problems being faced by citizens, especially COVID-19 patients and migrant labourers. MPs Manoj Tiwari, Meenakshi Lekhi, Ramesh Bidhuri, Parvesh Sahib Singh, Gautam Gambhir and MLAs Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and Vijender Gupta among others were part of the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cm-l-g-appeal-to-workers-to-not-leave-city-panel-constituted/article34371930.ece

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||A few countries cannot set global rules, says Xi Jinping||China’s President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday global rules cannot be imposed “by one or a few countries” and attempts to “decouple” would not benefit any nation. He was speaking at the annual Boao Forum, a meeting known as China’s Davos and this year attended virtually by a number of Asian leaders, Chinese official media reported, including South Korea’s Moon Jae-in, Indonesia’s Joko Widodo, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Mr. Xi outlined China’s view of a world in flux and contained veiled criticisms appeared to be aimed the U.S., although he did not name the country. He said “combined forces of changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century have brought the world into a phase of fluidity and transformation” with “instability and uncertainty clearly on the rise”. “That said, there is no fundamental change in the trend toward a multi-polar world; economic globalisation is showing renewed resilience; and the call for upholding multilateralism and enhancing communication and coordination has grown stronger,” he said, calling for countries “to uphold true multilateralism” and “safeguard the UN-centred international system”. His comments followed his remarks to the World Economic Forum at Davos in January, when he hit out at “small circles”, a reference that Chinese officials have subsequently used to describe U.S.-led groupings, including the Quad, comprising India, the U.S., Japan and Australia. Chinese officials have rejected the Quad, calling for a “rules-based order” to ensure a “free and open” Indo-Pacific region. On Tuesday, Mr. Xi said: “We must not let the rules set by one or a few countries be imposed on others, or allow unilateralism pursued by certain countries to set the pace for the whole world.” “What we need in today’s world is justice, not hegemony. Big countries should behave in a manner befitting their status and with a greater sense of responsibility,” he added.  Joint vaccine production He said China would continue to take forward its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including for joint vaccine production that had begun with BRI partners, including Indonesia, Brazil, the UAE, Malaysia, Pakistan and Turkey. With a push to deepen connectivity, he said China will “promote ‘hard connectivity’ of infrastructure and ‘soft connectivity’ of rules and standards”. While China is advocating for its own rules and standards under the ambit of the BRI, including in new emerging areas such as 5G, the U.S. has pushed for its allies and partners to seek alternatives. Last month, President Joe Biden said he had suggested to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that democratic countries should explore coming up with an alternative to the BRI. In its first leaders’ summit last month, the Quad countries announced a joint vaccine initiative as well as plans to coordinate standards in critical and emerging technologies. The India-U.S.-Australia-Japan grouping agreed to set up a Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group, recognising that “a free, open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific requires that critical and emerging technology is governed and operates according to shared interests and values.” The working group will facilitate coordination on technology standards development, including between respective national technology standards bodies, as well as joint plans on telecommunications deployment and building critical technology supply chains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/a-few-countries-cannot-set-global-rules-says-xi-jinping/article34371631.ece
21 April 2021||N’Djamena,||Chad President Deby dies on battlefield: Army||Chad’s President Idriss Deby Itno died in combat after three decades in power, the Army said on Tuesday, opening a period of uncertainty in a country that is a key strategic ally of the West in a troubled region. His son was immediately named transitional leader as head of a military council and both the government and Parliament were dissolved, but the army vowed “free and democratic” elections after an 18-month transitional period. The Army said Mr. Deby had died from injuries sustained as he led his troops against rebels who launched an offensive against his regime from Libya last week. Chad had claimed victory against the fighters, but soon after the announcement of Mr. Deby’s death, they vowed to pursue their offensive and march on the capital N’Djamena. The shocking news came just a day after the 68-year-old career military man was proclaimed the winner of a presidential election that gave him a sixth term in office. The Army also announced a curfew and border closures, while a state funeral was planned for Friday. 30 years in power Mr. Deby, often called “Marshal” due to his military rank, had ruled Chad with an iron fist since taking power on the back of a coup in 1990, and often put members of his family and ethnic group in key positions in government and the military. He was nonetheless a key ally in the West’s anti-jihadist campaign in the unstable Sahel region, particularly due to the relative strength of Chad’s military and its ability to supply weaponry and soldiers. France hailed Mr. Deby as an “essential ally in the fight against terrorism” and called for a peaceful transition over a limited timeframe.  The Army said Mr. Deby had been commanding his forces at the weekend as they battled rebel Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT). Mr. Deby “has just breathed his last breath defending the sovereign nation on the battlefield”, Army spokesman General Azem Bermandoa Agouna said in a statement read out on state television. He said Mr. Deby had died on Tuesday, but the presidency later gave the date as Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chad-president-deby-dies-on-battlefield-army/article34371628.ece
21 April 2021||Colombo,||Sri Lanka-India travel bubble delayed||Sri Lanka has decided to postpone launching the proposed “travel bubble” with India, in the wake of the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in India, officials at the Ministry of Tourism here said. “We are just postponing the bubble, this is not a cancellation. When things get better in India, we look forward to launching the travel bubble,” an official at the Ministry told The Hindu. Sri Lanka has been preparing to open up the country for tourists in phases as earnings from the sector, a crucial foreign exchange earner, fell steeply in the pandemic year. Special flights Less than two weeks ago, the Civil Aviation Ministry in India announced setting up a “bilateral air bubble” arrangement with Sri Lanka for operation of special international passenger flights between the two countries. According to official sources, New Delhi had also conveyed to Colombo its interest in welcoming an inaugural flight from Sri Lanka to the Kushinagar airport in Uttar Pradesh that was recognised as an international airport last year. The two governments have discussed ways to enhance connectivity with the airport to help Buddhist pilgrims in Sri Lanka visit important religious sites in India. “Once the pandemic situation eases, we will be able to finalise that,” the official said. Tourist source India accounts for one of the highest sources of tourists in Sri Lanka. Following the virus outbreak in March last year, Sri Lanka closed its borders and reopened it only in December 2020, stipulating protocols for on-arrival testing, quarantine and travel within the country. Witnessing a gradual increase in the last four months, Sri Lanka recorded 4,581 tourists from select countries in March 2021. Just before the pandemic hit, Sri Lanka received 2,28,434 tourists in January 2020 and the highest percentage of arrivals was from India, at 18 %. Sri Lanka has over 3,000 active cases of Covid-19, after reporting nearly 1 lakh cases in total, and 620 fatalities. Public health experts have cautioned the public about a possible new wave of infections. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan Airlines, the country’s national carrier, had planned to restart operations to several Indian cities, to create the travel bubble. With the surge in infections in India, the plans have been put on hold for now, a spokesman said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-india-travel-bubble-delayed/article34371633.ece
21 April 2021||Moscow,||U.S. envoy to Moscow returning to Washington for consultations||Washington’s envoy to Moscow will return to the United States for consultations, the U.S. Embassy said on Tuesday, after Moscow “recommended” that Ambassador John Sullivan temporarily leave amid soaring tensions. “Ambassador Sullivan is returning to the United States for consultations this week,” the U.S. diplomatic mission in Moscow said in a statement. “I believe it is important for me to speak directly with my new colleagues in the Biden administration in Washington about the current state of bilateral relations,” the statement quoted Mr. Sullivan as saying. The announcement came amid a spike in tensions between Moscow and Washington over a litany of disputes, including alleged meddling in the U.S. elections, Russia’s troop build-up along Ukraine’s borders and the deteriorating health of President Vladimir Putin’s imprisoned critic Alexei Navalny. U.S. President Joe Biden is pursuing a tougher line against Mr. Putin but has also proposed that the two leaders meet for a summit in a third country later this year. Mr. Sullivan said he would return to Moscow “in the coming weeks”, before any meeting between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin. Moscow has said it is studying the summit proposal. Moscow recalled its own envoy, Anatoly Antonov, from Washington for consultations in March and last week the former Cold War foes announced a wave of tit-for-tat sanctions and expulsions of diplomats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-envoy-to-moscow-returning-to-washington-for-consultations/article34371626.ece
21 April 2021||Islamabad,||Pakistan Parliament to decide on French envoy’s expulsion||A resolution was tabled in the lower house of Parliament on Tuesday for the expulsion of the French Ambassador from Pakistan over the issue of blasphemous cartoons being published in the European country. Amjad Ali Khan of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party presented the resolution in the National Assembly. Technically, it was not an official document as it was moved by a member in his private capacity but it was accepted for discussion. The resolution condemned the publication of blasphemous caricatures by French magazine Charlie Hebdo in September last year and expressed regret over the French President’s “encouragement of the elements hurting the sentiments of the hundreds of millions of Muslims in the name of freedom of expression”.  It stated that a debate should be held in the House on the expulsion of the French Ambassador from Pakistan. The main Opposition Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) attended the session but the Pakistan People’s Party boycotted it. Ahsan Iqbal of PML-N demanded that the government should bring a new resolution after discussion with the Opposition. Speaker Asad Qaiser said that he would like to give time to the House for discussion to come up with the consensus document and adjourned the session until Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pakistan-parliament-to-decide-on-french-envoys-expulsion/article34371634.ece
21 April 2021||The hague,||EU agency says blood clot ‘rare’ J&J side effect||Blood clots should be listed as a “very rare” side effect of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine but its benefits still outweigh the risks, the EU’s drug watchdog said on Tuesday. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a statement that it had found a “possible link” between the J&J jab and the clots, following eight such cases in the United States, one of which was fatal. The U.S. pharmaceutical giant’s vaccine is the second to be tied to the rare clots that mainly affect vessels leading to the brain, after the shot made by British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca. “EMA finds possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets,” the Amsterdam-based agency said in a statement, adding that it “confirms (the) overall benefit-risk remains positive”. EMA chief Emer Cooke stressed the number of cases was tiny compared to the seven million J&J vaccinations given so far, but that it was important for people to know. “This is a very rare effect but it also makes it very important for doctors and patients to be aware of the signs so that they can spot any concerns,” Ms. Cooke told a virtual press conference. “Early intervention by a specialist can change the outcome.” The agency, which licences medicines for the 27-nation EU, would continue to investigate the problem and was working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, she said.  The U.S. has also paused the use of the J&J vaccine, pending a decision expected on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eu-agency-says-blood-clot-rare-jj-side-effect/article34371623.ece
21 April 2021||Moscow,||Russia says it will launch own space station in 2025||Russia’s space agency said on Tuesday it hoped to launch its own orbital station in 2025 as Moscow considers withdrawing from the International Space Station programme to go it alone. Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin said work had begun on the fist module of a new station, after officials warned that Russia was considering pulling out of the ISS, one of the few successful examples of cooperation with the West. The announcement came with tensions soaring with the West. “The first core module of the new Russian orbital station is in the works,” Mr. Rogozin said in a statement on messaging app Telegram. He said Russia’s Energia space corporation was aiming to have the module “ready for launch” in 2025 and released a video of Energia staff at work. Launched in 1998 and involving Russia, the United States, Canada, Japan, and the European Space Agency, the ISS is one of the most ambitious international collaborations in human history. Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov said in recent days that Moscow was considering whether to leave the ISS programme from 2025 because of the station’s age. Roscosmos said on Monday that a decision on quitting the ISS had not yet been made. “When we make a decision we will start negotiations with our partners on forms and conditions of cooperation beyond 2024,” the space agency told AFP in a statement. Russia lost its monopoly for manned flights to the ISS last year after the first successful mission of U.S. company Space X. Despite its much-lauded history — Russia this month marked the 60th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin becoming the first person in orbit — the country’s space programme has struggled in recent years. Analysts say Mr. Putin is more interested in military technology than space exploration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-says-it-will-launch-own-space-station-in-2025/article34371625.ece

21 April 2021||beijing,||China rejects Xinjiang accusations||China on Tuesday rejected accusations of abuses in the Xinjiang region after a human rights group appealed for a UN investigation into possible crimes against humanity. Accusations of forced labour or detentions in the northwestern region are “lies and false information concocted by anti-China forces”, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin. He accused critics of trying to “undermine Xinjiang’s stability and security and curb China’s development”. On Monday, Human Rights Watch appealed to the UN Human Rights Commission to investigate reports of mass detention of Muslims, a crackdown on religious practices and other measures against minorities. More than 1 million people have been confined to camps in Xinjiang, according to foreign governments and researchers. Authorities there are accused of imposing forced labour and birth controls. Beijing rejects complaints of abuses and says the camps are for job training to support economic development and combat Islamic radicalism.   Mr. Wang called on foreign observers to “respect facts and truth” and to “stop the wrong practice of spreading disinformation about Xinjiang”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-rejects-xinjiang-accusations/article34371629.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||A low-carbon future through sector-led change||In the build-up to the ‘Leaders’ Climate Summit’ organised by the United States this week (April 22-23), there has been a flurry of articles about whether India should announce a ‘net-zero’ emissions target, and by when. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5°C report called for global carbon emissions to reach net-zero by 2050, which the pressure cooker of climate diplomacy has quickly transformed into a call for all countries to announce 2050 as the net-zero target year. Yet, global net zero may require some countries reaching net-zero before 2050 in order for others to have some additional time. Since a disproportionate share of the carbon space has been used up by developed countries, it is important that they act boldly at home, to match the vigour of their diplomatic efforts. Nonetheless, as a climate-vulnerable country, India must also up its game to contribute to limiting global temperature rise, ideally below 1.5°C. While doing so, it should not lose sight of the history of global climate negotiations and its own developmental needs. Though a large country and economy, we are still a very poor country with a significant development deficit — for example, our per-capita carbon emissions are less than half the world average. What India must do So, what is the way forward for India? Saying India will take only modest steps until richer countries do more is not viable in the context of a global climate crisis. Yet, announcing an Indian 2050 net-zero commitment risks taking on a much heavier burden of decarbonisation than many wealthier countries, and could seriously compromise India’s development needs. We suggest a third path, focused on concrete, near-term sectoral transformations through aggressive adoption of technologies that are within our reach, and an earnest effort to avoid high carbon lock-ins. This is best accomplished by focusing on sectoral low-carbon development pathways that combine competitiveness, job-creation, distributional justice and low pollution in key areas where India is already changing rapidly. This approach is directionally consistent with India moving towards net-zero, which should be our long-term objective. Over time, India can and should get more specific about future economy-wide net-zero targets and dates. Here, we detail what such an approach would look like, by laying out the contours of an enhanced national pledge for the electricity sector, to illustrate how it can be both ambitious and in India’s interest. A similar approach should be adopted for other sectors.  De-carbonise power sector To achieve net-zero emissions, a key piece of the puzzle is to decarbonise the electricity sector, which is the single largest source (about 40%) of India’s greenhouse gas emissions. De-carbonised electricity would also allow India to undertake transformational changes in urbanisation and industrial development, for example by expanding the use of electricity for transport, and by integrating electric systems into urban planning. So far, our efforts in the electricity sector have focused on expanding renewable electricity capacity, with targets growing by leaps and bounds from 20GW of solar to 175GW of renewable capacity by 2022, further growing to 450GW of renewable capacity by 2030. While useful as a direction of travel, India now needs to shift gears to a comprehensive re-imagination of electricity and its role in our economy and society. One way to do this is to go beyond expanding renewables to limiting the expansion of coal-based electricity capacity. This will not be easy: coal provides firm, dispatchable power and accounts for roughly 75% of electricity today; supports the economy of key regions; and is tied to sectors such as banking and railways. These connections need to be unravelled to truly shift to a decarbonised future. Ceiling for coal power A first, bold, step would be to pledge that India will not grow its coal-fired power capacity beyond what is already announced, and reach peak coal electricity capacity by 2030, while striving to make coal-based generation cleaner and more efficient. There is a strong rationale for this: coal is increasingly uneconomic and phasing it out over time will bring local gains, such as reduced air pollution, aside from climate mitigation. Such a pledge would give full scope for development of renewable energy and storage, and send a strong signal to investors. A second, necessary step is to create a multi-stakeholder Just Transition Commission representing all levels of government and the affected communities to ensure decent livelihood opportunities beyond coal in India’s coal belt. This is necessary because the transition costs of a brighter low-carbon future should not fall on the backs  of India’s poor. Third, a low-carbon electricity future will not be realised without addressing existing problems of the sector such as the poor finances and management of distribution companies, which requires deep changes and overcoming entrenched interests. Finally, India will need to work hard to become a leader in technologies of the future such as electricity storage, smart grids, and technologies that enable the electrification of other sectors such as transportation. Through careful partnership with the private sector, including tools such as production-linked incentives, India should use the electricity transition to aim for job creation and global competitiveness in these key areas. Thus, an electricity-supply focused component of India’s climate pledge could provide the overarching framework to envision and drive transformative change.  Improve energy services Enhancing the efficiency of electricity use is an important complement to decarbonising electricity supply. Growing urbanisation and uptake of electricity services offer a good opportunity to shape energy consumption within buildings through proactive measures. Cooling needs are expected to increase rapidly with rising incomes and temperatures. Air conditioners, fans and refrigerators together consume about 60% of the electricity in households. Today, the average fan sold in the market consumes more than twice what an efficient fan does, and an average refrigerator about 35% more. India could set aggressive targets of, say, 80% of air conditioner sales, and 50% of fan and refrigerator sales in 2030, being in the most efficient bracket. In addition to reducing green house gas emissions, this would have the benefit of lowering consumer electricity bills. India can leverage this transition too as an opportunity to become a global leader in production of clean appliances. Such a sector-by-sector approach, which can and should be developed for other sectors, can demonstrate concrete, yet ambitious, domestic action that sets India on the path toward net zero emissions. It empowers India to insist that developed countries complement their distant net-zero targets by enacting concrete near-term measures that are less reliant on unsure offsets. This approach also allows India to nimbly adapt its sectoral transition plans as technologies mature and enable it to ratchet up its pledges periodically as required by the Paris Agreement. Forming timelines Going further, India may even consider committing to submit plausible pathways and timelines to achieving net-zero emissions as part of its future pledges. This would allow India adequate time to undertake detailed assessments of its development needs and low-carbon opportunities, the possible pace of technological developments, the seriousness of the net-zero actions by developed countries, and potential geo-political and geo-economic risks of over-dependence on certain countries for technologies or materials. India can also use this period to develop a strategic road map to enhance its own technology and manufacturing competence as part of the global clean energy supply chain, to gain benefits of employment and export revenues. Such an integrated approach, which is ambitious, credible and rooted in our developmental needs — including climate mitigation needs — will represent an ambitious, forward-looking and results-oriented India.

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||The long battle against the Maoists||In the April 3 encounter between security forces and the Maoists in Sukma, a Maoist stronghold in Chhattisgarh, 22 jawans were killed — seven from the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA), a unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and 15 from the Chhattisgarh Police. One CoBRA jawan, Rakeshwar Singh Minhas, who was held hostage by the Maoists, has since been released. This followed a message from the Maoists to a Bijapur-based journalist that mercy would be shown to Mr. Minhas if the government nominated a team of mediators to negotiate his release. A team of local people, who later went deep into the forest area from where the Maoists were operating, spoke to the rebels and prevailed upon them to release the jawan. What persuaded the extremist group to show this gesture after their cruel act of killing the 22 men is anybody’s guess. It was possibly their attempt to broadcast to the world that they are not all that violent or merciless as portrayed by the administration; that they are in fact humane and compassionate, fighting only for a cause. Determination and tactics The ease with which the Maoists are able to strike at security forces and indulge in indiscriminate killing from time to time has confounded many analysts. The frequency of attacks may fluctuate depending on the preparedness of the extremists and the strength of the establishment’s retaliation. But the tactics of the Maoists have not changed greatly. They usually spread misinformation about the numbers of Maoists on the ground in a village as well as their location. Communication equipment in the hands of government forces has not greatly improved over the years. Ambushes have, therefore, yielded rich dividends to the rebels. It is an entirely different matter that they have also paid substantially with the lives of their own ranks. What should surprise an objective observer is the determination displayed by the extremists regardless of the difficulty in periodically replenishing their ranks and keeping them in a reasonable state of morale against great odds. The Maoists can never match the government’s resources and professional prowess. This is despite the assistance they receive in terms of weaponry from various sources. But unconventional wars are not fought merely on the ground; they are battles between minds of steel. Gory incidents like the recent one in Chhattisgarh have often led to the quick charge of lack of intelligence and planning on the part of the government, as though intelligence is a piece of cake. The criticism conveniently ignores the ruggedness of the terrain from where the extremists operate and the intoxication that an anti-establishment propaganda offers to almost all members of the group. In our view, if happenings during the past five decades or so are of any indication, one cannot overstate the capacity of the extremists. What works to their advantage is the fact that many States cannot give undivided attention to the task of eradicating extremism. All that the Central and State governments often do to step up their operations is to deploy more policemen and pour in more money and improve technology, but this has an impact only for a short span of time. There is an element of fatigue that afflicts both sides. Does development help? A lot of well-meaning people, some of whom are from the five States that are often affected by Maoist fury — Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra — have ceaselessly put forward the argument that rapid economic development of a region alone would lure people away from extremist ideology. Advocacy in favour of amelioration of living conditions is hard to dismiss. To be fair, the governments involved, both in the States and at the Centre, have taken the plea seriously and implemented several development schemes in these areas. However, this has helped only partially. Andhra Pradesh is perhaps an exception where the magic of development has succeeded, especially in Srikakulam district. Civil servants who have served in that area say a dedicated leadership at the district and grassroots levels is one explanation for this transformation. Some also say inducting local youth into the security forces helps in fighting the extremists. Over-dependence on Central forces is counterproductive. For able-bodied locals to comprise security forces is commendable. The Greyhounds, raised in Andhra Pradesh in 1989, is an eloquent illustration of this. History will remember the results it produced under the phenomenal leadership of K.S. Vyas, a courageous IPS officer who unfortunately paid with his life for the valour and dynamism that he had displayed. Whatever is happening in parts of the eastern region of our country should not surprise us. Economic deprivation and religious fundamentalism often hijack the thinking processes of many populations. How else would you explain the savagery that you continually witness in many parts of poverty-afflicted Africa? What about Northern Ireland from where violent disturbances are being reported from time to time owing to the Catholic-Protestant divide? The romance attached to the Maoists is therefore difficult to dislodge. One must also realise that shared ideology and resources by like-minded groups boosts their capabilities. Objectives The objective of the Maoists is to drive a wedge between the security forces and the government so as to sow disaffection against the latter. Another aim is to serve a warning to the government that it has no option but to concede all the demands of the extremists. It is another matter that these demands, such as the formation of a ‘people’s government’, are secessionist in nature, which no constitutionally elected establishment will ever concede. This is a tricky situation that defies a lasting solution unless the rebels break down from fatigue and suffer from a situation where recruits dwindle. We don’t see this happening in the immediate future. If this assessment proves right, we may see a gradual migration of younger rebels aspiring for a better life going to other parts of the country where there are better educational opportunities. It may start as a trickle but could become a deluge over the next few decades. R.K.Raghavan is a former Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation and D.

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Fight the pandemic, not the Opposition||There is a famous saying, “bad examples serve as good warning signs”. The nation was hoping that after witnessing and experiencing the effects of a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, N-95 masks and HAZMAT suits in the harsh, dreaded summer of March-April 2020, the Central government would take corrective steps and not repeat the mistake of ending up with a lack of supply of oxygen, medicines and of prioritising exports over domestic demands in terms of vaccine availability. However, looking now at the heart-rending and urgent appeals for oxygen supplies and vaccines, and the snail’s pace of the vaccination drive and reports of vaccine shortages, it is clearly déjà vu in terms of it being sheer mishandling by the event management-obsessed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. However, amid the bad news of rising COVID-19 deaths and dipping resources, India’s young population can heave a sigh of relief that the ruling regime has finally considered the suggestion of the Opposition to look at universal vaccination and woken up to the reality that 80% of the population below 45 years of age, who constitute a large segment of the COVID-19 infected citizenry, needs protection. But, a few questions remain unanswered: why did it take so long to give the green signal for a ‘vaccine for all’ policy? Why do the scales remain tilted in favour of exports over domestic supply? Why did the wise men and women at the helm of affairs not ensure the acquisition and the manufacture of the arsenal of equipment and keep them ready to combat the current catastrophe? Had the government paid heed to saner voices and prepared itself during the last one year for domestic capacity augmentation, may be India would have been in a better position to face the second wave. Now, the bottlenecks in the domestic supply of medicines, oxygen and vaccines have become a major constraint in the fight against COVID-19. In the absence of a steady stream of these key essentials, the ‘liberalised’ vaccination drive runs the risk of becoming another victim of sketchy implementation by the BJP government. India versus the world To avoid this, decision makers must hunker down to give wings to the vaccination drive and ensure maximum factory output to achieve maximum coverage. According to information available in the public domain, India lags behind the world average of doses administered per one lakh population. Out of the population of 136 crore Indians, approximately only one crore have got both doses. With less than 8% of the population vaccinated so far, India is way behind in terms of vaccination speed and coverage. Israel has vaccinated 61.8% of its population while it is 39.2% in America. Countries such as the Seychelles and Bhutan have vaccinated 67.4% and 62% of their population, respectively. The vaccination percentage in India is behind even Morocco, where 12.6% of the population have been vaccinated. To make matters worse, several State governments, including worst-hit Maharashtra, are facing shortages; in fact, vaccination has been halted at several centres across the country. This needs to change if India has to come out of the tailspin induced by the COVID-19 storm. Engage with the U.S. The vaccine manufacturers, specifically the Serum Institute of India, has already raised a red flag over the shortage of raw materials to produce the vaccine due to export ban imposed by the United States Government invoking the U.S. Defense Production Act, 1950. Last year, India exported more than 50 million hydroxychloroquine tablets to the U.S. Therefore, the Ministry of External Affairs should not waste any more time in getting the U.S. embargo lifted by encashing the goodwill of medicine diplomacy and showing no hesitancy in seeking a return of the favour. An ‘out of stock’ vaccine scenario is not only weakening India’s fight against COVID-19 but is also leading to the erosion of public confidence in the government’s containment strategy. In addition, for the purposes of ensuring that young India and the less privileged sections of our society are not deprived of vaccination, financial deterrents need to be removed. First, States are struggling with their finances and lakhs of crores of their Goods and Services Tax dues are pending with the Centre. These dues should be cleared so that direct purchasing from the manufacturers does not have an additional burden. Second, a pricing cap should be imposed considering that unemployment is at a 45-year-high, affecting youth, and free vaccination should be made available to the weaker sections of society. Vaccine diplomacy can wait Another aspect which requires a rethink is India’s global commitment to vaccine, medicine diplomacy vis-à-vis our domestic requirements. While it is true that the pandemic of the magnitude of COVID-19 has expanded the role of nation-states to fight the virus at the global level, the national priorities and lives of their own people demand the highest priority of governments to focus on domestic needs. As per the Government’s reply in the Rajya Sabha (March 17, 2021), a total of 7.06 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccines were supplied to the States and Union Territories; whereas, during the same period, 5.96 crore doses of vaccines were exported to 74 countries. According to the latest figure of the Ministry of External Affairs, 6.60 crore doses of vaccines have been exported out of India, as on April 19, 2021, which includes supplies in the form of ‘grants-in-aid’, commercial sales and under GAVI’s COVAX facility. Similarly, during the last six months, 11 lakh remdesivir injections were exported without considering the imminent domestic demand at a time when scientists had warned about a severe second wave in India. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan made a statement in Parliament that vaccines are not being exported ‘at the expense of Indians’ — but the numbers speak for themselves. Clearly, it is time to balance out the equation. By not addressing the supply issue seriously, euphemistically speaking, the BJP government is locking up the fire brigade stations despite seeing the wildfire spread. Vaccine diplomacy can and should wait till the entire population of India is vaccinated. Last, and most importantly, the government machinery needs to shift gear from fighting the political Opposition to fighting COVID-19. By ridiculing the constructive suggestions of Opposition leaders such as Dr. Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi and then implementing them the very next day only exposes the BJP’s brand of low politics. For the sake of upholding the spirit of cooperative federalism, the Centre must shed its policy of “credit is mine and crisis is yours” and follow the motto of “we shall fight it together”. True “Utsav” will only be witnessed when a majority of Indians stand vaccinated and no patient dies as a result of a shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and/or unaffordable injections.

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Same old rote learning||Last year, as the pandemic disrupted our lives, bureaucrats and administrators associated with educational institutions released a flood of notifications and circulars. Supposedly designed to enable academic activity, these orders disregarded the distress experienced by the academic community. The unrealistic ‘one order fits all’ approach established the distress as a new feature of educational institutions. The biggest failure of the administrative response was that instead of helping institutions, faculty and students overcome the uncertainties, the focus was on unnecessary bureaucratic centralisation. The second wave, occurring at a time when students in schools and higher educational institutions transition from one level to another, has exposed the administrative inadequacies of the past year. It was obvious that the pandemic would disrupt the academic schedule for more than two years. As we return to ask the same questions from 2020 in 2021, such as those about the end and commencement of academic terms, we need to accept that the past criticisms of these administrative actions were justified. A lost opportunity The pandemic offered an opportunity to initiate sustainable reforms in the structure of the academic term and the nature of continuous assessment. It provided an opportunity to work with teachers to address their concerns, encourage better student-teacher interactions, and develop a better framework to determine the qualificatory grade for students to move to the next stage of study. But instead, the administrator’s rigid insistence on rote learning, refusal to recognise the fact that marks obtained in exams are not the only markers of a student’s capabilities, and reluctance to engage with fellow academicians and teachers to nurture academic engagement became a source of public distress. The exam system, which has been crying out for significant overhaul, could have been reformed. We needed to reduce the pressure on our students and discourage them from memorising to prepare for set and repetitive exam questions. Attention should have been given to continuous assessment and evaluation of students. A system geared to assess the students’ understanding rather than ability to memorise and reproduce should have been in place. The revised academic calendars introduced in 2020 not only undermined proper and constructive academic interaction between teachers and students but also exposed everyone to new levels of distress. While teachers conducted online classes daily, administrators were obsessed with monitoring them and showed scant interest in enquiring about the health and difficulties of their colleagues and staff. They failed to consider initiatives to assess the mental health of teachers, non-teaching staff and students. At times it seemed as if they did not fully understand the qualitative and operational differences between online and offline classes. The government and its academic bureaucracy forced upon us archaic academic visions that exposed their outdated understanding of technology and their lack of understanding of the contemporary challenges of classroom interactions. The way forward There is a pressing need for bureaucratic administrators to consult academic stakeholders and find a way forward. It is time for institutions to reconsider their approach towards exams and grading. We need to introspect on the objectives of stressful final exams, consider alternative forms of assessment for promoting students, and explore innovative ways for evaluating the teaching and learning process. School boards and universities need to alter the pattern of question papers. We need to make academic evaluation more rigorous and sustainable, reduce the number of questions to be attempted, and encourage students to write imaginatively. The idea of open book examinations needs to be developed. The next few weeks will be a testing time for decision-makers in educational institutions. They will need to display administrative acumen and show willingness to learn from mistakes. The bureaucracy must recognise that universities and schools have their own academic considerations and that the standardisation of academic requirements, calendars, and teaching and learning processes are not feasible. Administrators of educational institutions should seize the initiative from the government, avoid short-sighted decisions, and decentralise decision-making. The decisions we take should not be knee-jerk responses such as cancelling and/or postponing exams and remaining fixated with the completion of the academic term; they should help secure the academic future for students, teachers and institutions.

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Tackling vaccine hesitancy||India is seeing a second wave of COVID-19 cases. However, this time we have diagnostic tools to tackle the infection, our healthcare workers are better equipped and more informed about the virus, and we have vaccines to counter the pandemic. Benefits of vaccines Yet I get several calls a day from concerned friends and relatives on which vaccine is better or if they should take the vaccine at all. My answer to most of them is simple — a resounding yes! Vaccines are one of the most important public health tools we have to mitigate the impact of infectious diseases. While some vaccines prevent infections from gaining a foothold in our body, others reduce the severity of illnesses. Currently available COVID-19 vaccines belong to the second category: they are disease modifying vaccines. It’s important to understand that a vaccinated individual can contract SARS-CoV-2, and without getting noticeably ill, can pass it on to other susceptible individuals. That is why face masks should be worn even after one receives the COVID-19 vaccine. While at individual and community levels, COVID-19 vaccines can save lives, replacement of non-COVID-19 healthcare services at government and private facilities due to rising demand for COVID-19 care can also be avoided through rapid vaccination drives. Yet, despite such direct and indirect benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, many are still hesitant to accept these life-saving scientific interventions. This phenomenon, vaccine hesitancy, is defined by the World Health Organization as a reluctance or refusal to be vaccinated and is one of the top threats to global health. It is a complex phenomenon for which there are no easy answers — hesitancy is often extremely localised to region and sociocultural contexts. This is not new. Reluctance to vaccinate has had detrimental impacts on public health in the past. Hesitancy was observed in Britain around vaccination against whooping cough in the 1970s and 1980s, and against measles in 1990. Hesitancy around the HPV vaccine in Japan and tetanus toxoid in Kenya has also been recorded. In India, too, there was hesitancy during the polio vaccination campaign. But mothers of the polio-affected children acted as agents for social change and paved the way for India reaching polio-free status. But today’s digital age has given vaccine hesitancy new momentum. In this age of surplus information, outbreaks of misinformation, spread through social and digital media channels, have the potential to significantly impact public health. India is particularly vulnerable to this challenge because we are increasingly moving towards consumption of news and information online and through social channels. This kind of misinformation, when directed towards public health programmes such as immunisation, can adversely impact public trust, especially through an ‘echo chamber’ effect. Some solutions There cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to vaccine hesitancy, but some things have worked in the past. Key among them is building public trust through clear and transparent communication. We need to equip ourselves as well as healthcare professionals and frontline workers with the information needed to counter misinformation. The messenger is also as important as the message. Garnering the support of trusted local and community voices can build credibility and address region- and community-specific needs and remove hesitancy. Seeding positive messages proactively in the community and on social platforms and demonstrating positive behaviour change, instead of countering rumours once they circulate, have also been shown to combat hesitancy. Above all, we need to understand and address our community’s concerns with empathy, because this is not just about the COVID-19 pandemic; it is about public trust in vaccines as a whole. Only when we as a community trust that vaccines work can we mobilise, protect those who cannot be vaccinated and take a giant step towards a healthier world.

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Managing an upheaval||A combination of panic, public pressure and comprehension of the magnitude of the crisis that India is in seems to have prompted the Centre to authorise vaccines to anyone above 18 and give States more control over procurement. This is despite the problems in scaling up production, and in the supply and management of vaccines amid the surge in cases. The step could not have been easy to take. For one, the processes initiated by the government in early January to expand India’s manufacturing capacity were under the assumption that it would be at least August before vaccines could be fully opened up for all. In December, it was announced that India’s priority would be to fully inoculate 300 million of the most vulnerable. Given that about 127 million doses have been administered, including a section of those above 45 without underlying health conditions, around 17 million have been fully inoculated — or about 5% of the intended beneficiaries. At the optimistic rate of three million doses a day, it would take at least 260 days from today for every adult to get at least a single shot. Eight months ago, India had begun a decline in daily infections to the extent that by January, India’s leadership itself — going by its own policy actions — believed that a devastating second wave was unlikely. There is no other explanation why India, following the example of the U.S. and the U.K., did not tie up orders to inoculate most of its adults within this year. India also applied different standards: waiving critical trials for Covaxin, but having stringent requirements for foreign companies. The supply lines are thus inadequate. The second wave, the hospitalisation and medical-oxygen crisis, have derailed all previously laid out plans. Opening up vaccines for all on May 1 and letting States negotiate deals with manufacturers does sound like the government is ‘listening to the people’, but given the background of supply constraints until June, there is a likelihood that the story of ‘vaccine shortage’ will surface more acutely. Leading international vaccinators such as Pfizer and Moderna have supply commitments already tied up and it is unclear if merely the policy move of liberalising vaccine supply will leave States in India with the finances and negotiating power to procure enough stocks of vaccines. Moreover, given that this is the hottest month in India, lockdowns are resurfacing in cities, and no end is in sight for the second wave, the logistics of administration will continue to be challenging. It was always going to be impossible to rapidly inoculate a nation of a billion. But chaos and confusion, which now seem inevitable, could have been averted with some foresight and planning. Pragmatism and preparedness should replace hope that runs on nothing more than hype.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/managing-an-upheaval/article34371605.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||A league of their own||The decision by 12 of Europe’s biggest football clubs to unveil a plan to launch The Super League, a multi-billion-dollar tournament to be played largely among a closed group of 20 teams has thrown the European game into turmoil. Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur from England, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid from Spain, and Juventus, Internazionale and AC Milan from Italy have come together for an initiative “to put the game on a sustainable footing”. But the principal aim seems to be to upend the Champions League, the crown jewel among all competitions managed by European football’s governing body UEFA. That the announcement came just a day prior to UEFA announcing a reformatted Champions League starting from 2024 is no coincidence. The Super League will inevitably damage the domestic leagues in each of the countries. Currently, league positions decide who qualifies for the Champions League, whereas in the proposed competition, the permanent members are under no risk of missing out, and are guaranteed a steady stream of revenue. According to one report, each founding member is assured of a whopping $400 million in exchange for a mere commitment to establish a “sustainable financial foundation”. This certainly appeals to clubs struggling to balance their books in the wake of COVID-19. This use of a football club as mere for-profit business is the crux. Traditionally, clubs considered themselves to be public-spirited entities. Meaningful competition among them was seen as a meritocratic exercise. But with leagues increasingly awash with hedge fund money and handouts from oligarchies, outfits are answerable more to investors and shareholders than actual supporters. In such a scenario, unpredictability can be anathema and the Super League seeks to eliminate that. Understandably, fans are displeased. Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool manager, even claimed to have been kept in the dark. UEFA, desperate to protect its turf, has threatened to bar Super League players from its flagship events like Euros. FIFA bemoaned a “closed league”, but stopped short of announcing sanctions. The Premier League, Spain’s La Liga and Italy’s Serie A are open to expelling teams, while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has issued a stern warning. However, this is no endorsement of UEFA’s new Champions League format, in which the number of games has nearly doubled and the additional revenue is sure to skew the domestic leagues further in favour of a few teams. Juventus has won the Serie A nine times in a row; Bayern Munich (Germany) and Paris Saint-Germain (France), both of whom have not signed up for the Super League, have been equally dominant. None of this feels like competitive sport. European football needs a rethink.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-league-of-their-own/article34371606.ece

The resort to violence in setting children right must be admitted on all hands to be a confession of failure on the teacher’s part in his attempt at reform with other and better methods of chastisement. No doubt it serves to some as a convenient, though not always an effective short-cut in the classroom to get over some difficulty, save prestige or establish discipline. In some cases, it may be, according to a few, the only way to avert dangerous mischief or persistent disobedience. But the other and more important fact cannot be ignored that the remedy is of a temporary and invariably of a superficial nature. It leaves the root cause of the trouble, which is most psychological and organic in the pupil’s nature, unaltered and achieves its effects by brutal intimidation and physical force. Added to this ultimate futility is the moral degeneracy engendered in the impressionable mind of children by the apparent triumph of violence and the consequent necessity therefore in human relations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/corporal-punishment/article34371612.ece

A large crowd gathered below the players’ balcony and cheered the Indians after the match concluded on an exciting note. Sobers, the West Indies skipper, congratulated his Indian counterpart, Wadekar on his victory and his splendid generalship, at the end of the match. He said India’s superiority had a lot to do with Wadekar’s plan of attack again the West Indies left-handers on whom the team’s batting was based. “This was one of the hardest series I have ever played,” he said. Commenting on the performance of India’s opening batsman Gavaskar, who aggregated 774 runs in four Tests, Sobers said “he is a tremendous player.” The final Test saw a dramatic finish. The West Indies batsmen chasing a target of 262 runs in 155 minutes lost eight wickets for 165 runs when stumps were drawn. Final scores: India: 360 and 427; West Indies: 526 and 165 for eight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/sobers-tribute-to-wadekar-gavaskar/article34371613.ece
21 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. says container shortages resolved||The container shortages dogging exporters in recent months have been resolved for now as is reflected in the higher goods exports in March, top commerce ministry officials said on Tuesday. India, they added, has begun drafting a long-term plan with steel producers to make containers domestically. In March, the World Container Index was 233% higher than a year earlier, suggesting that overall container shortages were high worldwide. However, India had been able to address the issue for its exporters in tandem with shipping lines, the Indian Railways, the Container Corporation of India (Concor) as well as Customs and port authorities, said Pawan Agarwal, Special Secretary (logistics) in the Ministry of Commerce. “The container shortages issue... has been eased out though the problem has really been a manifestation of international developments,” Mr. Agarwal said. “During March 2021, India’s goods exports were 17%-18% higher than March 2019, so that is a very heartening feature and this has been feasible because of addressing the container shortages,” he added. “The non-availability of space in vessels calling on Indian ports, congestion at the ports and because exports were higher than imports, this imbalance was creating shortage of containers,” he said, adding that the government had cut the quarantine period for Chinese vessels from 14 days to 5-7 days in order to improve availability. As many as 2,000 empty containers were released after clearing unclaimed cargo from ports, which were also urged to stop using containers for handling cargo. While Concor had ordered 2,000 containers, which were expected in the next 4-6 months, the ministry was in talks with steel producers to create an ecosystem for manufacturing containers that need special steel, Mr. Agarwal said. China currently produces three out of every four containers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-says-container-shortages-resolved/article34371590.ece

The official, who was providing a clarification on the impact to customer operations as a result of Citigroup’s announcement that it planned to exit the retail banking business in 13 markets including India, said customers of the consumer bank would be able to avail of their usual services till a buyer or buyers were found for the business, after due approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). “There is no immediate change to our operations and no immediate impact to our colleagues as a result of this announcement,” Citibank India CEO Ashu Khullar said in a statement. “In the interim, we will continue to serve our clients with the same care, empathy and dedication that we do today,” he asserted. “We don’t have the scale we need to compete,” Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser had said on April 15, explaining the rationale behind the decision to exit the 13 markets. As part of this strategy Citi plans to exit the credit card, retail accounts and mortgage (home loan) business in India, in due course. Citigroup would, however, continue to offer in India its corporate, commercial and investment banking, brokerage, treasury and trade services, securities and fund services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/citi-tells-retail-customers-its-business-as-usual-in-india/article34371586.ece

Ratings agency Crisil has in a report called for speeding up the vaccination drive, which of late has been on a decline on a weekly basis. With infections spreading fast, more States are clamping localised restrictions on movement and commerce, which is only short of a complete lockdown, Crisil said. This has resulted in electricity consumption and e-way GST bill collections, which are used as proxies to track economic activity, softening somewhat. It needs to be seen whether this softening is a blip, or marks a shift in trend, Crisil said. The saving grace is that manufacturing and construction activities are operating, and travel and recreation services are also allowed in most States with social distancing measures, the rating agency observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/local-curbs-have-started-to-hurt-activity-says-crisil/article34371599.ece

21 April 2021||HYDERABAD,||Rowers keeping their fingers crossed||The Indian rowing contingent, preparing at the Army Rowing Node (Pune) to take part in the Asian and Oceania Continental Olympic qualifying championship in Tokyo from May 5 to 7, is optimistic that the event will be held as per schedule. With Delhi under lockdown, there is some anxiety about the visa process being completed on time even as the rowers are training under the guidance of chief National coach and Dronacharya Ismail Baig. “The Japanese Embassy has agreed to accept the visa applications directly as a special case but due to the lockdown there is a problem submitting the documents,” said Rajlaxmi Singh Deo, president, Rowing Federation of India. Preparatory mode The rowers went into the preparatory mode from last October in Pune, where there is a man-made Olympic channel and look at the Tokyo qualifying event as the last one to make the cut for the Olympics though there is another one scheduled at Lucerne, Switzerland, from May 16 to 18. “It is the Asian meet from which the Indians made it to the last few Olympics and Switzerland event is not on our radar for many reasons,” Baig told The Hindu from Pune. “We are going ahead with the preparations in a secured bio bubble, assuming that the qualifiers will be on as per schedule. There is no word yet officially either about it being postponed or cancelled.” Interestingly, the qualifiers will be the first competition for the Indian rowers after last year’s Asian meet. Without seasoned campaigners — Olympian Dattu Bhokanal (out of contention on disciplinary grounds) and two-time Asiad medallist Sawarn Singh (quitting the sport) — the Indian hopes hinge on an inexperienced men’s squad of Jakar Khan (single sculls), Arjun Lal Jat (double sculls), Arvind Singh (single sculls), Sunil Attri (single and double sculls) and Shantanu Kumar (para). In Bhopal, the women’s team comprising Khushpreet Kaur (single sculls), Vindhya Sankat (double sculls), Rukmani Dangi (double sculls), and Sona Keer (single and double sculls) is being trained by 1990 Asiad medallist and Arjuna Awardee Dalvir Singh for the Tokyo qualifiers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rowers-keeping-their-fingers-crossed/article34371943.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Mishra bamboozles MI’s heavy-hitters in game-breaking spell||Until recently, Twenty20 was considered a youngster’s game. But Amit Mishra, Shikhar Dhawan and Steven Smith underlined the worth of seasoned campaigners, playing a vital role in Delhi Capitals avenging last season’s final loss to Mumbai Indians with a six-wicket win in a low-scoring tie on Tuesday. Sensible approach While Mishra spun his web around the MI batsmen on a turner at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, helping restrict the defending champion to 137 for nine, Dhawan and Smith batted sensibly to keep DC’s chase on course. Despite both batsmen being dismissed at inopportune moments — Smith plumb in front to Kieron Pollard in the 10th over and Dhawan caught on the square boundary off leggie Rahul Chahar in the 15th — Lalit Yadav and Shimron Hetmyer saw DC home with five balls to spare. Credit must also be given to the DC think-tank for altering the team combination to suit unfamiliar conditions. Playing its first game of the season in Chennai, DC read the turner to perfection and brought in Mishra and Hetmyer in place of Lukman Meriwala and Chris Woakes. The changes proved decisive, overturning captain Rishabh Pant’s luck at the toss. When Rohit Sharma got off to a flier — tonking Kagiso Rabada onto the roof in the PowerPlay — it seemed as if he would run away with the game before the dew could make life miserable for his bowlers later in the night. Mishra, however, changed the course of the contest with three wickets in eight balls. Rohit had to bat deep after losing Quinton de Kock (caught behind off Marcus Stoinis, who opened the attack) and Suryakumar Yadav (dismissed in similar fashion by Avesh Khan). But Mishra deceived the MI skipper and Hardik Pandya with flight and a bit of turn in the ninth over to give DC the advantage. The pitch started showing its true colours from then on, as Mishra got rid of Kieron Pollard with a googly and then had Ishan Kishan, MI’s last hope, chopping on in the 18th over. DC’s chase suffered an early setback. Off-spinner Jayant Yadav, brought in to combat the opposition left-handers, forced the right-handed Prithvi Shaw into a return catch. But a risk-free 53-run partnership between Dhawan and Smith steadied the ship before the latter took a few more risks in the latter half. Despite MI’s recent trend of defending moderate totals, Hetmyer and Lalit, promoted to No. 4, dealt with jittery moments and held their nerve at the death. Pollard — the stand-in skipper, with Rohit not on the field for most of the chase — bowled a no-ball to give DC the win.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mishra-bamboozles-mi-heavy-hitters-in-game-breaking-spell/article34371713.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Whatever the sport, the threat of disruption is ever present||As European football is thrown into a tizzy by the new ‘super’ league run by rich men with the primary aim of making themselves richer, the words of the American sportswriter Dave Zirin assume relevance. “Owners in the 21st century,” he wrote, “are destroying what took more than a hundred years to build.” But there’s an old question that becomes relevant too: Whom does a sport belong to? A combination of sponsors’ deep pockets, television, and players seeking the highest bidder for their skills is irresistible and influences the direction a sport takes. Cricket has been there before. WSC and ICL episodes When Kerry Packer was denied television rights to cricket in Australia despite offering more money, he signed up top international players for a league of his own, World Series Cricket (WSC). Nearly three decades later, after Zee Television was similarly snubbed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, it established the Indian Cricket League (ICL) with players from around the world. Both the WSC and the ICL were rebel leagues that led to many of the players being banned. For the organisers, there was an element of hurt ego involved, but mainly it was seen as a way of squeezing more money from sport. Both failed because they did not share the spoils with an important player — the administrators. When a compromise was reached in Australia, and Packer received the rights for his Channel Nine to broadcast matches there, WSC became irrelevant. The tournament had lasted two years, the same as the ICL in India. The BCCI borrowed the idea, refined it, gave it their seal of approval, worked out the optics, and the IPL was born. Deep pockets of the sponsors, television, and players seeking the highest bidder for their skills had met with official endorsement and there were no more roadblocks. The establishment had joined the ranks of the money-grabbers. Competition goes for a toss The European Super League (ESL) has been envisaged as a tournament with 20 teams, 15 of them permanent with no promotion or relegation for them. Competition, the bedrock of sport is thus thrown out of the window. The Guardian summed it up neatly: “For supporters, the sense of jeopardy on which meaningful sport depends will be removed, turning elite football into a soulless series of repeat episodes.” Cricket has been there too. Or nearly so. In 2014, India, Australia and England decided to formally take over the game. The Big Three called it ‘restructuring’. Wisden called it the ‘great carve up of world cricket’. The Future Tours Programme would be ditched, and international cricket would be a sport among the Big Three with the others, from New Zealand to Pakistan playing supporting roles, the straight men to the jokers’ lead. Also, whatever the final configuration of teams playing against one another, there would be no relegation for the Big Three. The first rule of international sport prevailed: He who pays the piper calls the tune. The idea fell through. While one Indian chairman of the International Cricket Council, N. Srinivasan proposed, another, his successor Shashank Manohar disposed. At any rate, the proposal was heavily criticised, and the BCCI had its own domestic legal problems to attend to. The current dispensation did try to resurrect a portion of the grand plan, but realised that even television might tire of broadcasting endless series between India and Australia. The threat of disruption, however, is ever present. The ICC, which attempts to keep the delicate balance between the bullies and the bullied, has not always been successful at this. Cricket being a human activity, cannot claim immunity from greed and selfishness. Who owns sport? So — to come back to our original question — who owns sport? Players, administrators, television, corporates? Or the fan who pours into it his love and aspirations, his intensities and desires? You could argue that the fan is the strongest element here, for if he decides to switch off his television or refuses to buy the brand of nail clippers being advertised during breaks in play, he could bring down the sports-commercial complex. Interestingly, as many countries move further to the right of the political spectrum, an area that lays great store by such notions as patriotism and nationalism, international sport seems to be moving in a different direction, with emphasis on clubs and franchises. Perhaps all sports aspire towards Formula One, with corporates running teams and nationality being purely incidental. In this scenario, the average fan might prefer to watch A.B. de Villiers and Virat Kohli bat together for a franchise than two of their countrymen wear the national colours. If cricket and other sports have lessons to learn from the ESL, it is the ease with which a traditional, popular sport can be hijacked. Because, as the marketing men keep reminding us, “the market decides.” So convenient!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/whatever-the-sport-the-threat-of-disruption-is-ever-present/article34371776.ece
21 April 2021||Leeds,||Leeds holds Liverpool||Liverpool conceded an 87th-minute equaliser to draw 1-1 at Leeds on Monday, denying Jurgen Klopp’s team a spot in the top four of the English Premier League. Liverpool stayed in sixth place, outside the Champions League places, after Spain defender Diego Llorente scored with a header from an inswinging corner to earn Leeds a point that the team’s second-half fightback might have deserved. Sadio Mane stroked the ball into an empty net in the 31st minute from a squared pass from Trent Alexander-Arnold to give Liverpool the lead and put the deposed champion on course for a fourth straight victory. A win would have lifted Liverpool above West Ham and into fourth place. Liverpool came in for lots of criticism ahead of the game — from its own fans and those of rival clubs — for being greedy and damaging the integrity of the English and wider game because of its role in the Super League plans.  The result: Liverpool 1 (Sadio Mane 31) drew with Leeds 1 (Diego Llorente 87) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/leeds-holds-liverpool/article34371771.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Super Kings eager to ride the momentum||After two comprehensive wins in two games, Chennai Super Kings will hope to ride the momentum when it takes on Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Wednesday. The three-time champion has adapted to the conditions since its defeat to Delhi Capitals in the first match, winning a game each while chasing and defending. The team has benefitted from the arrival of Moeen Ali, who has provided a spark to its batting firepower, playing at No. 3. With deep batting resources, stretching down to No. 11 Deepak Chahar, the team can be more aggressive at the top of the order. The only area of concern is opener Ruturaj Gaikwad’s form, but coach Stephen Fleming categorically said the team would continue to back the youngster. The team is unlikely to tinker with its line-up and is on firm footing against KKR, which will play its first game in Mumbai on Wednesday. In a welcome development for CSK, Jason Behrendorff has reached New Delhi and is serving his mandatory quarantine. After a comprehensive win against Sunrisers Hyderabad in its first match, KKR has struggled. It lost from a position of strength against both Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore.  The team will need a bit more consistency from its middle-order of Rahul Tripathi, Eoin Morgan and Dinesh Karthik. Coach Brendon McCullum hinted that Sunil Narine could play in this game, most likely as a replacement for Shakib Al Hasan. KKR will hope that the more batting-friendly pitches of Mumbai, compared with the ones in Chennai, can change its fortunes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/super-kings-eager-to-ride-the-momentum/article34371705.ece

A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Wednesday. SRH has started with three defeats in a row, ceding the advantage from promising positions in all three chases. It needs to solve a middle-order muddle. David Warner and Jonny Bairstow have been aggressive, but there remains a question mark over the batting line-up, not least around Manish Pandey, who has failed to close games out. Williamson could play Kane Williamson, if fit, could play. Bairstow donning the keeping gloves could open up a slot for Kedar Jadhav. SRH’s bowling is its strongest suit: an array of options, with Rashid Khan as a genuine wicket-taking threat in the middle overs. But the form of Bhuvneshwar Kumar will be a concern. He has gone for 120 runs in three matches and picked up just two wickets. Meanwhile, PBKS will draw inspiration from Mayank Agarwal’s return to form. He made a 36-ball 69 against Delhi Capitals on Sunday. The side has quality batsmen in K.L. Rahul, Chris Gayle and Deepak Hooda, but the bowling is spread thin.  Mohammed Shami, Jhye Richardson and Riley Meredith have gone for runs, with Arshdeep Singh, currently its highest wicket-taker, being the only outlier. PBKS could consider including Chris Jordan to break the sameness in the pace attack. The game will give an early indication of whether one of these teams can go deep in the tournament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/srh-and-pbks-eye-climb-from-bottom/article34371709.ece
21 April 2021||LOndon,||Chelsea and Manchester City all set to pull out of Super League amidst a backlash||Premier League clubs Chelsea and Manchester City were reported to be preparing the paperwork to withdraw from the breakaway European Super League less than 72 hours after agreeing to join it in a major blow for the proposed new competition. Shortly before the BBC reported that the two English clubs were set to back out of the breakaway competition, the new league went to court in Spain to stop football authorities from thwarting its plans. Chelsea and City were among the 12 teams who announced on Sunday that they were setting up a rival to UEFA’s Champions League without the need for annual qualification. Opposition The announcement prompted a wave of opposition from within the game, political world and public opinion, particularly in England. Neither Chelsea, Manchester City nor the Super League organisation immediately responded to a request for comment. The move came shortly after the Super League won a preliminary ruling from a Madrid court to stop European football body UEFA and the sport’s global governing body FIFA from imposing sanctions designed to stop the new formation. It was not immediately clear what authority the Madrid court, which adjudicates corporate disputes, had over the Swiss-based football bodies and a source close to UEFA said the organisation was “relaxed” about the ruling. The Super League has been hoping that a mixture of defensive court actions and momentum would lead football’s authorities to accept its new competition within the game. FIFA president Gianni Infantino said that the clubs cannot be “half in, half out” of the established framework. UEFA has threatened to ban the 12 clubs, who include Manchester United and Real Madrid, from domestic and international competition, with Infantino adding his voice to the backlash. Face the consequences “We strongly disapprove ... if some go their own way then they must live with the consequences of their choice, either you are in, or you are out. You cannot be half in and half out,” Infantino told UEFA’s congress in Montreux, Switzerland. The magnitude of the upheaval has led political leaders across Europe to speak out, and, in some cases, to threaten intervention. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would consider passing legislation to stop the breakaway, likening the plans to creating a cartel. Amid continued condemnation and threats, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin offered an olive branch to the breakaway dozen, asking them to “think again”. The English Premier League said it “unanimously and vigorously” rejected the plans, while the German Football Association (DFB) went even further, demanding the suspension of the 12 founding clubs until they reconsider. Candid Guardiola Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was candid in his opinion of the proposed league. “It is not a sport where the relation between effort and success does not exist,” he said, while saying those behind it had an obligation to give more information. “It is not a sport where success is already guaranteed or it doesn’t matter where you lose.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fifa-disapproves-of-super-league-uefa-president-implores-clubs-to-reconsider/article34371719.ece
21 April 2021||MUMBAI,||ICC T20 World Cup: BCCI shortlists venues||The BCCI may have shortlisted nine venues for the ICC T20 World Cup, but India is far from being confirmed as the venue for the marquee event, scheduled to be played in October-November this year. The BCCI’s apex council earlier this week shortlisted Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Delhi, Dharamshala, Lucknow, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Mumbai to stage the event, with Ahmedabad proposed to host the final. However, with a surge in COVID-19 cases, The Hindu understands that at least a couple of full members of the ICC have expressed reservations about travelling to India. In order to ensure the safety for all the travelling contingents, an ICC events and logistics team is scheduled to travel to India next week to conduct recce at a few venues. However, the recent wave in COVID-19 cases may force postponement of the tour. According to a BCCI insider, even if the ICC team defers its plan, it shouldn’t be construed as “a cause for concern” since “the BCCI hopes that the ICC annual conference in June will erase all the doubts”. A couple of member boards are in favour of the event being awarded to Australia, which is scheduled to stage next year’s T20 World Cup.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bcci-shortlists-t20-wc-venues-despite-covid-19-scare/article34371722.ece

21 April 2021||PALLEKELE,||SL eyes elusive Test win||It’s been a long time between Test wins for Sri Lanka, a record coach Mickey Arthur has ensured the players are acutely aware of. Sri Lanka will start a two-match series against Bangladesh on Wednesday, aiming for its first Test win since January 2020. The run since then has included two losses in South Africa, two losses at home to England and two draws in the Caribbean against the West Indies. Costly mistakes In all six tests, Sri Lanka had its chance but let the game slip away after some costly mistakes. A batting collapse, dropped catches, injuries and poor use of DRSthe decision referral system to review umpiring calls have been costly. “We have spoken at length about taking that opportunity when it presents itself and applying pressure for long period until the opposition inevitably breaks,” Arthur said. Sri Lanka has won 16 of its 20 Tests against Bangladesh and lost only once — at Colombo in 2017 — although three of the last eight matches have ended in a draw. There is a nice grass cover on the pitch and, while most expect the curator to shave it off before the Test starts on Wednesday, Sri Lanka seems to have changed its strategies to bank on its fast bowlers more than an inexperienced spin department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lanka-eyes-elusive-test-win/article34371779.ece

21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||One hundred years of fortitude||While arthritis has restricted her mobility over the last eight years, the pandemic lockdown has confined her to her room over the last 14 months. But Madurai’s much-loved obstetrician, Dr R Padmavathy, has a spirit that refuses to be cowed down. Her 100th birthday is just a week away. Her family realises it is a milestone but cannot get together in the midst of the pandemic. Blessed with three sons, a daughter, their spouses, eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren spread between the US and Chennai, the matriarch worries about their safety. “We will cut a cake at home and do a video call with the others,” says Dr R Gurusundar, her eldest son, who lives with her in Madurai. Her loved ones in Chennai used to take turns to visit her every month. “I miss my grandchildren,” says Dr Padmavathy, and breaks into a song that, she says, was written on the day she was born by her father Dr R Sundararajan. In the song, he fondly calls her Muni Prema (after her mother Muniammal) and declares that his first child born on April 27, 1921, would grow up to care for women’s health. Man with a vision In the 1900s, Dr Padmavathy’s father was perturbed by the plight of women in the region as they chose to suffer than consult male doctors. Of her nine siblings, five sisters and two brothers went on to join the medical profession. People from her community — apparently as a mark of protest against her going to school — would often throw her school bag into the well. Each time, he bought her a new set of books and raised her confidence. There was family pressure to get her married at 15 but yet again, her father resisted and got her enrolled at The American College, Madurai,. Later, she completed MBBS from Madras Medical College in 1949 and joined Government Erskine Hospital in Madurai as House Surgeon where her father was working as a Senior Civil Surgeon. He welcomed his daughter with an Austin and the 28-year-old woman created a flutter on Madurai‘s streets — a lady doctor who could also drive a car was an uncommon combination those days. When Dr Padmavathy got selected as an Assistant Civil Surgeon and was posted as the medical officer at Kodaikanal Government Hospital, there was a tussle between the then-Commissioner of Madurai Municipality who sought her services, and the District Medical Officer, who would not let her off the Government job. Yet again, her father’s word prevailed; he wanted his daughter to serve women in their hometown Madurai. And so, Dr Padmavathy became the first lady doctor to join the then-Madurai Municipality in 1950. She soon became the Superintendent of all the municipal maternity homes. “Nothing baffled her and her delivering high-risk pregnancy cases with success became a household story,” says Padmavathy’s eldest daughter-in-law, Dr G Sundari, who too was delivered by her “safe hands”. A career of firsts Showing sepia-toned photos of her trip to Poland for advanced training in maternity and child health sponsored by the World Health Organization in 1969, Padmavathy goes down memory lane. She was among the three Indian doctors selected for the training, and upon returning she pioneered and shaped mass maternity and child health programmes. She integrated the two, and subsequently the Central Government adopted this as a health policy. She introduced the dormiciliary deliveries (health visitor-assisted safe deliveries in rural homes of pregnant women who could not visit hospitals) and also got the Corporation Council to sanction an exclusive 24X7 standby ambulance that could rush pregnant women to the Goverment hospital in case of emergency. She married at 30 and built a 10-bed nursing home-cum-residence with her husband G Ramaswami, a school headmaster. Called Padmalaya Health Clinic, it still stands basking in her reputation, perhaps the only health centre without a theatre for caesarian operations. In later years her son, a general surgeon, and his gynaecologist wife trained by Dr Padmavathy established the Padmalaya Hospital in Jaihindpuram. The couple now runs both places. Says Sundari, “When I entered this house as a bride, she told me the woman has to be the head of the house and gave me all freedom. Her zest for life is worth emulating.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/one-hundred-years-of-fortitude/article34371755.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||A collective effort||A WhatsApp group made up of film technicians, actors and film aspirants in Kerala called Vellithira (meaning silver screen) pooled in their resources and have made a short film titled Kaakka , which is now streaming on the OTT platform Nee Stream. Formed in 2016, this WhatsApp group has 256 members and is as much a resource as it is a means of networking. Before the pandemic outbreak, the members of Vellithira had been toying with the idea of producing a film. However, that plan fell through when the lockdown started. “We had no clue when and how theatres would open. That is when the short film idea came up and I pitched my story,” says the film’s director Aju Ajeesh. “The film was made with the money we raised as donations — ranging from Rs. 500 to Rs. 30,000 — from our members. We raised close to Rs. 3 lakh; none of us (cast and crew) took any payment for the work. All the money was spent on accommodation, food and equipment,” Aju adds. Initially, the plan was to make a feature film with the story of Kaakka , but the team of writers, including Aju, Gopika K Das and Shinoj Ennikkal, felt it was more suited as a short. “Everyone who has been a part of this project has worked in the film industry. Kaakka has been made like a feature film and for a theatrical release, we have not compromised on anything,” Aju adds.  The short film Kaakka pivots around Panchami, a woman who is not confident about her looks||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-collective-effort/article34371761.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||A digital artisan-buyer connect||In the initial stages of the pandemic, one of the things that came to the fore was the need to support indigenous, sustainably produced goods that have a lower carbon footprint, and nurture artisan families as well. With tourism coming to a standstill, there was a need to take handmade products from artisan villages directly to buyers. A few e-commerce giants stepped in to stock products from the handloom and craft sector, but there is always room for more. Yeebo, a month-old marketplace that connects artisans to the buyers directly, is taking a step towards plugging the existing gaps. Founded by Delhi-based Maahin Puri and Ikshitha Puri, the app has on board more than 300 artisans and has been downloaded by more than 3,000 potential buyers. The mobile application interface is built such that artisans can set up their shop on Yeebo following a few steps, even if they are not tech-savvy: “Some of the villages we visited are off Google Maps and we found incredible handmade products there. Many artisans are not comfortable with browsing websites, but they use mobile apps easily. That helped us develop Yeebo,” says Maahin, a Duke University graduate in Economics and Computer Science. After graduation, he returned from the US, wanting to use technology to help small businesses: “Technology can be an equaliser. We learnt that there’s a huge untapped sector where nearly 70 lakh artisans (according to Development Commissioner — Handicrafts, Ministry of Textiles, Government of India website) are involved in handmade products — textiles and crafts,” says Maahin. Maahin was joined by Ikshitha Puri, who is pursuing her Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Award-winning artisans The artisans on board Yeebo hail from different Indian states — those specialising in Kashmiri shawls, blue pottery from Rajasthan, Rogan art from Kutch and Madhubani (Mithila) paintings from Bihar, to name a few. There are award-winning master craftspeople as well: Padma Shri awardee Abdul Gafur Khatri (Rogan art), Shilp guru Ram Gopal (Blue pottery) and National award winner Abid Nabi (Woodcraft). Maahin and Ikshitha share that during their visits to craft villages near Delhi, Meerut and Jaipur, they learnt that many artisans had not heard of popular e-commerce giants. Others were wary of selling alongside machine-made products that are sold on discounts: “They aren’t comfortable with competitive pricing for handmade products,” says Maahin. Artisans upload images and pricing details of their products and once an order is placed, the product is shipped to the buyer by the artisan. “The transaction is between the craftspeople and buyers; we take a 10% commission,” say the founders. The platform is a work in progress. At the moment, artisans list their products with images and little else. There is scope for short bios that detail the work of an artisan or a brief note of the craft and its significance. Plans are also on to popularise the platform through online and offline modes, through partnerships with Snarechat, Modern Bazaar and the Ministry of Textiles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-digital-artisan-buyer-connect/article34371758.ece
21 April 2021||LUCKNOW,||‘Lack of timely care hurting patients in U.P.’||A distraught Ambar Srivastava stands outside the mortuary at a government hospital, waiting to receive the body of his mother who died early on Monday after struggling for days to find necessary treatment. Mr. Srivastava alleges that his mother, who was 67, died due to negligence by the hospital staff. He says they failed to administer oxygen to her in time. However, an official of the government-run Lokbandhu Shri Raj Narayan Combined Hospital denied the allegations but said he would look into the matter. Mr. Srivastava’s ordeal over the past few days typifies the struggle faced by patients in Uttar Pradesh, especially Lucknow, in securing hospital beds, oxygen supply and medicine in time as COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise. Mr. Srivastava’s mother was admitted to the hospital at 2 a.m. on Monday. Kanak Srivastava, a diabetic with blood pressure and thyroid illness, was initially admitted to a private hospital here, but after her COVID-19 status turned out positive, the hospital asked the family to shift her elsewhere as they did not have the necessary quarantine facility, her kin said. Even as her oxygen levels continued to drop, Mr. Srivastava says he spent over 24 hours calling up the COVID-19 control room but failed to secure a bed. The family had to support her with an oxygen cylinder they purchased as the private hospital ran out of supply. However, following his appeals on social media, he managed to get his mother admitted to Lokbandhu. ‘Was not given oxygen’ “Her oxygen levels dropped to 67-70 but she was fine at night. In the morning, she was breathless. My brother approached the doctors and the staff but they did not provide her with a cylinder,” Mr. Srivastava alleged. Medical Superintendent of the hospital, Ajay Shankar Tripathi, said he would get Mr. Srivastava’s allegations checked but maintained that there was no shortage of oxygen supply. The hospital had a stock of 265 cylinders besides the separate pipeline in the ICU, said the official. Mr. Srivastava submitted a complaint, demanding strict action against the staff for their “gross negligence.” Many families also narrated how the delay due to running around from one hospital to another had led to deterioration in the condition of patients. In Varanasi, Vishal Sahu, a law student, managed to get his mother Laxmi Devi admitted to a government hospital more than a week after she reported ill and after three-four days of desperate search. His mother is a diabetic. While it was difficult to find beds in government hospitals, the private facilities simply refused, said Mr. Sahu. “Private hospitals said the condition of the patient was bad and that they do not have Level-3 COVID infrastructure,” Mr. Sahu said. His mother got tested on April 10 at a private laboratory. The results, however, came in three days later, he said. Since then, she was at home and all attempts made by the family to purchase oxygen cylinders proved futile. “We wasted all these days at home. After admission to the hospital, her oxygen level is under control—it is 91 with cylinder support—but she has become very weak and is unable to speak,” said Mr. Sahu. Lockdown in 5 cities While directing a lockdown in five cities of U.P., the Allahabad High Court on Monday took note of the issues in testing and treatment. While VIPs were getting their RT-PCR reports within 12 hours, the ordinary citizen was kept waiting for two or three days, the court said. It added that it emerged from the government hospitals that admission of patients to ICUs was largely being done on the recommendation of VIPs. The judges termed the state’s early testing scheme or plan “a farce”. If hospitals are not able to provide beds and oxygen, cities like Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur and Gorakhpur cannot provide medical aid to even 10% of the population at any given point in time, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/lack-of-timely-care-hurting-patients-in-up/article34371926.ece
21 April 2021||CHANDIGARH,||No lockdown in Haryana, announces Chief Minister||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Tuesday said no lockdown would be imposed in the State but there would be strict compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. The Chief Minister, addressing a live telecast programme, urged the labourers and workers to not panic. “Adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that no labourer and worker face any problem. This time, keeping the interest of the labourers and workers, especially those working on daily and monthly wages, no lockdown would be imposed in Haryana,” said the Chief Minister. “To ensure adequate medical arrangement for COVID-19 patients, the State government has recently held discussion with the DRDO officials for setting up a 500-1,000 bedded dedicated COVID hospital in Panipat,” he added. He said there is a steady increase in COVID-19 cases, which is a serious matter of concern. “In the last one and a half months, the number of new infection cases has reached about 7000 in one day. To deal with this emergent situation a state-level COVID Monitoring Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Health Minister Anil Vij,” said the Chief Minister. Mr. Lal said: “There is no shortage of oxygen supply. Liquid oxygen is being produced in the oxygen plant at Panipat. Simultaneously, efforts are being made to ensure the availability of oxygen in gas form,” he said. Separately, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij said at present there are about 42,000 active cases in the State out of which about 30,000 are in home isolation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/no-lockdown-in-haryana-announces-chief-minister/article34371924.ece
21 April 2021||April 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Not all deaths getting audited in Odisha||Despite COVID-19 cases rising sharply and a large number of consequential deaths occurring in different districts, the consolidated information disseminated by Odisha government has put the death toll on the lower side, fuelling suspicion about under-reporting of fatalities. Since April 1, the State government has reported 32 deaths due to COVIDfrom across 30 districts. However, information trickling in from districts about fatalities is vastly different from the State government’s claim. “As many as 19 patients, who were admitted in our centre, have died. Only six deaths have been audited,” said Sudhir Ranjan Nayak, who heads Nuapada COVID-19 Hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/not-all-deaths-getting-audited-in-odisha/article34371923.ece
