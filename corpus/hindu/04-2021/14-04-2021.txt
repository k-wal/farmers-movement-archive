14 April 2021||CHENNAI,||Centre fast-tracks approval for more vaccine candidates||In a major shift in vaccine approval policy, the government has decided to fast track approvals for COVID-19 vaccines that have been developed outside India and have been granted the emergency use authorisation (EUA) by other drug regulatory agencies. The decision was taken based on the recommendation made by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) at a meeting held on April 11, to “expand the basket of vaccines for domestic use and hasten the pace and coverage”. The vaccines that would be eligible for the fast-track approval will include those that have been granted an EUA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) of Japan, or those that have been prequalified by the WHO for emergency use. This would mean that Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines would be eligible for fast-track approval. Under the fast-track approval process, bridging studies will take place in parallel to mass vaccination. So far, clinical trials conducted in India were needed before the Indian regulator could approve the vaccine. But before the mass roll-out of the vaccines that are developed and tested abroad can happen, the vaccines will be first given to 100 beneficiaries and these individuals will be assessed for seven days for safety outcomes. “The decision will facilitate quicker access to such foreign vaccines by India and would encourage imports including import of bulk drug material, optimal utilisation of domestic fill and finish capacity etc., which will in turn provide a fillip to vaccine manufacturing capacity and total vaccine availability for domestic [use],” a government release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-fast-tracks-approval-for-more-vaccine-candidates/article34314615.ece

14 April 2021||New Delhi,||Skymet forecasts a ‘healthy normal’ monsoon||Skymet Weather, a private weather forecast company, said on Tuesday that the monsoon was likely to be 103% of the long period average (LPA) this year. The LPA refers to the average all-India monsoon rainfall of 88 cm, which is a 50-year mean. At the press conference, the agency classified the forecast as “healthy normal”. The monsoon in 2019 and 2020 was only the third time in a century of back-to-back years of above normal rainfall (rainfall that is 5% above normal, or 105%) during the season in India. This year’s forecast by Skymet falls a little short of the above normal mark. “The odds of an El Nino, characterised by a heating of the equatorial central Pacific over half a degree, are low this year. Currently, the Pacific is in a [converse] La Nina mode, and while it is expected to weaken a bit in the coming months, during the monsoon months [June-September], it is forecast to increase,” G.P. Sharma, president-meteorology, Skymet Weather, said. “Overall, neutral conditions are likely to prevail,” he said. An El Nino is historically associated, in many years, with a weakening of the monsoon over India. The monsoon is also expected to be fairly well-distributed, with even September (the month in which the season starts to recede) expected to post 10% more rainfall than normal. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), which provides the official forecasts, is expected to announce its forecast later this month. Last year, Skymet did not release its official monsoon forecast. In 2019, it forecast below normal rainfall and the IMD “near normal”. In defiance of these calculations, India posted a record 10% excess rainfall. In terms of geographical risk, Skymet expects that the plains of North India, along with a few parts of northeast India, to be at risk of being rain deficient through the season. Also, interior parts of Karnataka face scare or scanty rain in the core monsoon months of July and August, the forecast said. Along with the El Nino, another ocean variable, the Indian Ocean Dipole, characterised by a temperature gradient in the western and eastern Indian Ocean, may be slightly on the negative. A positive dipole usually aids the monsoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/skymet-forecasts-a-healthy-normal-monsoon/article34315202.ece

14 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Committed to framing rules for CAA, says Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah has said the Bharatiya Janaa Party-led Central government is committed to framing the rules for the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the only reason it was delayed was because of the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Shah said the delay in framing rules was not due to the West Bengal Assembly resolution blocking the CAA “but the fact that it involves a large-scale exercise in all border States. Due to the pandemic, undertaking this CAA exercise would not be advisable. The fight against COVID-19 is a priority that is why the rules for the CAA are delayed.” Answering a question on advisability of large gatherings in poll rallies and roadshows when India was undergoing a massive second wave, the Union Minister said there was “no alternative under the Constitution” to delay polls when the life of a legislative body had come to an end. “Maybe going forward if all parties come together we can come or should have suggested some alternatives to postpone polls or extend the life of elected Assemblies, but currently even the ECI [Election Commission of India] has no alternatives, and as political parties we have even less space, as we have to prepare for polls when the Election Commission of India sets the date,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/committed-to-framing-rules-for-caa-says-shah/article34314613.ece

14 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||NRC: Nagaland govt. told to be cautious with its version||An apex body of Naga tribes has asked the Nagaland government not to be hasty with the exercise to prepare the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants of Nagaland (RIIN), seen as a variant of Assam’s National Register of Citizens. The Nagaland government has reportedly been trying to revive the RIIN exercise, launched in July 2019, with the stated objective of preventing outsiders from obtaining fake indigenous certificates for seeking jobs and benefits of government schemes. The State government had formed a three-member panel headed by retired bureaucrat Banuo Z. Jamir for “studying, examining, and recommending and advising” on the implementation of the RIIN. But the exercise was suspended following protests from community-based and extremist organisations. The Naga Hoho, the apex tribal body that had objected to the RIIN in 2019, has reacted to the State government’s alleged bid to implement it with a tentative timetable. “The issue of RIIN should be handled with utmost care as it could have unforeseen and dangerous implications for the Nagas ,” it said in a statement. The State government had tasked the RIIN committee to determine the eligibility criteria to be an indigenous inhabitant, and authority to authenticate claims of being indigenous. The Naga Hoho said it was apprehensive of “dreadful consequences” if the “advocates of RIIN” implement the identification process with December 1, 1963 — the day Nagaland attained Statehood — as the cut-off date for determining the “permanent residents” of the State. This date is likely to exclude Nagas who have come from beyond the boundaries of Nagaland.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nrc-nagaland-govt-told-to-be-cautious-with-its-version/article34314740.ece

14 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||India has walked the talk: Modi||India has “walked the talk” on helping the world counter the coronavirus pandemic despite its “limited resources,” said Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, pointing to the supply of millions of doses of Indian-made COVID-19 vaccines, and said the world’s mistaken priorities were the reason for the global struggle to defeat the virus. “We understand fully that mankind will not defeat the pandemic unless all of us, everywhere, regardless of the colour of our passports, come out of it. That is why, this year, despite many constraints, we have supplied vaccine to over 80 countries,” Mr. Modi said at the inaugural session of the annual Raisina Dialogue conference co-hosted by the External Affairs Ministry and the Observer Research Foundation (ORF). Despite rising numbers and a “second wave” of cases in India, the government has decided not to ban the export of Indian-made vaccines, most of which have been committed as commercial consignments, or as part of the COVAX global alliance. Since January 21, the government has allowed the supply of 6.51 crore doses of the two Indian-made vaccines, of which about 1.05 crore are donations or grants from the government to 90 countries worldwide. Mr. Modi said the world was “under-prepared” for the COVID-19 pandemic. Pointing to the post-Second World War order, the United Nations and other multilateral structures that he said had been created only in order to prevent “the Third World War”, Mr. Modi said the world should have instead focused on hunger, poverty and humanitarian issues. “All the steps taken were to prevent the last war not the next one. While the humanity has not faced the Third World War, the threat of violence has not reduced in people’s lives. With a number of proxy wars and unending terror attacks, the prospect of violence is ever present,” he said, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented an opportunity to reshape the world order now. ‘Watershed moment’ In his taped speech that was shared over a virtual platform, Mr. Modi thanked participants of the Raisina Dialogue, especially the other leaders speaking at the four-day conference, including Rwandan President Paul Kagame, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the President of the European Council Charles Michel, for attending in a year he called a “watershed moment in human history”. Mr. Morrison, whose earlier plans to address the Raisina Dialogue in 2020 had to be cancelled due to the Australia forest fire crisis as well, will address the conference virtually later this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-has-walked-the-talk-modi/article34314517.ece

14 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Notice to Ghosh over Sitalkuchi comments||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday issued a notice to West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh for violating provisions of the Model Code of Conduct and the Indian Penal Code for making an “inflammatory statement” threatening the people of Bengal during a public rally at Barangar in North 24 Parganas. The ECI said it had received a complaint from Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien about the speech that was “an open threat” to Bengal and its people. Referring to the Central forces firing on a mob on polling day on April 10 in Sitalkuchi, in which four people were killed, Mr. Ghosh said the incident would be the start. “Where did so many naughty boys come from? Those naughty boys were shot at yesterday in Sitalkuchi. These naughty boys will not be there in Bengal. This is just the beginning. Those who thought that the Central forces’ rifles were meant to be just for show have well understood now the power of cartridges. And this will be carried on throughout Bengal,” Mr. Ghosh was quoted as saying in the ECI notice. Mr. Ghosh said: “Those who will take the law in their own hands will be given a befitting answer. I hope that you all will cast your votes on April 17. Central forces will be there in the booths. No one can show you an angry eye. Because we are here. And if someone crosses his limits then you have seen what happened in Sitalkuchi. There will be Sitalkuchi in several places. So be careful.” The EC asked Mr. Ghosh to explain his stand by 10 a.m. on Wednesday. In another notice to BJP West Bengal leader Rahul Sinha, the ECI said his speech on Monday saying that the Central forces should have killed eight people, not four, during the Sitalkuchi incident was a violation of the Model Code of Conduct, the Representation of the People Act and the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/notice-to-ghosh-over-sitalkuchi-comments/article34314533.ece
14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||‘People of Bengal have been convinced by Modi’s track record’||Union Home Minister Amit Shah , on his campaign trail in West Bengal, speaks on the Assembly polls in the State, framing rules for the Citizenship Amendment Act and vaccine shortage...  We are now exactly halfway through the polls, and the upcoming seats include those of the Kolkata Presidency, considered the strong areas of the Trinamool Congress. How do you expect to deal with that? When I spoke of the BJP getting more than 200 seats, it was including the seats of the “Presidency”. I believe that in the 109 seats considered part of the Presidency, the BJP will take a lead. On what basis are you making these claims? At the time of the 2019 polls, voters still had a bit of hesitancy on whether the BJP could defeat Trinamool candidates or not. They wanted to vote for us, but no voter wants to waste his or her vote. Therefore, the number of seats we got in 2019 has increased the confidence of voters in the party. Secondly, in our campaign since 2019, we have been successful in convincing the voter that we are not standing for negative issues. We have been talking about development, of solutions to some of the long-standing issues of the State, apart from the campaign that Mamata Didi does minority appeasement, doesn’t pay attention to law and order; crimes against women are rising, there is no new industry being set up in the State, etc. Our manifesto ( Sankalp Patra ) is very clear on our road map, and the people have been convinced by Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi ji ’s track record. The violence in Cooch Behar during the polls has been tragic, and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been open about her accusations that the fact that you are the Home Minister is somehow connected to the Central paramilitary forces opening fire on voters. How do you respond? I would first like to enlighten Mamata Didi on some basic general knowledge that during polls, the Central paramilitary forces deployed are not under the control of the Home Ministry but of the Election Commission of India (ECI). Also, in the same Sitalkuchi seat, Ms. Banerjee had made a provocative speech on surrounding the paramilitary forces, putting them under pressure, etc. Thirdly, if you look at the record of previous six polls in the State, including to panchayats, Assembly and Lok Sabha, these set of polls have had the least violence. Before the unfortunate incident that happened, that very morning, our party worker Anand Vardhan was murdered, but since he was a Rajbonshi, Mamata Didi hasn’t spoken of him. If even in death we think of only our vote bank, I don’t think such a thought process will be endorsed by the people of Bengal. It has been said that with the entry of the BJP, communal and casteist politics has made an entry into West Bengal. That it is the destruction of what is termed ‘Bengali exceptionalism’. If Mamata Didi feels that we have done this, then I must say that she highly estimates our influence, because this means that we are setting the narrative of the polls. But I believe the whole election is about Bengali pride and how it was undermined by first the Left and the Trinamool, minority appeasement and lack of development by the Mamata Banerjee-led government. This election is also about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) of people who have been here for 70 years without being considered citizens, and living as refugees. We are going to implement the CAA very soon here. The rules for the CAA are yet to be framed. The West Bengal Assembly has passed a resolution that they will block the implementation of the CAA, and added to it is the fact that rules need to be framed for it. The delay in framing rules is not due to the resolution, but the fact that it involves a large-scale exercise in all border States. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, undertaking this CAA exercise would not be advisable. The fight against COVID-19 is a priority; that is why the rules for the CAA are delayed. Referring to COVID-19, India is looking at a massive peak of the second wave. Large rallies and roadshows are still being held. Don’t you think this is foolhardy? We have no alternative arrangement under the Constitution. When the term of an elected Assembly or House of legislature ends, there is no alternative offered by the Constitution. Maybe, if all parties come together, we can come or should have suggested some alternatives to postpone polls or extend the life of elected Assemblies, but currently even the ECI has no alternatives, and as political parties we have even less space, as we have to prepare for polls when the ECI sets the date. Much has been said on shortage of vaccines. Would you like to comment on the issue? There is no shortage of vaccine, and we have had the fastest rate of vaccination in the world. I concede that the speed must increase, and there are many vaccine candidates in the pipeline for approval and in the next month or so we will see more vaccines in play, that will increase the spread of our vaccination programme.  I believe the whole election is about Bengali pride and how it was undermined, minority appeasement and lack of development||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/people-of-bengal-have-been-convinced-by-modis-track-record/article34314527.ece
14 April 2021||Lucknow,||Gyanvapi Masjid: HC moved against lower court’s order||The managing committee of the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi and the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board have moved the Allahabad High Court to restrain the proceedings of a local court, which recently directed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to conduct a physical survey of the mosque compound adjacent to the Kashi Vishwanath temple. The two bodies filed applications in the High Court in the petition in which they had challenged the maintainability of a civil suit pending before the Varanasi district court regarding the title dispute in the case. Arguing that the High Court had on March 15 reserved its judgment in the maintainability suit, the mosque committee and the Sunni Board pleaded with the HC to restrain the lower court from further proceedings. Senior fast-track court civil judge Ashutosh Tiwari on April 8 directed the ASI to conduct a physical survey of the Gyanvapi mosque compound adjacent to the Kashi Vishwanath temple to find out whether it was a “superimposition, alteration or addition or there is structural overlapping of any kind, with or over, any other religious structure”. The committee would “trace as to whether any Hindu temple ever existed before the mosque in question was built or superimposed or added upon at the disputed site”. Advocate S.F.A. Naqvi said an urgent application had been moved by the Anjuman Intezamia Masjid, caretaker of the mosque, in the HC. In the application, the mosque said the civil judge was “behaving in the most arbitrary manner and is passing the orders against the spirit of Judicial discipline”. The civil judge had ignored the entire written submissions and applicability of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 and the Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Civil Procedure Code, the mosque committee argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gyanvapi-masjid-hc-moved-against-lower-courts-order/article34314514.ece
14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Skymet forecasts a ‘healthy normal’ monsoon in 2021||Skymet Weather, a private weather forecast company, said on Tuesday that the monsoon was likely to be 103% of the long period average (LPA) this year. The LPA refers to the average all-India monsoon rainfall of 88 cm, which is a 50-year mean. At the press conference, the agency classified the forecast as “healthy normal”. The monsoon in 2019 and 2020 was only the third time in a century of back-to-back years of above normal rainfall (rainfall that is 5% above normal, or 105%), in India. This year’s forecast by Skymet falls a little short of the above normal mark. “The odds of an El Nino, characterised by a heating of the equatorial central Pacific over half a degree, are low this year. Currently, the Pacific is in a [converse] La Nina mode, and while it is expected to weaken a bit in the coming months, during the monsoon months [June-September], it is forecast to increase,” G.P. Sharma, president-meteorology, Skymet Weather, said. “Overall, neutral conditions are likely to prevail,” he said. Well-distributed rain An El Nino is historically associated, in many years, with a weakening of the monsoon over India. The monsoon is also expected to be fairly well-distributed, with even September (the month in which the season starts to recede) expected to post 10% more rainfall than normal. IMD forecast soon The India Meteorological Department (IMD), which provides the official forecasts, is expected to announce its forecast later this month. Last year, Skymet did not release its official monsoon forecast. In 2019, Skymet forecast below normal rainfall and the IMD “near normal”. In defiance of these calculations, India posted a record 10% excess rainfall. In terms of geographical risk, Skymet expects that the plains of North India, along with a few parts of northeast India, to be at risk of being rain deficient through the season. Also, interior parts of Karnataka face scare or scanty rain in the core monsoon months of July and August, the forecast said Along with the El Nino, another ocean variable, the Indian Ocean Dipole, characterised by a temperature gradient in the western and eastern Indian Ocean, is expected to be slightly on the negative. A positive dipole usually aids the Indian monsoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/skymet-forecasts-a-healthy-normal-monsoon-in-2021/article34314522.ece
14 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Last two rhinos translocated under IRV 2020||The ambitious Indian Rhino Vision 2020 (IRV 2020) came to a close on Tuesday morning with the release of two rhinos — an adult male and a female — in Assam’s Manas National Park transported from Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary about 185 km east. Designed in 2005, the IRV2020 is believed to have achieved its target of attaining a population of 3,000 rhinos in Assam. But the plan to spread the Rhinoceros unicornis across four protected areas beyond Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park and Pobitora could not materialise. “The eighth round of rhino translocation under IRV2020 ended at 7 a.m. today [April 13] with the release of the two rhinos in the central part of the Bansbari range of Manas, which has received a total of 22 rhinos from other protected areas under the translocation programme,” Amal Chandra Sharma, field director of Manas Tiger Reserve, said. “The ears of the translocated rhinos have been notched according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Species Survival Commission and Asian Rhino Specialist Group’s guidelines for identification and monitoring. A special team has been tasked with monitoring the rhinos as per the translocation protocols for Assam,” he said. Saviour of Manas Assam had at least five rhino-bearing areas till the 1980s. Better conservation efforts helped maintain the population of the one-horned herbivore in Kaziranga, Orang and Pobitora, but encroachment and poaching wiped the animal out of Manas and Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary. The lesser-known Laokhowa slipped under the radar of international watchdogs. Manas, in focus for the near-extinction of the pygmy hog, lost the World Heritage Site tag it received in 1985 along with Kaziranga from the UNESCO. “The translocated rhinos helped Manas National Park get back its World Heritage Site status in 2011. It can be expected that the translocation programme will set up a healthy, breeding population for the future of the species,” Mr. Sharma said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/last-two-rhinos-translocated-under-irv-2020/article34314544.ece
14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||S-400 delivery to begin by November||The delivery schedule for the S-400 long range air defence systems was on track for the end of 2021 despite the COVID-19 pandemic, a senior defence official said. “The deal is on track and deliveries are expected to begin by November this year,” the official said. Two officials independently stated that efforts were made to speed up the deal but the Russian side had conveyed this was not possible. Two official sources, also speaking independently, dismissed concerns over possible U.S. sanctions on the deal under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), stating this deal met national security considerations. In October 2018, India had signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia for five S-400 regiments despite objections from the U.S., with deliveries scheduled to begin end 2021. U.S. officials on several occasions raised concerns over the deal as India deepened its defence cooperation with the U.S. and acquired several frontline military platforms like transport aircraft, helicopters, artillery and drones. Indian officials had reiterated that all payment-related issues had been resolved and the deal was well under way. Responding to questions on the issue at a press conference during his visit to India in February, U.S. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin had said that there had been no delivery of an S-400 system, and “the issues of sanctions is not one that’s been discussed”. He also stated, “But we did address with the Minister of Defence the issue of the S-400.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/s-400-delivery-to-begin-by-november/article34314510.ece
14 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||No shortage of vaccines, but better planning must: Ministry||Stating that the issue of vaccine shortage, as reported by some States in India, is more about the need for better planning rather than actual shortage, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Tuesday that 2,01,22,960 COVID-19 vaccine doses were in the supply pipeline to the States and the Union Territories. “Doses received by the States and the Union Territories stand at 13,10,90,370, while total consumption, including wastage, is 11,43,69,677 and balance availability with the States and the Union Territories is 1,67,20,693 as on April 13, 11 a.m. Issue is about better planning and not shortage. On one hand, we have States like Kerala where there is zero wastage and on the other hand, we have several other States where there still is 8-9% of wastage,” Mr. Bhushan said at a Health Ministry press conference. Vaccine efficacy To a question on the effectiveness of the available vaccines, Balram Bhargava, Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said they were disease-modifying vaccines. “After both doses are administered, antibodies develop and severity of infection and chances of death are lowered. There is a 85% reduction in chances of hospitalisation after vaccination,” he said. V.K. Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, said there should be no question of use of Remdesivir (for COVID-19 treatment) at home. “This is required for those individuals who require hospitalisation. We appeal for rational use of Remdesivir,’’ he said. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Tuesday said that the second wave of the pandemic had created an unprecedented demand for the Remdesivir injection, resulting in a demand-and-supply mismatch and artificial panic. There was non-judicious use of this drug in many places beyond the scope of its evidence-based benefits. “The public as well as the medical community must be aware of the absolute indication of the drug and need to use it judiciously so that the drug is used for those patients who will be benefited,” the IMA said. The appeal comes at time when the Federation of All India Medical Association has written to the Prime Minister seeking help to counter the “prevalence of VIP culture in government hospitals”. In its letter, the association said that while doctors who are at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 are risking their lives every day — if infected they have no separate counter, priority for testing, reserved beds, etc.— priority is being given to all the so-called politicians and party workers who have actually held rallies and increased the spread of viruses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-shortage-of-vaccines-but-better-planning-must-ministry/article34314540.ece
14 April 2021||New Delhi,||CWC to meet on COVID crisis||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) will virtually meet on Saturday to discuss the second wave of COVID-19, party sources confirmed on Tuesday. The party’s internal polls to elect a president by June may also come up for discussion. However, the prospect of holding a Congress session or mass gathering in the current scenario looks difficult. The party’s highest decision making body will meet exactly a week after Congress president Sonia Gandhi had met the Chief Ministers of the party-ruled States and senior Ministers of Maharashtra and Jharkhand governments where the Congress is part of the ruling alliance. Apart from Maharashtra, Congress-ruled Punjab and Chhattisgarh are also among the States that have witnessed a sharp spike in the number of cases. On Monday, Ms. Gandhi had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which she had asked the government to open up vaccination by giving permission to all the vaccine candidates or vaccines that are in use in other countries. She also suggested that vaccines be given to those who need it based on their exposure rather than the current age criterion. As several State governments have started to re-impose stricter COVID norms and restrictions on movement, Ms Gandhi appealed to Mr Modi to consider putting in place a minimum monthly guaranteed income scheme of Rs. 6,000 for every eligible family. The Congress chief also asked for exemption from Goods and Services Tax (GST) for all equipment, instruments and medicines used in the fight against the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cwc-to-meet-on-covid-crisis/article34315017.ece
14 April 2021||Kolkata,||Modi is mocking me, says Mamata||A lot is at stake for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the West Bengal election as is evident from the manner in which he has been repeatedly and personally attacking Trinamool Congress president and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The mocking tone which Mr. Modi uses to address the Chief Minister, repeatedly saying “Didi-o-Didi!”, has evoked a strong response not only from the Trinamool Congress but from the Chief Minster also. “He is mocking me ( amake bhengache ). There should be a standard. I will not speak to him in this language,” Ms. Banerjee said on Monday at Basirhat. The Chief Minister alleged that the “language brings shame even to youth chatting informally in a neighbourhood”, and said she cannot use the language which the Prime Minister has brought into West Bengal . The first time people took note of the Prime Minister addressing the Chief Minister with the sing-song “Didi-O-Didi!” was at the BJP’s rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds on March 7. Thereafter at almost a dozen public rallies, Mr. Modi has used the mocking phrase to address the Trinamool chief. While these utterances drew a cheer for the Prime Minister, they also raised many eyebrows. The Trinamool Congress leadership on April 4 held a press conference accusing the Prime Minister of “insulting women” of the State by addressing the Chief Minister in a “mocking tone”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-is-mocking-me-says-mamata/article34314530.ece

Mr. Kishor, a poll-strategist, recently joined Captain Singh as his principal adviser. “There is no question of it. Kishor has no say in the matter,” the Chief Minister said. “There are set norms and patterns for ticket allocation in the Congress, which are followed in all elections in all States,” he said. There is a State election committee set up by the high command ahead of any Assembly poll, which considers all the names and decides on the final candidates. The shortlisted names are then sent for scrutiny to the screening committee of the top party leadership, including the Congress president. The final decision is taken by the Central Election Committee, with no individual having any role to play, he added. “In the process of ticket finalisation, inputs are always taken by this committee from various internal and external parties, including independent agencies as well the State party unit. This is the process that was followed in 2017 and will be adopted again this time. So where does Kishor come into the picture,” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/prashant-kishor-has-no-role-in-finalising-candidates/article34314531.ece
14 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||No decision yet on postponing CBSE examinations: Centre||As the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) dithers over demands to postpone or cancel Board examinations, at least four State Boards, whose exams were originally supposed to begin this month, have already announced plans to reschedule in light of the surge in COVID-19 cases. However, the Education Ministry seems to be taking a wait-and-watch stance on the CBSE’s examinations, which are scheduled to begin on May 4. Officials at the Ministry and the CBSE have been having discussions on the issue, given the rising demand for cancellation from a large section of students, but were tight-lipped about any decision. “We cannot say anything at this stage,” said a senior School Education Department official. Chhattisgarh Education Secretary Alok Shukla pointed out that uncertainty over the course of the pandemic made decision-making a challenge. The State has indefinitely postponed Class 10 exams, which were scheduled to begin on April 15. “We have not been able to set a new date for it as the number of cases are increasing continuously every day,” he told The Hindu , adding that cancellation was not ruled out. Maharashtra, which has postponed both Class 10 and 12 exams scheduled from the last week of April, has made it clear it wants Central Boards to follow suit.

I have been warning for the past one month and now is the time to take actions to break the chain. The only aim is to save lives. We can revive the economy if we survive,” Mr. Thackeray said in his address on Tuesday. Mr. Thackeray said that he was aware of the hardships to the poor due to such restrictions and that the State government had decided to take steps to provide relief. “Seven crore beneficiaries under the food security scheme will get 3 kg of wheat and 2 kg of rice each free for one month. The Shiv Bhojan thali will be provided free. Around 35 lakh beneficiaries in a total of five welfare schemes will get Rs. 1,000 a person every month for the next two months,” he said. The government will also provide Rs. 1,500 to each of the 12 lakh registered construction workers and 5 lakh registered hawkers. Tribal families will be paid Rs. 2,000 each under the Khavti scheme. Also, Rs. 3,300 crore is being provided for district-level schemes in the fight against the pandemic. Highlighting the State’s need of oxygen for patients, Mr. Thackeray said he had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow transportation of oxygen by the Air Force to ensure its speedy delivery to Maharashtra from far-off places. “Considering the financial burden, I have also sought exemption from State GST contribution for three months,” he said. Services that will not be affected are: healthcare, veterinary care, groceries and vegetables shops, fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries, confectioneries, cold storage facilities, offices of diplomats of various countries, banks and financial services, agriculture-related activities, export-import activities, e-commerce, accredited media, IT services, ATMs, gas supply, port activities and customs-related activities.

14 April 2021||New Delhi,||Record cases for third consecutive day in Delhi||Delhi witnessed a record number of new COVID-19 cases for the third consecutive day with 13,468 people testing positive over 24 hours, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Tuesday. The total number of cases stood at 7,50,156. Eighty-one deaths were reported over 24 hours, pushing the toll to 11,436. A total of 1,02,460 tests were conducted in a day, the bulletin said. Of the total cases, 6,95,210 people have recovered and there are 43,510 active cases. The positivity rate of COVID-19 cases jumped to 13.14% on Tuesday. Of the total 12,667 beds for COVID-19 treatment in the city, 61.03% were occupied. A total of 89,065 beneficiaries took the COVID-19 vaccination over 24 hours, said the bulletin. After a government order on Monday to convert 14 private hospitals into dedicated COVID-19 facilities, many hospitals said some beds should be kept for non-COVID-19 treatment as many of them are super speciality facilities. Hospitals also said that they are not forcibly discharging any patient and the government has given them some time for the shift. Hospitals’ request The chairman of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Dr. D.S. Rana, said he met Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday and requested him to allow non-COVID emergency patients at the hospital. “We have promised the Minister to provide 500 beds for COVID treatment. Even last year, only 300 of the 508 COVID-19 beds at the hospital were occupied, even when the admission was at the maximum,” Dr. Rana said. Dr. Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, also said part of the beds in the hospital should be kept for non-COVID treatment. “We are a super speciality hospital and have non-COVID patients who have cancer, heart ailments etc. We need to treat COVID-19 patients for sure, but we have to take care of non-COVID patients too. They cannot be ignored,” he said. “We have patients of chemotherapy, liver transplant, kidney transplant, they all are following up with our hospital. Suppose if they becomes sick, where will they go?” Dr. Chatterjee said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/record-new-covid-cases-for-third-consecutive-day-in-delhi/article34314835.ece
14 April 2021||New Delhi,||WhatsApp policy: CCI defends nod for probe||The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Tuesday defended before the Delhi High Court its decision calling for an investigation into the new privacy policy of WhatsApp. The competition watchdog, represented by Additional Solicitor-General Aman Lekhi, said the probe order was made to gauge whether access to data would lead to the abuse of dominant position. The commission said it was dealing with the instant messaging app’s new privacy policy that could lead to “excessive data collection” of consumers, the use and sharing of the data in anti-competitive context. Mr. Lekhi said the commission was not concerned with privacy aspect of the issue as the Supreme Court was already seized of it. The CCI’s submission came while hearing two separate petitions filed by Facebook and WhatsApp challenging its March 24 direction ordering for a probe into WhatsApp’s new privacy policy. The CCI had ordered that the investigation be completed within 60 days. Mr. Lekhi said it was too early for the High Court to hear the petitions as the CCI had only ordered for an investigation, the report for which was yet to come. WhatsApp, represented by senior advocate Harish Salve, said the CCI had jumped the gun and started the probe when this was not a competition issue. WhatsApp said the issue with respect to personal data of users, and sharing of personalised data was already before the Supreme Court, hence the CCI ought not to have intervened. After hearing all the parties, Justice Navin Chawla reserved the judgment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/whatsapp-policy-cci-defends-nod-for-probe/article34314508.ece
14 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Global cooperation benefits India, world’||International cooperation to counter global challenges such as the current pandemic is advantageous to both India and the rest of the world, said External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, highlighting India’s recent initiatives to provide vaccines to a large number of developing countries to help them fight COVID-19. “Our ability to make vaccines ... is itself a result of international cooperation. So international cooperation is not a one-way street where we are giving things to other people and somewhere short-changing ourselves, I think people need to understand that,” Mr. Jaishankar said in an interaction at the annual Raisina Dialogue on Tuesday. He argued that as a result of international partnership and research India was able to increase manufacturing of vaccines “developed elsewhere” while also developing indigenous vaccines in the country. First responder Mr. Jaishankar credited the Narendra Modi government on being the first responder on a number of crisis situations in the neighbourhood and beyond and the response to the pandemic, he said, was part of that same chain of initiatives. “If you look in terms of humanitarian assistance, whether it was an earthquake in Nepal, or a civil war in Yemen, or a cyclone in Mozambique, or a typhoon in Fiji, or a mudslide in Sri Lanka, or whether it is taking the Paris agenda forward through initiatives like the international Solar Alliance, or how to respond collectively towards disaster resilience. So there are very practical ways by which we have demonstrated our belief in the world as a family,” the Minister said. He argued that the success of India’s domestic battle with COVID-19 had not received sufficient global attention. He highlighted that during the lockdown and the aftermath, the Government of India transferred cash to 400 million citizens and at the same time 800 million people received food from the government. “Now, if you go anywhere in the world and say, listen guys, I just paid out 400 million people, and I’ve fed 800 million people, you should make waves,” Mr. Jaishankar said, asking for global attention on the work of the Indian government to counter the pandemic and its economic effects.

14 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Nagaland’s version of NRC triggers concern||An apex body of Naga tribes has asked the Nagaland government not to be hasty with the exercise to prepare the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants of Nagaland (RIIN), seen as a variant of Assam’s National Register of Citizens. The Nagaland government has reportedly been trying to revive the RIIN exercise that was launched in July 2019 with the stated objective of preventing outsiders from obtaining fake indigenous certificates for seeking jobs and benefits of government schemes. Three-member panel The State government had formed a three-member panel headed by retired bureaucrat Banuo Z. Jamir for “examining and advising” on the implementation of RIIN. But the exercise was suspended following protests from community-based and extremist organisations. The Naga Hoho, the apex tribal body that had objected to the RIIN in 2019, has reacted to the State government’s alleged bid to implement RIIN with a tentative timetable for different stages of the updating process. “The issue of RIIN should be handled with utmost care as it could have unforeseen and dangerous implications for the Nagas as a people,” the Naga Hoho said. The State government had tasked the RIIN committee with determining the eligibility criteria to be an indigenous inhabitant, authority to authenticate claims of being indigenous, place of registration as indigenous inhabitant, the basis of claims of being indigenous, and the nature of documents that will be acceptable as proof. The Naga Hoho said it was apprehensive of “dreadful consequences” if the “advocates of RIIN” implement the process with December 1, 1963 – the day Nagaland attained statehood – as the cut-off date. This date is likely to exclude Nagas who have come from beyond the boundaries of Nagaland. According to the Naga Hoho, Naga tribes living in Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh in India and in Myanmar have a legitimate claim to their ancestral homeland.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nagalands-version-of-nrc-triggers-concern/article34314836.ece

14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Govt. speeds up approval for more vaccines||But before the mass roll-out of the vaccines that are developed and tested abroad can happen, the vaccines will be first given to 100 beneficiaries and these individuals will be assessed for seven days for safety outcomes. “The decision will facilitate quicker access to such foreign vaccines by India and would encourage imports including import of bulk drug material, optimal utilisation of domestic fill and finish capacity etc., which will in turn provide a fillip to vaccine manufacturing capacity and total vaccine availability for domestic [use],” a government release said. “This is a welcome decision by the government to expand the basket of vaccines and overcome any shortage of vaccines,” said Dr. Shahid Jameel, Director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University. At least half-dozen States had reported vaccine shortage a few days ago. Professor of Microbiology at CMC Vellore Dr. Gagandeep Kang said: “The decision finally complies with the WHO’s recommendation of regulatory reliance.” While so far there have been no tie-ups with Pfizer and Moderna by any vaccine manufacturer in India, Hyderabad-based Biological E (Bio E) has tied up with Johnson and Johnson to test and manufacture the vaccine locally. Since the decision also allows imports of bulk drug material and fill and finish locally, it is likely that India will have access to Johnson and Johnson vaccine at the earliest. Pfizer had earlier filed for a restricted use approval with the Indian regulator but withdrew its application after a short while. Though the reason why Pfizer withdrew its application is not known, the policy then required Pfizer to carry out bridging studies in India before the vaccine could be taken up for approval. On Tuesday, the U.S. FDA said in a tweet that along with CDC, it is recommending a pause in the use of Johnson and Johnson vaccine “out of an abundance of caution”. It is unclear at this point if the vaccines developed, tested and approved outside India will be made available through the government at a subsidised rate or will vaccine manufacturers be able to import them and sell them in the private market. “So far, I am not aware of any vaccine being made available through private players. It is governments that are purchasing vaccines for citizens,” Dr. Kang said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-speeds-up-approval-for-more-vaccines/article34314518.ece
14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Russian shot gets DCGI nod for imports||Within weeks of Sputnik V becoming the first COVID-19 vaccine to be registered globally, by Russia in August, the Russian Direct Investment Fund announced a partnership with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories for clinical trials as well as distribution of the first 100 million doses in India. “Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories has received permission from the Drugs Controller General of India to import the Sputnik [V] vaccine into India for restricted use in emergency situations as per the provisions of the New Drug and Clinical Trials rules, 2019 under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act,” a statement from the Hyderabad-based drugmaker said. Co-chairman and managing director G.V. Prasad said “We are very pleased to obtain the emergency use authorisation for Sputnik V in India. With the rising cases in India, vaccination is the most effective tool in our battle against COVID-19. This will enable us to contribute to our nation’s effort of vaccinating a significant proportion of our population.” Since announcing its partnership with Dr. Reddy’s in September, the sovereign wealth fund of Russia went ahead and forged manufacturing pacts with five companies to produce an estimated 850 million doses of vaccine based on the human adenoviral vector platform. While Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma, Stelis Biopharma, Virchow Biotech and Panacea Biotec are firms with whom it has announced production partnerships, sources say a few more may get added to the list in coming days. On Sputnik V production process in the country, sources said the process involves the technology transfer, production of batches for approval and on getting the go ahead from the central laboratory seeking manufacturing licence from DCGI. It could take at least a couple of months, with the first Sputnik V produced in India likely to be made available in June. The vaccine, whose efficacy is pegged at 91.6%,  has now been approved for use in 60 countries. It uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination. According to RDIF, the price of Sputnik V is less than $10 per shot “making it affordable around the world.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/russian-shot-gets-dcgi-nod-for-imports/article34314519.ece

The ECI had issued a notice to Mr. Adhikari, who contested against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram, on April 8 for his March 29 statement that a vote for “begum” would lead to a “mini Pakistan”.

In his reply to the notice on April 9, the ECI said he had submitted that he believed in free and fair elections and that he had no malafide intention to criticise anyone personally or make offensive remarks. Mr. Adhikari argued that he had not violated the code. However, he said he would be more careful in the future.

14 April 2021||New Delhi,||Leaked content of meet triggers debate in Cong.||The leaked contents of a virtual meeting between election strategist Prashant Kishor and senior journalists has triggered a debate within a section of the Congress party on the question of how far a political party could go in engaging with external agencies while fighting elections. The internal debate is also prompted by the party’s experience in Tamil Nadu, where Mr. Kishor’s organisation, the Indian Political Action Committee or I-PAC, advised the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), which heads an alliance in which the Congress is a junior partner. Congress insiders claim they were witnesses to a “sense of disquiet” among senior DMK leaders as “core political activities” were decided by the external agency. The Congress’s Data Analytics chief, Praveen Chakravarty, who makes sense of the numbers for the party to help devise strategy, questioned the commitment of “external” agencies in terms of ideology. “If a political party outsources its election fighting to a commercial external vendor, then it leads to the eventual destruction of the very idea of a political party, [which is] building a cadre based on ideology. These vendors’ main objective is profits and they circulate strategic information, data, and knowledge of one party to another,” said Mr. Chakravarty. “A political party outsourcing election management to an external commercial vendor is like the Finance Minister outsourcing the Budget preparation to an external consultant. It is penny wise, pound foolish,” he added. The question is important as, recently, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh re-engaged Mr. Kishor, who had advised Mr. Singh earlier, as his advisor. The debate is also important as it could decide the party’s strategy with regard to Uttar Pradesh elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/leaked-content-of-meet-triggers-debate-in-cong/article34314528.ece

At this juncture, the Lord explains many subtle aspects that are to be factored in when there is transmission of esoteric knowledge from preceptor to disciple, pointed out Swami Omkarananda in a discourse. Unlike knowledge pertaining to the world and universe that can be grasped by the skilful use and application of the senses, mind and intellect, esoteric matters, being profound by nature cannot be easily explained or made overtly explicit. It is also true that all worldly knowledge is of no avail and stands no comparison with this Supreme Knowledge that gives peace of mind and calm and liberates one from the cycle of samsara. It leads one away from restless pursuits and confusion. But still each one has to face the challenge posed by the powerful sway of Maya that easily eclipses the significance of this knowledge amid the layers of worldly, objective and scientific knowledge that many learned and well informed people believe in and pursue. All learning is best achieved when one listens and takes in what is heard. That is, one starts to think on what has been heard and then tries to evaluate this with an impartial mind. For teaching and learning to be effective, the student has to listen with faith to what the teacher imparts. In this case, the Lord is the best person to explain His tatva and Vibhuti that even the Vedas are incapable of explaining. In fact, the Lord says later that whatever He has explained as His Vibhuti is only a miniscule aspect. It is something unfathomable and not to be explained. There is no end to the Lord’s infinite nature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-lords-vibhuti/article34314542.ece

14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Non-motorised transport facilities still in nascent stage||Cycling enthusiasts in the city are envious of the Chandigarh Smart City announcing an upgraded non-motorised transport draft policy with the focus on safety and incentivising cycling. While Chennai had announced the non-motorised transport in 2014, not much progress has been made to encourage people to start using bicycle as the primary mode of transport to workplace or as the connectivity mode for public transport. Felix John, an ardent advocate for non-motorist transport and a cycling enthusiast, said the Chandigarh Smart City, with its non-motorised transport draft policy announcement has earned kudos for the way it plans to promote cycling. The Bicycle Mayor of Chennai pointed out that the cycle tracks, having been paved in the city by the Greater Chennai Corporation on the Sardar Patel Road for 17 km, were aimed at attracting only fitness enthusiasts, and not the common man who would prefer using bicycle as a primary mode of transport. Mr. John said the lack of infrastructure alone was not the issue but the absence of the whole ecosystem. He wanted the State government to take its cue from Chandigarh’s non-motorised transport policy by providing monetary incentives through discounts in travel cards, segregated lanes exclusively for bicycles to avoid accidents and provision of safe and secured parking spaces. Thirumalaivasan, a resident of Ashok Nagar, who has taken to cycling for fitness, said separate bicycle lanes on arterial roads would help popularise bicycle as the city’s primary mode as it once was. He said that with more fitness enthusiasts taking up cycling, safety at traffic junctions had become a concern. He said that as cycling was being done during early morning hours, it would be helpful if traffic policemen were posted at important junctions to help the cyclists cross traffic junctions safely. Aswathy Dilip, Senior Programme Manager, ITDP, pointed out that the city was the first to adopt the non-motorised transport in the country, so one could not deny nothing has been done. The city had made great strides in creating amenities for pedestrians and cyclists, of which the T. Nagar pedestrian plaza was one of the landmark achievements. Slow process Ms. Dilip said developing facilities for the non-motorised transport is a step-by-step process wherein pedestrians took precedence over all other modes of transport with more than 90% of the first- and last-mile connectivity for using various public transport being by walk. Citing the more than 150 km of safe walking space having been created, she said the next step would be the Mega Street project under which walking and cycling space were proposed to be created in six localities: Anna Nagar, Nungambakkam, Velachery, Adyar, Mylapore and Tondiarpet. Ms. Dilip said: “Under the Mega Street project proposed by the Chennai Smart City, six urban designers from across the country would be involved in creating the amenities.” A senior official of the Corporation said the non-motorised transport in Chennai focused primarily on creating safe pavements. Having developed wide and safe pavements for all sections, including the people with disabilities, the focus was shifting to increasing the length of the cycle lanes. At present, cycle lanes are available in Besant Nagar, K.K. Nagar, Sardar Patel Road, and sections of Anna Salai. Also under the bicycle sharing project, more than 500 bicycles were put on the roads by creating cycle sharing stations at important places and metro stations. The cycle sharing project, which came to a standstill owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, is again revived with a plan to add 500 electric bicycles. As part of this, a survey is also being conducted to make it a pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/non-motorised-transport-facilities-still-in-nascent-stage/article34315038.ece

14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Thunderstorms set to roll through interior, western ghats districts||Thunderstorms are set to roll through the western ghats districts, south and north interior parts of the State till the weekend. One or two places in a few districts may experience heavy rain from Tamil New Year’s day on Wednesday, according to Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Chennai. This would bring in much-needed respite to many areas that were reeling under oppressive heat until a few days ago. The RMC has forecast a gradual increase in rainfall activity that would cover many places in interior Tamil Nadu. Officials of the Meteorological Department noted that a trough moving towards Arabian sea brought easterly winds into the region and convective activity also propelled thunderstorms in interior parts. On Tamil New Year day, thunderstorms with light to moderate rainfall may occur at a few places over western ghats districts, south and north interior Tamil Nadu. Gusty winds with speed reaching up to 30-40 km per hour may also prevail in one or two places. A few districts, including Nilgiris, Coimbatore, Theni and Dindigul, have chances of heavy rainfall in one or two places on Wednesday. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai, said thunderstorms may cover more areas by Thursday with fairly widespread rainfall. Four more districts — Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Tirupattur — may receive isolated heavy rain. The trough moving westwards brought easterly winds and moisture incursion also influenced convective activity in interior areas. The weather system would have an impact on a larger area, he said. However, coastal areas like Chennai may have to wait for some more days for pre-monsoon showers. Cloud cover may help day temperatures stay close to a normal of 35 degree Celsius till Thursday, he added. On Tuesday, the weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded an average of 34.4 degree Celsius and 35.5 degree Celsius respectively. A few places in neighbouring Kancheepuram district received sharp spells of rain due to convective activity. During the past 24 hours ending at 8.30 p.m. on Monday, Virudhunagar received the highest amount of 6 cm of rainfall. Many other places, including Nilgiris, Kanniyakumari and Dindigul too experienced light rain. Officials noted thunderstorms may be limited to isolated places over western ghats districts and interior districts on April 16 and April 17. Mercury levels may spike again around April 19 as hot, dry westerlies are expected to set in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thunderstorms-to-roll-through-interior-western-ghats-districts/article34314648.ece
14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||ICF tells staff to take the shot or proceed on leave||In a bid to contain the surge in COVID-19 infections, the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) here cracked the whip on its employees, saying staff aged above 45 years would be allowed to attend office only if they get vaccinated, otherwise, they should go on leave. ICF, the largest coach-making facility in the world, has over 9,000 employees. In an order issued on Monday, the management referred to a circular of the Department of Personnel & Training and said all Central Government employees of the age of 45 and above should get themselves vaccinated. “It is informed, they can attend the office only after getting vaccinated. Employees not getting vaccinated will have to avail their own leave,” the order, which had the approval of the competent authority, said. Asking employees to follow safety protocol like using hand sanitisers, wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing, the ICF commenced enumeration of officers/staff who had got the vaccination done. “We are surprised by the order that those who haven’t got vaccinated cannot go to work. This seems to be an attempt to force employees to take the shot…,” a senior ICF official said. SOP issued In a detailed Standard Operating Procedure, the ICF said if four or more employees working in different groups tested positive for COVID-19, the shop/office should be closed for 48 hours for deep disinfection procedure. In case a family member of an employee tests positive to the virus, he/she should not come for duty and self-quarantine till such time the family member tests negative. The employee will be under self-quarantine for the same period. As regards employees coming from other States/Union Territory, except Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Puducherry, they would have to undergo home quarantine for 14 days. In case of death of an employee declared COVID-19 positive, the State government would conduct the cremation/burial and no outsiders or friends would be allowed to attend the funeral or pay their last respects to the deceased employee. All employees were advised to pay their respects and condolences by phone. “It is strongly recommended that they should not attempt to visit the residence of the deceased COVID-19 positive employee or visit the family members, as this would increase the risk of infection…,” the SOP said.  In a related development, the Southern Railway has decided to function with 50% minimum attendance at the Zonal Headquarters and Construction Wing here while the remaining staff would work from home with effect from April 15, 2021 till the month end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/icf-tells-staff-to-take-the-shot-or-proceed-on-leave/article34314636.ece
14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tea business brewing amid pandemic||At a time when thousands of restaurants are folding because of poor patronage and margins, the number of tea shop brands has been increasing not just in Chennai but also in Tier-2 towns of Tamil Nadu. Experts who have been tracking the tea and coffee market say over 100 such outlets have come up in the last three months. Interestingly, many women are foraying into the tea business. “After lockdown, some restaurants in the Old Mahabalipuram Road belt closed; a few of them started selling tea in a smaller space. Some have closed shops because of rental constraints, and are now using bikes and even autorickshaws to sell tea. And I also wanted to experiment,” says Raja Shanmugam, who has started a cloud kitchen and is selling tea on bikes, along with a few of his friends. Another team of boys is selling tea on two-wheelers under the brand Your Chai Stop. “We call ourselves tea-wheelers, and we are targeting busy shopping spots,” says one of them. “Because of COVID-19, some people lost their jobs and many got their salaries cut. People were looking at small business [on an investment of less than Rs. 5 lakh] that can fetch them anywhere from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1 lakh a month. A tea shop fits the bill. That is the reason for the spurt in the number of shops,” says Suresh Radhakrishnan, founder of Chai Kanth. Mr. Radhakrishnan, who is also mentoring people in opening tea business, reckons that this is one of the very few businesses that have survived the pandemic (except outlets near or in IT parks). Dhamyanthi Kumaravel is the co-founder of Namma Cafe, which was launched after the lockdown was partially lifted. She feels this is a herd mentality. “When a business venture has potential, everyone wants to get into that space — just like how kulfi and lassi shops opened everywhere a couple of years ago.” She aims to roll out 1,000 Namma Cafe units (direct and franchise) over the next three years. Another woman who forayed into this space a month ago is Nandhini Kumari K, who heads Chai Castle. She says women and families prefer having tea at a place where there is no smoking, and that’s where brands like hers click. Asked about the sales, because this locality at Perumbakkam has several other tea outlets, Ms. Nandhini Kumari says that every business has its competitors, and she is confident of selling 3,000 cups in the coming days (she now sells over 300 cups). According to Chai Kings founders Jahabar Sadique and Balaji Sadagopan, the demand for tea is three times that of coffee, even in a market like Chennai. On any given day, they have more repeat customers for Chai than for coffee. Muthu Kumaran, a co-founder of Coffee Shastra, says that though the primary focus of his brand is coffee, his team want to give the best tea drinking experience to customers. “The demand for tea is increasing in metro, urban and sub-urban locations,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tea-business-brewing-amid-pandemic/article34314640.ece
14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||As cases rise, concerns mount over exams||The steadily increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the Tamil Nadu has caused concerns about the conduct of the public examinations. While State Board students are to take up the Class 12 examination from May 5, the Board examinations for Class 10 and CBSE 12 are to be held through May. Over 8 lakh candidates in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry take up the State Board public examinations every year, and several staff members are involved in the conduct of the examinations. Hence any decision would have to consider safety concerns involved and the possible impact on students mentally. “The Class 12 public examinations should be postponed at least till June... Apart from the pandemic, the students and teachers will find it difficult to have the examinations in May, during the peak summer,” says T. Arulanandam, State auditor of the Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association. On Monday, a circular issued by the Directorate of Government Exams announced the postponement of just the first paper alone, on account of the election results, and said the other examinations would be held as per schedule. It was less than a month ago that the government asked schools to shut in-person learning for Classes 9-11 after clusters were reported at schools in some districts. R. Shiva, a teacher of Madura College Higher Secondary School, says that going ahead with the examinations in May could result in case clusters. “Asking students to attend the board examinations during the pandemic can create anxiety among the students and their parents. How will students from containment zones be able to attend the examinations,” asks another teacher from Sholavandan. Under the hashtag, #CancelBoardExam2021, several students of CBSE and State Board schools have been highlighting their concerns. For students, it has been a year of uncertainty since schools reopened only in January, having been closed for over 10 months. “I hope they conduct the examinations within this schedule and do not postpone them,” says Jansi, a Class 12 student of a government school near Vellakinar in Coimbatore. “If the exam is postponed any further, we may become careless,” she adds. Teachers who are not for the postponement do not want students to face any more uncertainty. Having completed the truncated portions through classroom sessions since January, teachers in Tiruchi say that conducting the examinations as per schedule, while scrupulously following the safety protocols, will be ideal. “As far as the students are concerned, particularly those of the science groups, completion of the public examinations as per schedule will ensure that they have enough time to prepare for entrance exams such as JEE and NEET. Students have to complete omitted portions to take up these tests confidently,” says a science teacher of a school in Tiruchi.

14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||GEM Hospital launches pelvic floor clinic||A pelvic floor clinic has been commissioned at GEM Hospital here on Tuesday. The speciality clinic was launched by S. Gurunathan, director of Medical and Rural Health Services. C. Palanivelu, founder and chairman of GEM Hospital, said, “Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) are distinctive and comprise complaints pertaining to multiple organ systems, which need a multidisciplinary team approach.” The most common disorders are over-active bladder; urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and anal incontinence. “The need for a holistic, multidisciplinary approach has been the intent of the specialised pelvic floor unit at our hospital,” he said. PFDs cause serious social, economical, physical and psychological problems especially for women that significantly reduces their quality of life. Though pelvic disorders are stressful and cause serious discomfort, women often endure the pain in silence and are embarrassed to seek proper treatment, Dr. Palanivelu said. The clinic would create awareness of the symptoms and the need to get treatment at the right time, he added. Hospital CEO S. Asokan said the tendency to develop PFDs increases with age due to the weakening of pelvic floor muscles. The hospital has state-of-the-art facilities, besides a team of experienced doctors, to manage the complex, yet common, set of problems, he said. “The clinic will bring together the gastroenterologist, colorectal surgeon, gynaecologist, urologist, pain specialist and bio-feedback trainer under one roof,” he added.

14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Beautification efforts transform street along Buckingham Canal||For decades, Kalvivaru Street along the Buckingham Canal in Mylapore, has been an eyesore with haphazardly-parked vehicles and debris, and a strong stench of urine. However, the Greater Chennai Corporation has started beautifying the stretch with wide pavements and painting the retaining wall. The civic body will also set up a butterfly habitat along the canal. Kalvivaru Street runs for 400 metres and connects Kutchery Road and Mundakakanni Amman Koil Street. Motorists use the stretch instead of using the Royapettah High Road. There are many residential complexes and a CBSE school on the lane. “There were a lot of encroachments on the street, especially abandoned vehicles. The Greater Chennai Corporation also turned a blind eye towards the dumping of debris along the street. Many anti-social elements used this as a cover to drink and create a ruckus. It was unsafe for women,” said Geeta, a resident of the locality. A bad stench used to emanate from the area, and mosquitoes were a perennial problem. The street had turned a public urinal. But six months ago, the GCC started laying wide pavements and constructed a retaining wall along the Canal. “We have set up a children’s play area on the pavement and we have plants along the canal bank to attract native butterfly species and we will set up a butterfly habitat here. As of now, we are beautifying 400 metres and our aim is to do the same thing wherever there is space along the canal,” said architect Kavitha Selvaraj, founder of City Works, who designed the stretch. Karam Korpom Foundation, which works towards the prevention of public space abuse, has also started painting the retaining wall. “We started painting the wall with different themes, including the history of the canal, different native species of butterflies and we have also created a selfie spot,” said Uma Maheshwari, who along with her husband S. Shivakumar, has been carrying out the project. However, residents wonder how the space would be maintained. “Such makeover projects are mandatory. Transformation though, has to be sustained through participation and involvement of residents, along with civic authorities and the police,” said K. Viswanathan, secretary, Mylapore Residents Welfare Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/efforts-on-to-beautify-a-street/article34314671.ece
14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Philately summer camp to be held online in May||This summer, children have another option for fun learning. The Department of Posts will host an online summer camp on philately in May. While such camps have been held at the Philatelic Bureau, Anna Road Head Post Office, in the past, this edition will be conducted online due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In a bid to introduce stamp collection as a hobby and to impart the educational importance of stamps, the department plans to host the camp in four batches. The planned activities include an introduction to philately as a hobby, preparation of stamp exhibits and letter writing exercises. A short film on post office visits will also be screened as part of the camp. The first batch will be held between May 5 and 7, while the second batch will take place from May 11 to May 13. The third batch will be organised between May 19 and 21, with the fourth and final batch taking place from May 26 to May 28.

14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Not political rivalry but caste enmity behind Dalits’ murder’||An independent fact-finding team led by retired IAS officer P. Sivakami that examined the recent murder of two Dalit youths near Arakkonam ruled out “political rivalry” behind the crime but concluded that it was a result of a simmering “caste enmity” between the Scheduled Castes and Vanniyars. At the same time, the team said that there was no truth in the allegation that the youth were drunk. “As per the post-mortem [report] they were not drunk. It is wrong to come to the conclusion that they were drunk because broken bottles were found where the crime took place,” Ms Sivakami, accompanied by advocate A. Rajini, human rights activists Kalpana Sathish and Burely Walter told reporters in Chennai on Tuesday. ‘Not affiliated’ “The dispute that led to the murder had nothing to do with election or politics. Except one AIADMK sympathiser, the others are not affiliated to any political party. There was [however] a simmering enmity between Dalits and the caste Hindus in the area,” she said. (The accused belonged to the Vanniyar community) Alleging various motives were attributed to the murders to sidetrack the issue of “untouchability”, the fact-finding team members said the problem started after a Dalit youth Ayyappan mistakenly addressed another person in a “disrespectful” manner. “He had used the [Tamil] word ‘dei” assuming that it was his friend Adityan. But the caste Hindu boy entered into a fight with Ayyappan and people intervened and pacified them,” the team said in its findings. But subsequent peace meeting ended in violence as caste Hindus, numbering 20, attacked the Dalit youths with weapons. Two Dalit youths were killed and another three were severely injured. “There is a deep-rooted prejudice against Dalits and they are not allowed to participate in temple festivals. Grazing land, lake and agriculture lands are in the control of caste Hindus,” the team said. Regarding Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan’s allegations that the youths — Arjunan, 26, from Soghanur village and Suriya, 26, from Sembedu village — were murdered because they campaigned for the ‘pot’ symbol of his party, Ms. Sivakami said he would have said so to gain political advantage. Panchayats sought Reiterating that separate panchayats for Dalits alone would ensure development for them, the team members said though Dalits were in adequate numbers, they forced to be part of a panchayat run by caste Hindus. Urging the government to give priority to Dalits in National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the team members said caste Hindu women wearing expensive jewellery were getting jobs under the scheme. The team recommended establishment of separate rations shops and nutritious meal centres for Dalit hamlets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/not-political-rivalry-but-caste-enmity-behind-dalits-murder/article34314629.ece

Stalin and MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Tuesday urged the State government to restore the name of Dravidar Kazhagam founder Periyar E.V. Ramasamy to the Poonamallee High Road. The two leaders also criticised the Highways Department in this regard. “When the interim-government of Tamil Nadu is left with a few days, where did the order for removal of Periyar’s name come from? Has the AIADMK government surrendered itself fully to the BJP government even to remove a name given by its party founder MGR?” Mr. Stalin asked in a statement. Mr. Stalin said if the AIADMK government delayed restoring the name, it would be done by the DMK government after May 2. Mr. Vaiko alleged that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had implemented the order of the RSS and Sangh Parivar. Protest planned Meanwhile, the Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam in Coimbatore has said that it would stage a protest in Chennai on April 16 seeking restoration of Periyar’s name. In a statement, the outfit’s general secretary K. Ramakrishnan said AIADMK founder M. G. Ramachandran had renamed the Poonamalle High Road as E.V.R. Periyar Salai to mark the birth centenary of Periyar. The current name change was condemnable, he said and added that during the protest, the organisation cadre would paint tar on the new name board.  When the interim government is left with a few days, where did the order for removal of Periyar’s name come from?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-mdmk-want-periyars-name-restored-to-road/article34314678.ece
14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Several roads are now pedestrian-friendly’||The non-motorised transport policy of the city could have stopped short of improving the cycling facility but has earned kudos from national and international stages for the pavement infrastructure works. A senior official of the Greater Chennai Corporation said walkers form the predominant population, mainly for short distances, and the priority was to give wider and safer pavements free of any hindrance such as encroachments and parking of vehicles. The Corporation had received five national awards and one international award for the pavement project. The senior civic official said that having completed pavements on 108 bus route roads, footpath development work was in progress along 70 arterial roads, stretching for 94 km, at a cost of around Rs. 100 crore. The pavement widening and beautification work was completed on 108 bus route roads covering Gandhi Irwin Road, N.S.C. Bose Road, Kamarajar Salai (in Marina), Pantheon Road, Anna Nagar 4th Avenue, Purasawalkam High Road, Kodambakkam High Road and Greams Road. The pavement project was executed under Tamilnadu Urban Road Infrastructure Project (TURIP) funds for over 200 km. The pavement-friendly project, which is audited by the Disability Rights Alliance, has been envisaged with various specifications for providing ramps in all building entrances and shifting of all utilities such as electricity junction boxes and transformers which act as hindrances. To avoid parking or riding of vehicles on the pavements and cement concrete bollards were being fixed across the entire length of the pavement, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/several-roads-are-now-pedestrian-friendly/article34315039.ece

14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai Corpn. moves HC against exhuming neurosurgeon’s body||The Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner has preferred an appeal against an order passed by a single judge of the Madras High Court on March 31 directing him to arrange for exhuming the body of a neurosurgeon who died of COVID-19 in April 2020 as his body was buried at a cemetery at Velangadu near New Avadi Road much against the wishes of his wife. The High Court had ordered that the body should be exhumed and buried again at the Christian cemetery in Kilpauk following an appeal filed by his wife. The writ appeal has been listed for admission before a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and R.N. Manjula on Thursday. Justice Abdul Quddhose had issued the direction last month on a writ petition filed by the neurosurgeon’s wife. The petitioner had complained that her husband’s body could not be buried at the Kilpauk cemetery as per their religious practice because of some anti-social elements opposing the burial and indulging in violence. Hence, the body was shunted from one cemetery to another and finally got buried in a place used by people of other faith. She insisted on exhuming the body from Velangadu and re-burying it at Kilpauk. However, the Corporation opposed her plea vehemently and contended that the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines did not specify the circumstances under which a body of a COVID-19 victim could be exhumed. It was brought to the notice of the court that an expert committee, comprising various health experts, had opined against exhuming the body. The Corporation had relied upon bylaws framed under Section 349(22)(a) of the Madras City Municipal Corporation Act of 1919 and claimed that a grave could be opened only 14 years after burial of a body and therefore, the petitioner’s plea for reopening the grave within a year could not be acceded to. The civic body feared that accepting the petitioner’s request might open a Pandora’s box with similar requests by many. However, the single judge had rejected all contentions and held that there was a legislative vacuum in the country on the aspect of exhuming bodies that had been buried in inappropriate places and ensuring a decent re-burial after performing all religious obsequies as desired by the family members of the deceased. He said a constitutional court could fill the gap as an interim arrangement until the legislature fills the vacuum. The judge agreed with the petitioner’s counsel S. Elambharathi that there was absolutely no medical evidence anywhere in the world of a person having got infected with coronavirus after being exposed to the body of a person who had died due to COVID-19. Neither the WHO nor the Centre had spoken about the infection spreading from dead bodies, he said and directed the Commissioner to exhume the body and re-bury it by following all safety norms.  The judge agreed that there was no evidence of a person contracting COVID-19 after being exposed to the body of a person who had died of the disease||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/appeal-against-exhuming-surgeons-body/article34314653.ece
14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘GWT is the old name of EVR Periyar Salai’||After the controversy over mentioning EVR Periyar Salai as Grand Western Trunk (GWT) Road on signboards, the Highways Department has clarified that it is the name of the road as per their records. The GWT, whose old number is NH4 and also called as Poonamallee High Road, was formed and named so in the 1850s by the British, explained an official source. The two green-coloured boards on E.V.R. Periyar Salai, mentioning it as Grand Western Trunk Road, were placed some time ago as part of a city-wide signboard installation programme by the department, officials said. Citing a 2019 G.O. in which names of roads under the control of the department are mentioned, the official pointed out that Anna Salai was called GST (Grand Southern Trunk) Road and Walltax Road, which was renamed as V. O. C. Salai, as Grand Northern Trunk (GNT) Road. The GST Road, NH45, is also known as Mount Road in common parlance in the city limits, he added. “The GST, GNT and GWT are very old roads and are thus known officially through out the length that they run. There are also records that the Mughals had formed them,” he explained. In official parlance, all the roads under the control of the department also have a specific number. “There are numbers for even stretches that have been handed back to the State Highways by National Highways Authority of India. According to a 2011 G.O. we mention these numbers in all our communications as the road data, which includes accident data and maintenance data, are connected through web-based systems,” he explained. A former official of the Highways Department said that there was nothing wrong in putting up a board with the old name.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/grand-western-trunk-road-is-old-name-of-evr-periyar-salai/article34315052.ece

He was speaking after inaugurating a COVID-19 awareness campaign at T. Nagar. With public cooperation, “we successfully controlled the first wave in the State” and the second wave could be checked only if people followed the safety norms, he said. In every police district, traders and owners of hotels, lodges, malls and wedding halls were advised to follow the protocol and ensure their customers and guests wore masks and used hand sanitiser, Mr. Aggarwal said. “During the first wave, the public lacked the knowledge of how to prevent or control the spread of COVID-19. Even now, there is slackness among people. At traffic junctions and market places, we are conducting awareness campaigns,” he said, adding that 500-700 cases were booked daily for failure to wear masks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/500-700-cases-booked-daily-for-mask-norm-violation-in-chennai-commisioner-of-police/article34314661.ece

14 April 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Soon, property registrations may be allowed on 3 auspicious days||In a bid to generate more revenue by cashing in on the sentiments of property buyers, the Tamil Nadu government is planning to allow registration of property documents on at least three days considered auspicious in the Tamil calendar — Thai Poosam, the first day of the month of Chithirai and Aadi Perukku. However, those registering documents need to pay more on these days. At present, sub-registrar offices across the State are closed on these days. “The proposal is still in the stage of ideation. This would be similar to the collection of more charges for the registration of motor vehicles with fancy numbers,” a senior official told The Hindu . The official said the proposal would be cleared by the new government. The official communication was sent to the Inspector-General of Registration, but it would not be implemented this Tamil New Year day because several procedures were yet to be complied with. “The software has to be updated... and tokens for those seeking to register their property documents have to be generated. It would take time,” the official said. Tamil Nadu collected Rs. 11,071.02 crore in revenue by registering 25.73 lakh documents during 2018-19. A cross-section of Hindu Tamils observes Thai Poosam on the full moon day of the Tamil month of Thai. It is a religious belief that on this day, the ‘vel’ (the holy lance) was given to Lord Murugan by His mother Goddess Parvathi to annihilate the evil. Aadi Perukku, the 18th day of the Tamil month of Aadi, pays tributes to the life-sustaining properties of water. It is a major celebration along the banks of the Cauvery in the delta districts.

Market and a few other markets in the city. Sources in the civic body said the Corporation was mulling allowing only 50% traders to function on a day and the rest the next day as it done last year during the lockdown. The Corporation could arrive at a decision in the next couple of days.  Before taking a decision, the Corporation would engage with the traders to take their opinion and seek their cooperation and also consult with the district administration, the sources said. The Corporation, on Tuesday, also held talks with representatives of traders from the M.G.R. Wholesale Vegetable Market and Anna Retail Vegetable Market to explore the possibility of shifting them to a school or college ground or another place where maintenance of physical distance would not be a problem. After the discussion, the Corporation had decided to shift the onion trade to the Mettupalayam Road bus stand. Sources in the market said the shift of onion business would ease congestion in the wholesale market as it was onion at around 700 tonnes a day that occupied more space than other vegetables. At present, tomato business functioned out of the bus stand. The sources said the Corporation was looking at the old dump yard in Eru Company, at the junction of Sanganoor Road-Mettupalayam Road, as a possible alternative location for either the wholesale or retail market. Likewise at those markets and the one on Ramar Kovil Street in Ukkadam, the Corporation had also planned to ask the traders to regulate the entry and exit of customers so that at the entry point, they could be screened for temperature, given sanitisers and checked for mask, the sources added. In a related development, the Corporation slapped Rs. 10,000 fine on traders and customers at T.K. Market and Ramar Kovil Street market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-looks-at-regulating-markets-to-enforce-covid-19-safety-guidelines/article34315057.ece

The Department had received several complaints from residents of Vazhaithottam, mostly estate workers, about the movement of a leopard in the village at night. Based on directions from S. Arockiaraj Xavier, Deputy Field Director of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve and District Forest Officer of Pollachi Forest Division, 12 camera traps were placed at various places in the village a few days ago to monitor the leopard’s movement as per the protocols of the National Tiger Conservation Authority. The presence of the leopard was established from visuals of the camera traps and a cage was placed at one of the locations where the big cat had frequented on Monday evening. Valparai forest range officer K. Jayachandran said the villagers had not complained of any attack by the leopard on people and livestock at Vazhaithottam recently. The Forest Department suspects that the leopard could have been attracted by meat or chicken waste that are being discarded in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cage-placed-to-trap-leopard-near-valparai/article34314687.ece

In a representation to the government, the collective highlighted the difficult conditions in which women work in spinning and garment shop floors, tanneries, shoe factories, cashew plantations, rice mills and silver metal workshops. According to M. Shankar, State convenor of Thozhi, the women work outside the ambit of the government’s welfare schemes and without basic worker securities. Even amid the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of women workers are reluctant to get vaccinated, fearing not only the side-effects listed by the government such as body ache, fever and headache, but also the resultant loss of a wage day. The government should, therefore, urge employers to provide a day’s paid leave to women workers post-vaccination, Thozhi has said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/collective-seeks-a-days-paid-leave-to-women-workers-post-vaccination/article34314688.ece

However, the rain gauge stations along the Western Ghats like Srivilliputtur, Rajapalayam, Watrap and Pilavakkal did not receive any rainfall. “The Meteorological Department has forecast that the district could receive rainfall for the next three days. It will be useful for the horticultural crops, vegetables and standing paddy crops,” said Joint Director (Agriculture), S. Uthandaraman. The rain will help standing paddy crops on around 5,000 hectares in Rajapalayam, Watrap and Srivilliputtur blocks. Similarly, it will aid vegetable growing in Rajapalayam, Sivakasi, Kariyapatti, Mallankinaru, Watrap and Narikudi areas. Similarly, the sharp showers will encourage farmers to take up summer ploughing that will recharge the rain-fed farms. “Summer ploughing will also help the farmers in weeding process,” Mr. Uthandaraman added. Meanwhile, he expected more rainfall in Rajapalayam, Watrap and Srivilliputtur blocks where a section of coconut trees have been infected Rugose Whitefly attack. “The hot atmospheric temperature is conducive for the whitefly to flourish. Though forceful spraying of water on the palms will reduce the impact of the pest attack, rain will be a natural solution to wash away the whitefly,” the Joint Director said. Stating that the Rugose Whitefly that stays behind the leaves, suck its sap and make them turn yellow, he said that it leads to fungal infection that makes the leaves become black. The blackening of leaves prevent photosynthesis and the palms get reduced yield as the coconuts start to shrink. Rainfall reported in other places (in mm): Sattur – 19 and Vembakottai 4.20.

The available beds at MGMGH and other COVID care centres are sufficient to accommodate the patients, Collector S. Divyadharshini, who held a meeting with the health and revenue officials on Tuesday, told The Hindu.  More beds will be needed if the cases go up further. Hence, it has been decided to increase the number of beds to 4,000. Health and revenue officials have been asked to visit private and government colleges to study availability of beds in their hostels, she said. Institutions in Thuraiyur, Manapparai, Thottiyam and Musiri will be identified for the purpose. Basic facilities will be created in the new care centres. It will facilitate treatment of patients in their surroundings instead of coming to Tiruchi. “Some patients prefer home treatment. However, if they come to GH or COVID care centres, the chances of spreading the virus to their family members and neighbours will be limited. Hence, we ask them to get treated at the centres,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/efforts-to-convert-college-hostels-into-care-centres-under-way-in-tiruchi/article34315195.ece

Corner ground as very few traders set up shop there on Monday night. The few who shifted complained of poor business and claimed that some wholesale traders allowed to function in Gandhi Market were resorting to retail trade. Last week, district officials, after a meeting with representatives of the traders, decided to temporarily shift the retail traders of the market to G. Corner railway ground near Golden Rock. Following this, lighting arrangements were made at G. Corner ground and a sign board was put up by Tiruchi Corporation proclaiming that both retail and wholesale shops would function there from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. Visitors were asked to maintain social distance and wear face masks. Failure to wear masks would attract a penalty of Rs. 200,it said. Though officials said the temporary market had become functional, very few traders seemed to be ready to move there.“We have issued 900 tokens to traders of Gandhi Market who will be allowed to set up shop at G.Corner,” a senior official of the Corporation told The Hindu . “There is no other option but to abide by the government order and retail traders have to shift. We have instructed wholesale traders not to resort to retail sale at Gandhi Market,” he said. On Tuesday morning, senior officials of the Corporation led by Commissioner S.Sivasubramanian inspected the market following which barricades were erected to prevent retail trade there. Last year, almost the entire the market functioned temporarily out of G. Corner ground for some months in the wake of imposition of lockdown. However, some of the traders were sceptical over the success of the temporary market at G.Corner under the present circumstances. “I was one of the very few traders who opened shop at the market on Monday night. But there were hardly any buyers. I set up shop with vegetables worth Rs. 30,000 but hardly Rs. 1,000 worth of vegetables sold. I had to bring back the stock,” said M.K. Kamalakannan, president, Gandhi Market Vyabarigal Munnetra Sangam. Pointing out that there were very few city buses to G. Corner, Mr. Kamalakannan said people would hardly prefer to visit the spot to make purchases. Similar views were being expressed by consumer activists too. “The move to shift retail trade is against consumer interest. The views of consumers were not heard while taking the decision. How can the retail market function in the open ground at G. Corner during the scorching summer?” wondered M. Sekaran, president, Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations. Mr. Sekaran pointed out that last year only the wholesale market was shifted to G. Corner ground and temporary retail markets were opened at various places across the city, suiting consumer needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gandhi-market-or-g-corner-ground/article34315197.ece

This seems to be an attempt to force employees to take the shot…,” a senior ICF official said. SOP issued In a detailed Standard Operating Procedure, the ICF said if four or more employees working in different groups tested positive for COVID-19, the shop/office should be closed for 48 hours for deep disinfection procedure. In case a family member of an employee tests positive to the virus, he/she should not come for duty and self-quarantine till such time the family member tests negative. The employee will be under self-quarantine for the same period. As regards employees coming from other States/Union Territory, except Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Puducherry, they would have to undergo home quarantine for 14 days. In case of death of an employee declared COVID-19 positive, the State government would conduct the cremation/burial and no outsiders or friends would be allowed to attend the funeral or pay their last respects to the deceased employee. All employees were advised to pay their respects and condolences by phone. “It is strongly recommended that they should not attempt to visit the residence of the deceased COVID-19 positive employee or visit the family members, as this would increase the risk of infection…,” the SOP said. In a related development, the Southern Railway has decided to function with 50% minimum attendance at the Zonal Headquarters and Construction Wing while the remaining staff will work from home from April 15 till the month end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/icf-tells-staff-to-take-the-shot-or-go-on-leave/article34315033.ece

14 April 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Rain brings losses to paddy farmers||Several farmers who cultivated paddy in the puncha crop season (first crop) have suffered huge losses after summer rain destroyed harvest-ready crops in large tracts in different parts of the district. Besides, several tonnes of harvested paddy kept in paddy polders to be shifted to rice mills got drenched in the rain. According to paddy farmers and officials, the upper Kuttanad region has been the worst affected. In the Chennithala region, paddy in 500 hectares has been destroyed/submerged. Farmers in Mannar, Thalavady and other parts of the region too suffered losses. With the weather agency predicting rain in the coming days, the farmers are a worried lot. Apart from fields with standing crops getting submerged, the harvested paddy stored in the polders or in the open, due to lack of proper storage facilities, also gets damaged. Farmers said that due to the high moisture content in the rain-soaked paddy, rice mills were demanding wastage up to 15 kg per quintal of paddy. This results in friction between the farmers and mills. “We cannot do much about rain destroying standing crops. But authorities can ensure the procurement of harvested paddy in a time-bound manner. But, unfortunately, that is not happening, adding to the woes of the farmers,” said a paddy farmer from Chennithala. Kodikunnil Suresh, MP, who visited the submerged fields in Thalavady on Tuesday urged the government to provide immediate relief to farmers. In 28,000 ha Paddy farming has been undertaken in around 28,000 hectares in Alappuzha district, a major portion being in Kuttanad, in the ‘puncha’ crop season (first crop). So far, paddy harvest is completed in around 24,000 hectares. The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) has procured around one lakh tonnes of paddy so far from the farmers in Alappuzha. Earlier in the puncha season, seeds provided by the government to farmers in Nedumudi, Thakazhi and Veeyapuram failed to germinate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rain-brings-huge-losses-to-paddy-farmers-of-alappuzha/article34314781.ece

In a statement issued here recently, the college authorities said that the project funded by the Union Department of Biotechnology had received the necessary approvals. The Centre had sanctioned Rs. 50 lakh for the project. Officials claimed that this would be India’s first human milk-based human milk fortifier. Neonatal mortality The fortifier will play a vital role in reducing neonatal mortality, which remains significantly high in India. “Breastfeeding plays a very important role in reducing neonatal mortality. However, there are many challenges associated with breastfeeding preterm infants, including inadequate milk supply of the mother, high variability and limitations of the nutrient content of the milk itself and so on. Human milk fortifiers are recommended to optimise the nutritional composition of maternal milk,” says Tressia Alias Princy Paulose, assistant professor, Postgraduate and Research Department of Chemistry, Bishop Moore College, Mavelikara. Composition different Ms. Paulose says most commercially available human milk fortifiers are based on bovine milk, which has a composition different from that of human milk. Moreover, cow milk protein intake in the first months of life has raised concerns because of its association with allergies and intestinal inflammation in premature babies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/human-milk-based-milk-fortifier-for-preterm-babies/article34314776.ece

A recent order issued by Rajendra G. Garawad, Deputy Inspector General, NTCA, also urged State governments to execute the directive with immediate effect. According to the earlier guidelines of the scheme, a son above 18 years irrespective of his marital status, unmarried daughter above 18 years, physically and mentally challenged persons irrespective of their age and sex, minor orphan, and widow or woman divorcee will be treated as separate families. The eligible families were provided with a compensation of Rs. 10 lakh each, irrespective of the nature or extend of the land they possessed. The Kerala Forest Research Institute, Peechi, had conducted a survey 13 years ago on the relocation of settlers under the voluntary resettlement project. It had found that as many as 10,604 people from 2,613 families in 110 settlements needed to be relocated. The survey had identified 1,388 people from 880 families in 14 settlements for relocation in the first phase at a cost of Rs. 88 crore. Though the project had been launched in 2006, it was rolled out in the sanctuary in 2011. The government could relocate nearly 560 families so far, including tribal families, in 10 settlements in the sanctuary under the project. It was a long-standing demand of settler farmers, environmentalists, and State governments to enhance the compensation, as the land value and the prices of construction materials had gone up manifold, N. Badusha, president, Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti, said. The decision of the MoEFCC will be a great relief to thousands of settler farmer families in the sanctuary, as man-animal conflict had peaked inside forest settlements, A. Kesavan Chetty, a farmer of the Chettyalthur settlement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/settler-farmers-in-wayanad-hail-hike-in-compensation/article34314705.ece

District Collector Adeela Abdulla on Tuesday directed revenue officials to restrict the number of tourists to 500 persons a day at the major tourism destinations in the district such as Pookode, Thollayiram Kandy, and Banasurasagar. Ms. Abdulla directed the Vythiri tahsildar to make special arrangements for the purpose at Thollayiram Kandy area. Entry to the tourism destinations will be allowed only for those who have been vaccinated, who possess COVID-19 negative certificates and who have pre-booked their entry in those destinations. All the destinations should be closed at 5 p.m. Ms. Abdulla, who is also the chairman of the District Disaster Management Authority, issued a directive to District Medical Officer (DMO) to adopt steps to intensify RRT mapping and random tests in all inter-State and inter-district borders. The DMO should ensure conducting as many as 2,500 COVID tests a day in the district. The Community Health Centres at Pulpally and Thariyodu as well the Adhyapaka Bhavan at Sulthan Bathery should be set up as COVID first line treatment centres. The food security of tribespeople should be ensured by the three-tier local administrative bodies. All kinds of public meetings have been banned for the next three weeks and the number of participants in marriages has been restricted to 100 members. All shops should close by 9.p.m. and the COVID-19 protocol should be followed in the number of travellers in buses.

14 April 2021||KASARAGOD,KERALA||Grit, determination take tribesman to IIM teaching post||A few months ago, R. Ranjith was a name that hardly anyone knew. But this 28-year-old man, belonging to a Scheduled Tribe, has become an overnight sensation. People now look at him with admiration and he inspires many with his story. It all began with his post in the social media which has gone viral. The picture of his small unplastered house, a tiled roof covered with a tarpaulin to prevent rain water leaking and a message that it was where his journey to becoming an Assistant Professor in the Indian Institute of Management, Ranchi, began was well received by people. The post was widely shared and he was flooded with messages congratulating him on his grit and determination to achieve his dream. CPI(M) leader and Finance Minister Thomas Isaac shared the post and congratulated him on his feat. For Mr. Ranjith, however, the journey was never a cakewalk. He was born into a poor family. His father, Ramachandran Naik, is a tailor and his mother R. Baby is a daily wage labourer. After completing his Class 10 education at the government-run Model Residential School for Boys in Pillicode in the district, his love for the subject of economics grew during his higher secondary education in a government school at Balanthode. Later, he graduated in the subject from St. Pius X College, Rajapuram. “Those days were never easy, as I had to shuffle between duty as a watchman at the BSNL exchange in the evening and pursue my education in the morning. There was hardly any time to rest. But it was the difficulties in the house that kept me going,” he recalled. Speaking to The Hindu , he said that after his post-graduation from the Central University of Kerala, things changed for him when he joined IIT Chennai, for his PhD programme. “It was altogether a different world. I was unable to communicate with the people for lack of fluency in English and it was difficult to adjust to the new environment,” he said. But, his guide Subash Sasidharan and his wife, Vaidehi, both faculty members at the IIT, kept him motivated to pursue his research. He completed his research on “Special distribution of FDI and industrial agglomeration in India” before the stipulated period, which helped him to get a six-month pre-doctoral fellowship. No reservation roster It was during this period that he applied for the vacancy in the economics department in Calicut University. He said that this was a huge moment of disappointment him. Despite qualifying for the post in the department which had four vacant posts, he did not receive the appointment letter. To add to the feeling of injustice, the appointments were in the university were made without publishing the rank list. The reservation roster was also not released. This was highly controversial and it made headlines in the media. Many qualified scholars such as Mr. Ranjith were not given appointments. Mr. Ranjith said that in an academic institution, eligible candidates should be given the job without any discrimination on the basis of religion or caste since they would be responsible for training a new generation of students. The loss for the Calicut University turned out to be a gain for the IIM, Ranchi, where he will be joining soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/grit-tenacity-take-tribesman-to-iim/article34314715.ece

The public sector company is also expecting orders worth another Rs. 30 crore, which may further enhance its prospects. The Indian Railways, defence and ordnance factories remain the major clients of the company. The Kalamassery unit is one of the six units of HMT Limited, a subsidiary of the Bengaluru-based holding company, HMT Limited. The Kalamassery unit logged a sales turnover of Rs. 67.64 crore during the 2020-21 fiscal and a production turnover of Rs. 68.84 crore as against the target of Rs. 65 crore. The company posted an operational profit of Rs. 11.46 crore and a net profit of Rs. 3.37 crore subjected to audit, which it felt was a commendable feat considering the challenges posed by the pandemic situation. ‘Concerted efforts’ A company spokesperson attributed the feat to concerted efforts of the entire workforce ranging from trainee apprentices to employees and senior officials. The company now has a pool of 128 employees. The company lost nearly three months to the pandemic-induced lockdown. Though it had a tough time till the half-yearly mark, the company went full blast after that, helping it eventually post profits with everyone becoming aware of the fact that without their committed efforts they would be staring at troubled times. “However, we didn’t ignore the COVID-19 protocol and ensured strict compliance, which helped us avert pandemic infections to a large extent,” said the spokesperson. The product line of the Kalamassery unit comprises high-value machines, including conventional and CNC Lathes and single/multi colour offset printing machines, and directing gears catering mainly for the Defence, Indian Railways, the Indian Navy, and major auto manufacturers.

The State has recorded the lowest number of fire incidents and area lost to blaze this year when compared to previous years. Since January, only 161 fire incidents have been reported. The loss of forest area in these incidents has been estimated at 408 hectares. Four-year data available with the Forest Department indicate that fire inflicted the maximum loss in 2019 when 1,767.05 hectares was charred in 571 incidents between January and April. Last year, the countrywide lockdown imposed following the COVID-19 pandemic came as a blessing for forest managers as human intervention in forest areas was reduced significantly. It was estimated that 711.02 hectares of forest was lost in 377 incidents last year. In 2019, as much as 1,278 hectares was charred in 330 incidents during the four-month-long period. Control measures Grasslands that quickly dry up in summer and organic materials that gather on the floor of deciduous forests quickly catches fire. The deployment of fire watchers, reduction of fuel load and early burning are some of the fire-control measures that are conventionally engaged by the Forest Department, said Rajesh Raveendran, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, who is coordinating the drive. The month of February, revealed the fire data, is the blaze-prone month in a fire season that begins by December. It is also the period when the maximum number of festivals in temples located on hilltops takes place and there would be increased human interactions on the forest fringes, which could possibly trigger wildfire, he said. The summer showers that the State receives during the March-April period cool the atmosphere and reduces the chances of fire. Termites feed on the vegetation which gets soaked in the summer showers, thus reducing the fire risk, he explained. Block-based system This time, the Forest Department implemented a block-based decentralised fire management system after identifying highly fire-prone areas. Plans are afoot to draw up action plans for all the blocks and forest stations of the State for the 2022 season by April this year. The plans for the forest circle will be in place by July. The registration of all staff under the Forest Fire Alert system of the Forest Survey of India will also be completed, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rain-early-intervention-curb-forest-fires/article34314726.ece
14 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Tourism hub envisaged along Kadambrayar-Edachira stretch||A mini tourism hub has been envisaged alongside Kadambrayar ecotourism village-Edachira stretch to provide a sprawling waterfront locale for IT professionals and others in the locality to unwind. The Thrikkakara Municipality has joined hands with the Ernakulam District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) to carve out the tourism hub. The project got an impetus after a team led by the Chairperson of Thrikkakara Municipality, Ajitha Thankappan, inspected the weed and water hyacinth-infested waterbody. The Kadambrayar river and the Edachira canal offer immense potential for boating and other recreational activities. Boats and a restaurant that were operated by DTPC are now idling due to the pandemic situation and the expiry of the 10-year contract period with a private firm. The operation and maintenance of the locale will be retendered shortly. A walkway and boat jetty here, which suffered damage in the 2018 deluge, ought to be repaired, said S. Vijayakumar, Secretary of Ernakulam DTPC. “The municipality’s proposal has coincided with a riverfront beautification scheme that was being readied. In this, approximately 2-km-long walkways and landscaping are envisaged on either side of Kadambrayar river. They would begin from Infopark and end near the restaurant on the river bank,” he said. ‘Insufficient funds’ Ms. Thankappan said that the Rs. 1.50 crore that the municipality had earmarked in the budget would be inadequate to fund the tourism hub project. “This is because the waterbodies have to be cleaned, dredged and the banks reinforced, apart from readying of a walkway and hanging bridge. A tentative estimate has been readied, following which a DPR would be prepared. We are keen to tie up with the DTPC so that their expertise and tourism funds can be availed. This is one among the three dream projects of the municipality.” Regular tourist boats and coracles have been envisaged here for visitors. The CSR funds of KRL, IT firms and banks could be pooled together to realise the project. Ultimately, a solution has to be found to the pollution of Kadambrayar caused by industrial units and others. “A meeting of the Kadambrayar Samrakshana Samiti would be convened shortly in this regard, since we are unable to go ahead with a project to source drinking water from the river,” she said. Unhindered dumping of garbage and pollutants into the river has been a perennial problem, ever since the locale was developed as an eco-tourism destination in 2010. The locale is set to get more importance when Water Metro ferries begin service in the Vyttila-Kakkanad route in the third quarter of 2021. A popular private water theme park is located close by the tourist spot. The DTPC would associate with similar waterfront-beautification projects that are under way in Thripunithura Municipality as well, it is learnt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tourism-hub-envisaged-along-kadambrayar-edachira-stretch/article34315127.ece

14 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fate of Amrut projects hangs in balance||The fate of four large projects being implemented by the Kochi Corporation under the Union government-initiated Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) hangs in the balance. The scheme was launched in 2015 and the administrative sanction for the projects was obtained in early 2018. Six years later, around 45% of the sanctioned amount of Rs. 272.063 crore has been utilised. More than 60% of the funds allocated under the scheme are for water supply and sewerage projects. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is yet to grant permission for the laying of pipelines from the Kerala Water Authority plant at Maradu to the pump house at Thammanam and approval has been awaited for about two years now, sources at the corporation said. The pipelines, along the service road between Maradu and Vyttila, will carry 18 million litres of water per day, augmenting supply to the city. The ongoing construction of five overhead tanks and laying of pipelines within the city under the Amrut project would be useless unless the NHAI grants permission for this crucial section of the work, they said. Controversial project The controversial Padmasarovaram cycle track and walkway along the Chilavannoor lake is another Amrut project, for which Rs. 9.3 crore was sanctioned. The corporation is set to propose construction of the cycle track and walkway alongside the lake, in an eco-friendly manner, but there is both puramboke as well as private land adjacent to the lake. “Only once a survey is done can we determine if land acquisition will be required, thereby prolonging the process. Coastal Regulation Zone clearance will also have to be sought. This project is unlikely to be complete before the March 2022 deadline for Amrut projects,” sources said. The corporation has written to the State Level High Powered Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary to seek approval for the changes to the earlier project that had involved construction of a bund in the lake itself. But the steering committee has not met recently since the model code of conduct is in place, the sources said. Mayor M. Anilkumar confirmed that a change in the project has been sought. The construction of a park under the Amrut scheme, also on the bank of the Chilavannoor lake, had received flak for being environmentally unsound. “The current council does not seem keen on building the park considering the opposition to it. Funds worth Rs. 1.26 crore that had been set aside for the park are likely to now be used for the G. Sankara Kurup memorial that is coming up near Marine Drive. Permission has been sought from the steering committee for this change in fund utilisation,” sources said. Work on three decentralised sewage plants in West Kochi is yet to be awarded with no clear decision on how the corporation and the State government will pay for the cost quoted by the contractor in excess of the estimate. The project was estimated to cost around Rs. 44 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fate-of-amrut-projects-hangs-in-balance/article34315129.ece

The Kochi Corporation-owned ferries are operated by KSINC in the busy corridor. Official sources attributed the snag to a delay in carrying out repairs and the non-availability of a third vessel to operate in case a vessel had to be withdrawn for repair. “One of the two engines of the vessel stalled as it neared Fort Kochi jetty, possibly due to strong undercurrents. A couple of two wheelers that were being carried fell on their side in the resultant confusion, as the vessel swerved to one side. Fortunately, none was injured. A technician who arrived, fixed the problem in half an hour,” official sources said. In the absence of an alternative vessel, the two vessels operate regular trips even if there are minor complaints, they said. Jude A. Thomas, a passenger on board one of the vessels, said that a propeller stopped functioning at 5 p.m. The vessel went in circles since it could not go in a straight line, neither could it be berthed at the jetty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ro-ro-ferry-stalls-as-engine-develops-snag/article34315133.ece

The platform will help aqua farmers get better price and exporters to directly purchase quality products from the former enhancing traceability, a key factor in international trade, said a release here on Tuesday. The term e-SANTA means Electronic Solution for Augmenting NaCSA Farmers’ Trade in Aquaculture. The National Centre for Sustainable Aquaculture (NaCSA) is an extension arm of the Kochi-based Marine Products Export Development Authority, under the Ministry of Commerce. To reduce risk The new platform is expected to reduce risks for farmers, create awareness about products and markets, increase farmer income, and shield them from wrong practices. e-SANTA is a paperless end-to-end electronic trade platform between farmers and exporters. Farmers have the freedom to list their produce and quote their price while exporters have the freedom to list their requirements and choose the products based on their requirements such as desired size, location, harvest dates. The platform will provide detailed specification of each product listing and is backed by an electronic payment system with NaCSA as an escrow agent. After crop listing and online negotiation, a deal is struck, advance payment is made and an estimated invoice is generated. Once the harvest date is fixed, the buyer goes to the farm gate and the produce is harvested in his presence. After the harvest, the final count, quantity of material is verified, the final amount is decided, and delivery challan is issued. Once the material reaches the processing plant, the final invoice is generated and the exporter makes the rest of the payment.This payment is reflected in the escrow account. NaCSA verifies it and accordingly releases the payment to farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/e-platform-for-aqua-farmers-buyers/article34314730.ece
14 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Old barter market still holds sway||Three days of late-afternoon rain played havoc with the traditional Chendamangalam barter market that still holds a great fascination for the people in Paravur and its neighbouring areas despite money ruling the transactions. “People came in large numbers to the market despite the bad weather and slushy grounds,” says Sashankan, who sells a variety of products ranging from steel knives to earthen pots and pans. But the bad weather dampened spirits quite a bit, says Rajee Pradeep, who sells home-made pickles, peanut butter, honey and bangles, and items of personal decoration. She found the sales go slow after heavy downpour forced people to hurry back home. The organisers of the fair then decided to call it off by late afternoon on Tuesday. The market fair is organised under the aegis of the Chendamangalam grama panchayat. A range of products The Chendamangalam barter market is a throwback to history when people did not depend on cash to make exchanges and valuable transactions. A whole range of products from bamboo and coconut shell ladles and spoons to home-made bangles, earthenwares, dry fish, exotic orchids, and flowering plants, bamboo mats, and steel knives and locally popular mango varieties were seen in the market on Tuesday morning. This year’s market showed the great love people had for the old tradition, Mr. Sashankan says. Despite the weather conditions, they tried to make their presence felt, he adds. Paulose Joseph, who sells tea, coffee and soft drinks at the venue, felt the 2020 fair was washed out because of COVID-19 restrictions. It was expected that the 2021 festival will revive the event’s fortunes. However, the situation just about showed promise of a comeback when weather and fear of a new COVID-19 wave toppled this year’s plans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/old-barter-market-still-holds-sway/article34314813.ece

14 April 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Assamese girl a ‘battered child’: medical experts||The little Assamese girl admitted to the paediatric surgical wing at the Institute of Child Health (ICH) of the Kottayam Medical College Hospital last month is a victim of neglect and sustained abuse qualifying her as a ‘battered child,’ observed medical experts. Board’s conclusion A medical board, comprising doctors drawn from various departments, that met on Monday had concluded as much though whether the abuse was sexual remains something to be found out by a police investigation. The Battered Child Syndrome denotes injuries suffered by a child as a result of physical abuse inflicted usually by an adult caregiver. “The lacerations just above the vagina were indicative of possible unnatural sex though the hymen was intact. The child remains to be examined by a gastroenterologist to ascertain whether the rectal perforations were on account of some rare disease though the findings of the paediatric surgeon were adequate enough,” said ICH sources. Victim’s age The girl, whom the police said was nearly five-year-old but was found to be aged only three-and-a-half-year through a scientific bone examination was living with her father and stepmother and their children at a rented house at Perumattom in Muvattupuzha. She was taken to a private hospital last month after she complained of abdominal pain. From there she was referred to ICH after her condition was found complicated. She underwent surgery there when it was revealed that she had a wound in the intestine and considerable deposits of pus in the stomach. “There was no sign of food though, which means that either the girl wasn’t offered any food or she didn’t take it. She also had fractures to her leg, hand, skull and ribs indicating abuse,” said sources. The hypothesis by the police was that the child sustained the injuries from a fall she had from the window on to a broken cycle split by the middle. However, medical sources who examined the cycle seized by the police found the injuries incompatible with the cycle in question. During interactions a psychologist proficient in Assamese, allotted by the Childline, had with victim she stuck to the version of accidental fall on three occasions, said Muvattupuzha police sources. They recorded her statement before the magistrate as well. POCSO case The police had invoked charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act after the doctor treating the child flagged that the kind of injury found on her backside could also have been caused by sexual abuse among other things. Confidential report “The medical board was formed at our request and they are yet to finalise the report, which will be a confidential one to be handed to us. The report is expected by the end of this week,” said police sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/assamese-girl-a-battered-child-medical-experts/article34314779.ece

The arrested were identified as Agnel Benoy, 23, of Idukki, Muhammed Shafi, 31, of Thrissur, and Anoop, 33, of Thrissur. They stand accused of having waylaid a woman returning home by a scooter at Pattimattom, hitting her on the head and robbing her of her scooter, Rs. 15,000, and mobile phone. The incident occurred on March 19 around 7.45 p.m. when the victim was on her way back to home after the day’s work. The scooter was found abandoned the day after. According to the police, Agnel had worked with the victim in a firm three years ago. He had allegedly conspired with two others with criminal antecedents knowing that she would be having money with her. The accused were arrested from different places in Thrissur following a probe ordered by the District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural), K. Karthik. Agnel got involved in the crime after having been released from the prison in December on a chain-snatching case registered by the Nedumbasserry police. Anoop has cases registered against him at Varantharapilly, Mathilakam, Olloor, Puthukkad, Ernakulam North, Manchery, and Kalpetta police stations for charges varying from attempt to murder and theft.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/three-held-on-charge-of-robbing-woman/article34314794.ece
14 April 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Offering a safe site for Olive Ridleys||The endangered Olive Ridley turtles now have a safe nesting site at Paravur, all thanks to Punarjani, a joint initiative of the Social Forestry wing of the Kerala Forest Department and Travancore Nature History Society (TNHS). Though the marine reptile listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List is very uncommon in the coastline of Kollam, Chillakkal and Pozhikkara beaches make an exception. Since these spots lack seawalls, the turtles come ashore to lay eggs and the project aims at providing them a secure breeding habitat. “Fishers were educated about the necessity to preserve the turtles and were also urged to inform the authorities if they spot any. We could locate a couple of nesting sites with their help and we have already released the first batch of 61 hatchlings to the sea,” says Anil Kumar, Divisional Forest Officer, Social Forestry, Kollam. Abdul Salam, a local fisher, was employed by the department to guard the nests while the officials also ensured regular patrolling. “Each turtle lays 60 to 100 eggs and it takes 45 to 60 days to hatch the eggs depending on the temperature and climatic conditions. Usually, it is necessary to shift the eggs from vulnerable areas where poaching is rampant. Timing and maintaining the original positioning of the egg stalks are very important when it comes to translocating. If we want to move the eggs to a hatchery, we have to do it within 10 to 12 hours,” says Kalesh Sadasivan of the TNHS. Hatchery Though the department has established a hatchery at Chillakkal, none of the nests were translocated this time. Since hatchlings emerging from the nests crawl into the sea, constant monitoring was required to protect them from predators and birds of prey. “Though the first batch of hatchlings came out early morning, we had to keep them till evening. In the night they can safely make their way to the sea, but it is not possible during daytime due to the presence of predators,” says Dr. Kalesh. Punarjani was launched in 2020, immediately after some fishers reported the sighting of Olive Ridleys on the beach. While the Chillakkal beach is considered a safe zone, the picture seems different in Pozhikkara. “There is lack of awareness among local communities and we are planning another campaign following all COVID-19 guidelines to spread awareness,” adds Mr. Anil Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/offering-a-safe-nesting-site-for-olive-ridleys/article34314774.ece

Several incidents have been reported from villages in the eastern parts of the district bordering forests and the residents allege no proper step has been taken by the authorities. Pathanapuram, Kulathupuzha, Thenmala and Arayankavu have been facing the problem for several years now. Though the Forest Department had tried some measures, including solar fencing, the menace continues in most parts. Leopard attacks According to residents, there has been cases of leopards attacking their livestock while wild boars, monkeys, elephants and peacocks raid their farmlands. In a recent incident, a one-year-old bull calf was killed by a leopard in Punnala. According to the residents, the presence of leopard in the area was reported earlier too and the sightings have increased of late. “On last Thursday, the cattle grazing in the nearby forest area were attacked by a leopard. Alerted by the cry of the cattle, those who rushed to the scene saw the wild cat and the animal fleeing after seeing the crowd,” they say. The body of the bull was found on the spot and the Forest officials were informed about the incident. High conflict There are many parts in the district where the man-animal conflict is very high and the farmers have been trying their level best to curb animal incursion. The residents say apart from suffering the loss of livestock, they are also worried about their safety. Livestock go missing “Livestock often go missing from the village and sometimes they do not come back after grazing. There are elephants and giant squirrels that destroy our crops and we are unable to protect our cattle or farms. Forest officials often visit the site and ensure that the issue will be taken care of. But there has been no proper redressal measure so far,” says a farmer from Pathanapuram.

George and the Muslim electorate at Erattupetta, which reached its peak during the recent Assembly elections, continues to simmer even after polling. The latest episode was played out on Tuesday with Mr.George openly stating that ‘love jihad’ was prevalent at Erattupetta. “There is love jihad at Erattupetta and 47 girls from the region, including 12 Hindu girls, have so far fallen victim to the practice,” he alleged. He said the recent instances in which girls from Aniyilappu and Teekkoyi (both locations near Erattupetta) went missing were indeed cases of love jihad. “This was what happened in the case of Jesna [Maria James] as well,” Mr. George said. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. George said his statement was never intended to hurt peace-loving Muslims in the region. The statement takes a cue from his speech at Thodupuzha earlier this week when he abruptly raised the love jihad issue. Observers, however, regard his latest remarks as a continuation of his widening discord with the Muslim electorate since the Parliament elections of 2019. The legislator has been accused of engaging in anti-Muslim rhetoric with an eye on Hindu and Christian votes. Despite an evident consolidation of Muslim votes against him, Mr. George held a victory celebration immediately after polling on April 6. Addressing mediapersons later, he confirmed receipt of a tacit support from the Bharatiya Janata Party despite denials by the party leadership, which also triggered accusations of vote trading against him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pc-george-raises-love-jihad-issue/article34314800.ece

Farmers are now worried that the paddy might sprout if the fields remain submerged for a few more day. Adding to their concerns is the inordinate delay in sorting out the issues over procurement with rice mills. About 85 tonnes of paddy harvested from the Thuruthipadam polders in Peroor faces the prospects of a total loss due to a delay in procurement. Protests held Though harvest operations were complete in most locations, the delay in procurement is expected to affect the next cycle of cultivation as well. Earlier last month, farmers in the Neendoor and Kallara regions had organised protests against rice mill owners for delaying the procurement of paddy citing unfair reasons. The issue was settled following the intervention of the local body authorities and authorities at the paddy marketing office in the district. “The crisis, however, appears to have resurfaced at some other locations as the millers are attempting to cash in on the urgency triggered by the summer rain,” accused a farmer. The showers that have lashed most parts of Kottayam and Pathanamthitta since the last week left its mark on most of the crops. In Pathanamthitta In Pathanamthitta, the rain has caused losses of crops worth Rs. 14.3 crore. Seven houses were destroyed and 43 buildings sustained damage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/procurement-hit/article34314789.ece

Meanwhile, it has been decided to avoid big Iftar parties in the district in the wake of high number of COVID cases being reported from here. However, events to break the fast during the Ramzan month will continue. Rituals in mosques would be held as per the protocol. These were decided at a meeting of heads of Muslim organisations on Tuesday. The district administration said that the details of the beds for COVID treatment were available at the infrastructural dashboard of the Jagrata portal. An order issued by the District Collector said that violation of the pandemic protocol had led to the infection spreading in many areas. Barricades would be in place at all markets, harbours, and fish landing centres to control people’s entry. At least five-metre distance should be kept between counters in fish markets and the customers should keep a distance of one metre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/867-fresh-cases-in-kozhikode-tpr-rises-to-1231/article34314719.ece
14 April 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Congress hopes to win more seats in Malabar this time||After its dismal performance in north Kerala last time, the Congress is looking forward to improve its performance in the just- concluded Assembly polls. In the previous elections, the party nominees ahd won just six of the 60 seats in north Kerala. Pathetically, it was without legislators in Kasaragod and Kozhikode districts in the past three terms. Despite the hiccups in choosing its candidates in many Assembly constituencies, the Congress leadership finally managed to pull off towards the last round of electioneering. Ground realities revealed that Congress candidates would emerge victorious in a couple of seats more this time in the six districts, party functionaries said. The poll managers of the Congress believe that the campaign by party leader Rahul Gandhi would it secure more seats in Kannur, Kozhikode, Kannur, and Palakkad districts. In the case of Kasaragod, the party was unable to aggressively campaign like its partner, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). As in the 2011 polls, the party hopes to repeat its performance in the Kannur segment, and spring a surprise by wresting the Thalassery seat. It has fielded Satheeshan Pacheni and M.P. Aravindakshan in these constituencies respectively. This is apart from retaining the Irikkur and Peravoor segments in the district. Incidentally, the stalemate in the party over the candidate in the Irikkur was resolved at the eleventh hour. In Wayanad district, the support of the IUML would help pave the way for the success of Congress candidate T. Siddique in Kalpetta segment. Of the three seats in the district, the Sulthan Bathery seat is held I.C. Balakrishnan of the Congress. Congress leader M.K. Raghavan, MP, says that that the party would score stunning victories in segments that witnessed neck and neck contests in Kozhikode district. Some of these are Nadapuram, Koyilandy, Beypore, and Kozhikode North constituencies. The party had fielded seasoned leaders such as K. Praveen Kumar, N. Subramanian and P.M. Niyas in Nadapuram, Koyilandy and Beypore while its nominee, KSU State president K.M. Abhijith was in the fray from Kozhikode North. The exit of the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) is unlikely to impact its prospects in Kozhikode and Kannur districts. In Malappuram, the Congress leadership has high expectations in Nilambur and Thavannur. This is apart from retaining the Wandoor segment. The leadership also has a bright outlook on its nominees in Palakkad district where they faced the BJP candidates in triangular contests in many constituencies. The Congress won two seats – Thrithala and Palakkad – in the 2016 polls. The incumbent legislators, V.T. Balram and Shafi Parambil, were once again fielded in these segments. The party nominated Sumesh Achuthan and Riyas Mukkoli to capture the Chittur and Pattambi seats it lost to Left Democratic Front in the 2016 polls. It has also pinned hopes on Kongad seat as well in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-hopes-to-win-more-seats-in-malabar-this-time/article34314711.ece
14 April 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Vote seeking at a fever pitch in medical college||It’s been just a week since the Assembly polls got over. But vote seeking has just begun at the Government Medical College, Kozhikode, as the students’ union elections under the Kerala University of Health Sciences have been scheduled for April 17. Medicos wearing face masks are seen roaming around in groups campaigning for their candidates. The elections could not be held last year owing to the pandemic. For the past over one-and-a-half decades, the main contest is between Independents, an apolitical students’ organisation, and the Students Federation of India (SFI). The Independents have been winning all the general seats in the students union since 2003 and are hoping to retain them. “Mainstream students outfits such as the SFI, Kerala Students Union, and the Muslim Students Federation are controlled by outside forces. They cannot make an independent stand on crucial issues. For example, the SFI could not condemn the murder of Muslim Youth League activist Mansoor in Panoor, because they are affiliated to the CPI(M), whose workers are allegedly behind the incident,” Shawn Thomas, chairperson candidate for Independents, told The Hindu on Tuesday. He claimed that the Independents could take a stand on and express their views as it was not aligned to any political organisation. “We have expressed solidarity with the farmers’ agitation. We have also supported the movement against the Citizenship Amendment Act,” Mr. Thomas said. The Independents are also showcasing their work done in the past for a re-election to the office. The SFI, however, calls this apolitical, anti-Left jugglery of words. “They are feeding the students with fear about politics, saying it is all about violence. Also, an insider versus outsider binary is being created to claim that mainstream students organisations are controlled by others,” K.K. Danish Rahman, the SFI’s chairperson candidate, said. He alleged that the students union was yet to address issues on the campus such as waste disposal, stray dog menace, and the lack of hostel facilities for first-year undergraduate students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vote-seeking-at-a-fever-pitch-in-medical-college/article34314709.ece
14 April 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Vigilance to continue probe against Shaji||The Kozhikode Vigilance Inquiry Commissioner and Special Judge on Tuesday posted to April 23 a petition filed by social worker and lawyer M.R. Hareesh seeking the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) to take up a case against Indian Union Muslim League legislator K.M. Shaji for allegedly amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income. However, the petition has now become infructuous as the VACB has already registered a case against Mr. Shaji under Section 13 (criminal misconduct by a public servant) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 13 (attachment and forfeiture of property) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Amendment) Act. The case was registered based on a preliminary report the VACB had submitted in the court earlier. Meanwhile, the raids carried out on the residential premises of Mr. Shaji concluded on Tuesday evening. The raids were led by VACB Superintendent of Police S. Sasidharan from Monday morning. Sources said the VACB had seized Rs. 47,35,500 from his house in Kannur and about 60 sovereigns of gold ornaments from both the houses in Kannur and Kozhikode. The seizure included foreign currencies from different countries that possibly could be leftover denominations for personal collection after foreign travel. The probe would continue in the case, they said. However, Mr. Shaji termed the Vigilance raids at his house as Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s political vendetta against him. The money seized from his house was accounted for and it could not be deposited in the bank because of holidays, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vigilance-to-continue-probe-against-shaji/article34314727.ece
14 April 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Hoteliers, merchants oppose restrictions||As the State government and district administration begin to re-enforce the restrictions in the backdrop of the rising COVID-19 cases, merchant bodies in Kozhikode have started protesting against some which would adversely affect their sales during the festival season. The State committee of the Kerala Hotel and Restaurants’ Association (KHRA) and the Calicut Chamber of Commerce and Industry have alleged that the lack of adherence to restrictions during the election campaigns by political leaders had led to the crisis situation in the State and the common people and the merchants were suffering the consequences. The KHRA has taken offence over the order to close restaurants by 9 p.m, as well as the one to fill only up to 50% of the seating capacity. Pointing out the poor business due to COVID, the association’s president Moideen Kutty Haji and general secretary G. Jayapal said that closing the restaurants by 9 p.m. would lead to the downfall of the sector. The business in restaurants would be lost by 60% during the day due to the Ramadan fasting. They could survive only if they could function at night. The restaurants should be allowed to function till 11 p.m. By following the precautions, they said. Besides, small restaurants with less than 20 seats would be hit by the 50% occupancy rule, they said. “It is strange. People travel in buses without any social distancing. What is the use if they follow the rules only while eating?”, they questioned. The direction to offer food parcels to guests at weddings was also opposed on ground that it would be an insult to guests. The Calicut Chamber of Commerce and Industry objected to restrictions being imposed on merchants alone. “The government should make arrangements for the public to go ahead with normal life by following the protocol, instead of imposing restrictions”, chamber president Zubair Kolakkadan said in a press release. “Be it the beach or mall or movie halls, there should be security personnel to make sure that people follow the protocol”, he said. Street vendors and families too were adversely affected by the restrictions. They had been living in utter poverty for the past one year. “For a year, we did not even attend the funerals of our dear ones. Most merchants have been in a financial crisis over this one year. Restrictions that are not applicable for politicians are being imposed on merchants. It will only result in further disaster,” a meeting of the chamber on Tuesday said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hoteliers-merchants-oppose-restrictions/article34314716.ece

In a letter addressed to Railway Minister Piush Goyal, chairman of the confederation, A.V. Anoop, and working chairman C.E. Chakkunni said that there were major violations of COVID protocol in trains and Railway stations. They alleged that sanitisers or soaps were not provided near the washbasins in the trains, except in air conditioned compartments. Accusing the Railways of being the biggest agent spreading COVID-19 through its unhygienic practices, the duo requested the Minister to ensure that the toilets in the trains were made hygienic and to provide sanitisers, soaps and water in them irrespective of the compartments. The said that sanitising the compartments every hour may help in reducing the spread of the disease.

It alleged that “Brahminicial Hindutva fascist Ballari Reddy should not be allowed to touch his feet on Chakkittappara”. Those who prepared the posters alleged that the local grama panchayat and Pinarayi Vijayan government were “rolling out the red carpet for the mining lobby” to Chakkittappara.

14 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Curbs put a damper on Iftar parties, Vishu get-togethers||Finding affordable public transport seemed to have plagued the Vishu and Ramzan shoppers as COVID-19 regulations on public life kicked in on Tuesday. With the government insisting that stage carriages not admit passengers more than the legal seating capacity, a large fleet of buses remained off the road. A private bus operator said high diesel prices and a low number of passengers had made operations untenable. The restriction on allowing passengers to travel standing on buses had hurt operators financially. The scarcity of buses had caused shoppers to hire autorickshaws, often at higher than the legally permissible fare. The reintroduction of nominal pandemic control measures did not douse the spirit of the festival season. However, it appeared to burn a hole in the pockets of many. The new set of regulations issued by the State government to flatten the rising curve of COVID-19 infections put a damper on Iftar parties and Vishu get-togethers. The government had limited public events to two hours. The police fanned out across the State and proactively imposed the mask mandate and ensured social distancing in public spaces. However, the law enforcement did not slap any fines and limited themselves to counselling travellers. Hotels put on notice Municipal authorities issued notices to hotels requesting them to limit indoor dining to less than half the seating capacity. Customers should sit socially distanced and restaurants down shutters at 9 p.m. The new time constraint seemed not to apply to bars, which closed as usual at 11 p.m. Open-air and indoor gatherings should not number more than 200 and 100 attendees respectively. The government has warned against communal feasting and suggested that organisers supply guests with parcel meals instead. Supermarkets should not hold retail events that tend to attract large crowds. "Hotels and restaurants should promote takeaways and home delivery, instead of in-house dining as people tend to crowd in such public dining settings and remove their masks. Religious leaders and district authorities may be persuaded to avoid community gatherings when customary fasting is broken during evenings in the month of Ramzan," an order said. "Crowding must be controlled effectively and meetings shall be held online as far as possible... e-Sanjeevani of the Health Department should be popularised so that crowding in OP wards is avoided," the order said. The government has insisted that participants in group events must produce RT-PCR and RT-LAMP reports of tests conducted within the last 72 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/curbs-put-a-damper-on-iftar-parties-vishu-get-togethers/article34314804.ece
14 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||UDF sees political win in Jaleel’s quitting||The United Democratic Front (UDF) on Tuesday seemed to portray Higher Education Minister K. T. Jaleel’s high-profile departure from the Pinarayi Vijayan Cabinet as a political win for the Congress-led opposition. In contrast, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) seemed gratified that the Kerala Lok Ayukta order damning Dr. Jaleel for nepotism did not dent its election campaign. Moreover, it reportedly felt that the potentially damaging finding had manifested as a belated and arguably unavailing post-poll victory for the UDF. Dr. Jaleel’s resignation was arguably of little consequence for the LDF in the post-election scenario. However, the Congress, Indian Union Muslim League and BJP have raised a subsidiary charge. They have accused Mr. Vijayan of endorsing Dr. Jaleel’s ‘wrongdoing’ in writing. Dr. Jaleel, an LDF Independent, was widely reckoned as the poster boy and pointman for the ruling front’s ambitious forays into the overwhelmingly pro-UDF Muslim community in North Kerala. The IUML had long reckoned him a thorn in its side. It had, not surprisingly, spearheaded the Lok Ayukta case against Dr. Jaleel. By some accounts, behind-the-scenes political drama marked Dr. Jaleel’s resignation. The LDF initially ‘felt’ the government had till July to act on the Lok Ayukta’s finding. In the meantime, Dr. Jaleel could get relief against the damning decree from the High Court. With the Congress and BJP clamouring for his resignation, the LDF reportedly had a rethink. It indicated that public accountability was the LDF’s central electioneering plank. The CPI also dug its heels on the point. The LDF drew Dr. Jaleel’s attention to the precedent set by Industries Minister E. P. Jayarajan and the late NCP leader and Transport Minister Thomas Chandy. Both had resigned in the wake of adverse remarks from the judiciary. So did Transport Minister A. K. Saseendran after a television channel accused him of engaging a woman in a lewd telephonic conversation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-sees-political-win-in-jaleels-quitting/article34314797.ece
14 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Half of city’s eateries unlicensed||Over half of the food business operators in the city are outside the ambit of the food safety licensing regime, a survey conducted by the Commissionerate of Food Safety has found. Food safety officials found a majority of the 5,200-odd eateries in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation limits did not possess the licence and registration mandated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) rules. The anomaly came to light during a survey undertaken in the city as part of the nationwide ‘Eat Right Challenge’ that is spearheaded by the FSSAI. The survey, which was conducted across the Thiruvananthapuram, Kazhakuttam, Vattiyurkavu and Nemom food safety circles through Kudumbashree workers, incorporated data collected from hotels, restaurants, bakeries, tea stalls, wayside eateries ( thattukadas ), casual food business operators and vendors of fish and other products. According to Alex K. Isaac, Assistant Food Safety Commissioner, Thiruvananthapuram, the violators were mostly the casual food providers who constituted a major portion of the food business in the city. The lack of awareness regarding the licensing system was found to have led to the low licence coverage. Awareness programmes Besides awareness programmes, special licence and registration drives will be held across the city to ensure all food providers were brought under the food safety system. Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode cities and Kasaragod district were selected by the FSSAI’s Eat Right Challenge from the State. As many as 150 cities and districts have been provided seed funding of Rs. 5 lakh for participating in the drive aimed at strengthening food safety and to provide healthy food options for the customers. As part of the challenge, food safety officials have also been collecting random surveillance samples of seven food commodities, viz., milk, water, edible oil, jaggery, rice, pulses and fish from shops and markets in the city. Around 500 out of the targeted 700 samples have been collected and sent for tests to detect food adulteration and other quality hazards. Another 60 statutory samples – 15 samples each from the four circles – will also be collected and legal action will be initiated against the food business operators if they fail the quality tests. Pooja Ravindran, district nodal officer for food safety, said the Eat Right Campus, another component of the FSSAI-run programme, has been launched in the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College where its six canteens were being audited. Following a training for the canteen staff, a third-party audit will be undertaken by an independent agency. Water samples have also been collected from the campus. Discussions Discussions were under way to conduct the programme at the Poojappura Central Prison that runs a main kitchen for its inmates and staff as well as another for its ‘Food for Freedom’ endeavour. There is also a proposal to bring a major private hospital having considerable patient inflow under the ambit of the programme.

With 196 patients recovering from the illness, the number of active cases was 4,665. The pandemic has so far claimed 901 lives. Two more deaths – those of two men, aged 67 and 60 – were attributed to the disease on the day. The case fatality ratio stood at 0.8, much higher than in Kannur (0.54) and Alappuzha (0.5) that trailed Thiruvananthapuram. The district administration placed 1,613 people under quarantine during the last 24 hours, while 1,100 others were permitted to conclude quarantine. There were currently 19,416 people who are undergoing quarantine in various parts of the district. Containment zones District Collector Navjot Khosa declared new containment zones in Meennilam, Attukal and Karikkuzhy wards in Panavoor grama panchayats, Kanjirammoodu-Pazhayakacherinada Road and Choozha – Peezhumoodu Puthenpally areas in Aryanad grama panchayat, and Thuruthy ward in Tholicode grama panchayat that have been witnessing a surge in COVID-19 cases. The residents of these areas will not be permitted to exit the containment zones under any circumstances except for emergency purposes. Vaccination As many as 6,42,873 doses of the COVID-19 cases vaccines have been administered in the district thus far. While 5,77,353 people received the first shot, 65,520 have been given the second jab to complete the vaccination process. While health workers received 65,412 doses, other beneficiaries include other front-line workers (13,615 doses), polling officials (35,080 doses) and others including those aged above 45 years (4,63,246 doses). The vaccination centre that functioned at the MSK Nagar community hall under the Chala Urban Primary Health centre has been shifted to the Government Lower Primary School, Kuriathy, for the convenience of the public. Violations The City police intensified their crackdown on COVID-19 violations by initiating legal action against 459 people. Among them, 159 people were booked under provisions of Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance 2020. Another 286 people were booked for failing to wear masks, while eight persons were charged for violating physical distancing norms. The violators were cumulatively fined Rs. 1.42 lakh. Action was also taken against two commercial establishments and four public transport buses.

14 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Now, ‘Hello World’ from Samagra for English learning||A 10-second advertisement trying to pitch choco biscuits as a perfect tea partner, a recipe for a special ‘laddu’ made of broken wheat, an imagined conversation between a sparrow and a squirrel... students in the State are trying their hand at newer things, all in English, as part of the Hello World programme of the Samagra Shiksha, Kerala. Hello World is an adaptation of the Hello English programme of the Samagra Shiksha to suit the online mode of education against the backdrop of COVID-19. Hello World, for students till Class 7, comprises digital interactive learning material that is entertaining and facilitates English learning. Children are sent webpages in PDF format in which audio-video inputs and directions are embedded and linked to YouTube. One click and they can view stories, songs, presentations, and so on and follow up with activities aimed at language enhancement. Anaswara R.S., a class 7 student of GHS, Avanavanchery, Attingal, has received four activities so far through the webpage. One was a set of visuals about a tiger and a man using which she had to write a story and make a video. She also wrote the theme and message for a short film that had no audio support. Her latest activity requires her to write about a funny incident in her life. All the activities are fun and interesting, says Anaswara. Most importantly, she feels she can write a story in English quicker than she could, and think and speak in English too. “My English has improved. I’m awaiting more activities.”  Webpage activity As only one webpage activity is given to students a week, students have the flexibility to complete it as and when they get access to a device. This is especially beneficial in families with working parents. In fact, YouTube viewership of the materials is maximum between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m., says C. Radhakrishnan, State Programme Manager (Innovations), Samagra Shiksha, Kerala. The activities are inherently flexible too. A couple of days may be needed for preparatory activities, and then comes the shooting or recording part, thus keeping the students engaged for the week. For instance, if students are to shoot the making of a dish, they need to fix the recipe, ascertain the name of the ingredients in English, look websites or other resources with such content, ready a script for the preparation of the dish, and decide the presentation before the actual video can be made. In the process, the children not only improve their language, but also pick up skills such as research and editing. Parental involvement Parental involvement is another positive aspect. As a result, both self-learning and supported learning occur simultaneously at home. At the same time, it does not feel like a task thrust upon the students; children feel motivated to do the activities. They also learn from watching other students’ activities, says Mr. Radharkrishnan. Hello World will continue in May too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hello-world-from-samagra-for-english-learning/article34314710.ece
14 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSEB to set up sub-centres for better service delivery||The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is creating sub-centres under electrical section offices for guaranteeing efficiency and better service delivery in regions with a large number of consumers. In a first for the KSEB, a proposal to open the sub-centres under 11 section offices has been cleared by the full-time directors of the State-run power utility. Pitched as a low-cost solution, the concept primarily seeks to address issues linked to power supply failure within the time-frames set down in the Standards of Performance for service delivery prescribed by the Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission. Meeting consumer expectations aside, opening a sub-centre is much more cost-effective for the KSEB than opening a brand new electrical section office with all the trappings and staff. Operating under the section office and Assistant Engineer concerned, the sub- centre will have a break-down unit with vehicle and equipment to attend to power interruptions. It will be manned by staff redeployed from other units. At present, the KSEB has roughly 775 electrical section offices across the State serving 1.3 crore consumers. “The service expectation of the consumers has increased and it is often found difficult to cater to consumer requirements if the section offices have a very high consumer strength and/or vast area,” the KSEB has noted. To handle supply failure In creating the sub-centres, the power utility has responded to an increasing demand for new section offices or bifurcating existing ones to effectively handle supply failure issues, N.S. Pillai, chairman and managing director, KSEB, said. “We have sections which cater to 7,000 or 8,000 consumers, and others that have 30,000-32,000 consumers under them. Notwithstanding the difference in consumer numbers, the staff patterns of sections are more or less similar. But opening a new section demands a huge commitment from the KSEB in terms of money, new buildings and manpower. That said, We also need to provide 24x7 service. Sub-centres are an ideal solution to the problem,” Mr. Pillai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kseb-sub-centres-for-better-service-delivery/article34314771.ece
14 April 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||IMD begins issuing localised forecast||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has begun issuing block-level weather forecast in the State as part of introducing weather alerts that are more localised. The IMD Meteorological Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, issues the forecast for a five-day period. A typical block-level forecast covers the rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, humidity, wind speed and direction and cloud cover for the next five days. Kerala regions aside, the IMD is providing the forecasts for Kavaratti, Agatti, Amini, Andrott, Chetlat, Kadmat, Kalpeni, Kiltan and Minicoy in the Lakshadweep Islands. District level too The weather agency is also working on a proposal for issuing ‘impact-based’ forecasts at the district level, K. Santhosh, Director, IMD Meteorological Centre, told The Hindu . The IMD had for the first time introduced impact-based forecasts for Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi cities in 2020. An impact-based forecast for heavy rainfall carries such details as realised weather, a three-hour forecast and the ‘impact’ — such as waterlogging on major roads, uprooting of trees and floods. Typically, the forecast is accompanied by suggestions on precautionary measures. At present, the IMD has 30 automatic weather stations (AWS) and 29 automatic rain gauges (ARG) in Kerala. In 2020, the IMD had come in for criticism from the State for being ill-equipped to provide localised alerts. More AWS Since then, it has added more AWS to the list in Kerala. But the effort has also been hit by delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that some of the sites identified for the purpose have not met the IMD standards.

While the COVID-19 pandemic forced classes to go digital the entire year, it was felt that there should be a scientific analysis of each student’s academic level through an evaluation of outcomes of the First Bell classes and its follow-up activities so that his/ her strong points and limitations could be understood. The evaluation will be held in two ways – continuous evaluation and year-end evaluation. Children will be given grades depending on participation in academic activities, unit reviews, products or write-ups prepared by them, and the assignments completed as part of continuous evaluation. For the year-end evaluation, special activity cards or academic excellence records will be made available by block resource centres through head teachers to the students. The cards will be in book form, and each student has to complete the activities. The best five of these will be graded or scored. The cards have to be returned to schools by May 10 and evaluated by teachers. Grades can be given on the basis of continuous evaluation and year-end evaluation. The subject council for each subject in a school or the school resource group should meet to decide the scoring for the evaluation. A record of the grades should be kept by teachers so that necessary academic support can be provided to them. The school PTA executive or monitoring committees should ensure that the activity cards reach each student. The directives from the Director of General Education to all deputy directors of education, district education officers, Samagra Shiksha coordinators and so on come in the wake of the SCERT Director’s directives on the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/year-end-evaluation-for-students-up-to-class-9/article34315136.ece

Ravindranath. Special powers Acting on a petition by Mr. Ravindranath, commission chairperson Antony Dominic directed the SDM to use the special powers vested in him/her to cut the trees in front of the house of the vocalist-composer on Moolayil Lane, Sasthamangalam. The move comes in the wake of the failure of the Public Works Department (PWD) to take effective steps to cut the trees despite a commission directive. The commission said it was imperative to prevent the possible loss of life and property, and it was not right for the petitioner to wait further to avoid the threat. The PWD informed the commission that it had written to the Social Forestry wing seeking permission to cut the trees, and once that was received, the trees could be cut. The commission asked the SDM to inform it of the steps taken in this connection by May 15. Hearing The case will be heard again on May 20, a statement here said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shrc-directive-to-cut-trees-posing-danger/article34315175.ece

Swapna is now housed at the women’s prison at Attakulangara in Thiruvananthapuram. The CB submitted on Tuesday that it wanted to interrogate Swapna in connection with an audio clip in which she reportedly stated that the officials of the Enforcement Directorate had forced her to give statements implicating the Chief Minister and others in the gold smuggling case. The agency had also booked a case to probe the statement of Sandeep Nair, another accused in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, that P. Radhakrishnan, Deputy Director of the ED, had allegedly forced him to give statements against the Chief Minister and other prominent persons in the smuggling case. However, the ED contended that the Principal Sessions Court shall consider the case only after April 16, the day on which the Kerala High Court is expected to pass an order on its application to quash the FIR booked by the CB against its official. The Principal Sessions court has posted the case for April 16. NIA, ED lock horns Meanwhile, the ED has approached the Special Judge of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) with a prayer that the case related to the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, which was booked by the NIA, be transferred to the Principal Sessions Court. The ED contended that the NIA case pertained to money laundering, which came under the purview of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. However, the NIA argued that its cases have to be essentially tried in the Special Court itself. The NIA court directed the lawyers of both the NIA and the ED to argue the case through physical hearing. Remand extended The Economic Offences Court, Ernakulam, extended the remand of six accused in the gold smuggling case, including Swapna, Sandeep, and Sarith, for 14 days.

Both the YSR Congress Party and the Telugu Desam Party backed the BJP’s “anti-people” policies in Parliament, he charged. The ruling YSR Congress Party, which was given 22 MP seats in the 2019 elections going by its promise to achieve Special Category Status(SCS) to the State, neither articulated the issues concerning the constituencies nor raised in Parliament the injustice meted out to the State by the BJP-led NDA government, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-alone-can-protect-aps-interests/article34314866.ece
14 April 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu blames YSRCP for stone-throwing incident||Telugu Desam Party national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday asserted that none could harm him as he had the blessings of Lord Venkateswara. As the campaign for the Tirupati Lok Sabha byelection hotted up, he blamed the ruling YSR Congress Party for the stone-throwing incident in Tirupati on Monday.“'I have been targeted by tainted Ministers in the YSRCP Government who feared poll debacle,” he alleged. Election rally Addressing an election rally in Gudur town in SPSR Nellore district, he recalled that with the blessings of Lord Venkateswara he had survived an assassination bid by Left wing extremists when he was Chief Minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh. Taking strong objection to the way the police investigated the case, he said instead of nabbing the culprits, police had served notice on him. “I am astonished at the way the probe is being conducted in a case relating to a person who has been Chief Minister for 14 years,” he said. “'Stones were rained at us. Some sustained bleeding injuries. Despite all this, police are asking for evidence,” he lamented, adding that he would not be cowed down by such attacks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-blames-ysrcp-for-stone-throwing-incident/article34314867.ece

Social gatherings were missing as people preferred to celebrate the festival at home. As a result the arterial roads, including Trunk road and Kurnool road, wore a deserted look. Those who did step out of the house to visit temples were seen with facemasks. Devotees offered prayers at the historic Ganga Parvati Samedha Parameswara temple at Chennakeshavapeta and Santhepeta Saibaba temple.  The customary ‘Panchanga Sravanam’ was done away with in most temples. However, people did not miss the almanac reading thanks to live-streaming of the event on the social media and television channels. Vedic priest Matampalli Dakshinamurthy appealed to people to fully adhere to COVID-19 protocols while offering prayers to Lord Siva on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/roads-wear-deserted-look-with-few-stepping-out/article34314863.ece

14 April 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jaleel resigns after Lok Ayukta rap||Minister for Higher Education and Minority Welfare K.T. Jaleel on Tuesday resigned after the Lok Ayukta found him guilty of nepotism. Governor Arif Mohammed Khan accepted Dr. Jaleel’s resignation which was forwarded to him by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. In a damning pronouncement last week, the forum said Dr. Jaleel had lobbied the Kerala State Minority Welfare Corporation (KSMWC) to appoint his relative as general manager. Dr. Jaleel had tailored the top job specifications to suit his relatives academic credentials and ensured none else applied for the job by concealing the opening, the Lok Ayukta said. It decreed that Dr. Jaleel should not continue in the Cabinet. Dr. Jaleel had displayed a marked “lack of integrity” as Minister. His action amounted to “abuse of power, favouritism, nepotism and violation of oath of office,” the Lok Ayukta said. The forum conveyed its finding to Mr. Vijayan, the competent authority, for appropriate action, on Monday. The Congress and the BJP had clamoured for Dr. Jaleel’s exit. Facebook post In a Facebook post, Dr. Jaleel said he was the victim of a “right wing” media witch-hunt. Political opponents had prompted the persecution. Dr. Jaleel’s post appeared to primarily target Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leaders by obliquely referring to charges against them. CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said Dr. Jaleel had upheld political decorum. In contrast, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and former Excise Minister K. Babu had clung to power despite drawing adverse verdicts from the judiciary. Earlier, Dr. Jaleel met CPI(M) leaders. They reportedly backed his right to move the High Court. However, the party reminded Dr. Jaleel that political propriety demanded he relinquishes his post without waiting for relief from the court. Oppn. demand Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Dr. Jaleel had no recourse but to resign. There was nothing ethical or sacrificial in his quitting office. The Minister’s exit smacked of desperation and helplessness, Mr. Chennithala said. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan said Mr. Vijayan, who had endorsed Dr. Jaleel’s move to appoint his relative, should also quit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jaleel-resigns-after-lok-ayukta-rap/article34314561.ece

14 April 2021||Thrissur,ANDHRA PRADESH||A whistle which draws motorists to hotel||Those who pass through Paliyekkara Toll Plaza on NH 544 cannot miss a perky security person of a nearby hotel, who continuously whistles to invite attention of the motorists. With swift movements and the energy of a sportsman, this ‘security person with an attitude’ is currently a sensation on social media. He runs with the vehicle to help the driver to park properly. Then he turns to help an old lady cross the busy National Highway. With an athletic body that towers over 6 feet, Justine shows no semblance of a typical security person. “I was a crazy football player once. You won’t believe, I have even played a game in Japan,” says Justine with his big smile. Hailing from a financially poor family at Kuzhikkattussery, near Mala, Justine was sent as a helper at an orphanage under the Thrissur archdiocese, after he dropped out from the school after Class 8. When a team of children from the orphanage was sent to play a football match in Japan by some voluntary organisation, Justine too got an opportunity to be part of that team. “We even won the match. The media came home then,” says Justine. However in the course of time, he had to leave football to eke out a living doing small jobs, including as a security person at many places. He got his current job after his brisk work as security person at some other place caught the eye of the management of ‘Trichur Gate’, the restaurant where he works. Justine works from 10. 30 a.m. to 11 p.m. And does he get tired of this continuous whistling? “No, no.... They are paying me, give me accommodation, and food as well. I am totally satisfied,” says the 40-year-old Justine, who is planning to get married soon. Acting in films He has even received offers to act in films. “Recently, an actor who was in the movie Ann Maria Kalippilanu (he doesn’t know her name) invited me to act in her next film. If I am fortunate, you can see me on the silver screen.” Justine has no complaints in life. He is friendly with everyone around, and lavishes compliments on the visitors to the hotel. “Sir, please don’t remove your beard, even if your wife demands. It’s the secret of your beauty,” he was heard telling a young man.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-whistle-which-draws-motorists-to-hotel/article34314559.ece

People above the age of 45 should bring vaccination certificates and those below the age of 45 should carry COVID-19 negative certificates. Though the district administration has not issued any official notification, Devaswom representatives, who attended a meeting on Tuesday, told mediapersons that such restrictions would be imposed in the wake of a spurt in COVID-19 cases. Tight security  The Pooram will be held under tight police security. Children will not be allowed to attend the celebrations. The police will conduct inspection at various points. As many as 690 people tested positive for COVID-19 in the district on Tuesday while 186 people recovered from the disease. There are 3,423 active cases in the district. So far 1,08,487 cases have been reported in the district. Meanwhile, the Kerala Sastra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP) has warned of a possible surge in the pandemic if crowds at the Pooram are not restricted. In a letter, it urged the government to take appropriate decisions to avoid crowding of people for Pooram celebrations. It also urged the people to cooperate with the decision of the government. “People should keep vigil against the spread of the pandemic while celebrating the Pooram this time. Lack of vigil is the reason for the second wave of COVID-19. Crowding of people without wearing masks was common during the Assembly election campaign, which resulted in the rise in positivity rate,” the KSSP said.  Pooram will be held under tight police security.

Chandrababu Naidu on Monday evening. Clarifying on the issue along with Chittoor Superintendent of Police Ch. Venkata Appala Naidu, Anantapur Range DIG Kanthi Rana Tata told the media here on Tuesday that the issue had surfaced when a TDP worker complained to Mr. Naidu of being hit by a stone, followed by two more activists. “We inspected the main vehicles and those in the convoy, scanned the CCTV footage around the venue and also spoke to the NSG security personnel of Mr. Naidu. We are yet to get any concrete evidence over the incident,” Mr. Tata said.

14 April 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP blames YSRCP, TDP for backwardness in Rayalaseema||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the YSR Congress Party and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) of neglecting the Rayalaseema region, saying that the successive governments of the parties in the State are reponsible for the ‘perennial backwardness’ of the region. Addressing the media as part of his campaign for the byelctions to the Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency here on Tuesday, BJP State president Somu Veerraju said that the Rayalaseema region had become synonymous to drought and famine-like conditions. “Who is responsible for this? TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy should share the blame,” he told the media. Despite belonging to the region, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Mr. Naidu have let down the people by consistently ignoring the local aspirations, he added. Referring to the Polavaram irrigation project, the BJP State president said that the Centre had extended financial support to the tune of Rs. 15,000 crore after the works began during the TDP regime in 2017. “Why are the decades-old Galeru Nagari, Handri Neeva and Telugu Ganga projects still unfinished, if not for the official apathy of the successive regimes?” he asked. Earlier in the day, Mr. Veerraju offered prayers at Thathayagunta Gangammatemple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-blames-ysrcp-tdp-governments-for-backwardness-in-rayalaseema/article34314884.ece
14 April 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Modi regime wreaked havoc on nation’s economy, says Congress||Former member of the Rajya Sabha and senior Congress leader J.D. Seelam has accused the Narendra Modi regime at the Centre of having destroyed the nation’s economy with flawed policies. Mr. Seelam toured Srikalahasti and Satyavedu Assembly segments coming under the Tirupati (SC) Lok Sabha constituency on Tuesday along with PCC member Penubala Chandrasekhar, as part of his campaign for party candidate Chinta Mohan, when he made the observation. He charged the Centre with tampering with the independent and autonomous nature of constitutional bodies, apart from making a financial mess with its privatisation policy. “The demonetisation and the privatisation spree is only for the party’s personal gain,” he said, comparing the developmental projects taken up during the Congress regimes in the form of irrigation projects, railways, nationalisation of banks and farmers’ welfare. The attempt to privatise the Vizag Steel Plant is the last straw and the people should revolt against this regime, he said. While the Congress had made several promises to the State during its ‘reorganisation’, the TDP reduced them to ‘bifurcation’ promises by siding with the BJP government at the Centre, thus doing injustice to the State, Mr. Seelam alleged, even while flaying the YSRCP regime of having failed to press for the Special Category Status (SCS) issue with the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/modi-regime-wreaked-havoc-on-nations-economy-says-congress/article34314891.ece

Things started falling in place after Mr. Ramachandra Reddy evinced personal interest to get the temple renovated last year. “The demand for renovating this temple is heard from the days when I was a student of Sri Venkateswara university.

14 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Minister urges Centre not to shift CBSE centre from Kakinada||Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh has requested the Centre to drop the proposal to shift the Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) Centre of Excellence (CoE) from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Chennai. In a letter addressed to the Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, Mr. Suresh wanted the Central government to direct the Chairman, CBSE, New Delhi, to cancel the orders of shifting of the CoE to Chennai and withdraw the transfer order of the staff. “The move will hamper the efforts to introduce the CBSE syllabus in all schools in the State,” said Mr. Suresh. Established in 2014, the CBSE Centre of Excellence conducts 20 classes every month for a batch of 50 teachers from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, thus helping raise the standards of 1,000 teachers. A similar move in the past to shift the centre to either Chennai or Bengaluru was stalled by the timely intervention of the Central Education Department. The reason being given for the proposed shift of the centre is that there is no air connectivity for the Delhi officers to reach Kakinada. “Andhra Pradesh is in the forefront in bringing in reforms in the education sector with an aim to raise the quality of teaching and make education accessible to all. The State government has taken a policy decision to introduce CBSE syllabus in all schools from the 2021-22 academic year,” the Minister pointed out. Training of teachers A delegation of officials from the State School Education Department recently met the CBSE authorities in New Delhi and discussed the modalities and sought their cooperation to introduce the CBSE syllabus in the government schools in Andhra Pradesh. At this juncture, the retention of CoE is a dire need for training the teachers, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/minister-urges-centre-not-to-shift-cbse-centre-from-kakinada/article34314896.ece
14 April 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Do swarms of caddisflies in city hint at something?||Caddisflies swarm the flyover near the Police Control Room (PCR), and the bridges on the canals that pass through the city every evening and night. They come in groups and are attracted to light. Road users, particularly motorcyclists, are finding it difficult to drive their two-wheelers on the flyover and the adjacent areas. The problem is no different on the bridges on Ryves Canal, Eluru and Bandar canals. As the caddisflies are in good numbers and move closely together, the visibility of motorcyclists has been affected sometimes and they have to slowly push through to cross these stretches. The caddisflies blanket the pavements and roads so thoroughly that sometimes it looks like a white paint. Authorities ‘clueless’ According to information, the caddisflies, which are insects with aquatic larvae, have emerged in huge numbers by the eastern canal, and other canals in the city. The civic authorities, however, have not taken any steps to control their population. In fact, the authorities are ‘clueless’ and could not take up any special drives to disinfect the canals, which is said to be one of the possible reasons for the caddisfly problem. K. Praveen Kumar, an entomologist who works with Bayer, says that the caddisflies are found near water bodies or places where stagnant water is found. Certain species are also aggravated due to ecological imbalances, so that could also be a possible reason. Usually the flies are not harmful to people. They tend to form swarms of large numbers and are attracted towards light, he says. Problems in ecosystem The caddisflies are important indicator species, signalling to scientists that an ecosystem has problems. There are species that are more tolerant to pollution and those that are less tolerant not only to pollution but also to water level changes. Some survive downstream of dams very well, others are totally excluded, opines an entomologist at the National Institute of Plant Management, who did not want to be quoted. The entomologists say that caddisflies are useful as bioindicators since some are sensitive to water pollution and some species indicate undisturbed habitat, and some indicate degraded habitat. A field assessment is necessary to arrive at the conclusion regarding the caddisflies that swarm the bridges and roads in the city, they opine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/do-swarms-of-caddisflies-in-vijayawada-hint-at-something/article34314859.ece

Mr. Kalidas was the chief guest for a seminar on Reservations and Social Justice organised by the Forum of SC and ST Employees’ Associations representing employee outfits from 20 government departments including railways, telecom, postal, commercial taxes, revenue and medical and health. The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights leader and State general secretary of Dalit Bahujan Shramik Union P.

Forum convener Rettangi Sankara Rao expressed concern over the harassment being meted out to the staff of the downtrodden sections in various government offices. The leaders passed a resolution to send messages through social media platforms to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the continuation of reservations in government sector and their implementation in private sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/quota-needed-to-minimise-social-imbalances-forum/article34315160.ece

14 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||90% property tax collection from ULBs despite pandemic||Municipal corporations and municipalities across Telangana have collected 90% of the property tax on demand from 20-odd lakh dwellings despite the pandemic in the last financial year of 2020-21 ending March this year. The 141 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), other than GHMC, had collected about Rs. 495 crore and another Rs. 226 crore of arrears, making for a total of over Rs. 720 crore. The precise demand for the 20,24,315 properties has been Rs. 531 crore with arrears coming to Rs. 268 crore or a total of about Rs. 799 crore, said Director of Municipal Administration (DMA) N. Satyanrayana on Monday. While nine, albeit smaller, municipalities, have registered a cent per cent property tax collection, even mopping up the arrears, 99 ULBs collected property tax of 90% of the demand or more.  The tax collection is considerably more than the previous fiscal (2019-20) when Rs. 561 crore was collected from the overall demand of Rs. 650 crore or at the rate of 86.3%. Improvement in tax collection was made possible due to formation of special teams, identifying chronic defaulters and allowing citizens to use multiple methods along with digital means to pay up, he said. Among the municipalities which registered cent per cent collections are Korutla (Karimnagar) with 15,497 dwellings where the entire demand of Rs. 3.55 crore was collected. Among others are Metpalli, also in Karimnagar, with 11,766 dwellings where the demand was raised for about Rs. 2.24 crore plus Rs. 0.27 crore in arrears. Sircilla with 21,822 dwellings and demand raised for Rs. 4.01 crore and arreas of Rs. 0.30 crore, Rs. 4.32 crore was collected; Kothagudem in Bhadradri-Kothgudem has 18,059 dwellings and demand was raised for Rs. 4.22 crore plus Rs. 0.39 crore in arrears and a total amount of Rs. 4.61 crore was collected. Palvancha with 15,889 properties raised a demand for Rs. 3.69 crore plus Rs. 0.22 crore and Rs. 3.92 crore was collected. Khanapur in Adilabad has 6,300 properties and demand was raised for Rs. 2.86 crore including Rs. 0.93 lakh and Rs. 3.8 crore was collected. Chityal in Suryapet with 3,616 properties had demand raised for Rs. 0.58 crore including Rs. 0.31 crore in arreas, and Rs. 0.89 crore was collected. Dubbaka in Nalgonda with 5,418 properties raised a demand for Rs. 0.86 crore plus Rs. 0.30 crore in arrears to collect Rs. 1.16 crore. There were other ULBs which collected 98% of the tax on demand like Peddapalli, Khammam, Manuguru, Yellandu, Nrmal, Tandur, Vikarabad, Parigi, Gundlapochampally, Bodhan, Kamareddy, Bhongir, Suryapet, Huzurnagar, Nalgonda, Miryalguda, Gajwel, Sangareddy, Toopran and Nagarkurnool. Low collection ULBs with relatively poor collection in comparison to the tune of 56-97% include Kothakota, Chandur, Warangal, Shankarpally, Bandlaguda Jagir, Nizampet, Alair and Devarkonda. The DMA has notified municipal commissioners to mop up tax collection for this year under the ‘early bird’ scheme with 5% discount till April-end.  Improvement in tax collection was made possible due to formation of special teams, identifying chronic defaulters and allowing citizens to use multiple methods to pay up. N.

14 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Sandstone from Agra to Jaipur quarries for new secretariat||The State government and construction agency Shapoorji Pallonji Group has zeroed in on quarries located between Agra and Jaipur for procuring pink/red sandstone that is proposed to be used in the construction of the new secretariat complex. The Roads and Buildings department has shown the samples of the sandstone procured from these quarries to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao when he visited the construction site during the recent budget session of the legislature. Mr. KCR is understood to have examined the samples and gave his nod to the samples drawn from three major quarries between Agra and Jaipur. Mr. Rao, according to officials, examined the varieties that included red, beige, natural beige and other models of the sandstone, put for display at the construction site. “These were models procured from three quarries. We have asked the construction firm to negotiate with the quarry owners for supply of sandstone. An agreement will be reached once the contractors finalise the quantum of sandstone that will be required for the integrated complex,” a senior official told The Hindu . The development follows the visit of a delegation of R&B officials and representatives of the contracting firm headed by R&B Minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy to New Delhi. They visited Parliament complex, Rashtrapati Bhavan, North and South blocks and other structures where pink/red sandstone was extensively used. The delegation also examined the designs of these structures to explore the possibility of integrating them with the design approved for the construction of the Secretariat. Meanwhile, work on the new integrated complex has gathered pace with a major chunk of work pertaining to pillars, footwalls and other structures below ground level been completed. The firm had been given one year deadline for the completion of the more than Rs. 600 crore project for which work started in the third week of November. With the Chief Minister making it clear that steps should be taken for creation of wide inner roads, lawns with flower plants and construction of Dholpur stone-laden fountains, officials are constantly supervising works to ensure that the construction firm take adequate care to put all these instructions in place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sandstone-from-quarries-of-agra-to-jaipur-for-secretariat/article34315107.ece
14 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Pandemic dashes powerlifter’s hope||The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has indefinitely put on hold the dreams and aspirations of powerlifter Inturi Rekha of Sangareddy district. The 32-year-old mother of three girls, who is struggling to find a decent job to take care of her family, had her hopes pinned on competing in the Powerlifting World Championship in Krygystan this month-end. Had she managed to win a medal, she would have been eligible for a post in the Postal department under sports quota. ‘Strong woman’ “Now, with the sports calendar looking uncertain again, I am not sure when the championship will be held. I had won gold in the 72-kg category and adjudged ‘strong woman’ in the last Nationals in Jamshedpur,” says Rekha, who is one among six from the State to be named for the Worlds. With help from Arakapudi Foundation and collecting money from well-wishers, the powerlifter was training hard and was intensely focussed on making a mark in the Worlds. “Even a top-three finish there would have made me eligible for any post in the Postal department where the age limit for recruitment under sports quota is 35 years,” she says. Raising funds Like weightlifters, powerlifters also face the major challenge in raising funds to take care of their expensive diet, points out Rekha, who even lost her job as a gym trainer because of the pandemic which forced many fitness centres to close down. “Life has become miserable and honestly, I never thought it would reach such a terrible point,” says the former ‘Strongwoman’ of All India Universities meet coached by Sumit Badra. “Being an athlete from a low-profile discipline and with no godfathers to back me, I am finding it extremely difficult to tap any sponsor. Yes, I do wonder whether I sacrificed everything in my life to face this kind of a scenario,” says the powerlifter as she now stares at an uncertain future despite years of hard work.  Being an athlete from a low-profile discipline and with no godfathers, I am finding it extremely difficult to tap any sponsor.

14 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Governor, CM lead people in welcoming Plavanama Ugadi||The State welcomed the new Telugu year Plava, expected to be smooth sailing for people in different walks of life, on Tuesday. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and several Ministers participated in the Ugadi celebrations and greeted the people on the occasion. Endowments Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy attended the Panchanga Sravanam by B. Santosh Kumar at the Endowments office this morning. The Governor, who took part in the Ugadi celebrations, got the traditional Ugadi Pachadi prepared and served it to the guests. She took care to ensure preparation of other traditional dishes made of jaggery to treat the Raj Bhavan ‘pariwar’ and few guests. She said Plava signified the year of knowledge and wisdom and hoped that the beginning of the Telugu new year would mark the beginning of the end of COVID-19 pandemic. She extended her wishes to the Telugu people across the globe. The Governor announced assistance of Rs. 8.66 lakh from her discretionary grants towards the nutritional intervention programme for the primitive tribal groups in the State. She also extended financial aid of Rs. 50,000 to self-employed women from her discretionary grants towards the purchase of raw materials for handmade designs by women of Raj Bhavan pariwar. The Governor, moved by the plight of one attendant Bhavani who suffered paralytic stroke recently, extended financial assistance of Rs. 25,000 to her. The Chief Minister conveyed Ugadi greetings to the people and said that as predicted in the Telugu almanac, more importance would be given to flow of water this year, and water for irrigation would be available in abundance. Ugadi was known as the beginning of the agriculture year and an integral part of farmers’ lives as they would start their agricultural operations beginning with the new year. Referring to Ugadi Pachadi, he said people of Telangana who tasted bitterness under the united Andhra Pradesh were now enjoying the sweet fruits under the State’s self-rule. The CM said that during the pandemic times, the State government came to the rescue of farmers and purchased the agriculture produce from them. Proving critics wrong, Telangana ranked first in the country in paddy yield and in terms of extent of land under cultivation. He recalled the spree of initiatives like free power and procurement of agriculture produce by the government launched for farmers and said the schemes instilled confidence among the farming community and brought new hopes for them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/governor-cm-lead-people-in-welcoming-plavanama-ugadi/article34315094.ece
14 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Ramp works at heritage hillock deplored||The rat-rat-rat of pneumatic drill breaks the calm of the day halfway up the Maula Ali hillock. The smooth rock is now pock-marked with holes. Blocks of granite are tossed to one side as workers insert chisels to crack the rock into pieces to build a Rs. 25-crore ramp that will transform the small spiritual shrine. A grey haze of granite dust hangs in the air. “We are restoring the naqqar khana (drum house), arches and other small structures on top of the Maula Ali hill. Once the ramp is completed, we will take up the work of the half-dome that will protect the shrine and will be visible from across the city,” says Syed Nazeer Hasan Abedi of Al Kausar Trust, which is restoring the heritage spiritual site. “Once the ramp is built, the view of the two chattris will be blocked. It will take away some of the aura of the place. I had seen the markings earlier but this is not what I had expected. They are building a two-lane ramp and a parking space for 50 cars near the tower,” says Sibghat Khan, an architecture student, who chanced upon the destruction while on a visit to the site and raised an alarm. In the first phase, the ramp ended on the right side of the first landing. The current 850-metre ramp being built in the second phase takes it up the hillock and lands behind the shrine where a massive parking lot is being readied. Maula Ali is a medieval religious site built during the Qutb Shahi era after Ibrahim Qutb Shah’s aide had a dream. Over successive years, especially during the early part of Asaf Jahi rule, the shrine gained in importance as rulers patronised the spiritual spot. The Urs of Hazrat Ali turns the hill and its surrounding areas into a fairground with hundreds of thousands of visitors and pilgrims thronging the site. During Muharram, thousands of mourners reach the site to commemorate the battle of Karbala. “What is the need for a ramp? When the Nizams and his noblemen could climb the hill to pray, why can’t people do the same now? This will take away the charm of the place,” says Anuradha Reddy of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage. The Maula Ali hillock has seen slow destruction right from the time when a communication tower was built by the police department in 2009 right beside the small ashoorkhana.  When the Nizams and his noblemen could climb the hill to pray, why can’t people do the same now? This will take away the charm of the place.

14 April 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||All contempt appeals should have specific details: HC||Taking note of large number of contempt appeals being filed by government officials, the Telangana High Court has decided not to allow such appeals unless the officials held guilty of contempt of court furnish all details in their petitions. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy directed the HC Registry not to entertain any appeals by contemnors (persons held guilty for contempt of court) unless their respective appeal petitions contain specific details. The order was issued by the bench two days ago while hearing a batch of contempt appeal pleas. The bench made it clear that a contempt appeal petition of a government officer should mention if he or she faced contempt proceedings in the past. If so, details of the matter along with the copies of orders passed in the contempt petition should be filed. If an officer was held guilty of contempt of court for violating court order or breaching it, whether he or she filed an appeal against such order. The officer should also explain if any interim orders were passed by the court in the matter. The officer held guilty for breach of the court must explain if he suffered any adverse order of the court. Details of such adverse orders should also be mentioned in the appeal petition, the bench said. The CJ observed that the HC was being inundated with contempt appeal petitions. “This court would like to know antecedents of each and every officer approaching it by filing contempt appeals,” the CJ noted. In four contempt appeals, filed by three government officials and manager of a private company, the bench directed the contemnors to deposit the fine amounts of Rs. 2,000 each imposed on them in the HC. The bench stayed the punishment of three months of simple imprisonment awarded by a single judge in a contempt of court following depositing of the fine amounts by them. The single judge held them guilty as they disobeyed the order of the court not to acquire the lands of some farmers for Kaleshwaram project in Siddipet district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/all-contempt-appeals-should-have-specific-details-hc/article34315105.ece
14 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||ECI should deploy Central forces in Sagar bypoll: Uttam||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has appealed to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to deploy Central forces in Nagarjunasagar bypoll as the “local police was hand-in-glove with the ruling party and turning a blind eye to rampant distribution of money and liquor to influence voters”. “The State Chief Electoral Officer, district officials and the Returning Officer too, are silent and not taking action despite the submission of evidence on money and liquor distribution and intimidation of voters by the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS),” Mr. Reddy alleged. He made the allegations in a video conference with Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar on Tuesday. Mr. Reddy sought the immediate intervention of the ECI or else there would be no meaning of democracy. Mr. Reddy said that there were more outsiders in the constituency than the actual voters as the TRS has deployed all its workers, including ministers, MLAs, MLCs, sarpanches in all 189 gram panchayats, two municipalities and tribal hamlets of Nagarjunasagar Assembly constituency. “The ECI should immediately ask the outsiders to leave the constituency as they were distributing money and liquor and also intimidating voters that their benefits would be stopped if they don’t vote for the TRS. The borders should be sealed and Central forces should be deployed to check all vehicles meant for money and liquor distribution,” he said. The TPCC chief also sent a representation to the ECI to implement COVID guidelines and said that there was a danger of the virus spreading from thousands of people being mobilised for Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s public meeting in Halia on April 14. He wondered as to how the ECI could put lives at risk with huge spike in COVID cases, shortage of hospital beds and vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/eci-should-deploy-central-forces-in-sagar-bypoll-uttam/article34315110.ece

14 April 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Sanjay specialist in spreading rumours: Bhatti||Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka took strong objection to State BJP president Bandi Sanjay’s comments that Congress leader K. Jana Reddy would defect the party, and said that Mr. Sanjay was increasingly losing credibility with his silly statements. “It has become a habit for Mr. Sanjay to talk of defections during every election and then join hands with TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao. He tried similar methods by releasing a fake video during the Dubbak elections to defame the Congress candidate and was resorting to the same now to help the ruling TRS,” he said. “People will not fall to such cheap tactics of Mr. Sanjay and Mr. Jana Reddy will forever be a Congressman. In fact, Mr. Sanjay will join hands with KCR after the elections.” ‘Abusive politics’ The CLP leader said that Minister K.T. Rama Rao had gained arrogance with power and had lost sense in treating senior political leaders with respect. Taking objection to KTR treating Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy with contempt in a speech, he said it reflected his arrogance of power. “KTR should remember that his father KCR is a Chief Minister because the Congress gave Telangana.” On KTR threatening to file cases against people who abuse KCR, he said it was KCR who brought abusive politics in Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sanjay-specialist-in-spreading-rumours/article34315111.ece

Mr. KCR lauded the efforts made by Dr. Ambedkar to make the country secular (with no caste bias) and democratic republic. “It was because of the foresight of Dr. Ambedkar that the formation of Telangana could happen constitutionally and State government took inspiration from his works in the implementation of several schemes for the welfare of the oppressed classes,” the Chief Minister said. Dr. Ambedkar’s ideals were imbibed in the schemes or programmes being implemented to strengthen rural economy and provide self-respect to the weaker sections. A special fund was created for the development of Dalits based on their population and funds that were not spent during a financial year were being transferred to the next year without diverting them to other departments.

14 April 2021||Nalgonda,TELANGANA||All eyes on KCR’s Halia public meeting today||After the month-long campaign of the ruling TRS in Nagarjunasagar, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao will give his final touches at a public meeting to be held in Halia on Wednesday. Interestingly, this will be his second public meeting in the same town within two months, the last one being on February 10 and reflects the keenness of the party not to leave any scope for the opposition parties. His first visit to Halia was termed ‘Thanksgiving meet’ for he laid foundation stones for lift irrigation schemes, among other development goals for Nalgonda. Will he concentrate on just the welfare schemes of the government or go all out against Congress’ Jana Reddy will be keenly watched at the meet. The conduct of the meeting itself was in a jeopardy with some farmers and some Independents moving the High Court to stop it citing rising cases of COVID. With a lakh people likely to be brought in for the meeting, they argued that it would be a super spreader of the virus. However, the court cleared the obstacles for the meetings. But TRS leaders, well-prepared to fight the Congress giant K. Jana Reddy, who had been Nagarjunasagar’s legislator for seven terms and a celebrated State politician, were ahead in their homework even though their candidate’s name was not ready till a day before the closing of nominations. ‘Divide and Rule’ was TRS’ mantra to woo voters mandal-wise, with at least one legislator and his team of activists taking over full control. The campaign predominance was also visibly Yadav-centered, ever since TRS declared deceased MLA Nomula Narsimhaiah’s son Nomula Bhagat as the candidate, and prominent Yadav leaders, including BJP contenders, switched parties. Minister for Animal Husbandry Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Home Minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali and dozens of others made the constituency their home. Mr. Jana Reddy, who had addressed one public meet, had suggested a ‘no-campaign challenge’ to all contesting parties to set an example on ethical elections, but the contestants mostly read it as the septuagenarian’s inability to fight the election. While TRS asked, “Is 35 years not sufficient to develop a constituency?” Congress asserted, “The roads, even in remote villages, you are holding the shows on were laid by Jana Reddy.” Clearly, ‘Development’ is the most politicised word in the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/all-eyes-on-kcrs-halia-public-meeting-today/article34315113.ece

14 April 2021||Ghaziabad,||Vote against those who made you sit on the roads: BKU to farmers||Describing the report in a national newspaper misleading, Bhartiya Kisan Union national general secretary Yudhvir Singh said on Tuesday that he didn’t say ‘BKU is not against BJP’. Mr. Singh’s alleged statement led to chatter in social media groups about whether the BKU had been able to sustain farmers’ anger against the BJP and whether the Tikait brothers would put their weight behind those who could spoil BJP’s prospects in the upcoming panchayat polls in the State. “What I meant was BKU is not a political organisation and we don’t tell people where to vote in a panchayat election. But I also said farmers could cast their vote for any candidate except for the BJP supported ones,” said Mr. Singh. “All along, our protest is against the anti-farmer policies of the BJP-led government and Samyukt Morcha of which BKU is a part have been repeatedly appealing to farmers to punish those who have made them sit on the road,” Mr. Singh added. In an official release, he also reminded how BKU leaders had travelled to States where Assembly elections were being held. However, sources in BKU said the organisation didn’t want to take on the BJP directly before the Assembly elections, which are still almost a year away. “The message has already reached the ground and there is no need to underline it in panchayat elections as they are fought by individuals and not party.” Another factor in panchayat elections is that there is no unity among the Opposition as well. While Samajwadi Party and Rashtryia Lok Dal are putting on a united front for Assembly elections, in zila panchayat president elections, they are supporting archrivals in many districts. Sunil Rohata, RLD spokesperson said panchayat election was an opportunity to strengthen the cadre and no party would let go of it. “In West U.P., farmers are behind the RLD,” he asserted. “So, the subtle message is to support whomever you find strongest against the BJP-supported candidate,” said Dharmendra Malik, media in-charge of BKU. However, State vice president Rajvir Singh said the message should be clearly defined so that nobody could distort it. “When you can speak against the BJP clearly in Bengal, what is stopping you to say it in west U.P.?” asked a senior leader, requesting anonymity. Simmering anger Emphasisng that there is anger against the ruling party, Mr. Singh said BJP could not find candidates to support in all the 14 zila panchayat seats in Ghaziabad. “It shows which way the wind is blowing.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/vote-against-those-who-made-you-sit-on-roads-bku-appeals-to-farmers/article34314838.ece

14 April 2021||GUWAHATI,||Spike in virus cases dampens Bihu spirit||A spike in COVID-19 cases and strict guidelines issued by the Assam government has dampened the festive spirit ahead of Rongali or Bohag Bihu beginning Wednesday. Officials of the Health and Family Welfare Department said 583 out of 1,02,182 people tested positive on Monday, taking the active cases count to 2,387. The positivity rate of 0.75% was “manageable”, but the spread of the cases has been a cause for concern. More than 33% of the cases were detected in Kamrup (Metro) district, which mostly comprises Guwahati, where the major Bihu functions are organised. The Bihu organisers are miffed with the standard operating procedures issued by the district authorities on April 9, asking them to obtain prior permission for the programmes, sanitise the venues twice and winding up the programmes by 11 p.m. Each member of a Bihu organising committee was also asked to undergo tests for COVID-19. “A lot of investment goes into organising Bihu functions that have traditionally carried on well past midnight. After 2020 was lost to COVID-19 lockdown, people have been looking forward to enjoying Bihu this time, but the strict regulations have come in the way,” said Kailash Nath Sarma, advisor to the Brihattar Guwahati Bihu Sanmilani Sanammay Raksha Samiti, a coordination body of Bihu committees in the city. Relaxation demands He said that the festival organisers have protested demanding relaxation of the restrictions as well as assignment of volunteers by the district administration at Bihu sites for testing and sanitising. Assam’s neighbours in the northeast too have geared up to prevent the spread of the new strain of the novel coronavirus. Meghalaya imposed night curfew from Sunday but has resisted deferring the high school and higher secondary school, leaving exams under the State Board from April 16. D.P. Wahlang, the State’s Principal Secretary for Education, admitted many parents were wary of sending their wards to the examination centres. “But we need to take decisions that are locally relevant,” he said. Mizoram, on the other hand, has not taken any chances although the number of active cases there is among the lowest. The State government has closed down schools for students in Classes up to 8.

14 April 2021||JAIPUR,||Udaipur institution gets global aid for prosthetics and orthotics||An Udaipur-based charitable institution has received a global grant worth Rs. 1.34 crore for starting a central fabrication unit to manufacture and supply prosthetics and orthotics with computer-aided design technology for differently abled persons. The artificial limbs will be distributed free of cost through camps to be organised at remote places all over the country. The Narayan Seva Sansthan (NSS), engaged in corrective surgeries and manufacture of artificial limbs at its workshop, will use the integrated computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) platform for fabrication of prosthetics with precision. The new unit will meet the distinct requirements of each differently abled person. NSS president Prashant Agarwal told The Hindu on Tuesday that the grant from the U.S. was facilitated by a campaign led by children in Atlanta, capital of Georgia, since 2019 to raise funds through community service. Children sold sodas, tea, samosas, popcorn and explained about the project by giving “hugs for free”. Fund raising Before the Rotary International offered the grant to NSS, the Seva Project launched for raising funds accumulated $40,000 by connecting Indian-American singer and inspirational speaker Sparsh Shah with the drive to support the institution. Seventeen-year-old Sparsh, a resident of New Jersey, has a rare brittle bone disorder. Mr. Agarwal said the new central fabrication unit would enable the differently abled to be a part of the mainstream society and create new opportunities for them in the near future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/udaipur-institution-gets-global-aid-for-prosthetics-and-orthotics/article34315076.ece
14 April 2021||LUCKNOW,||Allahabad HC moots total lockdown in affected districts||The Allahabad High Court has asked the Uttar Pradesh government to consider the viability of a complete lockdown for at least two or three weeks in districts where COVID-19 infection has increased alarmingly. The court also stated that “We must give priority to public health over elections” and hoped that the government would streamline every department of public health and public care in the light of directions issued by it to curb the spread of COVID-19. Night curfew or COVID curfew imposed on many districts on instructions from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is a small step and could only curb night parties and large religious congregation in the coming month of Ramazan and Navratri, the court said. “We understand that complete lockdown for weeks together may not be feasible but looking to the current surge of pandemic, we direct the government to look into the viability of complete lockdown in those districts were spread has increased alarmingly, for at least two weeks or three weeks and at least immediately all public gatherings must be restricted to 50 persons,” the court said. A Division Bench of Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar said the court had been informed that COVID hospitals were “over-flooded” with patients and there was a shortage of both manpower and facilities in the hospitals. Complete collapse “The situation is so alarming that if it is not handled carefully and cautiously we may lead to stage of complete collapse of public health system,” the judges said. “What we need to ensure is that there is no unnecessary public movement even during the day,” the court observed. “We need to restrict public movement at least for a week or 10 days to break the chain. If life survives one would regain wealth and improve his economy. After all every development is for people and if there are no men there will be no use of any development activity,” the court said.

The Minister made the comment after a two-day long conference on measures to be taken to reduce air pollution in the city before the onset of winter. “The Delhi government will fight against air pollution as a mass movement for which we will explore every possibility. The government will focus on changing the mindset and behaviour of people,” Mr. Rai said. Also, six units engaged in illegal vehicle cutting and dismantling have been sealed in Mundka, Tekri, Chanchal Park, and Nilothi of west district, officials of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said. “They were operating without DPCC consent and a large number of vehicles were being cut, causing damage to public health and environment. The team has sealed the premises and electricity has been disconnected. FIRs have also been launched at Mundka police station against the violators,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/fight-against-pollution-will-be-a-mass-movement/article34314828.ece
14 April 2021||New Delhi,||Civic bodies should extend help to vendors, says AAP||The AAP on Tuesday alleged that a fire gutted about 272 municipal corporation stalls at Shastri Park furniture market and added that following a court order, the BJP-ruled civic body was supposed to spend Rs. 60 lakh to develop stalls at this market, but they haven’t done anything. “A few days ago, a massive fire gutted about 272 municipal stalls at Shastri Park furniture market. However, not a single councillor or Mayor or even a Standing Committee member of the BJP-ruled civic body has visited the affected area. Following a court order, 743 stalls were supposed to be put up for vendors evicted from Jama Masjid and Meena Bazar, which was the result of a long-drawn and hard-won battle. The municipal body was to spend Rs. 60 lakh to develop these stalls,” AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said. “We also request the BJP-ruled civic bodies to extend help to vendors who lost their shops. Yesterday, when the Aam Aadmi Party councillors went to the area, shopkeepers complained of lack of roads and toilets,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/civic-bodies-should-extend-help-to-vendors/article34314821.ece

14 April 2021||New Delhi,||HC rejects plea to relax age criterion for vaccine||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday rejected a plea seeking direction to the Centre and the city government to relax the age criterion for COVID-19 vaccination and to allow more private sector participation in the drive. An HC Bench said the plea appeared to be filed for publicity rather than doing any good to the society. It also said: “Does not have the wherewithal to deal with such matters which require empirical data...” The Bench said since the petitioner, a final-year law staudent is withdrawing the plea and has understood the consequences and in future will not indulge in such litigation, it was refraining from imposing costs. The petitioner, Mrigank Mishra, had sought direction to the authorities to formulate a policy to provide the benefits of vaccination drive to senior citizens, differently abled persons and poor sections of the society by initiating door-to-door vaccination services in the Capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-rejects-plea-to-relax-age-criterion-for-vaccine/article34314840.ece

Delhi BJP resident Adesh Gupta said: “The fourth COVID wave is on the upswing since the past 10 days but till date the Kejriwal government has not declared any of its bigger hospitals, including LNJP as COVID dedicated but had converted 14 private hospitals into COVID only hospitals.” He added that treatment in these hospitals is very costly and beyond reach of lower and middle-class people. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said alleged that there were only 26 ventilators available for new patients in Delhi government hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-cong-lash-out-at-govt-over-hospital-infrastructure/article34314845.ece

14 April 2021||Mumbai,||Grant parole to Arun Gawli for wife’s surgery, says HC||The Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court recently granted relief to contract killer-turned-politician Arun Gawli, lodged in Nagpur Central Jail, and quashed the order rejecting his parole. A Division Bench of Justices Z.A. Haq and Amit Borkar was hearing a criminal petition filed by Gawli, 68, against an order passed on March 3, by Divisional Commissioner of Nagpur division. The Commissioner rejected Gawli’s plea for grant of parole on the basis of an adverse police report in view of the Prisons (Bombay Furlough and Parole) Rules. Gawli is convicted under Sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 3 (punishment for organised crime) of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act and is undergoing imprisonment for life. On December 26 last year, he had filed an application seeking parole for 45 days as his wife had to undergo a surgery on her left ear, after suffering from chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The Commissioner called for a report from the Agripada police. In its report, the police said Gawli’s wife suffered from the illness mentioned in the plea and doctors at Mumbai’s Jaslok Hospital advised her to undergo a surgery. However, the report also stated that Gawli’s son and his wife’s relatives were capable of taking care of her. On the basis of this, the police sent an adverse report and said, “Gawli is the leader of a syndicate and involved in a number of criminal activities.” On the basis of the police report, the Commissioner told the court that if Gawli is released on parole there is danger to the complainants and witnesses and submitted a chart of dates when the gangster was released on furlough and parole. The court said, “The report of enquiry prepared by the police does not dispute the fact of necessity of surgery of the wife. Taking into consideration the nature of serious illness CSOM to the left ear, we are satisfied that the petitioner (Gawli) deserves to be released on parole.” The court perused the charts of furlough and parole and said, “The bare perusal shows that the petitioner had surrendered himself on due date before the Prison Authorities.” While quashing the order by the Commissioner, the Bench directed him to grant parole to Gawli as per his entitlement, eligibility and conditions permissible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/grant-parole-to-arun-gawli-for-wifes-surgery-says-hc/article34314747.ece
14 April 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra govt. to build 450-room working women’s hostel in south Mumbai||A working women’s hostel will now come up on the site of the MP Mill Compound slum rehabilitation project, which led to the resignation of Prakash Mehta, the then housing minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party government, in 2017. State Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said on Tuesday that the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority will build the hostel with 450 rooms at a cost of Rs. 35 crore to accommodate women who come to Mumbai for work from different parts of the State. Mr. Awhad said, “Mumbai is the financial capital of the country and women from all over the State come here seeking employment opportunities. They find it difficult to secure a place to stay and are forced to live in the distant suburbs. As a result, we decided to build a hostel for working women.” The minister said Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar and party MP Supriya Sule had put forward a request to build such a hostel and he was happy to fulfil it. Mr. Mehta had to resign in 2017 following allegations that he violated the development control rule by giving the transferable development rights not to the slum dwellers but to a building for project affected people. It was alleged that the move would enable private players to make huge profits. Mr. Mehta had claimed that the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was in the loop, but denied it on the floor of the Assembly. The Lokayukta’s report on the probe against Mr. Mehta is yet to be made public. Mr. Awhad confirmed to The Hindu that the hostel would come up on the MP Mill Compound project site. He said he was unaware about the status of the earlier project. Upon completion, the hostel will be handed over to a different organisation for maintenance.

14 April 2021||Washington,||U.S. to withdraw troops from Afghanistan||The U.S. will begin its drawdown of troops in Afghanistan before May 1 and complete the process before September 11, according to a senior U.S. administration official. There are between 2,500 and 3,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan at present. “We will begin an orderly draw-down of the remaining forces before May 1st and plan to have all U.S. troops out of the country before the 20th anniversary of 9/11,” the official told reporters on a briefing call on Tuesday. The process could be completed “well in advance” of the September deadline, the official said. U.S. President Joe Biden, who had earlier said the May 1 deadline set by the Trump administration was unrealistic, will formally announce the withdrawal on Wednesday. The U.S. and its NATO allies had signed a deal with the Taliban in February last year to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan if the Taliban met certain preconditions, including a cessation of violence (the Taliban has repeatedly attacked civilians and Afghan security forces since) and not turning the country into a haven for terrorist groups, particularly al-Qaeda. On Tuesday, the administration official warned that there would be consequences for the Taliban if it attacked U.S. or allied forces during the drawdown. “We have communicated to the Taliban in no uncertain terms that if they do conduct attacks against U.S. or allied forces as we carry out this draw-down... that we will hit back hard and that we will hold them accountable for that,” the official said. The U.S. considers the re-emergence of al-Qaeda in the region after the draw-down of troops a “genuine threat” according to the official, who said the threat will be dealt with “directly” and by holding the Taliban accountable. U.S. to focus on talks Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts to arrive at an intra-Afghan settlement are under way. Istanbul will host talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government between April 24 and May 4, joined by Qatar and the United Nations. The U.S. , via Secretary of State Antony Blinken, had proposed a peace plan that included an interim government — a plan that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has resisted, backing elections instead. India has said it would back a negotiated peace settlement via a regional process convened by the UN. The U.S. would continue its push for a diplomatic solution, the official confirmed on Tuesday, saying the administration had “long known” that there was no “military solution” to Afghanistan’s problems. “… We will focus our efforts on supporting the ongoing peace process. And that means putting the full weight of our government behind diplomatic efforts to reach a peace agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-to-withdraw-troops-from-afghanistan/article34315011.ece
14 April 2021||Washington,||Biden proposes summit meeting with Putin||U.S President Joe Biden has asked his Russian Counterpart Vladimir Putin for a summit level meeting in a third country, in the next few months, according to the White House. The proposal to “pursue a strategic stability dialogue”, made during a phone call on Tuesday between the two Presidents, comes weeks after Mr. Biden agreed during an interview last month to the characterisation of Mr. Putin as a “killer.” Mr. Biden had also said Mr. Putin would “pay a price” for alleged meddling in U.S. elections — leading to Russia recalling its envoy to Washington. The Biden-Putin call also comes days before Mr. Biden’s April 22-23 Leaders Summit on Climate, to which Mr. Putin has also been invited. “President Biden reaffirmed his goal of building a stable and predictable relationship with Russia consistent with U.S. interests, and proposed a summit meeting in a third country in the coming months to discuss the full range of issues facing the United States and Russia,” a White House readout said. Troops build-up “President Biden also made clear that the United States will act firmly in defence of its national interests in response to Russia’s actions, such as cyber intrusions and election interference,” the White House said. Mr. Biden reiterated the U.S.’s “unwavering commitment” to Ukraine’s sovereignty, according to the White House. “The President [Mr. Biden] voiced our concerns over the sudden Russian military build-up in occupied Crimea and on Ukraine’s borders, and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions,” the call readout said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-proposes-summit-meeting-with-putin/article34315014.ece
14 April 2021||Yangon,||‘Myanmar could be heading towards full-blown conflict’||The UN rights chief warned on Tuesday Myanmar could be spiralling towards a “full-blown” Syrian-style conflict, after a two-month crackdown that a local monitoring group says has already claimed more than 700 lives. Myanmar is in chaos and its economy has been paralysed since the military seized power from civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1. Warning of possible crimes against humanity, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Tuesday urged countries to take immediate action to push Myanmar’s military to stop its “campaign of repression and slaughter of its people.” Daily rallies across Myanmar have been met with live rounds. At least 710 civilians have been killed as of late Monday, including 50 children, according to a local monitoring group. “I fear the situation in Myanmar is heading towards a full-blown conflict,” Bachelet said in a statement. “There are clear echoes of Syria in 2011,” she warned, referring to the start of a civil war that over the past decade has killed nearly 4,00,000 people and forced more than six million to flee the country. In recent weeks, several of Myanmar’s ethnic rebel groups in some lawless border territories have stepped up attacks on the military and police, raising fears of a broader civil conflict. The military has retaliated with air strikes, which the Free Burma Rangers -- a Christian aid group working in the area -- said had displaced more than 24,000 civilians in Karen state by Saturday. The Rangers, which runs a health clinic in the state, said air strikes had killed at least 20 people and wounded more than 40.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-could-be-heading-towards-full-blown-conflict/article34314503.ece
14 April 2021||Cairo,||Egypt presses for $900 million compensation, seizes megaship||The megaship which blocked Egypt’s Suez Canal and crippled world trade for nearly a week has been “seized” on court orders until the vessel’s owners pay $900 million, canal authorities said on Tuesday. The 2,00,000-tonne MV Ever Given got diagonally stuck in the narrow but crucial global trade artery in a sandstorm on March 23, triggering a mammoth six-day-long effort by Egyptian personnel and international salvage specialists to dislodge it. Maritime data company Lloyd’s List said the blockage by the vessel, longer than four football fields, held up an estimated $9.6 billion-worth of cargo between Asia and Europe each day it was stuck. Egypt also lost between $12 and $15 million in revenues for each day the waterway was closed, according to the canal authority. The MV Ever Given “was seized due to its failure to pay $900 million” compensation, Suez Canal Authority (SCA) chief Osama Rabie was quoted as saying by Al-Ahram, a state-run newspaper. Mr. Rabie did not explicitly cite the Japanese owners Shoei Kisen Kaisha, but a different source at the SCA said on Tuesday that negotiations over damages between that company, insurance firms and the canal authority were ongoing. The Japanese-owned, Taiwanese-operated and Panama-flagged ship was moved to unobstructive anchorage in the canal’s Great Bitter Lake after it was freed on March 29. The compensation figure was calculated based on “the losses incurred by the grounded vessel as well as the flotation and maintenance costs,” Mr. Rabie said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/egypt-presses-for-900-million-compensation-seizes-megaship/article34314496.ece
14 April 2021||Brussels,||NATO warns Russia against Ukraine troop build-up||NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg told Russia on Tuesday to end an “unjustified” military build-up around Ukraine that has sparked fears of an escalation in the former Soviet state’s long-running conflict. Moscow retorted that it had sent troops to its western borders for combat drills because of “threats” from the transatlantic alliance, in an increasingly heated war of words between Russia and the West. As concern mounted, Kiev’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba held talks with Stoltenberg and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Brussels. “In recent weeks, Russia has moved thousands of combat-ready troops to Ukraine’s borders, the largest massing of Russian troops since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014,” Mr. Stoltenberg said at his meeting with Kuleba. ‘Combat training’ “Russia’s considerable military build-up is unjustified, unexplained and deeply concerning — Russia must end this military build-up in and around Ukraine, stop its provocations and de-escalate immediately,” he added. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu hit back that Moscow has deployed troops to its western borders for “combat training exercises” in answer to NATO military moves. “In response to the alliance’s military activities that threaten Russia, we took appropriate measures,” Mr. Shoigu said in televised remarks. He said the troops “have shown full readiness” and that the exercises would be completed within two weeks. Ukraine is pressing Western powers for “practical” support as it seeks to deter any new aggression from Moscow. “Russia will not be able to catch anyone by surprise anymore. Ukraine and our friends remain vigilant,” Mr. Kuleba said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/nato-warns-russia-against-ukraine-troop-build-up/article34314497.ece
14 April 2021||Geneva,||WHO urges halt on sale of live wild mammals in markets||The World Health Organization called on Tuesday for a halt to the sale of live wild mammals in food markets to prevent the emergence of new diseases such as COVID-19. The WHO said because traditional markets play a central role in providing food and livelihoods for large populations, banning the sale of live wild mammals could protect the health of market workers and customers alike. “COVID-19 has brought new attention to this threat, given the magnitude of its consequences,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told reporters. The call came in fresh guidance drawn up by the WHO in conjunction with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “WHO, OIE and UNEP call on all national competent authorities to suspend the trade in live caught wild animals of mammalian species for food or breeding and close sections of food markets selling live caught wild animals of mammalian species as an emergency measure unless demonstrable effective regulations and adequate risk assessment are in place,” the agencies said. “Animals, particularly wild animals, are the source of more than 70% of all emerging infectious diseases in humans, many of which are caused by novel viruses. Wild mammals, in particular, pose a risk for the emergence of new diseases,” the guidance said. The agencies recalled that some of the earliest known cases of COVID-19 had links to a wholesale traditional food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, with many of the initial patients stall owners, market employees or regular visitors to the market. They added that samples from the Wuhan market suggested that it might be the source of the pandemic’s outbreak and/or that it played a role in the initial amplification of the outbreak.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/who-urges-halt-on-sale-of-live-wild-mammals-in-markets/article34314506.ece
14 April 2021||Washington,||U.S. pauses J&J vaccine rollout||The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) called for a “pause” on Tuesday of J&J’s single dose vaccine after six individuals, all women between the ages of 18 and 48, developed blood clots. Nearly seven million people have been administered the vaccine. The “rare and severe” clot, a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), was seen along with thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets), according to the CDC and FDA. The authorities said they were consequently pausing the vaccine’s use out of an “abundance of caution.” “Right now, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare,” Peter Marks of the FDA and Anne Shuchat of the CDC said in a joint statement, asking vaccine recipients who develop a “ severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination,” to contact their healthcare providers. J&J had committed to delivering 20 million doses of its vaccine to the U.S. by the end of March and a further 80 million doses by the end of May. The White House released a statement from the head of its COVID-19 response team Jeff Zients, saying the pause will not impact the U.S.’s vaccination plans. “This announcement will not have a significant impact on our vaccination plan: Johnson & Johnson vaccine makes up less than 5% of the recorded shots in arms in the U.S. to date...,” Mr. Zients said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-pauses-jj-vaccine-over-blood-clots/article34314504.ece

The process is likely to take several years, but China quickly slammed the decision as “extremely irresponsible” and South Korea summoned the Japanese Ambassador. The government argues the release is safe as the water is processed to remove almost all radioactive elements and will be diluted. The International Atomic Energy Agency has endorsed the release, which it says is the standard practice at nuclear plants elsewhere. Fishing communities fear releasing the water will undermine years of work to restore confidence in their seafood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/japans-plan-to-release-fukushima-water-into-the-sea-raises-concerns/article34314493.ece
14 April 2021||Lahore,||3 killed in Pakistan clashes between police, Islamists||Two demonstrators and a policeman were killed on Tuesday in violent clashes between Islamists and police in Pakistan, a day after after authorities arrested the head of an Islamist party in the eastern city of Lahore, a senior police official and local media reported. The policeman was killed in overnight clashes with the supporters of Saad Rizvi, the head of the Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan who was arrested on Monday, police said. Ten policemen were also wounded in these clashes in the town of Shahadra near Lahore. Two Islamists were reportedly killed in the eastern Punjab province. The violence began on Monday after police arrested Rizvi for threatening protests if the government did not expel France’s Ambassador over depictions of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad. According to police, the arrest was aimed at maintaining law and order. But Rizvi’s detention quickly sparked violent protests by Islamists in cities around the country. The protesters blocked highways and roads in several cities. The deadly clashes come two days after Rizvi in a statement asked the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan to honor what he said was a commitment it made in February to his party to expel the French envoy before April 20 over the publication in France of depictions of Islam’s Prophet. However, the government has said it only committed to discussing the matter in Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/3-killed-in-pakistan-clashes-between-police-islamists/article34314494.ece

Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the police station in Brooklyn Center, the suburb where Sunday’s killing occurred. Demonstrators taunted police through wire fencing erected around the station, and carried signs saying “Jail all racist killer cops,” “Am I next?” and “No justice, no peace.” Police fired tear gas and flash bangs to disperse the crowd.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/unrest-in-us-city-after-police-shot-dead-black-man/article34314501.ece

14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Bengal needs no Radcliffe Line of hatred||Election time in West Bengal has, for decades now, meant violent time. There is violence during the campaigning, violence during the polling, violence during and after the counting of votes. The level of election-related violence and its duration vary but it is there. So what does that fact show? What does it establish? That Bengal is a violent state and Bengalis are a violent people? Certainly not. Not just Bengal-centric They are no more violent than any other part of India or section of Indian society when provoked, instigated, manipulated to think, speak and act violently. One has to only refer to the speeches made on the eve of Direct Action Day in 1946 at the Maidan, in Calcutta, to understand what I mean. Within hours of those incendiary speeches the city was bleeding. An estimated 4,000 people were killed. Very shortly thereafter, incitement and instigation doing their worst, the Noakhali region of East Pakistan saw appalling violence perpetrated on the Hindu minority there, with an estimated 5,000 killed. Bihar responded with matching fury, killing, according to information given to the British Parliament an equal number of  its Muslim minority and, according to The Statesman , twice as many. A peace-cherishing province was leveraged thus into peace-shattering violence. Battered as it was, Bengal was ‘bettered’ by other areas. The worst instance of Partition-time violence among all regions, took place in Punjab. “Virtually,” says Wikipedia, “no Muslim survived in East Punjab (except in Malerkotla) and virtually no Hindu or Sikh survived in West Punjab.” All this was around the partitioning of India. Much later, in the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 an estimated 2,800 were killed in Delhi, and another 3,350 nationwide. These are official figures, the actual numbers are likely to have been much bigger. In the Gujarat riots of 2002, official estimates put the toll at 1,044. The actual numbers, again, are perhaps much bigger. So, let no one tar Bengal and Bengalis with the sweeping description of ‘violent’ . They are only as violent or non-violent as any other part of India or its people, not a whit more. Maoist violence, the other ogre that has menaced life in Bengal, is not by any means confined to the State where Naxalbari lies, but is spread across over 200 districts across nine States. Spreading hate The violence that marred phase four of the eight phase elections now being held in the State is most unfortunate and to be bemoaned. But our distress over it misses another far more important, much more serious and infinitely more dangerous form of violence that is accompanying the elections in West Bengal.  That violence is being done to the mind of Bengal, to its thinking wires, its feeling nerves, to its very soul. It is being done by the unrelenting spread of the virus of communal hate, of sectarian animosity of the ‘line’ that Hindus and Muslims are different breeds of human species. Whichever side of the communal divide it comes from, hatred as an idea and a strategy is no less violent than ‘plain’ violence. Once planted, it incubates in the minds and hearts of people, like a virus, and then erupts with an uncontrollable febrile frenzy. The Partition years The then Muslim League Premier of undivided Bengal, H.S. Suhrawardy, had much to explain for the violence that disfigured Bengal in 1946 and 1947. On Suhrawardy’s last day in that office, August 14, 1947, he had on his hands a challenging ‘guest’ — Gandhi, who was staying in Hydari Manzil, at the Muslim quarter of Beliaghata in Calcutta. At his prayer meeting that evening, over 10,000 people gathered in the grounds around that house to hear him. It was the month of Ramzan. Pyarelal records in his iconic biography ( Mahatma Gandhi – The Last Phase, Navajivan , pp. 368-9), that some in the congregation shouted, “Where is Suhrawardy?” Suhrawardy was inside that house at the time, engaged in namaz . Gandhi told them that. After the prayer meeting gave over and Gandhi returned to the house, there was an uproar. Many had surrounded the house, which at Gandhi’s behest was un-policed, and demanded that Suhrawardy appear. Gandhi opened a window and got Suhrawardy to stand beside him, resting one hand on the outgoing Premier’s shoulder. One of the crowd to the Premier: “Are you not responsible for the Great Calcutta Killing?” Suhrawardy: “Yes, we all are.” ‘Will you answer my question, please?” “Yes, it was my responsibility”. Pyarelal writes: “This unequivocal, straight and candid answer by one who had made arrogance and haughtiness his badge and never known humility had a profound effect on the crowd.” But the incubating virus was working still. Riots broke out within days in Calcutta, viciously. Two young men, Sachindranath Mitra, 37, and Smritish Banerjea, 38, interposing between rioting mobs, were killed on the spot. On hearing that a truck carrying Muslim labourers had a bomb thrown on it in the same area — Beliaghata — killing two of them, Gandhi went to the scene. A four anna piece was lying near one of them that had rolled out of the daily wager’s waist band. Gandhi started a defining fast. It was in complete and exact harmony with the mind and soul of Ramakrishna’s, Vivekananda’s and Tagore’s Bengal. And equally, with the stoic Bengal of the two simple, humble but absolutely true Bengalis, Sachindranath and Smritish. “There should no longer be any more Hindu-Muslim riots in Calcutta…” the fasting Gandhi told Bengal’s leaders who implored him not to fast . “I shall terminate my fast if all of you accept this responsibility.” Seventy or so hours after his fast had begun, a group of leaders came to him to report that the innate good sense of the majority of the people of the city had prevailed over the furies let loose by the rioters. The mob that killed and burnt was not Bengal. The majority that stilled the mayhem, was. “We the undersigned,” the leaders said in a paper they gave to him , “promise to Gandhiji that peace and quiet have been restored in Calcutta once again. We shall never again allow communal strife in the city. And shall strive unto death to prevent it.” Among the signatories were Suhrawardy and N.C. Chatterjee, the Hindu Mahasabha leader. Netaji’s elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose, was a third. Bengal then and now That was and is Bengal. Its antibodies against the virus are strong. Its immune system is active. But if the load of the viral inoculum is huge, the balance can get affected. It can collapse. Beliaghata 1947, representing Bengal’s immune system, checked the virus. It has, by and large, remained in check. In 1971, 50 years ago, the virus all but disappeared, with the State hailing the return of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Rahman to Dhaka and the birth of Bangladesh, even as another Tagore composition — “Amar Sonar Bangla” — became the national anthem of the new nation. Bengal’s immune system should be spared the challenge of an overload of the communal virus. It is one thing to go through an election that seeks to win its favour; quite another to have a Radcliffe Line of hatred cut through its mind and torment its soul. Beliaghata 1947, Bangladesh 1971 and the ballot for Bengal 2021 bear witness to its covenants with life unto death.

14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||BIMSTEC needs to reinvent itself||The foreign ministers of BIMSTEC (the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) met virtually on April 1. That they made time to hold their 17th meeting is good news. They advanced the agenda, which had been arrested by the pandemic, since the last ministerial meeting held in August 2018. Their major task was to pave the way for the next summit, the grouping’s fifth, due to be held in Sri Lanka in the “next few months”. While most multilateral groupings from G20 to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) held their deliberations at the highest political level in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, BIMSTEC leaders failed to do so. In contrast to a meeting of even SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) leaders held at India’s initiative a year ago, BIMSTEC could not arrange its ministerial meeting until April 2021. This is due as much to contextual factors as the diplomatic environment prevailing today. Unfolding rejuvenation Established as a grouping of four nations — India, Thailand, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka — through the Bangkok Declaration of 1997 to promote rapid economic development, BIMSTEC was expanded later to include three more countries — Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan. It moved at a leisurely pace during its first 20 years with only three summits held and a record of modest achievements. But it suddenly received special attention as New Delhi chose to treat it as a more practical instrument for regional cooperation over a faltering SAARC. The BIMSTEC Leaders’ Retreat, followed by their Outreach Summit with the BRICS leaders in Goa in October 2016, drew considerable international limelight to the low-profile regional grouping. This also opened up the path for its rejuvenation. The fourth leaders’ summit, held in Kathmandu in August 2018, devised an ambitious plan for institutional reform and renewal that would encompass economic and security cooperation. It took the important decision to craft a charter to provide BIMSTEC with a more formal and stronger foundation. The shared goal now is to head towards “a Peaceful, Prosperous and Sustainable Bay of Bengal Region”. At the second swearing-in of the Modi government in May 2019, the leaders of BIMSTEC, not SAARC, were invited as honoured guests. Soon thereafter, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar observed that India saw a mix of “energy, mindset and possibility” in BIMSTEC. Recent decisions Two and a half years after the Kathmandu Summit, the grouping stands ready to move forward. The foreign ministers cleared the draft for the BIMSTEC charter, recommending its early adoption. They endorsed the rationalisation of sectors and sub-sectors of activity, with each member-state serving as a lead for the assigned areas of special interest. The ministers also conveyed their support for the Master Plan for Transport Connectivity, which will be adopted at the next summit. Preparations have been completed for the signing of three agreements relating to mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, cooperation between diplomatic academies, and the establishment of a technology transfer facility in Colombo. What has been missing from recent deliberations is a reference to the lack of progress on the trade and economic dossier. A January 2018 study by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry had suggested that BIMSTEC urgently needed a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement to be a real game changer. Ideally it should cover trade in goods, services and investment; promote regulatory harmonisation; adopt policies that develop regional value chains; and eliminate non-tariff barriers. Also lacking was an effort to enthuse and engage the vibrant business communities of these seven countries, and expand their dialogue, interactions and transactions. On this score, BIMSTEC remains a work in progress. Over 20 rounds of negotiations to operationalise the BIMSTEC Free Trade Area Framework Agreement, signed in 2004, are yet to bear fruit. In contrast, much has been achieved in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief and security, including counterterrorism, cyber security, and coastal security cooperation. India has led through constant focus and follow-up — to the extent that some member-states have complained about the ‘over-securitisation’ of BIMSTEC. The trick to ensure balance is not to go slow on security but to accelerate the pace of forging solid arrangements for economic cooperation. Similarly, while national business chambers are yet to be optimally engaged with the BIMSTEC project, the academic and strategic community has shown ample enthusiasm through the BIMSTEC Network of Policy Think Tanks and other fora. Hurdles The goal now should be to overcome the obstacles leading to BIMSTEC’s success. First, a strong BIMSTEC presupposes cordial and tension-free bilateral relations among all its member-states. This has not been the case, given the trajectory of India-Nepal, India-Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh-Myanmar ties in recent years. Second, uncertainties over SAARC hovers, complicating matters. Both Kathmandu and Colombo want the SAARC summit revived, even as they cooperate within BIMSTEC, with diluted zeal. Third, China’s decisive intrusion in the South-Southeast Asian space has cast dark shadows. A renowned Bangladeshi scholar argued at a recent conference that BIMSTEC would make progress if China is accepted as its principal interlocutor and partner. This perspective has hardly any takers in India and its friendly partners in the grouping. Finally, the military coup in Myanmar, brutal crackdown of protesters and continuation of popular resistance resulting in a protracted impasse have produced a new set of challenges. Despite them, the BIMSTEC foreign ministers could meet virtually — but will it be as easy for the summit to be held, with the much-maligned Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing in attendance at Colombo? As BIMSTEC readies itself to celebrate the silver jubilee of its formation next year, it faces a serious challenge: to effect “a paradigm-shift in raising the level of our cooperation and regional integration”, as Mr. Jaishankar said on April 1. The grouping needs to reinvent itself, possibly even rename itself as ‘The Bay of Bengal Community’. It should consider holding regular annual summits. Only then will its leaders convince the region about their strong commitment to the new vision they have for this unique platform linking South Asia and Southeast Asia.

14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||In climate change noise, India’s role as conductor||The recent visit to India by United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry gave an opportunity for both sides to discuss cooperation on climate change and the balance between near-term priorities and long-term targets. U.S. President Joe Biden’s ‘Leaders’ Summit on Climate’ scheduled for April 22-23 will also set the stage for major countries to outline their plans. One thing is clear: Climate action and climate leadership are being increasingly measured against a planetary imperative of emissions reducing to net-zero by 2050. This presents a conundrum for fast-growing developing countries such as India. They need the carbon space to develop but they are also among the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Is there an equitable way to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for the planet? Recent debates on whether India should declare a net-zero year or withstand mounting pressure have centred around two alternative strategies. The first is to delegitimise long-term targets. This view proposes focusing on measurable near-term progress, and paints the long-term (the year 2050 and beyond) as too far to be meaningful in terms of progress towards a deeply decarbonised world. The alternative approach argues that without long-term targets, the path to decarbonisation has little certainty. Fine points This polarised debate needs some nuance. Consider the analogy of a retirement plan. It is a must for everyone. However young, we need to start saving now to meet the goals of a financially secure retirement. It would be foolish to not have a retirement plan on the grounds that it is in the distant future, that medical sciences might advance, or that we could consider retirement properly when we are richer in middle age. To only focus on smaller savings in our youth would ignore the compounding effect that actions today have in the long run. Planning for emissions mitigation is similar: The short- and the long-term cannot be delinked. Ambitious renewable energy targets, improvements in energy efficiency and fast penetration of electric vehicles are among India’s critical low-carbon objectives in the next decade. Yet, rapid advances in these do not substitute for the need to set a clear direction of travel with the aim to reduce emissions to net-zero. Avoiding this choice makes India look like a climate laggard when its actions actually speak louder than the words of many developed countries. India needs to replan India should, instead, reframe the net-zero debate from the perspective of the planet and for the prosperity of its people. India had ensured that “climate justice” was inserted in the preamble to the Paris Agreement. As the climate crisis unfolds, climate justice should imply that humanity respects the planetary boundary of permissible greenhouse gases but also ensures that countries assume equitable responsibility based on their past and future emissions. This approach would be different from merely blaming developed countries for historical emissions and, instead, would establish the criteria by which economic advancement and climate responsibility could go hand-in-hand. We propose a formulation that combines per capita income and aggregate emissions. The World Bank classifies a high-income economy as one with gross national per capita income of $12,536 or more in 2019 prices. Any high-income country should not get more than 15-20 years to achieve net-zero emissions from 2020 onwards. This would imply that the European Union or the United States reach net-zero no later than 2035-40, rather than 2050 as they currently propose. China will enter this income category after 2025, so it should achieve net-zero by 2045, rather than 2060 as it proposes. India is expected to become a high-income economy around 2050, and it should target net-zero close to 2070. As a recent Council on Energy, Environment and Water report (https://bit.ly/2Qm7scN) shows, today’s high-income countries would still have a much longer transition period between peaking emissions and net-zero than India would get. Issue of aggregrate emissions However, per capita income cannot be an excuse for inaction in correcting emissions-intensive development pathways. Aggregate emissions also matter. The historical (past century) and future (this century) aggregate emissions of each country not yet in the high-income category should aim to be progressively smaller than those which have achieved high-income status. This approach acknowledges the potential to tap into technological advances and cost reductions and reinforces the need to give a long-term net-zero signal. (This is how India benefited from falling solar costs over the past decade and was able to aim higher for its renewable energy ambitions.) This approach would trigger a rethink about each country’s sustainable development priorities and sectoral pathways — and create the conditions for further innovation and investment in climate-friendly infrastructure, technologies, business models, and lifestyle and behavioural changes. As the suite of mitigation technologies becomes more widely available and cheaper, all countries could achieve net-zero much earlier. The debate between prioritising only near-term actions versus announcing long-term net-zero goals presents a false binary. Both are needed to establish certainty of action, credibility of promises and create incentives for markets to respond. The real debate should be about climate justice for people and the planet. India would do well to propose alternative formulations that establish equity, differentiate the pace of desired action, and yet be progressive in its ambitions.

14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Immediate vaccination a must in Indian universities||As universities and higher education institutions (HEIs) across India prepare to bring students and faculty back on campus, COVID-19 cases are suddenly surging across the nation. More people are being infected and at a faster rate than before. Vaccination roll-out strategies targeting selected groups must be rapidly expanded along with public health efforts to bring normalcy. In a recent letter to the Prime Minister, the Indian Medical Association has suggested that vaccination be allowed for all people above the age of 18 years. India has one of the highest proportion of young people with co-morbidities, including cancer, diabetes and tuberculosis, in the world. With a large part of COVID-19 deaths in India occurring due to co-morbidities, there is a compelling case for young people in universities and HEIs to be given priority in vaccination. Critical disparity The case for mass vaccination involving students, faculty and staff in HEIs is not without precedent. Cornell University in the U.S. intends to have a requirement of vaccination for students returning to certain campuses, which not only has a direct positive impact on restoring academic continuity, but also curtails high-risk asymptomatic transmission. On-campus learning transcends conventional didactic approaches by offering experiential learning and co/extra-curricular activities that are impossible to replicate virtually. Some of these will have to be redesigned to follow COVID-19 protocols. In 2020, while some HEIs initiated digital reforms to ensure academic continuity, many institutions faced impending challenges broadly around two key constraints. Privileged public and private HEIs were able to build the governance and infrastructural capacity for digital transformation to ensure academic continuity, supported by the Ministry of Education through several initiatives. SWAYAM deserves a special mention here. However, low Internet penetration and limited power and technology infrastructure impacted universities and students, particularly in rural India. Multiple institutions have replicated the physical experience of campuses in the virtual world through pedagogical innovations and using technology to drive social engagement. However, all universities in India may not have the resources required to do so in the online space. In order to meet these challenges, close gaps and give a reasonable holistic academic experience, our public health efforts and vaccination strategies may have to reflect this very critical disparity. Two concerns At this stage, one may consider the possibility of resuming university campuses with upgraded infrastructure and COVID-19 protocols, but one must keep in mind two concerns of high-risk exposure and logistical complexities. First, universities host a large number of students, faculty and staff members representing diverse demographic groups. Since the essence of most campuses is to promote social interactions, their ‘normal’ functioning can increase the risk of infection. While the magnitude of risk varies, this is true for campuses with day scholars and fully residential campuses. With such high exposure and cumulatively rising risk of transmissibility, a vaccination strategy that involves them can help curtail the spread and revitalise their learning experience. Second, reopening campuses will entail complex logistical implementation to ensure health and safety on campus. However, only a handful of institutions have been fortunate to make infrastructure enhancements in the past year. Also, while norms of social distancing and masks can be deployed, sustaining the rigour of adhering to all protocols will be strenuous for some. Compared to corporate organisations where it is easier to deploy such norms and protocols, we must be mindful of the challenges of doing the same for and in universities. The recent spike in COVID-19 cases upon commencement of physical classes among certain renowned Indian universities reinforces the importance of vaccination prior to reopening. More than 37 million students enrolled in higher education, along with the university faculty and staff, is a number that is feasible for a special vaccination drive to be planned and executed. Since at least three months are needed for two doses and to ensure an effective immune response, the implementation of such a programme for all HEIs must begin by May for timely commencement of on-campus learning this year.

14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Lessons from COVID-19||The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes COVID-19. Doctors initially did not know how best to treat patients with COVID-19. Thus, in the first few months, clinical care was dominated by opinion, anecdotes and dogma. An example is the hype surrounding hydroxychloroquine as a potential cure for COVID-19. It took a huge global effort to prove that hydroxychloroquine does not benefit COVID-19 patients. One year on, there is still rampant misinformation on cures for COVID-19, with steam inhalation, multivitamins, mineral supplements, and drugs such as ivermectin, and chloroquine, all of which have not been demonstrated to treat COVID-19, still being prescribed. Clinical trials High-quality evidence that informs best practice for treatments comes from randomised clinical trials. Until these trials produced results, what doctors did was treat symptoms and provide life support. Treatments include oxygen, breathing support in the form of mechanical ventilation in severely ill patients, and supporting other vital organs such as kidneys with dialysis and heart with blood pressure medications. Many COVID-19 patients developed blood clots and were therefore treated with blood thinning medications. COVID-19 was a clarion call for generating such high-quality evidence at pace, in particular designing trials to test multiple treatments simultaneously with innovative designs such as platform trials and adaptive trials. The RECOVERY trial network in the U.K., the REMAP-CAP trial globally focusing on critically ill patients, and the WHO-led SOLIDARITY trial globally are examples of this approach. RECOVERY demonstrated the lack of benefit with hydroxychroloquine, azithromycin, lopanivir-ritonavir, colchicine and convalescent plasma. REMAP-CAP highlighted harm with use of hydroxychroloquine and lopanivir-ritonavir and demonstrated that there is no benefit with convalescent plasma. SOLIDARITY also highlighted the lack of benefit from many of these drugs, including Remdesivir, an antiviral drug that perhaps shortens the illness duration. It is important that lack of benefit of these drugs reported in well-conducted clinical trials should be translated into clinical practice by healthcare professionals managing COVID-19 patients. Drugs that work Let us also consider the drugs that have been proven to benefit COVID-19 patients. We have learnt that corticosteroids (dexamethasone) is effective in COVID-19 patients who need oxygen and in critically ill patients (hydrocortisone). These cheap and universally available drugs have saved thousands of lives. More recently, we have emerging evidence that two interleukin-6 receptor blocking drugs (tocilizumab and sarilumab) benefit COVID-19 patients, including enhanced benefit when used in combination with corticosteroids, particularly in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. It is important to note the emerging evidence with heparin (a blood thinning medication). Heparin possibly harms critically ill COVID-19 patients whilst potentially benefiting non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Therefore translating these high-quality evidence into clinical practice by healthcare professionals would involve administering corticosteroids and interleukin-6 receptor blocking drugs when treating COVID-19 patients who are moderate to severely ill as per the WHO clinical criteria. Indiscriminate use of steroids and blood thinners in mildly ill patients with COVID-19 who do not need oxygen or any other organ support must be avoided. The pandemic continues to exert pressure on healthcare systems. It is important that apart from supportive care (oxygen, ventilatory support), the only drugs shown to reduce mortality are steroids and interleukin-6 receptor blocking drugs. Do not prescribe ineffective treatments to patients with COVID-19. A.V. Ramanan is Professor of Paediatric Rheumatology, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, and M.

14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Another beginning||As India grapples with a vaccine shortage, the Drug Controller General of India has formally approved another vaccine candidate — Sputnik V — under emergency use authorisation. Since January, India’s vaccination strategy has hinged almost entirely on Covishield — the AstraZeneca vaccine — and to a very limited extent, Covaxin. Another significant move by the government is in allowing foreign-made vaccines approved by regulatory agencies in the U.S., the U.K., Europe, Japan or those that find mention in the World Health Organization’s list of approved emergency use vaccines which can avoid conducting a local clinical trial but opt for a parallel bridging trial post-approval. Last year, Pfizer had approached Indian regulators for permission but a sticking point was over this question of the conduct of local trials. It is important to note that bridging trials are critical. A vaccine that is approved in a different country may have untoward effects in another population. Past learnings from the history of drug and vaccine effects across geographies were what necessitated such rules in the first place. However, India is in a crisis. When it had the opportunity to conduct clinical trials in the right way, in the case of Covaxin and even Covishield, India rushed through its regulatory process. This contributed to the hesitancy surrounding these vaccines. It is still a mystery why India did not plan for enough stocks like the U.K. and the U.S. did. Now, it seems India is taking a cue from these countries by conceding that no country can be entirely ‘atmanirbhar’ in vaccinating its population. While there are several vaccine candidates at various stages of approval that India can choose from, it must not repeat the same mistake of assuming that choice translates into immediate availability. All of the Indian companies that have tied up with foreign vaccine companies are private players. That is, while they may promise vaccines in the millions, it will always be the case that priority will be accorded to the highest global bidders. India must compete to ensure that these doses are available to a large fraction of its adult population in quick time. The pandemic wave seems to have ebbed in the U.S., to some extent, because at least 30% of its adults have got one dose. For India, this job of scaling up was always going to be uphill. Scenes from last year — paucity of hospital beds, ventilators, black marketing of drugs — are now being replayed in worrying proportions. With more vaccines come inevitably more complications associated with adverse events and rare side-effects. This is where India’s pharmacovigilance programme must step up. The easing up on conditions for facilitating more vaccines must be seen as a new beginning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/another-beginning/article34314473.ece
14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||A small step||Emancipation is seldom a linear progression to the finish; the hurdles are many, some entrenched in the mind. The passing of amendments to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act in India recently is a step forward in recognising the rights of women, but is no giant leap. It does push the envelope way past how far the now antediluvian MTP Act of 1971 went, primarily by allowing the termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks if there are foetal anomalies. However, it also sets the decision on the shoulders of a medical board formed by State governments for this specific purpose. The amended Act also allows the termination of pregnancy until 20 weeks based on the opinion of one qualified doctor, an improvement from the consensus between the two doctors clause that was previously required. As per the amendment, unmarried women can also terminate their pregnancy, and by replacing the word ‘husband’ with the word ‘partner’, it, for the first time, takes the dialogue outside the confines of marital relationships that it was trapped in, legally. In a country where statistics put the number of unsafe and illegal abortions done every year at about 800,000, any extension of legal and safe provisions for termination of pregnancy is clearly welcome. Admittedly, in India where sex-selective abortions are performed, the state needs to keep a watchful eye on anything that might allow the sex ratio to nosedive further. But this law stops short of reimagining an issue at the heart of any debate on abortions — a woman’s agency over reproduction. The key dramatis personae in a decision to keep or abort a foetus are essentially the woman and her gynaecologist; instead, the law envisages the decision to be made by a board of specialists if an abortion is required after 24 weeks. Among the reasons why the amendments were pushed was the laborious process a woman had to undergo in order to get an abortion, sometimes resolved by courts, but often frustrating and leading them to seek solutions surreptitiously, risking their life. This is retrograde, even positioned against a global trend — the laws in over 60 countries allow women to get an abortion on request at any point in the gestation. While old laws sought to protect the life of a woman on the grounds that medical procedures would be unsafe for the mother after a certain gestational limit — usually 12 weeks — medical capability is no longer a limit. Experts swear medical technology has advanced sufficiently to allow safe abortions in secure health-care settings at very advanced stages of the pregnancy too. The amended Act, then, scarcely recognises women’s agency at the centre of it all, and until it does so, through a fundamental change in mindset, measures such as these will count as but small progress on a jagged line.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-small-step/article34314475.ece

In England and the United States the law prohibits the committal of children to prisons while the provision of special institutions for the segregation of juvenile offenders has been widely adopted. The establishment of “Borstal institutions” in Great Britain, it is stated, has tended to bring about a decrease in the jail population. The beneficent influence of the Borstal system on young prisoners, sentenced to imprisonment under the Act providing detention in such an institution, is being appreciated in an increasing measure. In England it is found that 73 per cent of the young fellows sentenced to detention in a Borstal institution and released on licence are permanently reformed. In recent years steps have been taken in this Presidency to collect adolescent offenders in the specially selected jail at Tanjore where they are detained and trained to learn good conduct; and a profession.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/decrease-in-jail-population/article34314484.ece

Goods and Services tax (GST) collections for the full year fell 8% from Rs. 5.99 lakh crore in FY20 to Rs. 5.48 lakh crore, but the overall kitty was bolstered by a sharp spike in excise collections. “Net tax collections on account of Central Excise and Service Tax (Arrears) during financial year 2020-21 stood at Rs. 3.91 lakh crore as compared to Rs. 2.45 lakh crore in the previous financial year, thereby registering a growth of more than 59%,” the Ministry said in a statement. Customs duty collections also grew 21% to Rs. 1.32 lakh crore, helping swell the exchequer’s coffers. “The 59% growth in net central excise and service tax (arrears) collections is largely on account of the Sabka Vishwas scheme for resolving legacy disputes,” said Saket Patawari, executive director at financial consultancy Nexdigm. “In addition, there has been a rise in customs duty collection,” he added. Net direct tax collections for the pandemic-hit FY21 grew almost 5% to Rs. 9.45 lakh crore, provisional data showed last week. Subject to reconciliation Both the direct and indirect tax numbers are subject to reconciliation. “GST collections were severely affected in the first half of the financial year on account of COVID,” the Ministry said. “However, in the second half, GST collections registered a good growth and collections exceeded Rs. 1 lakh crore in each of the last six months,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/customs-excise-fuel-indirect-tax-surge-in-covid-hit-year/article34314448.ece
14 April 2021||AHMEDABAD,||S&P index drops Adani Port citing ties to Myanmar junta||S&P Dow Jones Indices on Tuesday said it was dropping Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. (APSEZ) from the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, citing the Indian company’s ties with Myanmar’s military. Stating that APSEZ would be removed from the indices prior to market opening on April 15, S&P Dow Jones Indices observed that the decision had followed a “Media and Stakeholder Analysis triggered by recent news events pointing to heightened risks to the company regarding their commercial relationship with Myanmar’s military, who are alleged to have committed serious human rights abuses under international law”. The Myanmar military has been accused of widespread human rights violations after a coup and has been slapped with sanctions by the United States. The group, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, is building a port in Yangon on land leased from the military-controlled Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), which is among the entities that have been sanctioned by the U.S. Last month, the Adani group said it would consult all stakeholders and authorities on the project after human rights groups alleged that the ports unit had an agreement to pay millions of dollars in rent to MEC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sp-index-drops-adani-port-citing-ties-to-myanmar-junta/article34314445.ece
14 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Confident of surpassing 2019 sales in India: Lamborghini||Italian super luxury car maker Lamborghini is confident of getting back on the growth trajectory this year, surpassing 2019 sales in India, despite the resurgence in COVID-19 cases in the country, a senior company executive said. Sharad Agarwal, head of Lamborghini India, said the company had got off to a positive start in 2021, with sales in the first two months already surpassing those during the pre-pandemic period. “We are now seeing a lot more positivity in the market... the economic activity, the forecast for GDP, the stock market,” he said, on the factors driving growth. “If you look at all the macro variables today, there is a very positive trend,” Mr. Agarwal added. Mr. Agarwal said the company had seen order bank coming back in the past 4-5 months, giving them the confidence “to do better than 2019.” “2020 was an aberration where we all had challenges. In the last five months [October 2020-February 2021], we are plus 20% over the previous year [October 2019-February 2020], which was pre-COVID time,” he said.

14 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Virus surge, vaccination pace threaten recovery’||The resurgence of COVID-19 infections in India, combined with partial lockdowns and the slow pace of vaccinations poses a big risk to a strong economic rebound, although the country may still register double-digit growth in 2021, Moody’s Investors Service said on Tuesday. In a note on India’s sovereign rating, the global agency said the second wave of infections presented a risk to its 2021-22 GDP forecast of 13.7% growth, ‘as the reimposition of virus management measures will curb economic activity and could dampen market and consumer sentiment’. ‘Retail activity drops’ “Retail and recreation activity across India had dropped by 25% as of 7 April compared with 24 February, according to Google mobility data,” Moody’s noted. “This was mirrored in the Reserve Bank of India’s March consumer confidence survey which showed a deterioration in perceptions of the economic situation and expectations of decreased spending on non-essential items,” it said. India had recorded its highest daily surge in new COVID-19 infections since the start of the pandemic on April 11, pushing its active case load further past 1 million, the agency pointed out, stressing that the vaccination roll-out will be critical in managing the second wave in a manner that balances ‘virus management against maintaining economic activity’. Despite the fresh risks, the rating agency said India’s GDP is still likely to grow in the double digits in 2021 given the low level of activity in 2020. “Given the focus on ‘micro-containment zones’ to deal with the current wave of infections, as opposed to a nationwide lockdown, we expect that the impact on economic activity will be less severe than that seen in 2020. “India’s very low coronavirus death count (about 1,70,179 deaths have been recorded as of 12 April) and relatively very young population also help mitigate risks,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/virus-surge-vaccination-pace-threaten-recovery/article34314450.ece
14 April 2021||New Delhi,||All gold jewellery must bear hallmark from June||The Centre will go ahead with its plan to mandate hallmarking of gold jewellery from June 1. The plan had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, the then Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Ram Vilas Paswan had announced January 2021 as the deadline, but jewellers had been given an extension. No further extension has been sought, Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan said at a virtual press conference. Gold hallmarking is a purity certification and is voluntary at present. About 40% of gold jewellery is sold with a hallmark. As per the new rules, if jewellery or an artefact made of 14-, 18- or 22-carat gold is sold without the BIS hallmark, the jeweller could be penalised five times the cost of the object or imprisoned for up to one year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/all-gold-jewellery-must-bear-hallmark-from-june/article34314456.ece

14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||MI coaxes KKR to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory||Kolkata Knight Riders left no stone unturned in preparing for its nemesis, Mumbai Indians. Eoin Morgan started with spin to keep Rohit Sharma & Co. quiet in the PowerPlay. He saved the express pace of Pat Cummins and Prasidh Krishna for Kieron Pollard and Hardik Pandya in the middle overs. The plans worked, with his side dismissing the five-time champion for 152. But in the end, pressure got the better of KKR, as it lost by 10 runs at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Tuesday. KKR started on a positive note, led by Nitish Rana (57, 47b, 6x4, 2x6), who found solid support in Shubman Gill (33). The opening partnership of 72 in 8.4 overs set the ball rolling for the men in purple before Rahul Chahar’s magic run began. The leg-spinner picked up four wickets at a crucial juncture to turn the tide. Gill found Pollard at long-off while trying to clear the fence. Rahul Tripathi edged one to Quinton de Kock, Eoin Morgan failed to execute the hack and was caught at deep mid-wicket, and finally, the in-form Rana was stumped. KKR needed to score 30 off the last four overs with five wickets in hand when left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya and speedster Jasprit Bumrah bowled two tight overs to Andre Russell and Dinesh Karthik, conceding just seven runs. Trent Boult removed Russell and Cummins in the final over to secure an improbable victory. Getting into the act Earlier, introduced into the attack in the 18th over, Russell came out of nowhere to pick up a five-for in his two overs, bowling around the wicket to right-handers. The hustle began with Pollard’s wicket. The other four to fall to Russell were Krunal, Jansen, Chahar and Bumrah. Suryakumar Yadav’s 56 (36b, 7x4, 2x6) was the highlight of MI’s innings — the runs that mattered in the end.   Rohit keeps telling me to bowl with confidence and that at times even he is not able to read my deliveries in the nets. He asked me to bowl the right length    Rahul Chahar     It was a difficult wicket to bat on. For a new batter to come in and hit from ball one was very challenging.

14 April 2021||London,||Everton suffers damaging draw||West Bromwich Albion improved its slender hopes of avoiding relegation from the Premier League as it survived VAR controversy to beat Southampton 3-0, while Everton’s fading top four bid was damaged by a 0-0 draw at Brighton on Monday. Albion saw Mbaye Diagne’s goal questionably ruled out by VAR early in the first half at the Hawthorns. But Sam Allardyce’s side recovered from that blow to sweep into a two-goal lead by half-time thanks to Matheus Pereira’s penalty and a Matt Phillips strike. Callum Robinson sealed West Brom’s second successive win after the interval as the Baggies built on their stunning 5-2 victory at Chelsea. At the Amex Stadium, Everton was hoping to close the gap on fourth placed West Ham in the race to qualify for next season’s Champions League. But Carlo Ancelotti’s team managed only one shot on target as its winless run extended to five games in all competitions. Everton, in eighth place, is seven points behind West Ham with a game in hand, while Brighton moved seven points clear of the relegation zone. Sevilla gave itself an outside chance of rejoining La Liga’s title race on Monday by winning a seven-goal thriller away at Celta Vigo. A second-half double from Ivan Rakitic and Papu Gomez snatched a 4-3 victory for Sevilla, which twice had to come from behind at Balaidos. The comeback puts Sevilla six points behind Atletico Madrid.    The results: Premier League: Brighton 0 drew with Everton 0; West Brom 3 (Pereira 32-pen, Phillips 35, Robinson 69) bt Southampton 0.   LaLiga: Celta Vigo 3 (Aspas 20, 23, Mendez 43) lost to Sevilla 4 (Kounde 7, Fernando 35, Rakitic 60, Gomes 76).   Serie A: Benevento 0 lost to Sassuolo 1 (Barba 45-og).

The Test will be played at the Bristol County Ground from June 16-19, kicking off the England team’s summer. The match was first confirmed by BCCI secretary Jay Shah earlier this year but the exact date and venue were unveiled by the host board on Tuesday.

14 April 2021||Liverpool,||Will Klopp inspire another Liverpool comeback?||In need of another famous Champions League fightback, Liverpool cannot rely on a wave of passion, colour and noise from the stands at Anfield to inspire a comeback from 3-1 down against Real Madrid on Wednesday. If the English champion is to reach the semifinals for the third time in four years, it will instead need its manager Jurgen Klopp to conjure the motivation and tactical masterplan to once again eliminate one of Spanish football’s giants. Hopes the Champions League could prove the salvation of a disappointing season were also dashed as Real ran riot last week. Liverpool’s deficit is not as steep as when Barcelona visited two years ago in the semifinals in what turned out to be arguably the greatest of all the memorable European nights at Anfield. Depleted by injuries, Klopp’s men still rolled over Barca’s stellar cast of star names 4-0 on their way to winning the trophy. Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund is waiting on the fitness of Marco Reus and Mats Hummels for the home leg against Manchester City with England winger Jadon Sancho definitely ruled out. Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, expects to be labelled a “failure” if City doesn’t reach the semifinals for the fifth straight year since he joined the English club. The Spanish coach hasn’t won the competition — or even reached the final — since capturing the second of his titles with Barcelona in 2011, with critics blaming him for over-thinking his tactics in the big knockout matches at not only City but when in charge of Bayern Munich from 2013-16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/will-klopp-inspire-another-liverpool-comeback/article34314764.ece
14 April 2021||Kochi,||Kerala Blasters has it easy against Kovalam||Bouncing back nicely after conceding an early goal, defending champion Kerala Blasters FC defeated Kovalam FC 4-1 in a Group-B encounter of the seventh Ramco Kerala Premier League football at the Maharaja’s Stadium here on Tuesday. The Blasters’ second win from four matches took them to seven points and the fourth place and kept alive their hopes of entering the semifinal from the six-team group where teams are very close to each other. Even Mar Athanasius, which currently leads the group with 10 points after finishing its league engagements, may not be sure of its semifinal berth as Kerala United FC and KSEB are breathing down its neck with nine points and a match in hand. And if Blasters win their last league game against KSEB by a handsome margin they will also be in contention for one of the two semifinal berths from the group. Surprisingly it was Kovalam, which had just one goal to show for its previous four matches, which took the lead in the 26th minute through a nice strike from J. Sherin from the right. Blasters found the equaliser through V.S. Sreekuttan five minutes later and then took the lead through substitute Naorem Gobindash around the hour mark. It was easy for the side after that. Missed chances For Kovalam, which lost all its five matches in the group, it was once again a story of missed chances. At Thrissur, FC Kerala, with an injury-time goal from K.S. Rohoth, held Kerala Police 2-2 in a Group-A match. Bijesh Balan scored twice for Police.  The results: Group-A (Thrissur): FC Kerala 2 (Vinayak K. Shibu 24, K.S. Rohoth 90+3) drew with Kerala Police (Bijesh Balan 39, 82). Group-B (Kochi): Kerala Blasters 4 (V.S. Sreekuttan 33, Naorem Gobindash Singh 60, Surag Chettri 75, O.M.

14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||SRH seeks first points against explosive RCB||He can take the match away from you in a matter of a few deliveries. This wizard with a magic wand can deliver brutal blows and yet make it seem delicate and attractive over the 360 degrees that is his range. The explosive genius of AB de Villiers, under pressure, was in full view, as Royal Challengers Bangalore snatched a last-ball thriller against Mumbai Indians in the IPL lung-opener. And the RCB line-up has so many match-winners, including skipper Virat Kohli and Glenn Maxwell. But then, in the game against Sunrisers Hyderabad at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Wednesday, RCB will need to work on its bowling. Someone like Washington Sundar, so successful with the ball in Twenty20 cricket, needs to bowl his full quota of overs. Against MI, he sent down just one over and made an impact by dismissing a rampant Chris Lynn. RCB has bowling depth, and seamer Harshal Patel bowled with clever variations against MI to scalp five. When your domestic uncapped players do well, it augurs well for your team. SRH has a problem. It cannot afford to bench someone with the temperament and stroke-making ability of Kane Williamson. Without him, the team appears a lesser outfit. It’s not just about his high-quality batting. Given his cricketing nous, his inputs to David Warner will be invaluable. SRH can bench Mohammad Nabi and ask Vijay Shankar and Abdul Samad to share four overs between them.  This will be a game full of mini-battles. Bhuvneshwar Kumar versus the influential de Villiers will be intriguing. And Rashid Khan vs. Kohli and Maxwell are mouthwatering match-ups. Curbing the heavy-hitting Warner will be a challenge for RCB. The surface might be sluggish, but this will be a high-octane clash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/srh-seeks-first-points-against-explosive-rcb/article34314576.ece
14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Sangakkara sees encouraging signs in Samson’s knock||How captaincy would impact Sanju Samson’s batting was one of the questions asked ahead of the IPL. On Monday night at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium, the new skipper of Rajasthan Royals provided the answer in a most emphatic style. Short by a few yards He played one of the great knocks in a lost cause at the IPL. His 119 off 63 balls fell shot by a few yards — quite literally — of what would have been an astonishing victory against Punjab Kings, chasing 222. No other Royals batsman managed more than 25. Kumar Sangakkara, Royals’ director of cricket, was all praise for Samson’s extraordinary innings. “It was encouraging to see (him take the responsibility),” he said. “He was just five or six yards short of hitting the last ball for a six. The next time I believe he will hit ten yards further to win us a game.” Sangakkara also was impressed with the efforts from youngsters Riyan Parag, whose 52-run stand with Samson for the fifth wicket kept Royals in the game, and Chetan Sakariya, the 22-year-old left-arm seamer who made a sparkling debut. “Riyan is a special player and has got amazing hand-speed and great composure,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sangakkara-sees-encouraging-signs-in-samsons-knock/article34314586.ece

I used the time away to work on my fitness and skill and I am happy to be back taking wickets for my country,” Bhuvneshwar said in an ICC release. “I would like to thank each and every person who helped me in this journey starting from my family and friends and my teammates. “Also, a special thank you to the ICC voting academy and all the fans who voted for me and made me the ICC Men’s player of the month for March.” Besides Bhuvneshwar, ace leg-spinner Rashid Khan of Afghanistan and Zimbabwe's Sean Williams were also nominated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bhuvi-is-icc-player-of-the-month/article34314589.ece

Although medical experts on the pandemic fear that the peak of the second wave could emerge in May, the BAI will go ahead with the Olympic qualification event with 228 players from 33 countries, including China. Seven-day quarantine The event, out of bounds for spectators and media, mandates the players and the officials to report here on May 3 and serve a seven-day quarantine period.

14 April 2021||TASHKENT,||Sajan wins but falls short of A-mark||Olympic hopeful Sajan Prakash clinched the gold in the men’s 200m butterfly with a timing of 1:57.85s, but it was well short of the A-mark Olympic Qualifying Time (1:56.48s), at the Uzbekistan Open swimming championships on Tuesday.

Also on Tuesday, Kenisha Gupta secured the gold medal in women’s 100m freestyle, coming home in 57.42s, while Shivani Kataria took the bronze (59.60s). A.S.

14 April 2021||Chandigarh,||Balbir Singh Jr. passes away||Balbir Singh Jr., who was a member of the silver medal-winning 1958 Asian Games Indian hockey team, died here at the age of 88, his daughter Mandeep Samra said on Tuesday. He is survived by his wife, daughter and son. “My father passed away in sleep on Sunday morning due to heart failure,” his daughter said.

He studied at Lyallpur Khalsa College in Jalandhar and was first selected to play for the Indian hockey team in 1951. HI condoles death  Hockey India condoled the death of Balbir Singh Jr. “On behalf of Hockey India, I express my deepest condolences to Balbir Singh Jr’s family.

14 April 2021||New Delhi,||Raman to re-apply for coach’s post||Former India opener W.V. Raman is all set to re-apply for the head coach's post of the Indian women's cricket team as the BCCI is looking at empowering the incumbent with more responsibilities. The Indian cricket board has published the advertisement on its website as per the requirements of its new constitution which states that the ending of every contractual agreement should be followed by seeking fresh applications. It is believed that the senior team head coach will also have a considerable say in the roadmap for the women’s ‘A’, U-19 and NCA teams. “As far as I know, WV will be applying for the post. Under his guidance, the women’s team reached the finals of the World T20. And don’t forget this series against South Africa was the first in one year. He is well within his rights to re-apply and I believe he remains a strong contender,” a senior BCCI official said on conditions of anonymity. Continuity With the women’s ODI World Cup scheduled in New Zealand in less than a year’s time and a full tour of England in June-July, it will be interesting to see if the BCCI, which has always believed in continuity, persists with the stylish former southpaw or looks at other options. “Whoever is the new head coach will have more say as we plan to develop a robust A and U-19 team before we can start a full-fledged six or eight-team women’s IPL. And who better than the new chief coach to monitor a smooth transition from U-19 to senior level for the girls,” the official said. The BCCI will also have a fresh set of junior selectors with the ICC U-19 World Cup set to be held next year. The appointments to replace the Ashish Kapoor-led committee was delayed because of the pandemic which also led to the age-group cricket being postponed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/raman-to-re-apply-for-coachs-post/article34314814.ece
14 April 2021||BAMBOLIM,||Bengaluru FC faces the Tribhuvan test||A fancied Bengaluru FC will mark the start of a new era when it takes on Nepalese side Tribhuvan Army FC in a preliminary stage two clash of the AFC Cup here on Wednesday. The fixture will be Marco Pezzaiuoli's first competitive game in charge of the Blues since his appointment as head coach in February. “I’m very hungry for my first game. The players look sharp and the preparation has been good. The youngsters are working hard, and in our friendly against Goa, they performed well. They are putting pressure on the others in the squad, and that is good to see,” said Pezzaiuoli. “This is an important game for us because we exited the competition early last season, and we want to reach the group stage this year. “The first step in that direction is to beat a strong Nepalese team and I believe we are strong enough to do that.” Tribhuvan Army Club recorded a 4-1 comeback victory over Sri Lanka Police in its preliminary stage one clash at the Dasharath Rangasala Stadium in Nepal last week, with striker Nawayug Shrestha scoring twice.  In a winner-takes-all tie, the winner will advance to the playoff stage of the 2021 AFC Cup, with either Bangladesh's Abahani Limited Dhaka or Club Eagles of Maldives the next opponent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bengaluru-fc-faces-the-tribhuvan-test/article34314464.ece

The senior team, which is to play five Tests against England in August-September, will now have only two intra-squad practice games instead of the First Class fixture between the India seniors and India-A teams planned earlier. It is believed that the decision has been taken to ensure the safest possible environment for a high quality international series in times of COVID-19. Mutual agreement “The ECB and BCCI have agreed to postpone this summer's men's India-A tour," ECB said in a statement on Tuesday.

14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Worked on death bowling for long period’||Having failed to make a splash in the last five editions of the IPL, Harshal Patel came to the fore in Royal Challengers Bangalore’s (RCB) campaign opener on Friday. The pacer, armed with a deceptive slower ball, took five for 27 and the man-of-the-match award in the close win over Mumbai Indians. The Haryana cricketer was particularly efficient in the final over, conceding just one run and dismissing Krunal Pandya, Kieron Pollard and Marco Jansen. Harshal, who has played only 18 IPL matches since 2016, is now regarded as the answer to RCB’s death bowling troubles. It is a responsibility he is happy to take on. “It is one of those aspects of the game where you are in a position to win the game for your team. It is a privileged position to be in. It can go the other way around as well at times — it can dent your confidence — but I look at it as a privilege. Death bowling is something I've worked on for a long period of time, and I am confident enough now to take all that practice into the game,” Harshal said at a media interaction on Tuesday. Harshal was traded to RCB from Delhi Capitals earlier this year, a move that has worked in his favour. More opportunities “I have more opportunities with RCB. I am being put into difficult match situations, and thus have more opportunity to showcase my skills. The trade is a welcome decision because I knew that with Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje in the DC team, I wasn't going to get an opportunity,” Harshal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/worked-on-death-bowling-for-long-period/article34314584.ece

14 April 2021||Margao,||FC Goa, India set for group stage debut||The AFC Champions League will be played in India for the first time here from Wednesday with FC Goa becoming the only team from the country to feature in the group stage of the continent’s top-tier competition in club football. The Gaurs will take the field against Qatar’s Al-Rayyan SC at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and head coach Juan Ferrando will hope that his team can fully utilise the advantage of playing at home. FC Goa will be up against a side coached by former Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc. The home team will also have to contend with the likes of former FC Porto star Yacine Brahimi and prolific Ivorian striker Yohan Boli. Besides Al Rayyan, the Gaurs will also have to contend with Persepolis FC (Iran) and Al Wahda (UAE) in Group E. Ferrando described it as a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity for the players to compete against some of the biggest names in Asia.  “(We are) very excited. This is one of the biggest competitions in the world,” Ferrando said. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many. These are the kind of things you start playing football for,” said Ferrando. “This is an opportunity for our players to play against some of the biggest names in Asia. Our goals are still far.” Attacking flair Al Rayyan also achieved direct qualification for this season and will be looking to make a good start to its campaign. Brahimi brings attacking flair to the side with his skill, pace and unpredictability.  For FC Goa, Ishan Pandita is one of the most exciting talents to emerge, having spent time in the academies of Spanish clubs Almeria and Leganes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fc-goa-india-set-for-group-stage-debut/article34314467.ece
14 April 2021||TOKYO,||Stark image||The torch relay for the Tokyo Olympics ran through a mostly empty Osaka city park on Tuesday, showing the risks of trying to hold the postponed games during a pandemic. It came on the same day that the government said new coronavirus cases in Osaka hit 1,099, a single-day record for Japan’s second largest metropolitan area. The torch relay began three weeks ago in north-eastern Japan, attempting to navigate around the pandemic with a total of 10,000 runners criss-crossing the country and bound for the opening ceremony on July 23 in Tokyo. Osaka, which announced plans last week to take the relay off city streets and bar the public, became the first detour since the relay began. Organisers had warned beforehand there may be more. Wednesday’s second leg in Osaka — the day the Tokyo countdown clock hits 100 day to go — will be in the same park under the same closed-doors conditions. Many runners arrived in Osaka’s Expo ‘70 Commemorative Park by bus and ran short legs carrying the torch alongside metal barriers or in empty park space. They were accompanied by security officials who jogged or walked alongside, and followed by an “escort” or “promotional” vehicle festooned with logos of major Olympic sponsors Coca-Cola and Toyota.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/stark-image/article34314820.ece

According to a statement from Royals, Stokes injured a finger on his left hand while fielding against Punjab Kings in Mumbai on Monday. He seemed to be in trouble after taking a diving catch to dismiss Chris Gayle. The world’s premier all-rounder was expected to play a major role in the Royals campaign. The Jaipur-based franchise had suffered a blow even before the first ball was bowled. Its bowling spearhead Jofra Archer was ruled out of the initial phase as he had to undergo a surgery to remove a fragment of glass from his hand. The England speedster has, however, been allowed to resume training. That could be some solace to Royals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/stokes-out-of-ipl-with-broken-finger/article34314572.ece

Done in a let-your-hair-down way, these offer an honest, moving and at times funny and charmingly unguarded look at the artistic journeys of these people. The idea behind this series is that art needs to be documented ‘as it happens’, in the current and not necessarily only as an archive of the ‘past’. The four episodes in Season 1 of this series feature Leela Samson (Bharatanatyam dancer), Bombay Jayashri (Carnatic vocalist), Pradeep Kumar (Carnatic and film playback vocalist), and T.M. Krishna (Carnatic vocalist). These will be on view on MOPA’s (Museum of Performing Arts) YouTube channel. The first episode on Leela Samson is scheduled for April 24.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/raw-experiences/article34314737.ece
14 April 2021||April 14 2021 00:00 IST,||Chirrups all around||It’s that time of the year in Assam when the Indian cuckoo (keteki) and  Asian koel (kuli) call out across the Brahmaputra plains. And, graceful bursts of pink-spotted white flowers of an exotic orchid streak the skyline. “The blooming of the foxtail orchid, the State flower of Assam, signifies the start of a new Assamese year when we celebrate Rongali or Bohag Bihu,” says Jaydev Mandal, a birder based in Assam, over the phone. Jaydev is part of Assam Bird Monitoring Network which, along with Bird Count India (BCI), will host the Bohag Bihu Bird Count from April 14 to 17 across districts of Assam. The initiative emphasises the use of eBird.org, a citizen science platform for the birders to register their observations in a systematic manner. “We have three Bihus — Magh, Bohag and Kati — during winter, spring and autumn every year and we plan to document avian diversity across these seasons. All these festivals are closely connected with Nature. We want people to enjoy Nature, encourage birding as a family activity and spare a thought to conservation.”  While this is the time for winter migratory birds that took abode in Assam as well as the surrounding regions to start flying back to their homes in the Northern hemisphere, endemic species like the swamp grass babbler, marsh babbler and black-breasted parrot bill come into the spotlight. In Tamil Nadu, birders can now observe courtship displays, and nest building of resident species in and around their homes. “As most winter migrants have started their return flight to their summer breeding grounds, this is the best time to watch resident birds,” says P.B. Balaji, co-author of Birds of Coimbatore, a handy guide on over 400 species of birds that can be seen across Tamil Nadu. “Assam gets a lot of passage migrants. Most migrant birds from the Himalayas stop over in the region. I was at Nameri last weekend and spotted some of the rarities, including river lapwing, pin-striped tit-babbler and greater adjutant storks.” A chithirai thirunaal birding is exciting as resident birds are active now, says birder K. Selvaganesh from Valparai, near Coimbatore. “One can look for birds in a neighbouring park, nearby streams and water bodies and also at forest periphery, farmlands or terraces of homes. Asian koels are calling out. Egrets can be seen in breeding plumage. Among water birds, you can see coots, grey-headed swamphens, and bronze-winged jacanas with their chicks enjoying a splash.” There is buzz on social media too. The IndiAves community on Twitter, that encourages people to tweet photographs of wildlife, birds and animals, plans to have #wildTN for the Tamil New Year. Chandrakala Ratnam, a wildlife enthusiast, says, “It’s all about new beginnings. The fledglings are out. The ibises, mynas, baya weavers, raptors, and munias are busy bodies collecting nesting material. We want to highlight habitat loss. The #wild TN will be an eye-opener on not just birds, but also endemic mammals like lion-tailed macaques and Nilgiri langurs. Such themes drive engagement among youth and thereby conservation.” Grounded faith While the festival is celebrated as Baisakhi in Punjab, Vishua Sankranti in Odisha, Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, and Ugadi in Karnataka, Arun Kumar Raju Urs of Bengaluru Butterfly Club based in Mysuru talks of the roti habba celebrated by the Soliga tribes of the Biligiri Ranganna Hills adjoining the Satyamangalam ghats. “The tribes offer their first produce to Nature, to the tree-god, mammals and birds in the forest.” Arun says the Ugadi weekend draws families to birding hotspots in Coorg, Bandipur, Nagarhole, and the Biligiri Ranganna Hills. “After the pre-monsoon shower, the forests are lush with greenery. While the koel s and bulbul s enjoy tender neem leaves, flower peckers relish on neem fruits.” Ramesh Iyer of Travancore Natural History Society says that in Kerala, Vishu, observed on the first day of the Malayalam Medam month, has a strong connection with the Indian cuckoo — a solitary, shy bird that is found in forests and open woodlands and breeds in the Himalayas. “It is called Vishu pakshi (the Vishu bird) as its distinctive call heralds the festival. The festival is also the time when we receive mid-summer showers spreading cheer not just to mankind but also to the flora and fauna. An ideal time to watch birds actively feeding on Nature’s bounty.” Pay a visit to a nearby woodland or forest patch, you can witness the raucous calls of racket-tailed drongo (kadu muzhakki), mimicking calls of hill mynahs, the metallic hammering call of the coppersmith barbet ( chembukottan ) and the melodious calls of Asian fairy bluebird ( Lalita).  “Even in towns, the cackle of the rufous treepie, the repetitive calls of white-cheeked barbets, and the chirping of mynahs can be heard distinctly at dawn or dusk,” says Ramesh. One can also see migratory butterflies — the double-branded black crow, common crow, dark blue tiger and blue tiger — on their return migration journey from the Ghats to the plains of southern India, just before the onset of the awaited Southwest monsoon.  Know more Bihu Bird Count will follow simple steps of documentation Anyone within the State of Assam can participate, watching birds for at least 15 minutes in and around the selected area at any time of the day People residing outside Assam can also participate and share their respective checklists with the account named ‘bihubird’ on eBird To know more, write to bihubirdcount@gmail.com or visit Bihu Bird Count on Facebook||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/chirrups-all-around/article34314736.ece
14 April 2021||New Delhi,||‘More people below 45 years getting infected with COVID’||A higher proportion of people below 45 years of age are getting admitted with COVID-19 this year than in 2020, said doctors at multiple hospitals in the Capital. However, they claimed that most of the ICU admissions are still elderly. The doctors said younger people are getting infected with the virus this year as they are going out for work, pleasure trips and parties. They also said the virus may be now more infectious than before due to mutations, but there is no data to establish it at this point. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday reiterated that 65% of patients were below 45 years of age as per data of the last 10-15 days. Head of Department of Internal Medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital S.P. Byotra said this year more children are getting infected with the virus than last year. “They develop fever, cough, cold, but it is not severe in most cases. For elderly people, the severity is more as they have comorbidities. Last year, people were scared to go outside, which is not the case now. This month, we have seen dozens of people in their 20s and 30s, college students and married couples, who said they had gone for a trip or a party and got infected after it,” said Dr. Byotra. Epidemiologist and president of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), Delhi, K. Srinath Reddy, said more young people getting infected is a trend in other parts of the country too. “Even in the United Kingdom, more young people are getting infected,” he said. Head of Department of Critical Care at Holy Family Hospital Sumit Ray said there are three reasons why more people below 45 years of age are testing positive. Three reasons “One, they are more mobile. Two, older people are more cautious and many of them have taken the vaccine. Three, the virus has definitely become more infectious. Earlier in a family of five, two might test positive and later on, two-three might test negative. But now, in most cases all members of a family are testing positive,” he said. Dr. Ray said one-fifth of the ICU patients in the hospital are below 45 years of age and one-third in general wards are below 45 years. Medical Director of Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital Suresh Kumar said that even the young people are developing severe illnesses. “Many people below the age of 45 are also getting admitted in ICUs,” he said. Senior Consultant at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital Suranjit Chatterjee said many of the younger people are not following COVID-appropriate behaviour. “They are working and going out. Last year, there was a lockdown, but everything is open now. Clinically, there is a suspicion that the virus is more infectious now,” he added.  Earlier, in a family of five, two might test positive and the rest negative. But now, in most cases all members of a family are testing positive Sumit Ray Head of Department of Critical Care at Holy Family Hospital||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/more-people-below-45-years-getting-infected-with-covid/article34314599.ece
14 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||1947, 1984... 2021 last battle for me: 92-yr-old protester||Among those still protesting at the Singhu border is an ailing 92-year-old man from Ferozepur who has been a part of the agitation since the beginning and believes this “to be the last battle” after having witnessed the 1947 Partition and 1984 riots. Sohan Singh was found semi-conscious in front of the main stage at the protest site around 10 days ago. He was taken to a nearby medical camp from where he was shifted to a makeshift hospital. ‘Not eaten for 6 days’ Avtar Singh, who runs the makeshift hospital by the name of Life Care Foundation, said he got a call in the afternoon about Mr. Singh’s health. He rushed to the camp with an ambulance and found that the man was unable to speak. “He was so low on energy. I asked him why he didn’t take any medicine. He could barely say that he did not eat for the last 5-6 days,” Avtar said. If not for the lab facility at the makeshift hospital, they might have turned him away with a few medicines and a bottle of glucose. “But we changed his clothes and conducted tests. It was found that he has an infection after which he was treated for it and kept in the hospital for eight days. He was discharged on Sunday,” Avtar said. Mr. Singh keeps a diary in which he has all the contact numbers, which are important for him. One of his family members — who was found to be in Kuwait — was contacted and his photographs and videos were also sent but the relative allegedly didn’t respond. Sitting in a hall, Mr. Singh said he spent two months at a protest site in Gurdaspur and then came here with a group in February. Mr. Singh claims he was 18 years old during the 1947 Partition. ‘Won’t die till I win’ “I have witnessed it all and have fought all the fights. Be it 1947 or 1984. We will always be in optimism and joy. This is my last battle, and I will not die till it is won,” said Mr. Singh. On Baisakhi (Tuesday), Nihang Sikhs at Singhu border protest had put up a show using their weapons and at Tikri border too, there were events lined up. Many at the protest site said the festival won’t mean anything till they have won.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/1947-1984-2021-last-battle-for-me-92-yr-old-protester/article34314592.ece
14 April 2021||NEW DELHI,||Putting in place more efficient hospital planning system: CM||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the government was putting in place a more efficient hospital planning system. To ensure only severe COVID-19 patients get access to beds, doctors will now be monitoring each and every patient within the hospital to see if any of them can be cured at home, he said. Donate plasma, says CM He requested people to postpone planned surgeries and asked those who have recovered recently from the virus to donate plasma as there was a shortage of the same in the city. Speaking at a digital briefing, Mr. Kejriwal said: “If doctors feel that a particular patient can be cured at home, they will be requested to go back home. This is not the hospital or the government shirking from responsibility. We will provide such patients with oximeter and our doctors will be calling them regularly to keep a check on them. We will monitor their situation even at home and bring them back to the hospital if the need arises.” He said the step was needed to ensure that serious COVID patients get beds in hospitals and requested all to cooperate with the doctors. “I request everyone to have faith and let the hospital management function smoothly. Please understand, we are shouldering the responsibility of the whole of Delhi and their well-being. For us, each life matters,” Mr. Kejriwal said. He added that some banquet halls and hotels have been attached to nearby hospitals to place COVID patients who do not need intensive care, thereby making it easier to transfer them to the hospitals immediately if required. Mr. Kerjiwal appealed to the Central government to cancel the CBSE board exams — scheduled to begin on May 7. He requested the CBSE to find an alternative method like online examinations or passing students with the help of internal assessment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/putting-in-place-more-efficient-hospital-planning-system-cm/article34314598.ece
14 April 2021||new delhi,||HC posers over enforcing ban on gatherings||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre if the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) order prohibiting all kinds of gathering in the wake of increasing COVID-19 cases was being implemented across the board in the Capital. Justice Mukta Gupta directed the Centre to indicate the manner in which the April 10 prohibitory orders of the DDMA were being followed and whether any kind of social, religious, political or festive gathering was being permitted. The direction came while the court was hearing a plea by the Delhi Waqf Board to reopen the Nizamuddin centre where the Tablighi Jamaat congregation are held. It has been locked since March 31 last year. ‘Unfortunate statement’ The HC expressed displeasure over a statement given to the media by the Board’s chairperson, Amanatullah Khan, who said that the court has allowed the mosque to be made operational. The HC said it was “unfortunate” that such a statement was made when the issue was yet to be decided. It will hear the case again on April 15. Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, appearing for the Board, questioned how gatherings are being permitted outside temples in the Capital when the same was prohibited by the DDMA. He asked whether the DDMA order was applicable only to a particular religious community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-posers-over-enforcing-ban-on-gatherings/article34314594.ece
