10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre announces hike in MSP for paddy, pulses, oilseeds||The Central government has hiked the minimum support price (MSP) for common paddy to Rs. 1,940 a quintal for the coming kharif season, close to 4% higher than last year’s price of Rs. 1,868. The decision was taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday. In a bid to encourage crop diversification, there were slightly higher increases in the MSP for pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals. Both tur and urad dal saw the MSP rise by Rs. 300, a 5% increase to Rs. 6,300 a quintal, while the highest absolute increase was for sesamum, whose MSP rose 6.6% to Rs. 7,307. Groundnut and nigerseed saw an increase of Rs. 275 and Rs. 235 respectively. However, maize saw a minimal hike of just Rs. 20 to Rs. 1,870 a quintal. The MSP is the rate at which the government purchases crops from farmers, and is based on a calculation of at least one-and-a-half times the cost of production incurred by the farmers. This year, the MSP for bajra was set at 85% above the cost of production, while the MSP for urad and tur will ensure 60% returns. The MSPs for the remaining crops were mostly set around the stipulated 50% above the cost of production. The announcement comes at a time when farm unions have been protesting for more than six months on Delhi’s outskirts, demanding legislation to guarantee MSP for all farmers for all crops, and a repeal of three contentious farm reform laws. Terming the announcement ajumla(false promise) as it did not account for the full cost of production, farmers’ groups under the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) noted that some increases, especially for maize, did not even keep pace with inflation. “There is no mechanism that guarantees that every farmer can get at least the MSP as the floor price in the market. Therefore, this is a meaningless concept as far as farmers are concerned, and that is why this movement has been asking for a statutory entitlement for all farmers so that a remunerative MSP can be ensured for all farmers,” said the SKM. Briefing the press after the meeting, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar reiterated that the MSPs were here to stay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-announces-hike-in-msp-for-paddy-pulses-oilseeds/article34774327.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI/COLOMBO,||Shun vaccine nationalism, says UNGA president-elect||Vaccine nationalism would destroy countries’ efforts to eradicate the pandemic and must be avoided “at all costs”, United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) president-elect and Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid said on Tuesday. Terming the disparity in vaccination coverage in developed countries and the rest of the world “unacceptable”, he said, “No one is safe until everyone is safe.” He was speaking to The Hindu from New York, a day after his historic election as PGA (President of the General Assembly), with a decisive majority of 143 of 191 votes cast by member-countries. Human rights would be a “central theme” at the UNGA, Mr. Shahid said, while he, as President, would refrain from “taking sides on contentious issues” such as Jammu and Kashmir and remain “impartial”. “India was one of the first countries who came out su-pporting me,” he said, thanking the Indian leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/shun-vaccine-nationalism-says-unga-president-elect/article34774329.ece

10 June 2021||kolkata,||PM Modi has to be removed from power, says Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said her next political move would be to remove Prime Minister Narendra Modi from power. “I have only one thing to say: Modi has to be removed from power,” the Trinamool Congress chairperson said when asked by journalists what role she wants to play in national politics. Ever since the West Bengal Assembly polls, where the Trinamool Congress defeated the BJP and retained power, questions on what role she will play in national politics have been posed to Ms. Banerjee. Meets farm leaders During the day, she met leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), including Rakesh Tikait, at the State Secretariat and extended support to the farmers’ union protesting against the three Central farm Bills. She would write to the Chief Ministers of the Opposition-ruled States to support the cause of farmers, she stated. SKM leaders said that having defeated the BJP, Ms. Banerjee should strive to make West Bengal a model State for farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-modi-has-to-be-removed-from-power-says-mamata/article34774460.ece
10 June 2021||MYSURU,||MLA’s land deals under the scanner||The former Mysuru Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, whose recent transfer is being perceived by some to be the handiwork of the land mafia, has alleged the involvement of politicians in illegal land deals in Mysuru. She furnished copies of her orders to revoke certain land transactions that were prima facie in violation of the law to cite her claims and said they involved S.R. Mahesh, K.R. Nagar MLA. The MLA’s convention hall in Mysuru was also questionable as it was on a raja kaluve [stormwater drain] and it was being surveyed, she added. Ms. Sindhuri said that all decisions by the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA), after H.V. Rajeev took over as chairperson, should be probed as they smacked of illegality and accused him of being a cohort in certain land transactions. Ms. Sindhuri’s response followed a press conference in Mysuru on Wednesday where Mr. Mahesh – who was among the most voluble critic of Ms. Sindhuri – questioned why she had not made any efforts to reclaim the land encroached upon during her stint as the Mysuru DC. Just a day before her transfer, Ms. Sindhuri had sought certain documents and records from the MUDA. Following their scrutiny, she had ordered cancellation of land conversion approved by the authorities with regard to 1.39 acres in Lingambudhi village on the outskirts of the city. Ms. Sindhuri had also directed that the MUDA Commissioner should initiate action against officials who were responsible for clearing the land conversion based on false reports. With regard to Survey No. 115, which is a government gomal land in Kergalli village spread over 129.22 acres, Ms. Sindhuri had sought a report on the action taken by MUDA, on a complaint of irregularity with respect to certain transactions and creation of fake records for landownership to claim compensation. In another case, Ms. Sindhuri directed MUDA to rescind its earlier orders approving conversion of 2 acres near Lingabudhi Lake for commercial purposes. She said that any approval, including for layout plans, in areas coming within 75 metres of any lake should be revoked. She alleged: “These were some of the illegal land dealings of the honourable MLA Mr. Mahesh and there were many more like this.” Ms. Sindhuri said that he has been “incessantly making false allegations” against her. “The whole modus operandi is to threaten and scare officers so that they do not take action,” she said. Meanwhile, Mr. Mahesh has urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to conduct an inquiry into Ms. Sindhuri’s allegation that there was encroachment of land in and around Mysuru and ascertain the truth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mlas-land-deals-under-the-scanner/article34774376.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Former Minister Jitin Prasada leaves Congress, joins BJP||Former Union Minister Jitin Prasada joined the BJP on Wednesday, leaving the Congress, where “he felt he was unable to serve the interests of his people and society”. His induction took place at the BJP’s national headquarters here in the presence of Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and BJP media cell in-charge Anil Baluni. Mr. Prasada said he joined the BJP as he felt it was currently the only party that was an “institutionally national party” and all others were either personality-oriented or regional in nature. “I have been associated with the Congress for three generations and thought long and hard before leaving. I left because I felt that if one is unable to serve one’s people or protect their interests being in a certain party, it’s better to leave. Under the BJP and and the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I feel that I will be better able to serve my people,” he said at a press meet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/former-minister-jitin-prasada-leaves-congress-joins-bjp/article34774325.ece
10 June 2021||RAJAMAHENDRAVARAM,||Smooth-coated otters spotted on Godavari island||An island in the Godavari, upstream Dowleswaram barrage in East Godavari district, has become a safe habitat for vulnerable Indian smooth-coated Otters (Lutrogale perspicillata). Last week, an amateur wildlife photographer from Rajamahendravaram city, Suresh Kumar Uppuluri, began documenting the movements of the otters on the island. “I have documented a group of four otters on the island that can only be reached by boat. The otters are a playful lot and hide in the bushes whenever they sense movements of the boat,” said Mr. Suresh Kumar. “Over the past one week, I have been able to capture photographs of the four otters that appear to be young. The island, located at least one km upstream the Dowleswaram barrage, is always calm with no movements of outsiders,” Mr. Suresh Kumar added. On being informed by local fishermen, the 40-year-old lensman managed to sight the otters and began the documentation. Habitations “The movements of the otters are more frequent in the river water during the morning compared to the rest of the day,” he said. In the islands downstream Dowleswaram barrage, scores of black bucks have been sighted in recent years. In East Godavari district, Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS) is a habitat for the Indian smooth-coated otter. The sighting of otters in the Dowleswaram area is cause for celebration for the wildlife photographers and the Forest Department that had vast experience in conservation of otters in KWS. In Andhra Pradesh, Krishna and Godavari estuaries are the prime habitats of otters that have been sighted and documented by the wildlife wing of the Forest Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/smooth-coated-otters-spotted-on-godavari-island/article34774337.ece
10 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||More steps to revive State economy: FM||The State government will come up with schemes to help those in coir, cashew, handloom, and other traditional industries and small and medium traders badly hit by the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic, Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal told the Assembly. Replying to the three-day general discussion on the revised Budget for 2021-2022 in the House, Mr. Balagopal also announced that the last date for giving options to the VAT amnesty scheme was being extended from August 31 to November 30. The deadline for giving the option to pay the turnover tax of bars has been extended from July 31 to October 31. Mr. Balagopal said stage carriers, taxies, and autorickshaws reeling under COVID would be granted time till August 31 to pay motor vehicle tax. Admitting that the financial situation of the State was bad, Mr. Balagopal criticised the technicalities raised by the Opposition on the revised Budget presented by him. The debt of many States, including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Bihar, had increased. Former Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac’s announcement that Rs. 5,000 crore was available in the treasury was to make it clear that there was no cash crunch when he stepped down, Mr. Balagopal said. Instead of going for harsh measures, the Finance Minister said the government was trying to put cash in the hands of the people and revive the economy. A sum of Rs. 1,140 crore was being made available for kits, Rs. 1,110 crore for welfare pension, Rs. 1,100 crore for contractors, and Rs. 1,100 crore for employee guarantee scheme. The government had also set aside Rs. 2,000 crore for primary cooperative societies. Pointing out that the legislators did not debate on the immense scope of the agriculture sector, the Minister said efforts would be made to make value-added products from various types of banana grown in the State, mango, and pineapple. Seeks Oppn. cooperation Stating that the unanimous resolution of the Assembly had also influenced the decision of the Centre to change the vaccine policy, he sought the cooperation of the Opposition to tide over the crisis. Mr. Balagopal said the revised Budget aimed to spend Rs. 2,800 crore on the health sector, including Rs. 1,500 crore for vaccines and equipment. Of this, Rs. 540 crore would be provided from the MLA fund and Rs. 559 crore from the Central fund to local bodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/more-steps-to-revive-state-economy-fm/article34774472.ece
10 June 2021||New Delhi,||Central deputation of officers very low: DoPT||With the States not nominating enough officers for Central deputation, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has shot off a letter to the State governments, cautioning them that not sending enough officers may affect future cadre review proposals. For instance, Uttar Pradesh has over 500 Indian Administrative Service officers but data show that only 32 IAS officers are presently on Central deputation. West Bengal has around 280 IAS officers but only 11 are posted with the Central Ministries. Bihar fares better with 32 IAS officers on Central deputation out of 208, whereas 28 out of the 167 IAS officers of the Assam-Meghalaya cadre are serving the Centre. Out of the 241 Gujarat cadre officers, 27 are posted with the Union government. Rajasthan has deputed 13 out of its 247 IAS officers to the Centre. An official of Uttar Pradesh cadre, however, said it was not that officers were not willing to go on Central deputation but the no-objection clearance was hard to come by. The final clearance is given by the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/central-deputation-of-officers-very-low-dopt/article34774323.ece
10 June 2021||HYDERABAD,||Elephant Rani dies at Nehru Zoo||Elephant Rani from the Nehru Zoological Park, well known for its participation in Bonalu and Muharram festivities for a long time, breathed her last on Tuesday at the ripe age of 83. The news was announced by the zoo authorities through a press release on Wednesday. Another animal, a male leopard named Ayyappa too died due to senility at the age of 21, the press release informed. Rani, born on October 7, 1938, was one among the oldest elephants in captivity. It was shifted from the Public Gardens, Nampally where the zoo had been housed earlier, in the year 1963. She had been suffering from problems related to old age and was under the care and treatment of zoo veterinarians. Special supplements were given to her along with medicines to improve her quality of life. An earthen mound was built in its enclosure to allow her to lean and take rest, when she was unable to lie down due to arthritis, the note said. She had been adopted by the vice-chairperson of the Apollo Foundation & Apollo Life Upasana Kamineni Konidela in July, 2020 for a period of one year. Post-mortem revealed that the pachyderm died of multiple organ failure. The normal life span of an elephant in captivity is only a little beyond 70, the statement said. Citing Internet search, the statement said Chengalloor Dakshayani (female, 88 years) from Travancore Devaswom Board, and Lin Wang (male, 86 years) from Taipei Zoo were the only elephants which lived longer than Rani among Asiatic Elephants. Zoo officials and animal keepers paid floral tribute to the gentle matriarch and fondly recalled her memories. With her demise, the zoo is left with four Asiatic elephants—one male and three females. Leopard’s death  Ayyappa, the leopard which passed away, was received from the Sri Venkateswara Zoological Park, Tirupati in the year 2000. It died on Wednesday due to multiple organ failure, the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/elephant-rani-dies-at-nehru-zoo/article34774881.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,||KERC hikes tariff by an average of 30 paise||People will have to pay more for electricity as the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) has approved an average increase in tariff by 30 paise per unit for all electricity supply companies (Escoms) for the ongoing financial year. According to the commission, the revision is an average increase of 3.84%. The Escoms had sought an average increase of Rs. 1.35 per unit accounting for 17.31% increase. The revised tariff will come into effect for electricity consumed from the first meter reading date falling on or after April 1 this year to “enable recovery of the revenue gap determined by the commission.” “However, to soften the burden of increase in tariff on consumers during the prevailing COVID-19 lockdown, the arrears towards revision of tariff for April and May is ordered to be recovered during October and November respectively, without charging any interest,” the commission has said. Defending the increase, KERC has said it was necessitated owing to a variety of factors, including the regulatory asset created by the commission in its 2020 order owing to the delayed issue of tariff order for the previous financial year (11.89 paise per unit). The tariff revision was announced in November owing to the pandemic and the KERC announced that it will not be implemented retrospectively. Instead, it had announced the creation of a regulatory asset for the period to be recovered from consumers in two equal installments during the financial years of 2022 and 2023. “The remaining increase (12.64 paise per unit) is towards overall increase in the operational costs of Escoms, which includes the approved revenue deficit as per the annual performance review for FY20 and also the increase in the cost of power purchase,” the commission said. The total revenue gap has been pegged at Rs. 1,819.38 crore.  Fixed cost While the increase is uniform across Escoms with a marginal differential increase in Bescom areas, the increase in energy charges is 10 paise per unit, and increase in fixed cost ranges between Rs. 10 and Rs. 20 across all the categories except Bangalore Metro and battery charging stations for electric vehicles. The year-on-year increase in fixed cost, a substantial part of which is being recovered through energy charges, is necessitated as the current level of recovery of fixed charges is only 33%, which will now go up to 34.29%. KERC cited the poll code and COVID-19 as reasons for the delay in tariff revision.  Fact sheet  Average increase: 3.84%  Increase in energy charges: 10 paise per unit Increase in fixed cost: between Rs. 10 and Rs. 20 Tariff comes into effect from first meter reading date falling on or after April 1 New tariffs for April and May (2021) to be recovered during October and November||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kerc-increases-tariff-by-an-average-of-30-paise-per-unit/article34774374.ece

10 June 2021||Hyderabad,||Telangana govt. cancels Inter second year exams||The Telangana government has cancelled the exams of Intermediate second year (12th class) as the environment for conducting exams was not conducive due to the COVID-19 situation, Education Minister Sabitha Indra Reddy announced here on Wednesday. The decision was expected after Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao asked the officials to study and submit a report after the Central government decided to cancel the CBSE 12th class exams this year. Ms. Sabitha Reddy, who held a meeting with the officials of the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE), said that a committee is being constituted to work out the modalities of the marks to be given to about 4.80 lakh second year students. She said marks would be worked out based on the scores of first year exams conducted last year. However, students who wish to improve their marks can appear for the exams to be conducted at a later date when the COVID-19 situation improves. The BIE already has the marks data and it would not take more than a week to announce the results. The team to be constituted will look into several aspects while fixing the modalities for announcement of results. About 4.80 lakh students are presently admitted in the second year after all of them were promoted last year as the government had cancelled the supplementary exams. The annual exams were held last year as per schedule and out of the 4,80,555 students who took the exam 2,88,383 passed in all subjects. The advanced supplementary exams generally scheduled in July every year too were cancelled due to the lockdown, forcing the government to promote all the students to second year. No clarity The first year students have already been promoted to second year without exams. However, the government is yet to clarify on the first year exams — whether they would be conducted at a later date or the marks would be decided based on some internal assessment. Intermediate exams have little role to play for admissions into professional courses like engineering, medical or agriculture courses as the admissions are based on the engineering and medical entrance tests. However, admissions to conventional degree courses are based on Intermediate marks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/telangana-govt-cancels-inter-second-year-exams/article34774883.ece

10 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Implement lockdown strictly, says CJ||Madras High Court Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee on Wednesday expressed disappointment over the police not enforcing strictly the ongoing lockdown in Tamil Nadu to fight COVID-19. He said it appeared as if the lockdown had been lifted and it was “party time” on the roads. The Chief Justice broached the subject with Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram and said it was shocking to find people moving about on the roads as a matter of routine, though the lockdown was still in force and only a few relaxations had been provided for the convenience of the people. “We have just eased a few things for the convenience of the citizens. But if you walk on the streets, it appears that it is party time. There is business as usual. We, the public, must follow what is in our best interest. We must inculcate a sense of discipline in us,” the Chief Justice told the Advocate General. In reply, Mr. Shunmugasundaram said, “Your Lordship may recall that policemen were beating up people. Now, strict instructions have been given not to beat people and just to ask them about their documents, e-passes, etc. Now, they are handling softly and politely,” he said. Asking the A-G to ensure that enforcement of lockdown does not become a political issue, the Chief Justice said police could create awareness among people through the public address system and ask them not to roam about unnecessarily on the roads and crowd at public places. It should be done particularly in Coimbatore and neighbouring districts, he said. Adding a word of caution that his intention was not to advise the police on what to do or what not to do, the Chief Justice said he was only impressing upon the need to implement the existing lockdown. “It appears as if the lockdown is over. In the High Court, we are maintaining all kinds of restrictions but if you go out to the streets, it appears as if it is party time,” the CJ added. Stating that he perfectly understands the sentiments expressed by the court, the A-G said he would advise the police authorities appropriately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/implement-lockdown-strictly-says-cj/article34774561.ece

10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Telangana High Court to get 18 more judges||The Telangana High Court will see one of the biggest hikes in judicial strength across the country in a long time after Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana took up with the Prime Minister and the Union Law Minister the High Court’s two-year-long pending request for more judges to tackle an alarming increase in its case pendency. The High Court will witness a 75% increase in its sanctioned Bench strength with immediate effect. This would take the number of judges in the High Court from 24 to 42. The High Court’s request for more judges had been lying with the Centre since February 2019 even as its case backlog climbed to 2.37 lakh.  The proposal for a hike in the sanctioned Bench strength was first sent to the Union Law Minister by the then Chief Justice of the High Court in 2019. Though the request was endorsed by the Chief Minister and the Governor, the Centre chose to keep it “in abeyance”. Assurance given The issue had remained dormant until CJI Ramana, along with other concerns of the judiciary, took it up with the Prime Minister and the Law Minister soon after assuming office as top judge in April. They had both, in turn, agreed to “get the matters examined expeditiously”. However, this assurance did not stop the CJI from writing to the Law Minister on May 27 about the High Court’s still unresolved request. Chief Justice Ramana observed that the High Court’s request was reasonable and fully endorsed by the Telangana Chief Minister. The High Court desperately needed more judges for faster delivery of justice. The request has been pending for over two years. The CJI also affirmed that the necessary infrastructure was already in place to accommodate 42 judges. The Law Ministry responded this time by swinging into action, concurring with the CJI to enhance the sanctioned Bench strength in the High Court. The Ministry conveyed its decision to the CJI on June 7. The CJI has given his requisite final approval to the proposed hike on June 8. The path is clear for the Ministry to notify the hike.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/telangana-high-court-to-get-18-more-judges/article34774249.ece
10 June 2021||New Delhi,||Tomar must resign for his comments, says Congress||The Congress demanded resignation of Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar for his comments that the government is ready to discuss any options other than the repeal of the three farm laws. Speaking to presspersons, Mr. Tomar said, “These laws are for the benefit of the farmers, we have spoken to them and even today we are ready for talks. If they want to talk about any other options other than repeal of these laws, we are ready to deliberate and arrive at a solution.” Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate, at a virtual press conference, said that if not the repeal of the three farm laws, should the farmers discuss the weather with the government. She said that this was an illogical and insensitive statement. She accused the Narendra Modi government of being obdurate and arrogant. “A person who is insensitive and oblivious to the plight of the farmers, has no business being the Union Agriculture Minister,” she said. Ms. Shrinate said that the farmers are sitting in the searing heat of Delhi continuing with their protest even though 600 persons have lost their lives in this agitation. The farmers, she said, are not sitting on protest on a whim, they are forced to protest because of the anti-farmer laws. “The Narendra Modi government is not willing to give up their love for the industrialists and want to hand them over Rs. 25 lakh crore worth agri industry,” she said. She reminded the BJP that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had claimed that he is just a phone call away and now his Minister is saying that they are not ready to talk about repeal of the laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tomar-must-resign-for-his-comments-says-congress/article34774259.ece

10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Human rights should be the central theme when it comes to people’||Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid was elected president of the 76th United Nations General Assembly for 2021-22 with a striking majority of votes cast by members (143 out of 191). Mr. Shahid spoke from New York in a virtual interview, a day after his historic win that marked the Maldives’ first time at the helm of the world body, putting the Indian Ocean archipelago at the global centre stage.  What are your plans for what you called a “Presidency of Hope” at the General Assembly, and ensuring vaccine equity in particular? On vaccine equity, it is the first ray of hope that I want to build my presidency of hope on. It is clear that no one is safe until everyone is safe. We should avoid vaccine nationalism at all costs, because that is going to be so destructive to our efforts of making sure that we do away with this pandemic that has devastated our countries, both socially and economically. When we look at the developed countries, one in every five persons has been vaccinated, and when we look at the rest of the world, it is one in every 500 people. This is unacceptable. India has had to stop all vaccine export since April. Do you still hope that it will be able to give more vaccines in the future? The situation in India, I understand, is very difficult now. But it is our hope that as soon as things get better, that we will be able to benefit from Indian vaccine. I am constantly in touch with the Indian leadership on this, our conversations are ongoing. How much was India a part of your victory at the UNGA? India was one of the first countries that came out supporting me. I thank Prime Minister Modi and External Affairs Minister Dr. Jaishankar for their outstanding support for the Maldives’s candidature. India has always been one of our closest friends, the best friend, that has always come to the assistance of the Maldives. In addition to India, many other countries also came out. The previous General Assembly President focused quite a lot on human rights and in particular had made comments on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and Palestine. Will human rights issues be a big part of your agenda? Human rights issues should be the central theme when it comes to people, and the United Nations is about people. So we should, and we must have, human rights issues at the centre of our debate. In particular, will an issue like J&K, which caused tensions between the outgoing President and India, be on your agenda? It will be not in line with the code of conduct of the President of the General Assembly to take sides on contentious issues, because the post, like Parliament Speaker, has to be impartial. Where are investigations into the recent attack on Speaker Mohamed Nasheed, and the renewed focus within the Maldives on tackling Islamist radicalism? The attack is being investigated by the police, it is an ongoing investigation. We have received assistance from international partners, including Australia, the United Kingdom, the U.S., and they are all involved in it. Extremism in whatever form is an issue that the government will address very seriously. You spoke about religious extremism, but globally there is also the rise of Islamophobia. In your new role, how do you plan to tackle both? Any form of intolerance is not to be tolerated. And I think the United Nations and the world community should come together against such intolerance. Extremism, in whatever form, should not be condoned. And I think that is the clear message that the United Nations continues to send. You plan to wear both hats, as Maldivian Foreign Minister and as the UNGA President. Is this unprecedented? There have been many precedents, the most recent being, three years ago, the Slovenian Foreign Minister was elected. When we look at the 75 years of the United Nations, a large number of PGAs have been sitting Foreign Ministers. Were you surprised by Afghanistan’s candidature and disappointed that it did not allow this to be a unanimous win for the Maldives, even in South Asia? Afghanistan had been the President of the General Assembly in 1966. And this is the first time that the Maldives has contested this election. When you look at the history of the United Nations in the last 75 years, there is a generally accepted principle of rotation, when it comes to the PGA, with only three exceptions. When I spoke to my brother [Afghanistan Foreign Minister] Mohammed Atmar, I tried to convey to him the Maldives’ desire to have a clean slate. But on hindsight, I must thank Dr. [Zalmai] Rassoul, for being there, and having conducted a very dignified, disciplined campaign. Having a contender gave me an opportunity to put in a lot more effort.  India has always been one of our closest friends, the best friend, that has always come to the assistance of the Maldives||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/human-rights-should-be-the-central-theme-when-it-comes-to-people/article34774268.ece
10 June 2021||Mumbai,||Heavy rain affects life in Mumbai||Heavy rains lashed Mumbai and its suburbs on Wednesday, leading to disruption in local train services, as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced the onset of the southwest monsoon in Maharashtra. As forecast by the IMD last week, all parts of Mumbai experienced heavy to very heavy rainfall. The Regional Meteorological Centre has forecast similar weather for the next five days in the coastal parts of Maharashtra, while an orange alert has been issued in Mumbai for the next four days. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Mumbai received 181.01 mm of rainfall in the 12 hours from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday. According to the data, the city area received 137.82 mm of rainfall, while its western and eastern suburbs received 190.78 mm and 214.44 mm of rainfall respectively. Incessant rain led to water-logging at Hindmata Junction in central Mumbai, King’s Circle, Sion, Andheri subway, Khar subway, BPT Colony, Sardar Hotel Junction, Shanmukhananda Hall area, Nair hospital area, Wadala Library Junction, Mankhurd railway station and a few other low-lying parts of the city. Six incidents of wall collapse were recorded, but no injuries were reported. 197 pumps deployed The rainfall’s intensity was the highest between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. Nine centres in the city recorded more than 200 mm of rainfall till 3 p.m. P. Velrasu, BMC Additional Municipal Commissioner, said, “Heavy rainfall coincided with the high tide. As a result, water couldn’t be drained through drainage lines. A total of 197 pumps were used between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to drain water.” The Central Railway suspended train services on the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) to Thane main line at 9.55 a.m. owing to flooding in Kurla and other areas. Similarly, traffic was suspended on the CSMT-Mankhurd Harbour Line after the water level rose above four inches due to heavy rainfall and high tide. Train services on the slow track were restored at 8 p.m. The Railways said it was working in coordination with the BMC to restore services. “High tide at 11.43 a.m. combined with high rainfall led to flooding in the city and on railway tracks. All railway pumps at Chunabhatti, Sion and Kurla are working to pump out water from the tracks,” the Central Railway said. Several long-distance trains were rescheduled. Local train services on all lines were restored by 9 p.m. Though rainfall subsided after 6 p.m., the IMD announced that heavy to very heavy rainfall was expected over the next five days due to strengthening of westerly winds along the coast due to the presence of a low pressure area over the sea.  Heavy rainfall coincided with high tide. As a result, water couldn’t be drained through drainage lines P.

10 June 2021||Lucknow,||Kin of patients who died in Agra hospital seek probe||The relatives of patients who died at a hospital in Agra have demanded a high-level probe and the arrest of the owner after a video surfaced in which he is allegedly he-ard talking of conducting a “mock-drill” to check which patient would survive if oxygen support was cut off. Among the victims was police head constable Ashok Kumar Singh’s wife who died on April 26 at Shri Paras Hospital. She was admitted on April 25. Mr. Singh demanded a high-level probe. “This was a deliberate act. The doctor of the hospital should be arrested. We want justice,” he said. Mr. Singh said he received a call from the hospital around 5 a.m. on April 26. “The doctor said there was scarcity of oxygen, and asked to shift the patient elsewhere. But when I reached the hospital, they said they could manage for an hour or so. They also asked me to arrange our own cylinders,” Mr. Singh said. He said he was not allowed to see his wife on the day of her death. The matter came to light on Tuesday after the owner of Shri Paras Hospital, Arinjay Jain, was heard in a video allegedly claiming how the hospital shut off oxygen supply for five minutes on April 27 as part of a “mock drill” to see which patients would su-rvive and which would not. Hospital sealed Twenty-two patients started turning blue while 74 others survived, he is heard saying in the video. Following a preliminary probe, Agra District Magistrate N. Prabhu ordered an FIR against Mr. Jain under the epidemics Act, while the hospital was sealed and the doctor’s licence suspended. Mr. Prabhu, however, said there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen in the hospital on the said days, April 26 and 27. On April 26 and 27, seven patients had died at the hospital, the administration said. Vishal Sharma, a journalist with a Hindi daily, lost his mother to COVID-19 at the hospital. While there was an oxygen crisis at the hospital and in the district on April 26 and 27, he says he never doubted the integrity of the doctors. However, Mr. Jain’s admission has ignited doubt in his mind and he thinks there had been some “misdoing”. “The doctor is saying it all himself,” he said. Mr. Sharma claimed that on the day of his mother’s death, they were not allowed to view the patients through the CCTV, as was the usual practice since they were not permitted inside the COVID-19 ward. Mr. Sharma said the FIR lodged against the hospital was “an eyewash”. “They should take such action that these things don’t repeat.” The kin of patients also claimed that the number of people who died on the two days was much higher than the official figure of seven.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kin-of-patients-who-died-in-agra-hospital-seek-probe/article34774279.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Revive free ration scheme for migrants, activists urge Centre||The Centre must operationalise the Supreme Court’s recent orders to ensure migrant workers’ welfare by reviving and expanding last year’s Atma Nirbhar scheme to provide free rations to such workers and other needy people who do not have ration cards, according to three activists who are intervenors in the case in the top court. They have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and all Chief Ministers to push for urgent implementation of the Supreme Court orders on May 13 and 24, directing that all migrant and stranded workers be provided dry rations and cooked food. “During this time of crisis, it is unconscionable to not provide basic food and social security to the economically vulnerable workers of the country,” said the letter to the Prime Minister, written by Anjali Bhardwaj, Harsh Mander and Jagdeep Chhokar. “At a time when the government has record high stock of foodgrains — 100 million tonnes as per the FCI website — and there is acute distress among the working poor, this stock must be used to provide rations to all those in need. Food security net must not only be restricted to ration cardholders,” they said. The activists also urged the PM to ensure that the Supreme Court’s directions regarding the registration of migrants, unorganised sector and construction workers were also followed. “Many of the actions by the States entail first actions by the Union government,” they said. In the letter to Chief Ministers of all States, the activists called for cooked food to be provided to migrants through community kitchens as the court had directed, apart from the distribution of dry rations. They also urged that cash transfers be given as compensation for the loss of livelihoods due to lockdowns imposed by States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/revive-free-ration-scheme-for-migrants-activists-urge-centre/article34774283.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Hybrid hearings to continue in courts||Supreme Court e-Committee Chairperson Justice D.Y. Chandrachud has written to the Chief Justices (CJs) of the High Courts that hybrid hearings will have to continue considering the pandemic situation, dispelling notions that courts may revert to the physical hearing mode soon. The onset of the pandemic in March 2020 witnessed a quick transition within the judiciary from physical hearings to videoconferencing. Justice Chandrachud noted that 96,74,257 cases were examined through videoconferencing across the country during the pandemic. “Considering the present situation of the pandemic, consistent with the need to protect the safety of lawyers, litigants, court staff, judges and other stakeholders, it may not be possible to conduct only physical hearings of court proceedings and we may have to rely upon a hybrid model of hearing for some time. We need to plan effectively to be able to deal with all exigencies,” he wrote to the CJs. Uniform mechanism Justice Chandrachud, who has spearheaded the transition of the courts from physical to virtual mode, said the committee was working on a uniform videoconferencing mechanism for courts across the country. However, until then, the letter requested the CJs to “opt for a suitable videoconferencing solution from any of the available options”. Robust solution “Until the e-Committee can eventually provide one video conferencing solution for all High Courts, certain steps can be taken to facilitate judicial work, on the re-opening of courts after the summer recess... We must ensure that a robust, efficient and user-friendly videoconferencing solution is available to users for effective hearing of court proceedings,” Justice Chandrachud wrote. He urged the CJs to take corrective measures, intervene personally and keep an eye to help improve the virtual court system, especially if advocates and litigants have grievances about its quality and connectivity that impede their right to access to justice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hybrid-hearings-to-continue-in-courts/article34774272.ece
10 June 2021||Srinagar,||With jabs and SOPs, Kashmir gears up to welcome tourists||From vaccinating 80% stakeholders to elaborate guidelines for hotels, the Tourism Department in Kashmir has chalked out a meticulous plan to receive tourists again, as the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic dips significantly. “We are working on two fronts for safe and secure means of reviving tourism, as the pandemic level is likely to dip further. First, special vaccination drives for all stakeholders involved with the tourism industry. Two, capacity building on protocols to handle tourists and ensure their safety during the stay in Kashmir,” Ahsan-ul-Haq Chisthi, Deputy Director in the Tourism Department, told The Hindu . According to the department, around 75% tourism stakeholders, including shikarawalas, houseboat owners and hotel staff around the Dal lake, have been vaccinated. Similar vaccination drives were also conducted in tourist hotspots of Pahalgam and Gulmarg. “We are speeding up the vaccination drive to ensure that all get double doses in time,” Mr. Chisthi said. The Tourism Department, along with the Health Department and expert academics from Kashmir, is working on capacity building among the hotel staff to train them on how to deal with tourist flow. “We are working on new Standard Operating Procedures [SOPs] for hotels, like ensuring well ventilated and airy spaces, and new guidelines for the staff and restaurants,” Mr. Chisthi said. The Gondola in Gulmarg, Asia’s highest cable car project, has also been directed to reduce the number of tourists ferried in a cabin. ‘Make RT-PCR must’ Meanwhile, Kashmir-based tour operators have demanded that RT-PCR test should be made mandatory for all tourists heading for Kashmir now. “Rapid Antigen Tests at the Srinagar airport have not been effective during the second wave. RT-PCR should be made must and the number of tourists travelling to Kashmir need to be regulated,” said Nasir Shah, chairman of the Indian Association of Tour Operators, Jammu and Kashmir Chapter.

10 June 2021||HYDERABAD,||CCMB scientists discover new enzyme for cell stability||The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) scientists here have discovered an enzyme that helps maintain the stability and integrity of cell walls in bacteria such as Escherichia coli .  Named ‘LdtF’, the enzyme plays a vital role in the formation of covalent linkages between the bacterial outer membrane and an inner polymer layer that protects bacteria from environmental stress. This study will help understand the fundamental bacterial cell wall biology and identify alternate drug targets for the development of new antimicrobials. Cell wall of gram-negative bacteria has an outer membrane and an inner membrane. Sandwiched between these two membranes is a layer of ‘peptidoglycan’, a polymer of amino acids and sugars that form a protective layer. A lipoprotein is known to link the outer membrane to the layer of peptidoglycan. But, how the linkages between the lipoprotein and peptidoglycan are modified is not known. CCMB scientists led by Manjula Reddy studied the cell wall biology of a well-studied strain of E. coli u sing genetic and biochemical approaches to identify ‘LdtF’ which could cleave the lipoprotein from the peptidoglycan. Absence of this LdtF enhanced growth defects and increased the peptidoglycan-lipoprotein linkages in the bacteria. The presence of this enzyme, however, decreased the levels of peptidoglycan-bound lipoprotein, suggesting its role in modulating the peptidoglycan-lipoprotein linkages. Such LdtF-mediated modulation of the cell wall gives bacteria flexibility and a survival advantage in fluctuating environmental conditions, said Dr. Reddy. The research finding has been featured in the latest Nature India magazine.  LdtF-mediated modulation of the cell wall gives bacteria flexibility and a survival advantage in fluctuating environmental conditions.

10 June 2021||New Delhi,||Jitin playing politics of convenience: Cong.||Reacting sharply to the exit of Jitin Prasada from the party, the Congress accused him of playing “politics of convenience” and concentrating on short-term gains. At a virtual press conference, party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate, “You don’t need power to serve people, you need the will.” She also pointed out that Mr. Prasada had not shifted to a like-minded party, instead he had made a 360-degree switch. She questioned, “How is he comfortable being in the company of people who are responsible for the death of thousands of people because of their mismanagement of the pandemic? Where is his moral compass?” After joining the BJP, Mr. Prasada claimed that it was no longer relevant to stay in a party where one could not protect the interests of people or work for them. Ms. Shrinate said that his exit had to be placed in context. He had served as a Minister of State during the UPA government’s tenure. “His father, Jitendra Prasada, fought and lost against Congress president Sonia Gandhi for the president’s post. And despite that, he was appointed vice-president of the party and was given key posts till his untimely demise,” Ms. Shrinate said. Jitin Prasada was given Congress ticket to fight from the Shahjahanpur Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh at a very young age, Ms. Shrinate recalled. He was a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC), which is the highest decision-making body of the party. Ahead of the West Bengal election, Mr. Prasada was appointed State in-charge. The Congress drew a blank in the election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jitin-playing-politics-of-convenience-cong/article34774265.ece
10 June 2021||Kolkata,||Modi has to be removed from power: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said her next political move would be to remove Prime Minister Narendra Modi from power. “I have only one thing to say: Modi has to be removed from power,” the Trinamool Congress chairperson said when asked by presspersons what role she wants to play in national politics. Ever since the West Bengal Assembly polls, where the Trinamool Congress defeated the BJP and retained power, questions on what role she will play in national politics have been posed to Ms. Banerjee. Meets farm leaders During the day, she met leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), including Rakesh Tikait, at the State Secretariat and extended support to the farmers’ union protesting against the three Central farm Bills. She would write to the Chief Ministers of the Opposition-ruled States to support the cause of farmers, she stated. SKM leaders said that having defeated the BJP, Ms. Banerjee should strive to make West Bengal a model State for farmers. Ms. Banerjee said, “We have been supporting the protesting farmers from the start. We also passed a resolution in the Assembly against the Bills”. Farm leaders requested her to visit Delhi after the COVID-19 situation improves. The Chief Minister said she would take the initiative so that she could have a meeting with the Chief Ministers of the non-BJP-ruled States on the issue. Why the Centre was not holding talks with the protesting farmers for the past seven months, she asked. The Chief Minister also took on the Centre on GST on COVID-19 vaccines. “Imposing GST on vaccines is like playing with the life and death of people,” she said. Why vaccines were not routed through States, she asked. It was a “dirty drive against the State government”, she alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-has-to-be-removed-from-power-mamata/article34774263.ece
10 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||Pakke Tiger Reserve’s contingency staff begin strike||More than 200 contingency workers of the Pakke Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh went on an indefinite strike from Wednesday over non-payment of wages since December 2020.  Reserve unguarded The 862 sq.km. tiger reserve in Pakke-Kessang district has been left unguarded as all the 202 workers, along with their eight elephants, converged at the tiger reserve’s administrative office to demand wages pending for the last six months. “Our strike was scheduled from May 2 but was withdrawn after the Environment and Forest Minister [Mama Natung] promised that wages would be released. We can manage somehow, but all of us have families to maintain with our meagre wages,” Pakke Tiger Reserve Workers’ Union general secretary Nikum Nabam said. Other than payment of wages of the staff under Project Tiger, the union has demanded regularisation of the Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF), an increase of wage last revised in 2018 to Rs. 11,000 per month and monthly payout instead of periodic disbursement. The Pakke contingency workers were given their wages from April-November 2020 after the National Tiger Conservation Authority sanctioned Rs. 6.05 crore for 2020-2021 fiscal and released a part of it.  Second instalment “The second instalment of Rs. 1.32 crore was released in January but the money is lying in the State exchequer instead of being transferred to the Divisional Forest Officer of our tiger reserve for disbursement of wages,” Mr. Nabam said, adding that the workers have been borrowing or surviving on meagre donations. Mr. Natung said the workers should have waited two-three days. “There were no officers to handle their wages due to the COVID-19-induced emergency situation. But the process has been started and they should get their wages in a few days,” the Minister told The Hindu from State capital Itanagar. Green activists recalled a similar situation two years ago that led to the discontinuation of services of 53 frontline staff in the 1,895 sq. km Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh. “We know protecting the tiger habitats is crucial for the conservation of the striped cat in India, but it is difficult to focus on empty stomachs,” a member of the Pakke workers’ union said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pakke-tiger-reserves-contingency-workers-go-on-strike/article34774456.ece

There is no clarity in the latest order whether those applying for jobs will have to submit permanent residence certificates or domicile certificate,” Mr. Tarigami said.

10 June 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. officials targeted in phishing attempt||Several government offices, including Defence Ministry officials, were on Wednesday targeted by a malicious web link sent on WhatsApp and SMS, asking them to update their vaccination status. The message asked officials to click on www.covid19india.in to generate a digital certificate of COVID-19 inoculation. The SMS, signed with an abbreviation “MoHFW”, that expands to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said, “as per directives of MoHFW, Confirm your COVID status on https://covid19india.in and generate your vaccination certificate”. An official said that when he clicked on the link, it directed to a page “@gov.in” that resembled the government website mygov.in, and asked to key in the official e-mail and password An e-mail received by a Defence Ministry official said that as part of an awareness drive regarding “post vaccination measures to be followed by armed forces” a questionnaire was required to be filled and a Google drive link was shared. Some officials even received phone calls where the caller said he was calling from an Army Hospital and the official need to update the vaccination status on a link being sent on WhatsApp. The officials were sensitised to not click on the link as it appeared to be a phishing attempt to access their official e-mails and correspondence. A considerable part of government offices are still working from home owing to COVID-19 restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-officials-targeted-in-phishing-attempt/article34774254.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Central deputation of officers very low: DoPT||“Many officers from Uttar Pradesh have applied but they are not getting a clearance,” said the official. As per norms, States have to depute All India Services (AIS)officers, including Indian Police Service (IPS) officers, to Central government offices and at any point it cannot be more than 40% of the total cadre strength. In a letter to States on June 4, the DoPT has said “the number of nominations received so far has been very minimal and as such the representation of officers from various cadres/ services, especially at the deputy secretary/director level, is extremely low.” The DoPT had sent a similar communication in December 2020 but in the past two years it has not been able to fill vacancies at the director and joint secretary level in various Central ministries. Around 40% or 390 CSS posts are at the joint secretary level (more than 19 years experience) and 60% or 540 such posts are at the rank of deputy secretary (nine years) or director rank (14 years of service). “…. every cadre is allowed a deputation reserve to ensure that officers have the opportunity to work on deputation including that under the Central Staffing Scheme [CSS], which adds to their experience. The utilisation of this reserve is low and this underutilisation, particularly at the deputy secretary/director level, causes serious gaps in cadre management. This aspect will also be kept in view by the DoPT while considering cadre review proposals, to be received in future. The cadres that have not been forwarding adequate nominations for the CSS at various levels may have to settle for less number of additional senior duty posts in future by way of corresponding reduction,” the letter stated. Age limit The DoPT has stated that officers nominated for Central government posts should not be more than 54 years. “It is also requested to ensure that the officers who are on the verge of promotion, as may be relevant, during the year are not nominated, often necessitating their early repatriation to avail of promotion in the cadre. It may be ensured that the names of only those officers are forwarded who are likely to remain available under the Central Staffing Scheme for full tenure,” it said. Last year, to tide over the crisis, the DoPT changed norms and made it mandatory for IAS officers from 2007 batch onward to mandatorily serve for two years in Central deputation within first 16 years of their service if they wanted to be empanelled for a joint secretary rank in the future. Before any officer of the AIS is called for deputation to the Centre, his or her concurrence is required. The Establishment Officer in the DoPT invites nominations from the State governments. Once the nomination is received, their eligibility is scrutinised by a panel and then an offer list is prepared, traditionally done with the State government on board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/central-deputation-of-officers-very-low-dopt/article34774255.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Jitin Prasada leaves Congress to join BJP||Mr. Goyal specially mentioned Mr. Prasada’s father, the late senior Congress leader Jitendra Prasada, as one who had rendered great service to the people of Uttar Pradesh. “I have been watching Jitin Prasada for many years, he lost his father when he was quite young, but he took on the mantle, and decided to serve Uttar Pradesh, winning two Lok Sabha elections in 2004 and 2009. He has been diligent in his push for development of his constituency, lobbying hard with the government since 2014 for a railway project in the area,” he said. Mr. Goyal, sources said, was instrumental in negotiations between Mr. Prasada and the BJP’s top leadership before the induction. Brahmin factor Sources said Mr. Prasada’s induction was a response to heavy feedback from the Uttar Pradesh unit of the BJP that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s reported close identification with the Rajput community was alienating Brahmins, who form at least 12% of the vote in the State. “The community also punches above its weight in terms of societal influence,” said a source in the BJP. Mr. Prasada, who had formed a Brahmin Chetana Manch, with a patchy record of influence, is being seen as a part of the BJP national leadership’s move to press the reset button on the Brahmin-Rajput equations, and settle the consolidation of upper caste votes in favour of the party. It is also significant that the induction comes at a time when BJP and RSS leaders have been engaged in stocktaking exercises in Lucknow and the report submitted to party president J.P. Nadda on that exercise mentioned the resentment of Brahmin leaders in the party against Mr. Adityanath. Mr. Prasada’s entry into the party may unsettle some equations in the BJP, not just in the Adityanath camp but also those Brahmin leaders in the party who were jockeying for position as purveyors of the interests of the community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jitin-prasada-leaves-congress-to-join-bjp/article34774256.ece

The added focus on nutri-rich nutri-cereals is to incentivise its production in the areas where rice-wheat cannot be grown without long term adverse implications for groundwater table,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/paddy-msp-hiked-less-than-4-from-last-year/article34774257.ece

He said the government should speak to farmers to understand why they are seeking repeal of the laws. Urging the government to be sensitive to the pain and anguish of farmers, Mr. Badal said, “It is shocking that the NDA government is effectively telling farmers that there is no space for discussion in a democracy.” He said it was more shocking that besides ruling out any talks on taking back the three black laws, Mr. Tomar had asserted that the agricultural laws were in the interest of farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hold-fresh-talks-with-farmers-says-akali-dal/article34774266.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The ultimate destination||The Vishnu Sahasranama is Bhishma’s response to the very pertinent questions that Yudhishtira poses. Who is the one Supreme Deity? Who is the sole and supreme goal for all? By chanting whose names, by praising and by worshipping which person can mankind attain good? Which is the dharma that is considered best by you? By reciting what hymn is mankind freed of all troubles and from the cycle of birth? Yudhishtira exemplifies the troubled soul caught in samsara struggling to follow the path of dharma against the powerful forces of evil and adharma, pointed out Sri Sriramana Sarma in a discourse. Bhishma draws attention to the Supreme Brahman to whom the entire universe with all its beings owes its existence. He alone is to be propitiated. How can His nature be described? The Supreme Lord is the essence of all effulgence, of the highest penance, of the highest Brahman, and He is also the ultimate destination for all beings in this creation. He is the abode of all auspiciousness and His power is unlimited. He is the embodiment of all penance and His word is the law which He enforces by the sheer power of His yoga. The Upanishads state that the sun, moon, stars and the other planets in the galaxy dare not transgress the law He has put in force. Moreover, they owe their effulgence, heat and light to His grace alone. Bhishma asserts that every troubled soul is sure to find solace by praising the Lord with His divine names. This hymn, which is venerated by all, carries the promise to fulfill desires, ward off evil influences, free one from diseases, fear, disasters, etc, and above all from the bondage of samsara. No matter whatever be our state of life and existence on earth, we all have to seek, search and try to reach Him who is the ultimate destination for all.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-ultimate-destination/article34774270.ece

Tilak Chandar,TAMIL NADU||Suggestions from Pudukottai student on developing villages earn praise from High Court||A Class XI government school student from Pudukkottai district earned praise from the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday for coming up with suggestions to develop the villages in the State by utilising available resources. The court was hearing the public interest litigation petition filed by V. Lakshman, the father of L. Gowri. The petitioner said his daughter was interested in developing their village, Kalvirayan Viduthy. He said Gowri formulated a project and methodology titled ‘National Rural Development Research Project’. She collected data on the village, its population and the hurdles they faced. She also offered solutions to the problems of the people, he said. Impressed by the data collected by the girl, who studies in Thanjavur, a Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi sought her presence (via videoconferencing) during the hearing of the PIL petition. Gowri informed the judges that one of the methods to overcome the hurdles faced by the villagers was creation of a post called ‘Village Collector’ in each village to deal with the public issues. The judges told her that the role of the VAO was similar to what she had suggested and asked if there was a need to create a new post called ‘Village Collector’. She said the Village Collectors should be one with knowledge to deal with rural issues. The student told the judges that her father would submit petitions to the authorities for the welfare of the village and he would have to spend an entire day at the government office. A Village Collector could associate with the villages to redress grievances, she said. The judges appreciated the girl and suggested that she revise her report. The judges asked her to highlight the key points and submit it so that the authorities could take a look at the points and get back for the next hearing.

10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu sees 17,321 cases, 405 deaths||Tamil Nadu reported 17,321 fresh COVID-19 cases and 405 deaths on Wednesday, taking the State’s tally to 22,92,025 and toll to 28,170. Compared to 15 days ago, cases have nearly halved, said Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian. “The number of COVID-19 cases is gradually reducing. The situation is under control in 25 districts. In four districts alone, the numbers remain the same or are varying. Nine districts need additional focus,” he said. In Coimbatore, 2,319 people tested positive, followed by 1,405 in Erode and 1,345 in Chennai. While Salem reported 957 cases, Tiruppur saw 913. The State’s active caseload dipped further to 2,04,258. Of these, Coimbatore accounts for the most number of active cases at 24,022 and is followed by Tiruppur (18,359). Chennai accounts for 14,678 active cases and Erode 13,724. As many as 31,253 people were discharged after treatment, taking the total figure to 20,59,597. The State tested 1,80,750 samples in the last 24 hours — the highest figure in a day so far. Till date, 2,92,43,359 samples have been tested. Coimbatore (62) reported more fatalities than Chennai (52). There were 29 deaths in Chengalpattu and 23 in Salem. Among the deceased was a 21-year-old woman from Dharmapuri. The Medical Minister, who participated in an event at Gurunanak College, said so far, 1,052 people had been affected by mucormycosis in the State. Amid a shortage of COVID-19 vaccines, only 12,609 people were vaccinated in the State on Wednesday. The overall coverage now stands at 97,62,957.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-sees-17321-cases-405-deaths/article34774816.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Metrowater plans to increase quantity of water supply||Chennai Metrowater is mulling over an increase in the quantity of water being supplied to the city as more added areas have now been provided with drinking water infrastructure. At present, the city and added areas are being provided with 846.41 million litres a day (mld) of water. Of this, nearly 815.21 mld is provided as domestic supply for those in the city and added areas, and the remaining to industrial and municipal supply. With Veeranam tank in Cuddalore expected to receive water around the third week of June, the agency is planning to begin drawal to augment the city’s supply after June 25. Metrowater officials said about 90 mld of water was being sourced from the Paravanar river belt, borewells and the NLC’s mines. Once Veeranam tank, which is dry now, begins to receive water, there are plans to draw about 130 mld initially and subsequently, drawal from other sources in Cuddalore district would be stopped. “We are planning to increase the city's water supply to 900 mld-930 mld to enable better access for consumers in added areas. However, drinking water would be provided to merged areas on alternate days for now,” said an official. Some of the localities annexed with the Greater Chennai Corporation, including Theeyambakkam, Vadaperumbakkam, and those along East Coast Road, like Palavakkam, Injambakkam and Perungudi, now have a water pipeline network. Similarly, Metrowater has provided infrastructure in neighbouring local bodies, such as Pammal and Pallavaram. With growing population and urbanisation, the water demand has increased to 1,100 mld to 1,200 mld and steps are being taken to bridge the shortfall. The Water Resources Department (WRD) expects Mettur water to reach Veeranam tank by the third week of June. The tank has a capacity of 1,465 million cubic feet of water. Officials said the WRD would complete desilting work being carried out in supply and surplus channels of the tank by June 20. Other improvement works would be temporarily suspended. Once water storage in Veeranam tank is built, water would be released for irrigation needs in August or September, officials said. “We also expect Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh to reach the State border in Uthukottai, Tiruvallur district, around June 16-17. This will also help boost water resources for the city’s supply,” said an official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metrowater-plans-to-increase-quantity-of-water-supply/article34774788.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||It’s imperative to not allow an inch of forest land to be encroached: HC||It is absolutely imperative that not even an inch of forest land in the State be allowed to be encroached upon by anyone, the Madras High Court observed on Wednesday. It also impressed upon the need to maintain the forest lands well without spoiling their pristine glory. First Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said so while passing interim orders on a public interest litigation petition alleging encroachment of reserve forest land at Naduvattam village in Nilgiris district to build a private resort. The judges directed the Nilgiris Collector and the forest department officials to immediately visit the spot and find out whether the forest land had been encroached upon as alleged by the litigant S. Prabakaran, a local resident. The officials were also directed to survey the lands to ascertain the charge of encroachment. If it was found that the forest lands had been encroached, they should be retrieved and restored to their pristine status, the judges said. They also took serious note of the submission made by petitioner’s counsel C. Vigneswaran that a Chennai based woman doctor, constructing the resort, had laid pipelines to draw water from forest lands. “If such is the case, the same must be stopped immediately and the negligent or recalcitrant forest officials identified and steps taken against them for not being able to protect the relevant forest,” the court ordered and directed the forest department officials to file an action taken report after three weeks. They also referred the case to Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram to treat the matter with the degree of seriousness it deserves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/its-imperative-to-not-allow-an-inch-of-forest-land-to-be-encroached-hc/article34774448.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Sai University will start functioning from August, says founder-chancellor||Sai University, one of the two private universities for which the Tamil Nadu government granted permission in 2018, will start functioning from August, according to its founder-chancellor K.V. Ramani. To begin with, around 250 to 300 students will be admitted to three undergraduate programmes in liberal arts, science and technology, and a postgraduate programme in law. A telecom software entrepreneur, philanthropist and ardent devotee of Shirdi Sai Baba, Mr. Ramani, who is 70 years old, told The Hindu, “It is perhaps my last project, given my age. I intend to see it as a full-fledged university before my 80th birthday.” Genesis of university Mr. Ramani said he conceived of the university when he came to know that no educational institute in the country figured among the top 100 global institutions. He approached the State government in January 2018 to set up the university and, in July that year, the government introduced the Private Universities Act. Tamil Nadu earlier had only one private university — the Annamalai University — which was taken over by the State government a few years ago. The Act stipulated that the institution should be a greenfield university and hence, Mr. Ramani had to purchase 105 acres of contiguous land, which he did in Payyanur, about 8 km from Mamallapuram. Construction is on in full swing, with work on one building having already been completed. “We now have 40 scholars, half of whom are international faculty,” he said. “Sai University is going to be a service-oriented institution. We will make a surplus that will go towards expanding, building and developing the university. It is not for the personal gain of any single family,” Mr. Ramani said. “Nearly half of the students abroad are from India and China, and nearly half of the faculty are from India and China. The key differentiator for a university is the government policy, besides infrastructure for research and academic development, and freedom for the faculty to do what they like, to conduct research. So, Sai University will be the first to provide a global ecosystem in India,” he claimed. The Rs. 750 crore project will be partly funded through own sources (the Trust), with the rest of the funding coming from other institutions. Mr. Ramani believes the concept of a global university is doable. He points to the growth of software services and the private healthcare sector, both of which have developed in the past 30 years. “In the IT sector, we created an industry from zero. Today, when we go to fund a software company [in Western countries], they first ask us, ‘What is your India plan? If you don’t have an India plan, you get a tie-up done and then come to us’,” he said. Admission process Similarly, 35 years ago, Indians went abroad for a bypass surgery. Today, India is sought after by foreigners for healthcare. “We want to repeat the same magic in the education sector,” he said. Admission to the university will be based on the Class 12 marks or the scores in competitive exams like SAT or the Pearson’s test that students may have taken on their own. Alternatively, students may take a test offered by the university. There will be a faculty interaction session and group discussion (GD) from next year. The GD has been shelved this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Course structure Students will undertake a year of foundational courses that will include exposure to critical and analytical thinking, data analysis, presentation and communication skills and tech skills. They will then be exposed to subjects across various disciplines and can choose a bouquet of courses for their degree. The university’s governing council includes five Padma awardees. The institution is also planning to offer courses in engineering, technology, management and medicine later. “The fee structure will be a fourth or fifth of what students spend on undergraduate education abroad,” Mr. Ramani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sai-university-will-start-functioning-from-august-says-founder-chancellor/article34774794.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Assembly session from June 21||The Assembly session will commence at the Kalaivanar Arangam at 10 a.m. on June 21 with the Governor's Address, Assembly Speaker M. Appavu announced in Chennai on Wednesday. Mr. Appavu told journalists that the Business Advisory Committee would meet after the Governor’s address to decide on the number of days that the House would meet. All legislators and Assembly officials will be tested for COVID-19 and only those testing negative will be allowed to take part in the proceedings, he said. Arrangements have been made to ensure adherence to physical distancing norms. Replying to a query on whether the session would have Question Hour, the Speaker said it was unlikely. Answering a query on the DMK’s election manifesto, which promised a live telecast of House proceedings, the Speaker said it was being considered. Earlier in the day, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin called on Governor Banwarilal Purohit at the Raj Bhavan to discuss about the first Assembly session under the DMK government. Mr. Stalin also briefed Mr. Purohit about the COVID-19 scenario in the State. The Chief Minister and the Governor also presented books to each other. Minister for Water Resources Duraimurugan, Chief Secretary V.

10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Woman undergoes renal transplant||A 35-year-old woman, who recovered from COVID-19 recently, underwent a renal transplant at Kauvery Hospital in Chennai. Her mother, who donated her kidney, also recovered from the infection recently. The Madurai-based patient had come to Chennai for management of chronic kidney failure. The patient was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy, which led to a deterioration in kidney function, necessitating immediate transplant. The patient’s mother offered to donate a kidney. The hospital’s chief nephrologist, R. Balasubramaniyam, said just as the investigation to check for compatibility and eligibility was completed, the women developed COVID-19 symptoms. Their CT scans were normal and hence, they were placed under home quarantine. After recovery, they were tested for antibody levels, which indicated “they were well-protected from further COVID-19. We then went ahead with the transplant procedure,” Dr. Balasubramaniyam said. The transplant was successful. The donor was discharged three days after the procedure and the patient was discharged after six days. The creatinine levels also fell, leading to a shorter stay in hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/woman-undergoes-renal-transplant/article34774565.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. urged to extend special benefits to sugar cardholders||Even as the civil supplies authorities are planning to start the distribution of the second instalment of cash support of Rs. 2,000 each, along with a hamper of essential commodities, to rice cardholders by the middle of the month, sections of sugar-drawing cardholders have demanded that the government extend the benefits to them too. Among the various benefits being provided by the government to rice cardholders is the additional entitlement of free rice this month and next month. There are about 2.1 crore rice-drawing cards and three lakh sugar cards, apart from about 50,000 non-commodity cards. By providing a total of Rs. 4,000 in cash support, along with a pack of 14 essential commodities to every rice-drawing cardholder, the government will spend more than Rs. 9,000 crore. Pointing out that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted all sections of people, a senior citizen from Thiruvanmiyur, who holds a sugar card, said the government should not discriminate between rice cardholders and sugar cardholders while disbursing the benefits. The sugar cardholders, too, were from the middle class, a large section of whom had otherwise been covered as they were holding rice cards, he said. T. Sadagopan, a consumer activist, supported the demand, adding that the pandemic had rendered even fairly well-off sections of society economically vulnerable. Officials said the distinction was part of government policy. There was nothing new in what was being done, as this had been the case even in the past when colour television sets, wet grinder-mixies and table fans were distributed. There was an implication that by opting for sugar cards, those cardholders didn’t need government support, which was why they were excluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-urged-to-extend-special-benefits-to-sugar-cardholders/article34774792.ece

10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Late referrals of the critically ill put govt. hospitals in a fix||A critically-ill patient diagnosed with COVID-19, who was undergoing treatment at a private hospital, was shifted to a government hospital at about 11 p.m. He died three hours later. Similarly, an octogenarian, referred from a private facility to a government hospital, was declared dead on arrival. Such incidents have become common in Chennai’s government hospitals. Last-minute referrals of critically-ill COVID-19 patients from private hospitals are not only putting government hospitals in a fix but are also causing mental agony to families of the victims, say senior doctors. Every day, the major government hospitals in Chennai receive a number of critically-ill COVID-19 patients, even in intubated states, from private hospitals. Most of them are late referrals. “A majority of such patients are flown in ambulances late in the evening. Most emergency calls that we get after 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. are of such patients. We receive at least 10-15 such cases a day. Almost all of them are last-minute referrals and about 90% of them die in six to eight hours or a maximum of a day. They are shifted in very critical conditions, including in intubated states. They are shifted to government hospitals after seven to eight days of treatment in private facilities,” a doctor at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital said on the condition of anonymity. Recently, the hospital received eight very critically-ill patients, all late referrals, from private hospitals on a single day, he noted. A doctor at the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital said they received a patient who was referred from a private hospital. He died five minutes after arrival. When the hospital added about 50 beds to its ICU during the peak, 40 of them were occupied by the evening as there were many such referrals, he said. While the deaths of patients referred in the eleventh hour are accounted for by the respective government hospitals, doctors say it causes a lot of distress to families of the deceased. “From top hospitals to nursing homes, many institutions resort to last-minute referrals. Private hospitals should avoid such referrals of critically-ill patients to at least save the families from mental agony. The families are traumatised and such practices can be avoided in the best interest of the patients,” he said. A Health Department official said, “Patients should be referred with complete treatment history, at a mutually convenient time. Private hospitals should also make sure that the patient’s condition will not worsen during the transit.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/late-referrals-of-the-critically-ill-put-govt-hospitals-in-a-fix/article34774807.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||After COVID-19 rush, Chennai hospitals on track to normalcy||Unlike during the first wave of COVID-19, several major hospitals in Chennai managed to simultaneously run non-COVID-19 services, except having to suspend elective surgeries. Now, with a steady decline in cases, the number of people visiting outpatient departments is on the rise, and hospitals are all set to resume elective surgeries soon. Last year, some major hospitals brought their non-COVID-19 services to a halt as the inflow of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 started to rise. However, this has not been the case during the second wave — all major government hospitals ran outpatient services by making alternative arrangements. E. Theranirajan, Dean of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, said they did not halt any non-COVID-19 services during the second wave. “Emergency services, as well as non-COVID-19 outpatient departments (OPD) and surgical OPDs functioned as usual in the last few months. Only the number of patients coming to OPDs reduced during the period. It reduced to 300-400 a day during the peak of COVID-19, and the numbers are gradually rising now. On Wednesday, we had nearly 4,000 people visiting non- COVID-19 OPDs,” he said. With the inflow of infected people — both OP and in-patient — reducing, the hospital is slowly resuming regular activities. “We have 130 admissions and around 160-170 outpatients for COVID-19 every day. We had stopped only elective surgeries, and those are now being resumed slowly,” he added. At the Government Stanley Medical College (SMC) Hospital, outpatient services were shifted to the nearby Bharathi Women’s College as soon as COVID-19 cases started to rise. Separate teams of doctors were posted for OPD services, P. Balaji, Dean of SMC, said. “We have been handling emergencies, and OPDs have been operational throughout the second wave. We moved the emergency, trauma and TAEI wards to the diabetology block on the premises of the Institute of Social Paediatrics of the hospital. Similarly, the emergency operation theatre (OT) has been functioning in the paediatric OT,” he said. The number of people coming to non-COVID-19 OPDs has increased to over 1,000, after declining to 400-500 a day. “By the end of this week, if the active caseload drops below 500, we will start doing non-COVID-19 work in full swing. Elective cases are yet to start at the hospital,” he said. Venkatachalam, director of medical services, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, said the hospital had resumed non-COVID-19 services. “Acute COVID-19 patient inflow has significantly reduced in the last 10 days. However, we continue to receive post-COVID-19 patients with complications. All stringent safety measures are being continued,” he said. The inflow of COVID-19 patients has slightly reduced, Navin Gnanasekaran, associate director of medical services, MGM Healthcare, said. “Right now, we have started cardiology, general surgery and semi-emergency services. We have started opening up certain OPDs, such as ENT and ophthalmology, due to the rise in mucormycosis cases. We are slowly increasing surgeries and elective procedures,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-covid-19-rush-chennai-hospitals-on-track-to-normalcy/article34774809.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai Corporation plans more mini cleaning camps||Riding on the success of its ‘10-day mass cleaning programme’, the Chennai Corporation plans to have a regular cleaning exercise every month. The civic body removed nearly 13,300 tonnes of waste in 15 zones of the city during the campaign between May 27 and June 5. The waste, comprising garbage and construction debris, remained uncleared for several months and the mass cleaning exercise came as a boon for residents. The campaign was also aimed at improving sanitation in public toilets during the COVID-19 pandemic. A senior official of the Health Department of the Corporation said the campaign, an initiative of Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi, was based on hundreds of pending complaints from residents and social activists about the poor condition of the localities. Having made the campaign a success, a schedule is being worked out to organise small campaigns every month by taking one particular division of the 200 in the city. The senior civic official said during the 10-day cleaning campaign held in 1,709 locations, involving nearly 19,200 sanitary and road workers, 10,085 tonnes of dumped debris and 3,260 tonnes of garbage were removed. The civic body put into use all machinery and vehicles, including compactors, earth movers, battery-operated vehicles and tricycles, to remove the huge amount of garbage and debris, he added. As part of the mass cleaning campaign, the civic body, which normally takes up cleaning of waterways including Cooum, Buckingham and Adyar rivers before the onset of the Northeast monsoon, also undertook clearing of the floating debris to ease the flow of water. The success of the campaign was due to the inspection carried out by Superintending Engineers in various localities and a review meeting at Ripon Buildings by the Commissioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-corporation-plans-more-mini-cleaning-camps/article34774789.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rameswaram-Dhanushkodi rail link remains a non-starter||Two years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Rameswaram-Dhanushkodi railway line, work is yet to commence on the 17.2-km stretch, as officials await the sanctioning of the revised cost estimate, which has more than tripled. Only the survey work for the project has been completed. After engineers from IIT-Madras recommended an elevated embankment of about six-seven metres above road level, the original estimate of Rs. 208 crore was revised upwards to Rs. 700 crore, sources in the Southern Railway told The Hindu on Wednesday. The Rameswaram-Dhanushkodi railway line and establishments were washed away along with a train in a devastating cyclone in 1964. The severe storm also brought Dhanushkodi town under water, leaving dozens of people dead. Since the night of December 24 that year, the services of the prestigious Boat Mail, also known as the Indo-Ceylon Express, which provided a boat link to Thalaimannar in Sri Lanka, also came to a halt. “Experts from IIT-M’s Ocean Engineering Department conducted a field study on various aspects, including protective measures like embankment. They recommended an elevated Gabion embankment of about six-seven metres above road level to protect the railway line from flooding. When the cyclone struck in 1964, the tracks had an embankment of less than a metre from road level,” a top railway official said. Since the railway line would be like an elevated corridor with boulder embankment, and other safety parameters were taken into consideration on the basis of detailed soil investigation, the cost of the project had more than tripled. In anticipation of the sanctioning of funds, railway engineers wrote to the Tamil Nadu government, requesting the acquisition of land for the much-awaited rail link in the southeastern tip of India, which would run in the erstwhile alignment along the existing road, the official said. Top priority The restoration of the railway link between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi is listed among the top-priority projects monitored directly by the Prime Minister’s Office. In a note to the General Managers of the Zonal Railways on June 4, the Railway Board listed several key projects Mr. Modi had announced or laid the foundation for, and said monthly progress made in the projects should be updated for perusal by the Prime Minister’s Office. “Proper attention shall be given while reporting the progress. It may be ensured that progress is not reported less in subsequent months as compared to earlier months. Considering the importance of these projects, it is imperative that they be accorded utmost priority and attention from the highest level to ensure completion as per the timelines submitted,” the note said. The priority projects include a new bridge at the Pamban viaduct across the sea connecting Rameswaram, the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail project (508 km), the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link (272 km), and private participation for operation of passenger train services over 12 clusters across the country, among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rameswaram-dhanushkodi-rail-link-remains-a-non-starter/article34774797.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Power billing in excess: consumers||Since Tangedco did not undertake an assessment of meters in the city during the lockdown, thousands of domestic consumers have raised complaints of exorbitant billing. When the State government announced a lockdown from May 10, the Tangedco extended its window for payment of electricity bills, temporarily halting door-to-door assessment after meter assessors refused to do the job fearing the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, Tangedco announced that consumers would have to pay electricity bills from 2019. But after several complaints, domestic consumers were asked to self assess meters and send the readings to local officials for updation. Domestic consumers have since been highlighting billing problems due to the stopping of door-to-door assessment. Some said they had been billed for locked houses. New tenants who occupied houses recently cited high electricity bills and in some cases, there was no billed amount as the house was kept locked in 2019.  A senior Tangedco official said they were receiving hundreds of complaints about such issues. To rectify them, a dedicated WhatsApp facility, 9445850811, had been launched. More than one lakh bills from electricity consumers had been corrected and uploaded, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/power-billing-in-excess-consumers/article34774813.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Title documents of temples go online||Title documents like pattas , chittas and even gift deeds belonging to thousands of temples in the State will be available online on the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department’s website. The Department has completed the matching of data from documents for 3,43,647 acres of land with that on Tamil Nilam , the State’s land records’ repository, said an official. “This amounts to over 70% of land belonging to temples in the State that have 4,78,272 acres under their control. People can go check the lands owned by individual temples on the Department’s site. The documents can be viewed and they have a disclaimer that they cannot be used for anything else,” the official said. The remaining lands have been divided into two — those that match partially with the Tamil Nilam data and those that are not found on it. “We will take steps to bring back land that originally belonged to the temples, but subsequently got transferred to other names. This has already been initiated in many temples,” an official said. Minister for HR&CE P.K. Sekar Babu has started retrieving land belonging to temples. “Chief Minister M.K. Stalin is very particular that interests of the temples should be safeguarded. There have been cases where houses have been constructed on land owned by temples. We will ensure that such people become tenants and the revenue goes to the temples,” he said.  People can go check the lands owned by individual temples on the Department’s site.

10 June 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Secretary of A.M. Jain College passes away||Sardarmal Chordia, secretary of the Agurchand Manmull Jain College, passed away on Wednesday. He was 82. Taking over as the secretary in 1990, he transformed the college, improving infrastructure to a great extent. From a few hundred students in 2000, now there are nearly 8,000 students in the self-financing stream of the college.

10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Consider Class IX scores for Class XI admissions’||The School Education Department has said schools can take the Class IX performance of the students into consideration while allotting them subject groups in Class 11, if the number of students opting for a specific group is much higher than the intake capacity. The Department withdrew an earlier announcement stating that schools could conduct tests, on the basis of which students could be allotted the group of their choice in case the number of applications received is high. In a circular, the School Education Department Commissioner said Class IX marks could be taken into consideration, and schools need not conduct a test based on the Class X portions for allotting groups in Class XI to students. Students seeking admission to Class XI did not write the Class X board exams this year as they were cancelled due to COVID-19. Guidelines for Class XI admissions were issued by the School Education Department on Tuesday. The Chief Educational Officers have been asked to inform the heads of all schools about the revised guidelines to be followed. Based on the COVID-19 situation, schools have been told that they can start sessions for Class XI students from the third week of June. For Class XII students, lessons can be provided through Kalvi TV  and other resource materials, the Department said. Welcoming the decision, the State Platform for Common School System-Tamil Nadu thanked the government and said students should be allotted the groups they wish to take. It recommended that additional sections be started in government schools to accommodate all students based on their preferred subjects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consider-class-ix-scores-for-class-xi-admissions/article34774449.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC refuses to extend interim protection from arrest given to former IT Minister||The Madras High Court on Wednesday refused to extend an interim order directing the police to not arrest former Information Technology Minister M. Manikandan of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in a rape case. Justice Abdul Quddhose rejected a plea to extend the interim protection granted to the accused by another judge of the court, on June 3, since the latter had not given reasons for directing the police to not arrest the accused till June 9. The petitioner's counsel R. John Satyan, Government counsel R. Muniyapparaj and advocate V. Raghavachari representing the complainant completed their arguments on Wednesday on an anticipatory bail petition moved by the accused. Later, the judge decided to pronounce orders after they file written submissions within a few days. When Mr. Sathyan insisted on extending the interim protection from arrest till the pronouncement of orders on the advance bail plea, the judge refused to do so by stating that no reason had been assigned for grant of interim order. During the course of arguments, the petitioner's counsel accused the complainant, an actress, of being part of a gang that lays honey traps and blackmailing people. On the other hand, the government counsel said a custodial interrogation of the former Minister was absolutely necessary since the charges were grave. He also opposed any interim protection from arrest by stating that the accused, if allowed to roam freely, might tamper with electronic evidence such as photographs and videos shared on WhatsApp.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-refuses-to-extend-interim-protection-from-arrest-given-to-former-it-minister/article34774498.ece

10 June 2021||CHENNAI/THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||State human rights panel seeks reports over ‘medical negligence’||The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on Wednesday called for reports over two incidents in Thanjavur and Cuddalore where media reports implied negligence on the part of medical staff in hospitals. SHRC member A. Chittaranjan Mohandoss took suo motu cognisance of a media report, which said a finger of a 14-day-old infant was cut by a nurse while removing the cannula in Government Rajah Mirasdar Hospital (GRMH), Thanjavur, earlier this week. He called for a report from the Director of Medical Education in Chennai over the incident within two weeks. According to sources, Priyadharshini of Kattur near Thanjavur had delivered the baby in the GRMH on May 25. As the delivery was a pre-mature one, IV cannula was fixed in the left-hand thumb of the infant for administering fluids. When the doctors decided to discharge the mother and child three days ago, the baby was taken to the Station Nurse table at the ward for removing the cannula. When the nurse attempted to remove the cannula, profuse bleeding was noticed, and subsequently a surgeon on duty was summoned. Necessary procedure was carried out and the bleeding was arrested. The mother, along with the infant, was directed to stay back at the hospital for a few more days though the scan result of the thumb did not show any damage to the thumb bone, official sources said. In another case, SHRC member D. Jayachandran took suo motu cognisance of a media report about the death of a man in Cuddalore Government Hospital last month, after the oxygen supply to him was allegedly stopped. He called for a report from the Director of Medical and Rural Health Services within four weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/medical-negligence-shrc-seeks-reports/article34774936.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI/TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK to elect legislature party office-bearers||The AIADMK plans to hold its legislature party meeting on June 14, even as indications of intra-party differences are coming out into the open and former interim general secretary V.K. Sasikala continues to “reach out” to her “admirers”. After submitting a petition to DGP J.K. Tripathy for the proposed meeting, organisation secretary D. Jayakumar told reporters on Wednesday that office-bearers of the legislature party would be elected at the meeting that will be held at the party headquarters. Nearly a month ago (on May 10), former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was “unanimously elected” as the leader of the legislature party, and consequently, he was recognised as the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. It took two meetings for the party to decide on his election, as party co-ordinator O. Panneerselvam also wanted the legislators to deliberate on factors that led to the defeat of the party in the election. He identified the 10.5% quota for Vanniyars within the overall reservation for the Most Backward Classes (MBCs) as one of the factors. But the camp led by Mr. Palaniswami did not want an elaborate review then, even though the former Chief Minster briefly explained the rationale behind the internal reservation for Vanniyars. In different parts of Tirunelveli, posters issued by anonymous “members of the AIADMK” from the Maanur panchyat union were seen on Wednesday morning with a message that AIADMK cadre would “lay siege” to the party headquarters if Mr. Panneerselvam, a “find” of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, “remained sidelined”. The posters, spotted in and around Tirunelveli railway junction, Vannarpet and Palayamkottai, said the party lost in the poll as the coordinator was “not consulted on crucial issues”. The posters baffled several local party functionaries. Party organisation secretary and chairman of Aavin-Tirunelveli Sudha K. Paramasivan said this could be the “handiwork” of his party’s adversaries. He said he would file a complaint with the police to take action against those behind the posters. Asked for a comment, Mr. Jayakumar said the coordinator and the co-coordinator would look into the matter. “The conduct of party members should be such that no room is given for questions by our political rivals, especially the DMK, and the media,” he said. Office-bearers will be elected at the scheduled meeting of the legislature party next week, the way a leader was elected at the previous meeting, he said. “No excitement. No ripples. There are no issues in the party,” the former Minister said. Meanwhile, M. Anandan, who was the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Minister during the first Ministry headed by Jayalalithaa (1991-96) and later became the Villupuram MP, had a telephonic conversation with Ms. Sasikala. His was among the five audio clips containing Ms. Sasikala’s tele-conversations with her supporters that were available on social media. In a chat with The Hindu , Mr. Anandan expressed disappointment with the way the party was being run by Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam. He added that apart from himself, many leaders in the party from the Scheduled Castes, including former Minster A. Arunachalam and former leader of the Parliamentary party P. Venugopal, were not given ticket this time to contest the Assembly election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-to-elect-legislature-party-office-bearers/article34774811.ece
10 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Five pharmacies face action for OTC sale of drugs||Selling a strip of paracetamol or azithromycin to a buyer without a valid prescription will land medical shops in trouble. The Tamil Nadu Drugs Control Department has taken action against five pharmacies in Coimbatore district in the last one week after they were found selling drugs to people without asking for the prescription. S. Gurubharathi, Assistant Director of Drugs Control, Coimbatore zone, said that notices have been served on five pharmacies and further action on them was being followed up. According to him, the department had issued strict instructions to pharmacies to curb over the counter (OTC) sale of drugs, especially antiviral drugs and antibiotics. “The instructions were given by the department based on the information that people were getting drugs like paracetamol, azithromycin, doxycycline and ivermectin as OTC drugs. Taking such drugs without the prescription of a registered medical practitioner is dangerous. Self-medication will also have a huge impact on the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, considering the current situation,” he said. Based on inputs given by the Drugs Control Department, Coimbatore district administration instructed medical shops to sell drugs only if the buyer produces a valid prescription. Pharmacies have to collect the name, address, phone number of the patient and the details of the doctor who issued the prescription. They have to maintain the stock list of antibiotics, antiviral drugs and steroids. The district administration also appealed to the public to seek treatment even in the case of mild fever and avoid self-medication. “The Drugs Control Department collects the above details from pharmacies and submit the same to the district administration on a daily basis. The details are further shared with field level officers at the corporation, municipality, taluk, town panchayat and village panchayat levels for further monitoring of fever cases,” said Mr. Gurubharathi. The official added that drug inspectors had already issued notices regarding the restrictions to all the pharmacies in the district and had asked them to display it for the view of customers. There are more than 2,000 medical shops in the district and eight drug inspectors were overseeing the implementation of the new restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/five-pharmacies-face-action-for-otc-sale-of-drugs/article34774823.ece
10 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Spread of pandemic in rural areas affects agriculture, industry||The number of COVID-19 cases increasing in rural areas of the district has started impacting the local economic activities. There are villages that had 200 to 300 cases. The reasons for the spread may be many - those who were employed in other cities and towns returned to the villages when the lockdown was announced and some of them were COVID-19 positive; there is no control of people visiting houses to supply milk or vegetables; and there are crowds in front of PDS outlets, banks, etc. The public, too, are aware of the need to be careful, but are not alert in following the precautions. They still go out for condolences and at least two or three people test positive. In some places, the cases have reduced in the last two days, say sources. Tomato farmer Amirtharaj at Kinathukadavu says that there is fear among the public as the second wave of the pandemic has hit villages. Hence, there is reluctance to come to work. When the labourers go to nearby villages, 10 or more workers travel in a vehicle. Now, that is not permitted. So, the labourers are unable to go to nearby villages for work. Several traders who buy from the farmers are not coming regularly to the wholesale markets to purchase the produce. And the price offered is low, he says. Moorthy, a vegetable farmer near Pollachi, adds that the the main impact is on the labour front. “It is very difficult to get workers and wages have increased too,” he says. According to Velusamy, a powerloom weaver in Palladam, the weavers are hit hard by the second wave. When the cases increased in Maharashtra, the weavers here could not send goods to the State. Now, the cases are declining there but have increased here. Bhoopathy, a job working weaver at Somanur, adds that vegetable traders, weavers in Somanur area are affected. In Pollachi, 70 % of the workers are from other States and almost 50 % of them have returned to their home States. Several villages have imposed self quarantine or there are entire villages that are affected. Since, there is lockdown now and these are lean months for the coir industry, the sector is yet to realise the impact of the spread in rural areas, say sources. At the Kurichi Industrial Estate in Coimbatore, P. Nallathambi, president of the Manufacturers Welfare Association, says the units are closed because of lockdown. While 60 % of the workers are from the northern States, the rest come from nearby villages. “They are not coming to the units now because of the lockdown,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spread-of-pandemic-in-rural-areas-affects-agriculture-industry/article34774829.ece

As this was a very long street, the civic body had placed barricades on that portion of the street that was necessary to prevent unnecessary movement of people. The corporation had deployed health teams to collect samples from people who might have come in contact with the persons who had turned positive and conduct fever camps. Likewise, it had also deployed sanitation teams to disinfect the area. The civic body had also made arrangements for supply of essential commodities to people within the barricaded area, Commissioner P.

Selvanagarathinam, Superintendent of Police District (Rural) Police, on Wednesday. According to him, the average response time taken in vast jurisdictions like the Mettupalayam and difficult terrains like Valparai was 10 to 11 minutes. “The response time is being monitored periodically” said Mr. Selvanagrathinam after flagging off 10 new motorcycles for patrols on the Police Recruit School campus on Wednesday. The SP said that the rural police were getting 50 to 60 calls through the emergency number 100 and 40 to 60 calls through the Kavalan SOS App. He urged the public to use the Kavalan app to report emergencies. The 10 motorcycles launched on Wednesday are fitted with public addressing system and siren. These facilities enable the police personnel to make announcements at public places. The new vehicles were given to 10 police stations, including Thudiyalur, Vadavalli, Sulur, Karumathampatti, Pollachi town, Annur and Mettupalayam that handle more cases. According to the SP, 50 more new motorcycles will be introduced within three months with GPS tracking facility.

Sources said the Tangedco was laying the power cable so close to the water supply line that either the civic body or TWAD Board, whichever agency maintains the Kavundampalayam-Vadavalli drinking water supply improvement scheme, would find it difficult to take up maintenance work. They said that it was important that the Tangedco took a relook at where it laid the pipeline because the water supply line was a feeder main or the main supply line linking two water tanks and the power cable looked like a high voltage cable. When the TWAD Board or Corporation would attend to repair or maintenance work on the water pipeline, the Tangedco would be forced to shutdown power supply, depriving residents concerned without power and water. TWAD Board sources said the agency had taken the issue to the notice of the Tangedco and the latter had assured it in writing of cooperation by switching off power supply while taking up the work to maintain water supply line. Commenting on the problem, consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon said this was always a ticking time-bomb because when the pipeline needed to be repaired or replaced, the same set of officers from both the agencies might not be posted here, the then engineers might not be aware of the ground reality and therefore any repair work could prove catastrophic. Any accident arising out of the proximity of the cable, water pipeline, gas pipeline and underground drainage line would make officials of all the four government agencies equally culpable, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/twad-board-objects-to-tangedcos-underground-cable-near-water-pipeline/article34774445.ece

Periyasamy said on Wednesday that through the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Banks, farmers across the State would get farm loans to the tune of about Rs. 11,500 crore. As per the directive of Chief minister M.K. Stalin, the cooperative societies had been instructed to enrol new members and also ensure that no genuine farmer was missed out. Already, water was released for the kuruvai crop in the respective regions from dams. For instance, for the 45,000 acres of kuruvai  crop in Madurai, Theni and Dindigul districts, water had been released from Periyar dam on June 1, Mr. Periyasamy said and added that in other districts, the authorities had taken steps in this direction. The objective of the State government was to ensure that water for irrigation, money required for procuring seeds and fertilisers was available to them. With copious water in dams, the foodgrains production this season in Tamil Nadu should be high, he hoped. Revenue and Disaster Management Minister K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran said that all the ration shops across the State had been instructed to display the prices of essential commodities. There shall not be any malpractice or irregularities. Public may share such information with the authorities concerned and action would be taken sternly.

Along with this, the cardholders would also get a kit containing 14 essential commodities as per the CM's order. To a specific query that many people, under the guise of farmers, had been benefited in the farm loan waiver, the Minister said that all the Cooperative Department officials from the rank of Deputy Registrar had been instructed to look into this. The public may also share such details and action would be taken as per the laws. Similarly, to another query that the DMK had promised to waive gold loans less than five sovereigns through Cooperative Department, he said that the government would take a decision soon.

10 June 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court questions family for not receiving body of remand prisoner||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has taken a serious view of the fact that the family had not received the body of remand prisoner P. Muthu Mano, who was murdered in Palayamkottai Central Prison, even after more than one and a half months of the conduct of post mortem. Hearing a petition filed by A. Pavanasam, father of the deceased, a Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi asked the petitioner’s counsel why the earlier order of the court to receive the body and perform the last rites was not complied with. It directed the counsel to appropriately advise the petitioner. It observed that the petitioner had earlier approached the court seeking a set of directions, including a probe by the CB-CID into the incident. The direction was issued, the judges said. The court also passed a direction to the family members to receive the body and perform the last rites. The order was not complied with, and the petitioner, instead, chose to file another petition seeking a judicial inquiry. If the petitioner was not going to follow the court’s order, he should have challenged it before the appropriate forum. In the absence of an order reversing the earlier order, he could not simultaneously seek to advance arguments, the judges said. The case was adjourned till June 14. Muthu Mano, a history sheeter, and his accomplices were arrested and remanded in judicial custody after they allegedly attempted to murder two persons. Muthu Mano was murdered inside Palayamkottai Central Prison by a few inmates. Following the incident, six prison staff were suspended and the accused in the case were arrested. The Tirunelveli Collector has written to the Chief Secretary regarding the compensation and a government job to a member of the family of the deceased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-questions-family-for-not-receiving-body-of-remand-prisoner/article34774497.ece
10 June 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Offer nutritious food to tribal people’||The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Tuesday has sought a response from the Centre and the State in a public interest litigation petition that highlighted the plight of the tribal communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi sought a response in the PIL petition filed by R. Ezhiloviya of Pudukkottai. The petitioner sought a direction to authorities to set up community kitchens to offer nutritious food to the tribal communities in the State. The petitioner said that she works with various NGOs and was involved in the distribution of books, notes and other educational materials to the tribal children. She pointed out that the tribal communities were among the worst affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions, the tribal people could not market their produce and they were suffering financially. They were dependent on the help provided by the government and NGOs, she said. The self-sustaining population has turned into a dependent one due to the pandemic. The petitioner said that a COVID-19 testing drive must be conducted in tribal hamlets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/offer-nutritious-food-to-tribal-people/article34774499.ece
10 June 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Karur district administration acted in the interest of one person, says HC||Expressing shock over the fact that a private person in Karur district had been permitted to lay pipelines to extract water from a well in a land close to Amaravathi river, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed that the entire Karur district administration had acted in the interest of one person. A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi quashed the order passed by the then Collector S. Malarvizhi who permitted laying of the pipelines. Directing removal of the pipelines, the court said the entire cost to be spent towards removing them should be recovered from the private person, S. Shanthi. The judges wondered how the Collector had granted permission to extract water from the river and lay pipelines along road margins. Earlier, the permission was denied to the private person by the Tahsildar concerned. The predecessor to Ms. Malarvizhi, T. Anbalagan, had also rejected the application of S. Shanthi, who is said to be an influential person. After Ms. Malarvizhi took charge as Collector, Shanthi filed an appeal petition to her seeking permission to draw water from the river. Fifteen government officials formed a panel to conduct an inspection and subsequently permission was granted. The court wondered whether the Collector had the jurisdiction to pass the order. The court said the exercise of such power was illegal and perverse. The Collector was expected to protect natural resources and it was unbecoming of a public servant to pass such an order. The court said it was shocked by the constitution of the committee. The court took note of the fact that the local villagers had objected to drawing of water from the river. The Collector should have considered the plea of the villagers. Instead, she acted in haste. The villagers were complaining about lack of water for agricultural purposes and the district administration catered to the needs of the private party, the judges observed. The court was hearing the public interest litigation petition filed by Village Drinking Water and Health Society of Aravakurichi in Karur district, which sought a direction to restrain the private person from laying the pipelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/karur-district-administration-acted-in-the-interest-of-one-person/article34774931.ece

10 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Beware of self-medication, late hospital presentation||Late presentation, self-medication are among the main factors for the high COVID-19 death rate across the central region. The district administrations has increased surveillance and set up fever camps to identify cases in their early stages in an attempt to reduce the death rate. In Tiruchi, where an average of 10 deaths are reported per day, the district administration is pulling all the stops to trace cases at an early stage. While the corporation has organised 36 fever camps across the 65 wards daily, the Department of Public Health is conducting fever surveys. Volunteers and health workers are going door-to-door to test a patient’s well-being equipped with temperature guns and pulse oximeters. According to S. Ram Ganesh, Deputy Director of Health Services, late presentation is the chief cause of the increasing death rate. To keep a check on cases and to ensure early medical intervention, all blocks in Tiruchi rural have established a triage centre. Block-level health officers test the patient and if they have oxygen saturation between 90 to 94 without co-morbidities, they are advised admission at COVID Care Centres or home isolation. Only patients with co-morbidities and dipping oxygen levels will be taken the nearest government hospital. Mirroring his thoughts, A. Liakath Ali, District Epidemiologist, Nagapattinam district says early intervention is the key. He also notes that a decline in cases will reflect in the death rate only after 14 days. “The deaths reflecting in the reports right now are patients who tested positive earlier. The numbers will soon go down.” Another senior health official cites two other important reasons. “Patients try to self-medicate, take antibiotics and other such medicines instead of visiting a doctor as soon as they experience COVID-19 symptoms. By the time they get to a doctor, it is too late.”. Also, private hospitals send patients to the District Headquarters Hospital in the later stages. “These hospitals keep the patients until it is too late and then pack them off to government facilities when they cannot help. We get several brought-dead cases because of this. Patients whose oxygen levels dip to alarming levels must not be moved around at all,” he points out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/beware-of-self-medication-late-hospital-presentation/article34774964.ece

10 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Isolation rail coaches still in standby mode||Isolation rail coaches continue to remain stabled at different locations in Tiruchi Railway Division. A total of 75 coaches are stabled at railway stations in Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Villupuram, Mambazhapattu near Villupuram, and Sillakudi near Ariyalur on Tiruchi-Vriddhachalam broad gauge section, said railway officials here. The railway administration identified three-tier sleeper class coaches and general compartments over 15 years old for conversion into isolation coaches with provision of oxygen and basic medical facilities for quarantining patients when the second wave of COVID-19 hit the region. The conversion works were carried out last year at Golden Rock Railway Workshop and other places in Tiruchi division. The coaches are ready to be moved to locations based on specific requests and requirements. The Golden Rock Railway Workshop, which carries out periodic maintenance of broad gauge compartments and diesel locomotives, has alone modified over 100 sleeper class and general compartments into isolation coaches following a direction from Railway Board, New Delhi. Railway officials here say the isolation coaches continue to remain stabled at the five locations in the division as no specific requirements from the State government or the railways have been received so far. Each coach can accommodate 16 patients and has a separate cabin for para-medical teams and equipment. They are more likely to be deployed at Tiruchi and Villupuram junctions because the two major stations have more platforms and a range of facilities including coach watering and battery charging. Further, the isolation coaches have to be deployed at a place that is away from general public. The coaches will be cleaned before they are deployed. They are now locked and under round-the-clock surveillance, the officials add.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/isolation-rail-coaches-still-in-standby-mode/article34774960.ece

Nehru on Wednesday said steps would be taken to renovate and clean tanks in Tiruchi city. Speaking to reporters here, he said encroachments in periyakulam , spread over 11 acres at Milaguparai, would be removed and the waterbody renovated.

10 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Demand for oxygen comes down in Tiruchi||Hospitals in Tiruchi have begun to heave a sigh of relief as the demand for oxygen has come down due to decrease in the number of COVID-19 admissions. There were days when ambulances carrying COVID-19 patients waited at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) for oxygen-supported beds. Hospital authorities had to exercise maximum restraint to allot beds as oxygen-supported beds were running to capacity. Until April, MGMCH had about 420 oxygen beds. But due to unprecedented increase in COVID-19 patients, the number of oxygen-supported beds were increased to 643 by augmenting additional resources. Since the third week of May, most of the private hospitals in the city preferred to admit patients mainly with mild or asymptomatic patients due to severe shortage of oxygen and uncertainty over the supply of oxygen. Several patients, who were badly in need of oxygen support, were denied admission, forcing them to visit MGMCH. However, the decreasing trend in fresh cases of COVID-19 has begun to release the pressure on doctors, nurses and other hospital infrastructure. The demand of oxygen has also come down by 25% to 30%. Until a week ago, MGMGH required about 7,000 litres of oxygen a day as against 2,500 litres of oxygen a day in normal circumstances. It reached a peak in the last week of May with usage of 7,400 litres. However, it has come down to 5,800 litres. As on Wednesday, out of 643 oxygen beds, 562 were occupied. Out of 1,099 total beds, 760 were occupied by COVID-19 patients. ‘Crucial week’ “Situation is marginally better. We feel the pressure is getting released slowly as fresh cases have been decreasing slowly. But, the next one week is crucial. We hope for the best,” says K. Vanitha, Dean, MGMGH. Though COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms and those requiring oxygen support have come down a bit, patients with serious complications continued to remain high. The demand of patients needing ventilator and ICU support has not come down yet, she added. The pressure on private hospitals too seems to be declining slowly. “There has been a noticeable improvement in oxygen supply. The number of COVID-19 patients seeking admission has also gone down a bit. It has released the pressure to an extent,” says D. Senguttuvan, Executive Director, Kauvery Hospital, Tiruchi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/demand-for-oxygen-comes-down-in-tiruchi/article34774963.ece

Since the dropping of goat and sheep is excellent manure, the shepherds would have the sheep pens in the farms and the fields ahead of every paddy season in the district. When farmers rearing goat and sheep in Marudhakulam, Moolaikkaraipatti, Munanjipatti, Paruththipaadu, Rengasamudhram and other adjoining areas are taking their flock, each having 150 to 1,000 animals, around Tirunelveli and create pens in the fields, a mysterious disease has started ravaging the sheep over the past 25 days. After sudden swelling in the eyes of the animals, the infected sheep suffer frothing in the mouth. And, the affected animals die within a couple of days even as the infection is spreading rapidly in the flock. “We suspected it to be a kind of sheep pox for which the animals were vaccinated 10 days ago by the veterinarians. However, we continue to lose the sheep even after the vaccination,” says shepherd S. Ganesamurthy and Thirumalai Nambi of Moolaikkaraipatti. Farmer R. Gopalakrishnan from Rengasamudhram, who is rearing over 1,000 sheep, has so far lost 58 animals to this mysterious disease. “A total of 28 more animals are dying gradually with the symptoms of this disease,” he weeps. Even though the farmers isolate the infected animals from the flock, 15% of the animals in every bunch have contracted the infection. The farmers claim that they had not witnessed such a devastating infection over the past 35 years. “This is not a kind of pox, as being suspected by the veterinarians of the Department of Animal Husbandry. The officials, with the help of the Veterinary College and Research Institute at Ramaiyanpatti, should have collected the blood samples of the infected animals to pinpoint the exact reason behind this infection. Unfortunately, none has turned up so far to rescue us,” said shepherds Palavesam of Rengasamudhram and Kandan of Paruththipaadu. The Joint Director, Department of Animal Husbandry could not be reached for his comments. The faculty of the Veterinary College and Research Institute too said that they had not received any information from the animal husbandry department seeking their help.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mysterious-disease-kills-over-200-sheep-in-tirunelveli-district/article34774495.ece

The petitioners said the sanitary workers, who are frontline health workers, were not given any incentive as being given to other workers being part of anti-COVID operations.

10 June 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Probe launched into vaccination drive held by Tiruppur Corpn.||The Health Department has launched an inquiry into a recent COVID-19 vaccination drive held by the Tiruppur Corporation for industry workers, allegedly without informing medical officers of the urban primary health centres (UPHC). Sources in the Health Department said on Wednesday that Deputy Director of Health Services (Tiruppur) K. Jegadeesh Kumar has sought an explanation from Corporation authorities for administering 800 vaccine doses to the employees of three export apparel units on Saturday. While Tiruppur district received 2,000 Covaxin doses on Saturday from the State government, the Corporation allegedly utilised the 800 doses allocated for the 17 UPHCs in Tiruppur Corporation limits and the medical officers concerned were allegedly unaware of this, the sources said. However, a corporation official denied any wrongdoing and said that a suitable explanation will be given to the Health Department regarding the issue. As part of COVID-19 preventive measures, the Tiruppur Corporation has been carrying out various new initiatives such as field triaging, fever camps and door-to-door surveys in the past 10 days. Nearly all the medical officers and other staff from the UPHCs were being involved in these initiatives, hence the corporation was unable to inform them on Saturday regarding the vaccination drive, the official claimed. As industry workers fall into the ‘vulnerable workers’ category as per a recent Government Order (G.O. No. 252 dated May 22), the corporation accorded priority to the workers and conducted the vaccination drive, the official added. A senior IAS officer supervising the COVID-19 preventive measures of Tiruppur Corporation said that the matter will be investigated and action will be initiated, if any irregularities were confirmed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/probe-launched-into-vaccination-drive-held-by-tiruppur-corpn/article34774837.ece

According to officials, out of a population of 5.8 lakh adults over the age of 18, around 34 per cent, or 2 lakh adults have been administered at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. “The plan of the government and the district administration is to acquire enough vaccines to inoculate the entire population of the Nilgiris and possibly become the first district in the country to have a resident population that is completely vaccinated,” said the district administration in a press release. The Nilgiris District Collector, J. Innocent Divya, said that as the population of the Nilgiris is relatively small in comparison with other districts, the plan to vaccinate the entire population is feasible. Following the visit of Medical Minister Ma. Subramanian to the Nilgiris, it was decided that steps would be taken to vaccinate the entire Adivasi population in the district by the end of June. The district administration said that the vaccination drive aimed at Adivasi communities will commence once vaccines are received in the coming days. Another priority group in the Nilgiris is workers in tea factories. According to officials, around 80 per cent of the workers in the tea factories have already been administered at least the first dose of the vaccine. It was stated that efforts will be taken to administer the second dose of the vaccine to workers as soon as they become available.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plan-to-make-nilgiris-first-district-to-completely-vaccinate-adult-population/article34774836.ece
10 June 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Man killed in elephant attack||A 26-year-old man died after being attacked by an elephant during an accidental encounter while he was returning home from a temple near Kunjapannai on late Tuesday night. Forest department officials identified the deceased as R. Rajkumar, a resident of Semmanarai, a tribal village in the area. It was believed that Rajkumar had gone to visit a temple nearby and was returning home when he crossed paths with an elephant. Forest department officials believe that the elephant was spooked by Rajkumar, who could have inadvertently got too close to the animal. Officials rushed to the spot on Wednesday morning and conducted an investigation to ascertain the cause of death. They found signs of the presence of an elephant. District Forest Officer, Nilgiris division, Guru Swamy Dabbala, said that this was the first fatality resulting from a problematic human-elephant interaction in Nilgiris division in over a year. “The forest department is figuring out how best to minimise such interactions in the future. One such measure being considered was for bushes near the road in which Rajkumar was walking to be cleared so there is a better line-of-sight for people using the road,” said Mr. Dabbala. The forest department has handed over interim compensation to the next of kin of the victim.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-killed-in-elephant-attack/article34774442.ece

10 June 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Many transgenders complain of neglect by Social Welfare Dept.||A large section of transgenders of Virudhunagar district complain that they have been left out in the list of beneficiaries of State government’s COVID assistance to transgenders. “While 254 of us got Rs. 1,000 each in two instalments during last year’s lockdown, the number has come down by over 100 this year,” one of the transgenders said. The third gender persons were shocked when they got details of the beneficiaries on their mobile phone on Monday night. The district administration had planned to distribute the assistance of Rs. 2,000 to 112 persons, who had no ration cards. “At least last year, a lot of philanthropists and elected representatives gave us essential goods, along with the government’s assistance. But now we have not got anything,” said Thulasi (37), who lives in Srivilliputtur. Out of the 48 transgenders in the locality, only 12 were in the list of beneficiaries, she said. The transgenders alleged a big mistake in preparing the list. “No one contacted us for verification,” she said. At least three transgenders told that they were not given any concrete reply from the office of District Social Welfare Officer as to why their names had been removed. “When the officials themselves ignore us, how can we find fault with society that refuses to accept us,” she asked. The transgenders were not able either to find jobs or seek alms as most shops remained closed. “We have pressure from our houseowners to pay rent,” said another transgender, Poovarasi (named changed). Most of the transgenders were living in small groups or alone in rented houses. When his attention was drawn to the issue, Collector R. Kannan said he had instructed officials to include all transgenders who did not have ration cards. “As of now, all those who don’t have ration cards will get the benefit. We will wait for further instructions from the government for others,” Mr. Kannan said. However, the transgenders wondered how temple priests who had got benefits as ration cardholders also were given additional benefits. Another transgender Ramyamma (50) of Padanthal said amputation of two toes on her feet had almost crippled her mobility for more than a year. “Though I have an identity card for transgender, even last year I was denied assistance. After repeated promises of depositing the money in my account, the DSWO officials ditched me. I could not pursue it further due to my ill health. I don’t have a ration card, but still my name has not been included in the list of beneficiaries,” she rued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-transgenders-complain-of-neglect-by-social-welfare-dept/article34774491.ece

Nagarajan has warned of action against banks and micro finance institutions (MFIs) that pressurise self-help groups (SHGs) to pay dues. In a release, Mr. Nagarajan said it had come to the district administration’s knowledge that private banks and MFIs were pressurising SHGs to repay loans during the pandemic period. Affected by the lockdown, the SHGs had had their livelihood affected. In such circumstances, the private banks and MFIs should give them time to service the loans and avoid pressurising them. They should also stop levying penal interest. To address the issue, Mr. Nagarajan said he had constituted a team comprising project director, lead bank manager, and assistant project officers of Magalir Thittam, who were looking into complaints.  Salem/Namakkal  The district administration in Salem and Namakkal also advised financial businesses to not insist on women SHGs to pay loan dues. In a release issued by the respective District Collectors, they said the livelihood of the public had been affected due to the lockdown.

At a meeting, he asked Public Works Department officers to identify an existing building and hand it over to the Health Department in two days, to begin tests. He asked Deputy Commissioner M.G.

He asked the Deputy Commissioner to appoint on temporary basis, private doctors or those who had retired for treatment of black fungus patients in government hospitals. Each taluk should have a special COVID ward for children as there are reports that the third wave, if any, could hit children badly. The district hospital should have a dedicated children COVID ward, he said. Mr. Hiremath said that the rate of death in the district was 1.6%. A total of 976 persons are under treatment in government and private hospitals. As much as 16 kilo litres of oxygen is being used per day. There is no scarcity of oxygen in the district, he said.

Yediyurappa, who also holds charge of Bengaluru development, ‘expressed his disappointment over the slow progress of Smart City projects, despite the commencement of monsoon’, according to a statement from the CMO. He reviewed the progress of Smart City, Namma Metro and suburban rail projects in the city on Wednesday. “Twenty-seven road works are being implemented currently. Piles of mud and craters are seen on both sides of roads. It is a hurdle for people and vehicle movement. “Last time, I had personally reviewed implementation of the works. I also gave a priority list and instructions to complete the work within May 31. But, the works have not been implemented. The monsoon has already arrived and is expected to intensify in another two weeks,” the CM stated. The city police drew the attention of the Chief Minister to traffic snarls in the Central Business District (CBD) due to ongoing road works, which will become a concern when the lockdown is lifted. This drew the ire of the Chief Minister, sources said. “Works are incomplete on both sides on prominent roads like Minsk Square on Raj Bhavan Road, Vasanthnagar to Basaveshwara Road, Balabrooie guest house to Manikyavelu Mansion Circle. Labourers are not working there. “I have daily observed that the incomplete road works in the Central Business District is a hindrance to the public as well as VIP movement,” Mr. Yediyurappa said. The Chief Engineer of Bengaluru Smart City Ltd. sought time till June 30 to complete the work. Line doubling The CM set October 2021 as the target for all tender work to be completed and commencement of work on the 25.01-km Baiyappanahalli-Chikkabanavara line as part of the suburban rail project. He directed officials to finish doubling work between Baiyappanahalli and Hosur (48 km) and Yeshwanthpur-Chennasandra (21.7 km) within the stipulated time. Presently, work on tenders worth Rs. 323 crore are in progress. Twelve bridges have been completed while work on 20 other bridges are under way. Mr. Yediyurappa also reviewed the revenue of Namma Metro – Rs. 434 crore per annum – and reportedly expressed displeasure.

In Bengaluru alone, there are nearly 250 patients who have been hospitalised for over 21 days after testing positive. Of these, while 154 have been in hospital for more than 30 days, 170 have been hospitalised for 21-30 days. Besides, 412 patients have spent 11-20 days in hospitals, according to BBMP’s COVID-19 bed status portal.  Many complications Doctors said patients, who do not have an easy ride back to normalcy, are mainly those who have developed COVID pneumonia, COVID-related heart issues, brain stroke, and other ailments. The State-run Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences has four patients in the COVID ICU for more than three weeks. Institute director C.N. Manjunath, who is also the nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said these patients developed COVID-related cardiac issues along with lung involvement. “Patients who have extensive lung involvement need high-flow oxygen for a longer time. During this second wave, only severe cases whose oxygen saturation dropped below 95 were admitted. Besides, several moderately-sick patients were shifted to bigger hospitals from smaller facilities after they became critical and hence, needed a longer hospital stay,” he said. Prakash Doraiswamy, senior consultant-anaesthesia and critical care at Aster CMI Hospital, said the hospital currently has close to 15 patients who are long stay COVID-19 pneumonitis patients. “They have been with us for a duration ranging between six and eight weeks in the ICU. Besides, there are few more patients who have been staying for more than three weeks in the wards,” he said. “During the second wave, many patients had severe inflammatory response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused extensive damage to their lungs, which is described by CT severity score. This resulted in hospitalisation for a significant number of days for some patients. They require prolonged oxygen therapy with or without the need to go on a ventilator and their recovery is further delayed if they have muscle weakness, nutritional issues or any secondary issues,” the doctor explained. “We had a 60-year-old male patient who had to stay at our hospital for more than 80 days. He had a severe infection and his lungs were more than 95% damaged. While he was taking all necessary medications and measures, his condition turned critical and he was put on a ventilator after 25 days. He recovered after 80 days and was recently discharged,” Dr. Doraiswamy said. Mutations Satyanarayana Mysore, HOD and consultant-pulmonology and lung transplant physician at Manipal Hospitals, said the mutations in the virus or the delta variant probably is responsible for long duration hospitalisation, increased mortality and morbidity. “In hospitals, patients followed the ‘H’ type of lung pathology, wherein there will be decreased lung compliance. The hypoxia is quite pronounced and severe. Therefore, for the purpose of getting oxygen supplementation, improving the lung and for the sake of stability, several patients have been in hospital for a longer duration. In such patients oxygen supplementation - high flow oxygen and non-invasive ventilation - all had to be resorted to and this indicates the severity of the disease,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hospital-stay-is-longer-in-second-wave/article34774427.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Domestic tariff: First slab up by 20 units||In its new order for tariff revision for the ongoing financial year, the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) has increased the first slab for domestic tariffs from 30 units to 50 units. This, the commission has said, is aimed at encouraging consumption by “lower and middle-class domestic consumers”. For domestic consumers, installations of government or charitable educational institutions and hospitals in BBMP and other municipal corporation areas, the increase in energy charges across the State is 10 paise per unit. This means that the energy charges for monthly consumption of 0 – 50 units (earlier 0 – 30 units) will go up from Rs. 4 per unit to Rs. 4.10 per unit, and for consumption between 51 and 100 units (earlier 31 to 100 units), the tariff is increased from Rs. 5.45 per unit to Rs. 5.55 per unit. The tariff for monthly consumption of 101–200 units will go up from Rs. 7 to Rs. 7.10 per unit, and for above 200 units from Rs. 8.05 to Rs. 8.15 per unit. Commercial consumers The increase in tariff for LT and HT industrial consumers across the State is 10 paise per unit. Similarly, commercial LT and HT consumers will also be paying 10 paise more per unit. The commission has also announced the removal of morning and evening peak under ToD (time of day) tariff to encourage consumption in HT installations. The penalty of Rs. 1 per unit for usage of energy during morning peak hours — between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. — and evening peak hours — 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. — has been withdrawn, continuing the policy of the 2020 tariff order. This, the KERC has said, is with a view of making use of the available surplus power as projected by the Escoms and the SLDC during the monsoon period, i.e., from July to November. “The evening peak ToD for the other months in the financial year will be continued for the energy consumed during the evening peak hours and a penalty of Rs. 1 will be levied in the monthly bills issued from December to June as per the existing mechanism. Similarly, the rebate of Rs. 1 offered on the energy consumed during off-peak period i.e., 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. from July to November is withdrawn,” the commission has said. New scheme A new ‘Discounted Energy Rate Scheme’ has also been announced to encourage energy consumption over and above the base or normal consumption by HT installations (industries, commercial, hospitals, educational institutions), especially during the power surplus/monsoon/off-season period of July to December. Surplus power will be sold at Rs. 6 per unit to them over and above their base/normal consumption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/domestic-tariff-first-slab-up-by-20-units/article34774508.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No admissions before SSLC exams: DPUE||Several pre-university (PU) colleges in Karnataka that have started the admission process may find themselves running afoul of the education department. The Department of Pre-University Education (DPUE), on Wednesday, announced that strict action will be initiated against colleges that are admitting students in first year PU. DPUE Director R. Snehal, in a circular, said that managements who admit students before SSLC examination is conducted and before the department announces the new academic calendar will be at risk of losing their affiliation. The circular also stated that colleges cannot begin online classes till the academic calendar is chalked out. A majority of the colleges, particularly integrated PU colleges, have already admitted students based on their class nine examination marks and online exam scores of class 10. “All my daughter’s classmates got admitted to top PU colleges. So we decided that we need to finish her admission process as well. I paid the fees last Saturday,” said Sudeep P., a parent. Students as well as college managements are worried about the status of the admissions that they have already completed. The department has asked deputy directors at the district level to forward the circular to principals of all pre-university colleges. District officials have also been asked to initiate action against colleges and submit an action taken report to the department. PU colleges have objected pointing out that many CBSE and ICSE students completed the admission process earlier this month. Others claimed that they are facing pressure from parents to complete the admission process. “If we do not admit students now, they will go to another college and we will lose out on admissions,” said the principal of a top PU college in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-admissions-before-sslc-exams-dpue/article34774772.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||SIM box fraud: 2 held for running international exchange racket||In a joint operation carried out by Military Intelligence sleuths and Anti-Terrorist Cell officials of the Central Crime Branch, the police arrested two men on Wednesday for allegedly running an international telephone exchange scam from BTM Layout. The police suspect that the duo were using it for anti-national activities but refused to give more details saying that investigations are ongoing. The police team raided six places and recovered 30 SIM boxes containing 960 SIM cards at different locations. “The accused had rented many places to install the SIM boxes. They used them to receive international calls, bypass telephone routers, and convert them into local calls,” said a police officer. A SIM box allows users to route international calls through the internet using VoIP and bypass the GSM connection to reach the recipient. With this, an international call is made to look like a local call. A SIM box can hold multiple SIM cards from different service providers and can be installed in various locations. Initial investigations have revealed that Ibrahim is part of an international network based in Dubai and is involved in hawala rackets. “Ibrahim worked in Dubai for many years to learn about SIM box operations. He returned to Bengaluru to set up and run the business on behalf of the network.” said the police officer, adding that the duo had produced hundreds of SIMs on fake IDs. Through this illegal exchange, the duo raked in Rs. 10-Rs. 15 lakh per month. Ibrahim and Goutham would take home a salary of Rs. 50,000 -Rs. 70,000 per month. The accused charged their customers Rs. 1 per pulse rate against Rs. 10 of the international pulse rate and make a huge amount of profit. Their customers are individual and small companies that have to make long international calls. “Such calls not only incur huge revenue loss to the state exchanger but can also be used for anti-national activities,” a senior police officer said . Ibrahim allegedly confessed that he sourced ID proofs for the SIM cards using the documents submitted by people, mainly migrant labourers, to the local SIM dealer when they were applying for a phone connection. The police have booked the duo under various sections of Information Technology Act and Indian Telegraph Act and taken them into custody to probe their network further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sim-box-fraud-2-held-for-running-international-exchange-racket/article34774774.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Consumer confidence has hit a new low, says RBI survey||The confidence of consumers, devastated by the second wave of COVID-19, has dipped to a new low and 81.4% of the respondents have said that the general economic situation has “worsened”, a new survey by the Reserve Bank of India has said. As the pandemic continues to adversely hit lives and businesses across the country, 82.1% of the respondents said the employment situation had “worsened”. The RBI released the results of the May 2021 round of its Consumer Confidence Survey to understand perceptions and expectations on the general economic situation, employment scenario, and overall price situation by conducting telephonic interviews with 5,258 households across 13 major cities, including Bengaluru, from April 29 to May 10. Overall pessimism Respondents were also bleak in their view of the year-ahead prospects, with 51.5% saying the general economic situation would “worsen”, while only 33.2% predicted the situation would improve. As many as 15.3% said the situation would remain the same. “The future expectations index moved to pessimistic territory for the second time since the onset of the pandemic; this was driven by sharp fall in expectations on the general economic situation, employment scenario, and household income over a one-year horizon,” the RBI said. In one-year ahead prospects on employment scenario, 35.4% of respondents said the situation would improve and 16.1% said the situation would remain the same. However, a majority of the respondents (48.5%) said the employment situation “will worsen”. About the price level, an overwhelming response (90.6%) was that prices have increased. On one-year ahead expectations, 73.9% respondents said prices would increase, the survey found.  In a separate inflation expectations survey of households by the RBI, 60% of the respondents said they predict higher inflation over the next three months and over the next one year. Income scenario On the income scenario, 58.5% of the respondents said their incomes had decreased and 42.5% said their income would increase in the next one year. About 42% said their income would remain the same. On spending, 50.6% said their spending had increased and it was largely on essential items (63.2%). Household spending was reduced largely owing to consumers’ concern about the economic situation and job prospects, the RBI survey found.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/consumer-confidence-has-hit-a-new-low-says-rbi-survey/article34774505.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Four arrested with rare sperm whale secretion worth Rs. 8 crore||The K.G. Halli police on Wednesday arrested four persons and recovered 6.7 kg of sperm whale ambergris valued at Rs. 8 crore in the international market. Ambergris, which looks like a rock but has a waxy feel to it, is secreted in the intestines of the sperm whale. It is a highly valued ingredient in Eastern medicine and is believed to be an aphrodisiac. However, it is rare and is usually found floating in tropical waters. After receiving a tip-off, a team of police officers went to a coconut farm at Lakshmipathi Garden in K.G. Halli where the accused had kept the ambergris. They arrested Syed Tajammul Pasha, 54, resident of Magadi Road; Saleem Pasha, 48, and Naseer Pasha, 34, of Palace Guttahalli; and Rafiulla, 45, from J.P. Nagar, along with the ambergris. “An initial probe has revealed that the accused sourced the ambergris from Salman, a resident of Kolar,” said a police officer, adding that there is a market for the item in China, and also in Arab countries where it is used in the perfume industry. The police have booked the accused under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act, and for cheating. Efforts are on to track down Salman to ascertain the source of the ambergis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/four-arrested-with-rare-sperm-whale-secretion-worth-rs-8-crore/article34774768.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||KV principals, students told to delete ‘Thank you Modi’ tweets||After directing school principals to express their gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) authorities in the Bengaluru region have reportedly asked them to delete tweets and video clips with the hashtag ‘Thank You Modi Sir’ for cancelling the CBSE board exams. Kendriya Vidyalaya school principals were told to ensure that at least five tweets with videos were posted by students thanking the Prime Minister. However, screenshots of the instructions from the Deputy Commissioner of Bengaluru Regional Office, KVS, started doing the rounds on social media, following which several politicians and Opposition party members criticised the KVS Bengaluru region authorities. The images also drew flak from citizens and parents. The principal of a Kendriya Vidyalaya school in Karnataka said that they were instructed to tweet the videos on June 3. “We were asked later to delete the tweets from the official school account, and also orally inform students to delete them.” A teacher of a Kendriya Vidyalaya school in Bengaluru said, “Although we received directions to ensure that five students from the school had to post video messages, many teachers became overenthusiastic and asked all the students in their class to post videos. Students who did not have a Twitter account were asked to create one, and post the message.” Some complained Some clips showed students in their school uniforms dutifully thanking the Prime Minister for caring about their physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several parents and students complained that they were forced to tweet such messages. Fifty-one KVs come under the purview of the KVS Bengaluru region. Repeated calls by The Hindu to Sirimala Sambanna, Deputy Commissioner of Bengaluru Regional Office, KVS went unanswered.

10 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Left parties to hold protest against ‘failures’ of State govt.||The Left parties along with others have threatened to stage a demonstration outside the office of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on June 15 in protest against the government’s “failure” to handle COVID-19 pandemic. Protests will also be staged outside the offices of the district in-charge Ministers and legislators, seeking an eight-point demand to be implemented. The cadre will stage a protest with COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, the leaders said. CPI, CPI(M), CPI(ML), SUCI, All-India Forward Block, Swaraj India, and RPI cadre will be part of the protests. “We have been asking for time to meet the Chief Minister, but have failed it. The protest is to draw attention to the problem of the poor,” K. Uma of the SUCI (C) told reporters here. She said MGNREGA works should be ensured for at least 200 days from the current 100 days, and has to be extended to urban centres too. CPI(M) State secretary Basavaraj said the “unscientific” lockdown had affected thousands of people. The Union and State governments had failed in pandemic management, he added. “The financial aid announced by the government is grossly insufficient and it should be enhanced to at least Rs. 10,000. It is also restrictive as not all sections of BPL families have been covered,” CPI State secretary Saati Sundaresh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/left-parties-to-hold-protest-against-failures-of-state-govt/article34774503.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||CD scandal: Victim questions credibility of SIT probe||The woman connected to the alleged CD scandal case, involving the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, has moved the High Court of Karnataka challenging the legality of the constitution of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the case. She has also questioned the credibility of the investigation carried out so far. Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty, before whom the petition came up for hearing on June 7, ordered issue of notice to the State government, the Commissioner of Police (CoP) of Bengaluru, and the SIT. Before FIR It has been pointed out in the petition that Mr. Jarkiholi, on March 9, 2021, wrote to the Home Minister claiming that he was a “victim of a well-hatched conspiracy...” and the Home Minister on March 10 wrote to the CoP asking him to set up an SIT to conduct a probe. The CoP, based on the Home Minister’s letter, constituted the SIT on March 11 even though no first information report (FIR) related to the allegations existed then. Though the first FIR was registered with the Sadashivanagar police on March 13, based on Mr. Jarkiholi’s complaint against unknown persons, and another FIR was registered on March 26 based on the petitioner’s complaint against the BJP leader, the transfer of these FIRs to the SIT was illegal as no Government Order was passed either to set up the SIT or to transfer the FIRs to it, it has been contended in the petition. The SIT set up, on the basis of the letter by the Home Minister at the behest of a letter from the rape-accused former Minister, has no legal jurisdiction to probe the FIRs, the petition claimed. “The entire investigation is being handheld and controlled by the political bosses of the SIT and no justice or fair play can be expected under the facts and circumstances,” the petitioner has contended. Moreover, she has also alleged that the SIT is not conducting the probe in a fair manner while pointing put that the SIT has neither arrested the former Minister nor secured him through a bond besides not subjecting him to medical examination as per the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC). It has been alleged in the petition that the SIT had selectively leaked to newspapers and television channels the contents of her statement recorded under Section 164 of the Cr.PC before the magistrate as well as the statement of the accused, and “all efforts are being made to show the petitioner in poor light and protect the accused”.  Questioning non-completion of the probe within 60 days as per the law, the petitioner has also raised doubts on the continuation of the probe when its head, IPS officer Soumendu Mukherjee, is on leave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cd-scandal-victim-questions-credibility-of-sit-probe/article34774509.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Staggered unlocking based on recommendations by experts’||The ongoing lockdown restrictions will be eased in a staggered manner as unlocking in one go may trigger surge in cases, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said on Wednesday. “Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will take a final decision on the modalities of unlocking in a graded and phased manner. The recommendations made by experts will be conveyed to the Chief Minister and he will take a final decision,” he told reporters. Pointing out that as per experts’ opinion, unlocking can begin if the positivity rate is less than 5% and daily new cases are less than 5,000, the Minister said: “There is no confusion regarding lifting restrictions. States such as Maharashtra opened up only after reduction in cases. Compared to other States, the second wave has relatively subsided quickly in Karnataka.” “Although, it has been predicted that the next wave may impact children predominantly, there is no such evidence from other countries which have already undergone the third wave. Even AIIMS (Delhi) director Randeep Guleria has said that there is no data, either from India or internationally, to show that children will be seriously infected in any next wave of COVID-19,” he said. Mr. Sudhakar pointed out that nearly 70% of children, who got infected and were admitted in hospitals during the second wave in India, had either co-morbidities or low immunity. Healthy children recovered with mild illness without hospitalisation. “However, we are ensuring preparedness to protect our children,” he said. Meanwhile, the BBMP organised a two-day training and simulation workshop for doctors (MBBS) and paediatricians. Inaugurating the workshop, Revenue Minister R. Ashok said there were around 25 lakh children in the city. The workshop will address challenges that could arise in treating children affected by COVID-19. “We have a shortage of paediatricians and nursing staff. We are also creating facilities where children and their caretakers (parents) could be accommodated and treated. One such facility is coming up in Padmanabhanagar,” he said, and added that a team of 10 children’s specialists would offer teleconsultation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/staggered-unlocking-based-on-recommendations-by-experts/article34774429.ece

KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar told reporters on Wednesday that the Union government had increased the petrol price 48 times since January 2021. Congress MPs, MLAs, MLCs, ex-legislators, and office-bearers of all cells and all levels of party units would take part in the protests in front of petrol stations in district headquarters on June 11. Protests would be held in front of petrol stations at taluk headquarters on June 12, in hoblis on June 13, in gram panchayats on June 14, and other prominent places on June 15. Protests would be held for one hour from 11 a.m. by taking into account all COVID-19 protocols. Videos of protests would be uploaded in social media accounts of the party and later dispatched to the All-India Congress Committee, he said. While the petrol price was hiked 16 times each in January, February, and June, the KPCC chief said the price was not increased during March, April, and May owing to elections. Proposal rejected He said the government had rejected the party’s proposal to procure COVID-19 vaccines directly from manufacturers and administer them to the people of Karnataka, using Local Area Development funds of MLAs and MLCs. The party had mooted a Rs. 100 -crore plan to procure the vaccines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/100-not-out-campaign-by-congress-to-oppose-increase-in-petrol-price/article34774504.ece

Yediyurappa on Wednesday highlighted the role of anganwadi assistants and workers in the prevention of possible third wave of COVID-19 and suggested that they give priority to the health of children during the pandemic. According to experts, the third wave is expected to affect children and so anganwadi workers must identify children suffering from malnutrition and illnesses and give them nutritious food to improve their health, he said. During a virtual conference with anganwadi workers from different districts, Mr. Yediyurappa listened to their grievances and said it was satisfying that 85.91% of workers received vaccination. As anganwadi schools remained closed, he appreciated the workers’ role in delivering food kits to houses of anganwadi children, and pregnant and lactating mothers. Being members of GP task forces, anganwadi workers play a vital role in handling the pandemic, he said. The government has paid COVID-19 relief of Rs. 2,000 each to anganwadi workers. Compensation of Rs. 30 lakh was paid to the family members of deceased workers. In the first wave, 20 assistants and workers died. Mr. Yediyurappa paid condolences to Girija, whose husband succumbed to the pandemic. In his conversation with Manjula Sangamesh of Belagavi, the Chief Minister invited her to his residence for a coffee during her trip to Bengaluru. Besides department work, anganwadi assistants/workers of Udupi, Shivamogga, Ballari, Kolar, and other districts said they have been doing surveys of other departments and urged the CM to reduce their workload.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-highlights-role-of-anganwadi-workers/article34774422.ece

10 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Now, I PU students have to answer 2 papers from home||After cancelling examination for first year pre-university students (I PU) and announcing that they will be promoted to the second year, the State government now wants students to sit for two question papers before the end of the academic year. While all students will pass their assignments will be evaluated. The marks will be uploaded on the Student Achievement Tracking System (SATS) portal. Students, parents, and teachers criticised this decision deeming it as a pointless exercise that will only add to their anxiety and stress. The Department of Pre University Education (DPUE) on Wednesday announced that two model question papers have been uploaded on the department’s website. Students have to download the papers and answer them. They can send their answer sheets to their lecturers on WhatsApp, via email, or by post. “As the department announced I PU students have been declared as pass and the department has cancelled the examination, the students even stopped preparing for the exams. When this is the situation, how could we ask the students to write the exams again," asked teachers. The department has asked students to complete the first paper by June 22 and lecturers are expected to complete the evaluation by June 25. Students have to complete and submit the second assignment between June 26 and July 5. The deadline for the evaluation is July 10. Marks have to be uploaded on the SATS portal by July 20. Lecturers have been asked to consider internal assessment marks as well. Ninge Gowda A.H., president of the Karnataka State Pre-University College Lecturers’ Association, said that the association has written to the department urging the Director to withdraw the circular. “After declaring that I PU students will be promoted to the next class, it is pointless to now ask them to write an examination. Moreover, many students in rural areas will not be able to download the question papers,” he said. The move has not gone down well with students who have started preparing for II PU classes. “Although this will help me understand what concepts I have learnt in I PU, it would have been better if it was done earlier as II PU classes have already begun,” said Gagana K.H. of Oxford Independent PU College. The department has asked students to complete the first paper by June 22 and lecturers are expected to complete the evaluation by June 25. Students have to complete and submit the second assignment between June 26 and July 5. The deadline for the evaluation is July 10. Marks have to be uploaded on the portal by July 20. Lecturers have been asked to consider internal assessment marks as well.

The move has not gone down well with students who have already started preparing for II PU classes. “Although this will help me understand where I stand and what concepts I have learnt in I PU, it would have been better if it was done earlier as II PU classes have already begun,” said Gagana K.H., a student of Oxford Independent PU College.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/now-i-pu-students-have-to-answer-2-papers-from-home/article34774381.ece

10 June 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Youths to the rescue of starving monkeys||A group of youths, Team Cause, has joined hands with a temple administration in Dakshina Kannada to feed a large number of monkeys found in Karinja Hills, about 40 km from Mangaluru, during lockdown. Karinja Hills in Bantwal taluk is on the way from Mangaluru to Dharmasthala. There are two temples, of Shiva and Parvathi, on the hills and many simians have made the surroundings of the temples their home as the administration of the temples feeds them cooked rice daily at noon. Visitors can also offer “vanaranna seva” to feed the monkeys by paying the prescribed fee. The Shiva temple which is atop the hills and which can be reached only by walk is in about 1,000 ft. above sea level. The COVID-19 restrictions and the lockdowns, however, have hit the resources of the temple, making it difficult to feed the monkeys. Suhan Alva, founder of Team Cause, told The Hindu that a city police officer showed the team video clipping on the pitiable condition of monkeys in the hills. Priests of the temple, he said, have been feeding about 150 monkeys but it was not sufficient. “Hence we took the task of feeding these monkeys,” Mr. Alva said. Mr. Alva accompanied Ganesh Mulky and other members of Team Cause to the hills on June 1. “As banana is among the fruits recommended by the Forest Department for monkeys, we carried with us full bunches of banana,” said Mr. Ganesh. “We will be in regular touch with the priests and arrange supply of banana and other fruits for monkeys. A few of our volunteers in Bantwal have offered to supply fruits,” Mr. Alva said. For the last 43 days Team Cause has also been providing lunch, tea and dinner to 1,500 people every day in Mangaluru city. In the evening, tea prepared at Mr. Ganesh’s house is served to people. In the night, food prepared by a local catering unit is served to needy people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/youths-to-the-rescue-of-starving-monkeys/article34774425.ece

In a formal complaint lodged with the Chief Secretary, DPAR (Services), through a letter on June 6, Ms. Sindhuri said Ms. Nag’s “pre-meditated plan” was to falsely raise allegations against her and “create a scandal in order to force her transfer from the district”. Ms. Sindhuri refers to Ms. Nag’s interview to a private television channel in which she has reportedly stated that “her mission of ensuring my transfer from Mysuru district had been accomplished and the purpose of doing the press meet on 3/6/2021 (during which she made false allegations of harassment by me) was achieved.” ‘Collusion’ Ms. Sindhuri said that actions of Ms. Nag, who has also been transferred from the post of Commissioner of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), were in “collusion” with local politicians with the stated objective of having her transferred out of Mysuru. Overcharging patients Further, she said some politicians in collusion with private hospitals were allegedly overcharging patients while running private COVID Care Centres reportedly in violation of prescribed norms and committing gross irregularities. “I had ordered their closure. This was an immediate cause for motivated and false attacks on me,” she said in the letter. Contending that Ms. Nag’s conduct was “unbecoming” of an officer, amounting to “gross misconduct and indiscipline”, Ms. Sindhuri said Ms. Nag had violated rules of the All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968. While Rule 3(1) states that “every member of the Service shall at all times maintain absolute integrity and devotion to duty and shall do nothing which is unbecoming of a member of the Service”; Rule 3 (2B) (XI) states that “maintain discipline in the discharge of duties and be liable to implement the lawful orders duly communicated to him,” she explained in the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sindhuri-seeks-action-against-shilpa-nag-for-violating-service-rules/article34774510.ece

Many of them are struggling to meet the daily needs of their families. Therefore, Chief Minister B.S.

Since 2017 The innovative project was launched by the Ernakulam district administration in 2017 using the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds made available by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. The Roshni project had found mention in the Governor’s policy address last year. The government had maintained that it would be extended across the State. “Around Rs. 20 lakh is required to clear the salary arrears of the 40 educational volunteers since November 2020. We had provided their salary for the first five months of the previous academic year using the balance funds available from the academic year 2019-20,” said people associated with the programme. Revised proposal “A revised project proposal incorporating the audio-visual components in the online mode was submitted before the district administration in August last. The bills and vouchers of the expenses incurred up to March this year were also forwarded to the District Collector for approval in April,” said officials at the Office of the Deputy Director of Education, Ernakulam. The heads of schools partnering in the programme had sought the help of the educational volunteers to interact with migrant children in their respective native languages after the online sessions began on June 1. However, the trained volunteers have not yet come on board officially in view of doubts over the fate of the project. They were instrumental in creating interactive and adaptive online modules after watching classes aired on Victers channel last year. Senior officials of the district administration said the project was originally envisaged in the offline physical mode of instruction, and the sponsoring agencies had expressed doubts over how it would be implemented online. The release of funds is possible only after due certification from the Deputy Director of Education, Ernakulam, who is also the nodal officer for the Roshni project, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/roshni-project-hits-a-roadblock/article34774533.ece
10 June 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Brahmapuram grapples with mounting waste||The Kochi Corporation spends crores each year transporting thousands of tonnes of waste to Brahmapuram, while much of the waste continues to remain piled up at the yard. For the transportation of waste to the dumping yard, the corporation has been paying contractors an increasing amount each year. In the 2016-17 financial year, the corporation spent Rs. 3.89 crore to transport waste. The amount rose to Rs. 6.39 crore in the 2020-21 financial year. Part of this amount goes towards renting trucks for waste transportation. The civic agency owns 94 vehicles for waste transportation as per official records. “These include both large and small vehicles. Only few of the trucks are currently in use, and several of the vehicles used for transportation are being hired,” said T.K. Ashraf, Health Standing Committee chairperson. He added that the transport expenses were routine, and included the salaries of those transporting waste. Since the vehicles that the corporation owns to transport waste were not being maintained well, they develop snags and were easily abandoned, said V.K. Minimol, UDF councillor. Consequently, vehicles are hired on a daily basis, said Ms. Minimol, who was the health standing committee chairperson for roughly half of the previous council’s term. On an average, 28 truckloads of waste are transported to the yard daily. Corporation records say that the local body collects waste from 2,22,557 homes and 487 hotels. Mr. Ashraf said that an average of 300 tonnes of waste arrive at the plant daily, including the waste collected from other municipalities and panchayats. Data from the corporation says that around 6,112 tonnes of waste was dumped at the site in March alone this year. Of this total amount of waste, a small fraction is being processed. Sources at the corporation said that around 10 to 20 tonnes of compost were being generated daily. Mr. Ashraf said that the compost generated is 10% of the total quantity of waste that is treated. While much of the waste piles up at the site, the corporation collects a tipping fee to process the waste from the other local bodies that dump garbage at Brahmapuram. Mayor M. Anilkumar said that a detailed plan was being drawn up to overhaul the dumping yard and set up a functioning treatment system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/brahmapuram-grapples-with-mounting-waste/article34774530.ece
10 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||CIAL planning to do away with landing, parking charges by 2030||Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL), which blazed a trail by becoming the first airport in the world to depend solely on solar power for its day-to-day operations, now plans to become the first airport in the world that will not impose landing and parking charges. Plans are ready to diversify revenue streams and to replace the income from landing and parking charges with the income from them. “Kochi airport hopes to operate without landing and parking charges by 2030,” said its outgoing managing director V.J. Kurien here. Mr. Kurien was interacting with media persons at the airport office as he retired on Wednesday after serving the airport for around 20 years since its inception in 1992. Mr. Kurien said a proposal to develop an “airport city” on 100 acres held by the airport authority close to the National Highway would come up for the consideration of the board of directors of the company soon. The airport city will showcase the best in the world, including the best food collection. Income from the proposed airport city will make up for the income the airport will forego as landing and parking charges, Mr. Kurien added. He said landing charges constituted 25-30% of the airport’s income. Rs. 204-cr. profit last fiscal CIAL’s airport operations registered a turnover of over Rs. 655 crore during 2019-20 and a profit after tax of Rs. 204 crore. Mr. Kurien said the pandemic had held up projects a little but exuded confidence that the airport would easily overcome the setback suffered due to curtailed operations for more than a year. “We have overcome bigger challenges in the past, and it will take about six months for the airport to recover fully to reach the pre-pandemic level,” he added. It is estimated that the airport sustained losses of around Rs. 80 crore. Mr. Kurien, as a young IAS officer in the early 1990s, proposed the setting up of a greenfield airport with people’s participation. The idea looked ridiculous then, but the State’s political leadership, including then Chief Minister K. Karunakaran, backed him. Mr. Kurien recalled that a capital of Rs. 20,000 was received from a private investor initially.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cial-planning-to-do-away-with-landing-parking-charges-by-2030/article34774538.ece
10 June 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Airport offers 1 acre for Silver Line station project||Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) has offered an acre for the construction of a station for the proposed Silver Line semi-high speed railway proposed by the State government. The airport authority has land holding close to the proposed Silver Line alignment, and the project will provide great connectivity to the airport too, said V.J. Kurien, outgoing CIAL managing director, here. The Silver Line project linking Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod is expected to reduce the time taken to cover the 532-km distance to less than four hours. Mr. Kurien said rail proximity would complete the circuit and make Kochi an airport with connectivity to water, road and rail transport. He was interacting with reporters at a session as he steps down from office on retirement on Wednesday. He added that Kochi, Kannur and Thiruvananthapuram airports would be connected to waterways through various projects in progress. Most segments of the 610-km trunk line between south and north of Kerala are navigable now. Waterway has tremendous potential and is a turning point for various sectors, including tourism. Mr. Kurien said there would be more scope for airport development in the State depending on the future growth of the economy. While Kannur and Thiruvananthapuram can grow, requirements like Sabarimala should be taken into account for future development. Tough phase On the current situation, Mr. Kurien said CIAL was going through a tough phase, but it would recover and bounce back quickly. Despite the pandemic, the airport authority has neither reduced the number of employees nor cut their wages, he added. The airport, while providing good return on investments to shareholders, has also been able to provide employment to members of families that lost houses when land was acquired for the airport project, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/airport-offers-1-acre-for-silver-line-station-project/article34774528.ece
10 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Back home after eight years in UAE jail||In the eight years and six months he languished in the Abu Dhabi Central Prison on death row, Becks Krishnan, a 45-year-old from Irinjalakuda in Thrissur district, was witness to the terrifying sight of seven inmates being walked to the firing range to be shot dead. He left behind those dreaded memories when he was eventually released and flew back to the embrace of his family in the early hours of Wednesday thanks to the intervention of expatriate Malayali industrialist M.A. Yusuff Ali. As he reunited with his tearful wife Veena and 12-year-old son Adwaith at the Cochin International Airport at Nedumbassery here, Krishnan heaved more than a sigh of relief. Mr. Ali paid as blood money five lakh dirhams, equivalent to Rs. 1 crore, to the family of a six-year-old Sudanese boy whom Krishnan had knocked down, which he claims was an accident, in a residential area on the night of September 13, 2012. “The one mistake I made was not stopping my car following the accident fearful of being beaten up by the family,” Krishnan recounted. Sleuths picked him up later that night and booked him for murder. During the trial, the judge sentenced him to 15 years imprisonment after the prosecution accused him of deliberately running over the child, and it was upheld by an appeal court. Krishnan had all along maintained that the child accidentally fell before his car. Approaching the apex court to get the sentence reduced sprang a nasty surprise, as he was sentenced to death. At that point, his brother-in-law approached Mr. Ali. Over six years It took over six years to convince the Sudanese family to accept the blood money and not to object to his release as per the Sharia law in the UAE. “It was about helping a fellow human being. There are times when no amount of money can help you save a life,” said Mr. Ali who has also promised to give Krishnan a job. For Krishnan, being looked down upon as a murderer is proving to be as painful as the prison life. Even on the flight back home, a fellow passenger advised him to mend his ways. “I just remained silent. I did not tell him that I was not so cold-blooded to kill a child my son’s age. Hopefully, things will improve with time, and I would be able to shed the stamp of a murderer some day,” Krishnan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/keralite-released-from-uae-prison-returns-home/article34774536.ece

In a memorandum submitted to Fisheries Minister Saji Cherian, the association listed a few recent accidents, including the one in which fishing vessel Andavan Thunai, which ventured out from Kochi on April 29, was caught in the cyclonic storm Tauktae and sank off the Lakshadweep islands on May 14. There were misleading reports in a section of the media that the fishers in the vessel had returned safe though there is no news of them as of now. In another incident, Ajmer Shah , a boat that left the Beypore harbour on May 5 was lost in the sea, and search operations are still on. Six boats and 69 fishermen on them, which left Kochi and were caught in cyclone Ockhi are still missing. Under these circumstances, the authorities must step in to provide the latest communication and safety equipment to the fishing community. All fishing vessels should be monitored strictly to ensure their safety, the association said. It also demanded that the dormitory at the Thoppumpady fishing harbour be repaired immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plea-to-ensure-safety-of-deep-sea-fishers-vessels/article34774534.ece

Additional paediatric ICUs, beds and ventilators will be made available while assistant surgeons and staff nurses will be given training in ventilator and ICU management. “At present, we have more paediatric cases compared to previous months. After a discussion with the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, all main government hospitals in Kollam have been instructed to add extra beds. Since we expect a surge, neonatal ICUs, ICU beds, and step-down ICUs will be made available, and the numbers will be increased depending on the requirement. Extra facilities will be arranged in Government Medical College Hospital, District Hospital, and taluk hospitals,” said R. Sandhya, Deputy DMO. The department is also planning to vaccinate maximum number of parents whose children are under the age of 12. All Primary Health Centres (PHCs) have been directed to collect the data of parents in four categories based on the age of their children that include zero to one, one to five, six to 12 and 13 to 18. All orphanages and shelter homes will be given a special protocol and each home will be linked to a paediatrician. Exclusive COVID first-line treatment centre (FLTCs) and second-line treatment centre (SLTCs) will be opened for children while special attention will be given to tribal and migrant communities. Quarantine “Surveillance will be strengthened when it comes to paediatric fever cases and we are also planning to spread awareness in coordination with the Education Department,” she adds. The department will open reverse quarantine centres in four places to shift children whose parents test positive. “Children, the only category who are not vaccinated, will be vulnerable during the third wave.

Launching a search operation in the waterbody which had been in spate was not easy and it took authorities hard work before finding the body stuck to a metal rod underneath before floating on to the water. The operation, which lasted over two days, brought to focus the efforts of Team Nanmakkoottam – a volunteer group of rescuers who braved the deep, murky waters to search for the body hours on end. The 60-member collective of youths, based in Erattupetta, has been part of many a search and rescue mission in and around the region for four years now. “There are about 20 expert swimmers and divers in the group, all of whom have been actively into the rescue and search mission since the mega floods of 2018,” said Fazil Vellooparambil, secretary of the collective. The team members undergo training from experts including the Fire and Rescue Services personnel every six months and operate with a couple of rope sets and an unmechanised boat. Operating primarily as a support team to the police and the Fire and Rescue Services, it has conducted 48 search operations and could save a handful of lives. The collective was founded by 38-year-old E.M. Afsal 10 years ago. Besides accidents in rivers, they support victims of road accidents.

Judicial member of the Commission K. Baijunath, who visited the plant on Monday, has asked the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation Secretary to submit a report within 10 days on steps that could be taken to alleviate the problems faced by local people due to the plant. Former councillor Mohammed Shameel, who had filed a complaint with the Commission, pointed out that the fire had caused much discomfort for local people. Besides, residents complained of the pollution of water in their wells and the stink generated from the plant. The Commission asked the Kozhikode Corporation to take the issues seriously. A major direction was to repair the shed where waste is collected, to prevent rainwater from entering it. The Commission noted that water combined with waste could lead to health issues for residents. The Commission also asked the Corporation to ensure that waste water from the plant did not go out of the plot. Meanwhile, work on the waste-to-energy plant coming up at Njeliyanparamba is taking more time than expected to be completed, mostly due to the non-availability of manpower and other hurdles posed by COVID and the lockdown. The project was launched in January 2020 and was expected to be completed in a year. Biomining to remove the residue waste in the plot is also in progress. The Corporation is also unable to bring machinery from abroad due to the lockdown. Work on the waste-to-energy plant, being carried out by the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation, through a Bengaluru-based private firm, can begin once the biomining is completed. The waste treatment plant produces around 250 tonnes of organic manure every month. The Corporation had earned around Rs. 33 lakh from the sale of the manure in the previous financial year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-directed-to-address-issues-of-njeliyanparamba-residents/article34774522.ece

Sources said at least a dozen Central agencies, including the Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing, National Investigation Agency, Enforcement Directorate, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Bureau of Investigation, Narcotics Control Bureau and Central Board of Direct Taxes, have been authorised to track the rooms scheduled by clubs that are generating excitement or individual or group chats in open or closed rooms in real time. The audio-drop in the start-up that has been attracting a bevy of early users on to conversations on multiple topics seems to have been the latest prying room for the investigation agencies.  Some of the agencies have been empowered to act under Sub-section(1) of Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, read with rule of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information Rules, 2009), the sources said. Now with Central agencies furtively trying to extract information from chat rooms, many believe that the Clubhouse app, which has been created during the COVID-19 pandemic for participatory speaking and listening, would be subjected to electronic surveillance. The App was first introduced to iOS ( mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc) in March 2020 with a beta launch for Android in May. Clubhouse beta testers are also getting new features as well. Privacy policy Incidentally in its privacy policy released on May 9, Clubhouse has stated that it would share personal information to law enforcement, government authorities and private parties as it believed necessary to “protect our, your, or others rights, privacy, safety or property (including by making and defending legal claims), enforce the terms and conditions that govern the App and protect, investigating and deter against fraudulent , harmful , unauthorised , unethical or illegal activity.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/central-agencies-pry-on-clubhouse-chat-rooms/article34774540.ece

10 June 2021||Palakkad,KERALA||Across the river, into the forests, a trip to reach students||The children of remote tribal hamlets in Attappady might have remembered the quote “if the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain” when their teachers reached their houses with bundles of books and sweets. For the teachers of Government Higher Secondary School at Agali, who reached out to their students living in remote jungles of Attappady with textbooks and notebooks last week, the four days spent in the hamlets gave moments of reckoning. Reaching the primitive Kurumba hamlets at Thudukki, Galasi, Thadikkundu, Kinattukara, Murugala, Kurukkathikkallu, Palur, Gottiyarkandi, Mele Bhuthayar and Pazhayur in the remote hills of Attappady was never easy for the teachers, led by Student Police Cadet (SPC) community police officer Joseph Antony. 10 km on foot Carrying bundles of books and stationery on their heads and shoulders, the teachers walked through the hilly jungles for about 10 km, after covering 25 km by jeep from Agali to Anavai. They crossed the River Bhavani risking their lives. “Their walk through the leech-infested forest in the rain gave them one of the toughest experiences of their life,” said T. Satyan, nodal officer of the school’s Electoral Literacy Club. The teachers took the books to the students as they have remained in their homes since March 2020. Reaching the students over the telephone too was hard as their hamlets were far inside the forests. “There was no choice before us as our students were from far-flung corners of Attappady hills,” said Mr. Antony. His colleagues Mohammed Faizal, Manikyan, Jemshad, and Dominic Arogyaraj accompanied him. The children were excited to see their teachers after more than a year. When the teachers offered them sweets, their joy knew no bounds. The teachers were touched by the living conditions of their students in the hamlets that lacked proper roads, power and mobile connectivity. Solar power Many of them have been depending on solar power for television and online studies. Solar equipment become virtually powerless in the monsoon. Lack of mobile towers in the regions makes them travel a long distance to get signal. The teachers stayed in the hamlets for four days, and experienced the life of their children in the jungle. “Life in those hamlets is hard by all means,” Satyan told The Hindu . Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) Officer Suresh Kumar, Scheduled Tribes promoters, tribal chieftains, school headmistress K. Vasanthi, and the members of the parent-teacher association and the school management committee offered their support to the teachers. Because of the lockdown, parents of the tribal children were without work and stayed at home. The remoteness of the hamlets often forced the students to stay in tribal hostels for their studies, leading to various kinds of psychological stress for them. The children had returned to their hamlets after their hostels closed down in the wake of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/across-the-river-into-the-forests-a-trip-to-reach-students/article34774486.ece

The committee has been authorised to start discussions with companies to get the project off the ground at the earliest. Dr.Sudheer said the project was envisaged as an integrated facility for mass production of generic vaccines for various diseases. “However, given the current shortage of COVID-19 vaccines, the immediate priority would be this area,” he said. New facility Dr.Sudheer said the new facility would work in tandem with the Institute of Advanced Virology under the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, which is equipped with bio-safety laboratories for research and development of vaccines. The Cabinet decided to convert the Overseas Keralites Investment Holding Limited (OKIHL) into a 100% government-owned entity.

10 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||322 fisher families to get flats at Mathippuram||The long wait for new flats for 322 families in the capital’s coastal region is about to end this month with the completion of construction of flat complexes at Mathippuram, near the Vizhinjam fishing harbour, under the second phase of the Rajiv Awaz Yojana (RAY) housing project. However, the city Corporation will face fresh challenges in executing the third and fourth phases of the project due to issues with temporary rehabilitation and ownership of the land. Remaining work At a meeting at the Corporation on Tuesday to discuss the progress of the project, officials said much of the work has been completed. The Corporation has asked the agency executing the project to complete the remaining work by June 25 so that the house keys can be handed over to the beneficiaries by the end of this month. Mainly, the work on providing power and water connections to the households are remaining. The project began six years ago, with a plan to complete the construction of new flats in place of the old huts. The residents from the plot were shifted to a rehabilitation site set up by the Corporation, while a few of them shifted to rented accommodation. But the work could not begin as nine families refused to shift for around three years. Later, the police were brought in. Resistance to project The Corporation could face similar issues in the third phase for constructing flats for 320 beneficiaries, which is also proposed in land occupied by houses of fisher families. Corporation officials expect at least a few of the families to resist the plan to move them to a temporary rehabilitation site. The fourth phase consisting of houses for 120 beneficiaries is proposed in land owned by the Harbour Engineering Department. Though the department had initially responded positively to the proposal, it is now not so keen on parting with the land. The department had recently prepared a draft master plant, as per which a processing unit is to be set up in this land. The Corporation now plans to resolve the issue through a ministerial-level meeting. The RAY project in Mathippuram was envisaged to construct flats for 1,032 families in the fishing community. In the first phase, which was completed a few years ago, houses were provided to 222 families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/322-fisher-families-to-get-flats-at-mathippuram/article34774478.ece
10 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Children orphaned by the pandemic live to fight another day||Zeeshan Ahmed, 14, (all names changed to protect privacy of children) of Adakathavayyil in Kasaragod was at the hospital with his uncle when his mother Shamsad died battling COVID-19 last month. It took some time for the teenager to realise that his mother was no more. She was his world and role model, says Shanvaz, Zeeshan’s uncle. “He was disturbed after losing her, but has accepted it now and is returning to his usual self.” As the pandemic tears through the State, it has left many families devastated. The mounting body count has had the most impact on children, depriving them of a kiss, a cuddle, a guiding hand, and often the only parent they have ever known. Zeeshan’s father had left the family 13 years ago and no one has a clue about his whereabouts. “I have been looking after my sister and her son for years. I will continue to take care of Zeeshan,” says Shanvaz. If COVID-19 has claimed the life of the lone parent in some instances, it has snatched both of them in the case of others. Aron, 10, was left alone in his small house near the Ayyappankavu temple at Manalur in Thrissur district after both his father and mother died, two weeks apart. Aron’s mother, Jiji, was the first to go. She died at the Thrissur district hospital. Two weeks later, his father, Subhash, too succumbed to the disease. Aron’s twin brother had died two years ago. In Neyyattinkara, near here, sisters Malini and Mrinalini, aged 16 and 11, have been left bereft by the deaths of their parents and their grandmother in a matter of days. The triple blow at the end of May has upended their life. It was their father who first tested positive for COVID-19. He later contracted pneumonia, and died. The same day, their mother Bindu tested positive. She too developed pneumonia and succumbed to a week later. Three days later, their maternal grandmother also breathed her last. Uncertain future Death of parents deprives children not only of their presence but also leave them dependent on relatives. Malini and Mrinalini are now living with their mother’s niece. Malini, the elder, tries to sound strong, but the pain is palpable from her reluctance to say much. Many families find themselves at a crossroads, unsure of what lies ahead. Aron’s maternal grandparents have agreed to look after him. In Kasaragod, Shanvaz’s visa has been cancelled and he has lost his job. He was employed at a supermarket in Dubai but had returned home to attend to his ailing father. “My father’s treatment expenses have left us in deep debt. Now, Zeeshan is staying in a rented accommodation with my family at Adakathavayyil,” he says. Staying resilient In the midst of personal tragedies, children have been trying to surmount sorrow and prepare for school, examinations and admissions. Two siblings, a 16-year-old and an 18-year-old, in Ernakulam lost both their parents in a span of two months. They lost their mother to cancer in March, three weeks after she got her diagnosis. In April, their father, a building contractor, tested positive for COVID, and succumbed to it after a week in the hospital. The siblings are now staying with their grandparents. "When I appeared for my class 12 exams this year, my father was still around. Two days after I finished my exams, he passed away," says Anoop. He hopes to pursue Hotel Management, while his sister aspires to become a doctor and wants to prepare for entrance examinations. Officials say that reports on the children orphaned by the pandemic have been sent to the government, and they expect the benefits to be made available once the modalities of the rehabilitation package are announced. However, it is not clear if the monthly assistance of Rs. 2,000 announced by the government is in addition to the existing foster care or sponsorship scheme. The details of assistance to children who have lost one parent to COVID-19 are also not clear as yet.  Package on the anvil The Kerala government is looking into guidelines submitted by the State Women and Child Development Director on the rehabilitation package announced for such children. So far, 72 children have been orphaned or abandoned in the State. Social Justice Secretary Biju Prabhakar said 1,700-odd children had also lost a single parent. Some of them did not require financial support. Only after a clear picture of those in need of financial support emerged could the quantum of assistance for them be decided. Individual care plans for the children would need to be drawn up for this. Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights member K. Nazeer said the guidelines should be decided scientifically. There have also been calls for extending the benefits to children orphaned by causes other than COVID-19 on the grounds of fairness. The government is considering the matter. About eligibility for aid in specific instances such as children turning 18 after the death of parent/parents from COVID-19, Mr. Prabhakar said a decision on them could be taken only after individual child care plan preparation.

10 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Probe moots action against cops in manhandling incident||An internal inquiry conducted into the alleged manhandling of four minor boys in Kattakada two days ago has recommended disciplinary action against the police officers who were involved in the incident. Sanjaykumar Gurudin, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Thiruvananthapuram Range, forwarded his recommendation along with the inquiry report to Harshita Attalluri, Inspector General of Police, South Zone, for further action. The inquiry by Kattakada Deputy Superintendent of Police (Dy.SP) S. Shaji was instituted after four Plus One students alleged they were manhandled by the police near a temple in Anjuthenginmoodu on Monday. Online class They had claimed to have been attending an online class on a mobile while they were purportedly assaulted. The probe noted the local police used to receive complaints from local residents about a group of youngsters who regularly gathered on the temple premises to watch movies and smoke. While the police had made previous attempts to rein in such practices, especially during the lockdown, the gang used to evade prosecution by fleeing at the sight of officers approaching them. Action after complaint On the day of the incident, the police received a complaint and subsequently a team, led by the Kattakada station house officer (SHO) Jose Mathew and comprising a sub-inspectors and four others, rounded up the suspects by coming in two vehicles from different access routes that led to the temple premises. The inquiry officer stated that there was “minimum use of force” when the youngsters resisted the officers’ attempts to take them into custody. They could have suffered injuries in the melee. Nonetheless, the police officers were found to have committed lapses in handling the issue. Adequate precaution was not adopted in securing the custody of the minor boys. The controversy brought bad name to the police, the report concluded. While the police had initially alleged that the youngsters used to smoke ganja, the report made no such mention. The findings also did not include the alleged use of a cable which, the students claimed, was used to assault them. Child rights panel The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which had formally registered a suo moto case in connection with the incident a day ago, served notice on the State Police Chief, District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram Rural) and the Kattakada SHO on Wednesday. They have been directed to submit inquiry reports within 15 days. Commission chairman K.V. Manoj Kumar said he had recorded the statements of the purported victims and took cognisance of the visible bruise marks on their backs. On inspecting the jeep of the Kattakada police, he had also found a black cable that was allegedly used to assault the youngsters.

10 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||No carte blanche to govt.: Sudhakaran||Newly appointed Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran has said the Congress will not give the government a carte blanche even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, Mr. Sudhakaran slammed the Left Democratic Front (LDF) for injecting politics into the fight against the global scourge. “The CPI(M) has deliberately kept Congress workers out of pandemic relief efforts. It has browbeaten authorities to ensure only LDF workers got volunteer passes with an eye on future elections. Party workers will rally strongly against the partisan approach,” he said. The Congress high command had tasked him to rebuild the Congress in Kerala from scratch. The party would emphasise merit while choosing leaders. Group equations would take a back seat. Mr. Sudhakaran said he belonged to no group. “I defeated ‘A’ and ‘I’ group nominees to become the District Congress Committee (DCC) president in Kannur in 1991,” he said. The CPI(M) had spread the rumour that the new KPCC president was soft towards the BJP to alienate minority communities from the Congress. The ploy failed at the hustings in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and would flop again. Mr. Sudhakaran said the BJP in Kerala would never surmount its inherent weaknesses. The BJP’s majoritarian Hindutva politics had no traction in highly literate and progressive Kerala. The party would remain on the fringes of the political spectrum. For the Congress, the main enemy is the CPI(M) and its politics of violence. The party would meet the CPI(M) head on, he said. Mr. Sudhakaran said nobody had eased him into the KPCC president’s seat from above. He had come up the ranks of the Congress and suffered much in the process. He owed the position to the party’s national leadership and none else. Mr. Sudhakaran said former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, former Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan and others had backed him for the post. He would take charge on a date convenient to party workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-carte-blanche-to-govt-sudhakaran/article34774553.ece

While the Sree Narayana Guru Open University (SNGOU) had earlier expressed doubts in launching their open and distance learning (ODL) programmes this year, Calicut University is also yet to receive the UGC approval. Nonetheless, both Kerala and Calicut universities had expressed their interest in conducting distance education programmes at a meeting of Vice Chancellors convened by Higher Education Minister R. Bindu recently. Kerala University had obtained regular recognition from the UGC’s Distance Education Bureau for the 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years. On account of the COVID-19 pandemic, the university had received an extension in 2020-21. The university had applied for recognition of its 26 programmes for the current academic year (2021-22) in October last and has been awaiting approval, Director of the university’s School of Distance Education (SDE) R. Vasanthagopal, said. The SDE, which offered 26 undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, admit nearly 12,000 students on an average every year. Considering there are five papers in the first semester, around 50,000 copies of study materials used to be published from the Kerala University Press for the batch alone. Printing ceased However, the university ceased to print such materials last year after the government had passed legislation to bring distance learning courses under the SNGOU. Official sources say that the press will have to dedicate at least three months to print the SDE materials. This poses a risk of its other activities going off track. Any delay in overcoming such hurdles could jeopardise the career prospects of nearly 1 lakh students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/distance-education-faces-uncertain-test/article34774475.ece
10 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Artist and sculptor G. Sunilkumar dead||Artist and sculptor G.Sunilkumar, who was active in the Radical Painters and Sculptors Association in the 1980s, passed away here on Wednesday following COVID-19-related health complications. He was 61. A resident of Kovalam, his works reflected the lives and landscapes of coastal regions. Some of his notable works in the later years were on stained glass. In the 1980s, as a student at the College of Fine Arts, Thiruvananthapuram, he became a part of the radical group, a proletarian art movement that eschewed the existing visual styles, that created ripples in the art world across the country. “Sunilkumar was a dedicated art student during those days. He was active in the radical group. He used to be mentally very alert observing the world around him to make it reflect in his art. Unlike many other artists, he was concerned about society as a whole. He was of the opinion that artists should not be idle, but remain active. With a wish to help other artists, he set up an art gallery at Kovalam too,” says sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman, who used to teach at Fine Arts College. Kunhiraman remembers that the radical movement brought about positive changes in the college too, as protests against the policies of the administration were also part of the group’s concerns along with their experiments in art. Gallery in Kovalam A.S. Sajith, former Principal of the College of Fine Arts, remembers the exhibitions Sunilkumar used to organise at his gallery in Kovalam. “His sketches are notable for the powerful lines he employed,” says Sajith. Sunilkumar had later worked as an art teacher at the College of Fine Arts, the College of Architecture, Thiruvananthapuram, and the RLV College of Fine Arts, Thripunithura.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/artist-and-sculptor-g-sunilkumar-dead/article34774480.ece

The court returned the petition citing technical reasons. The petition can be filed after rectifying the errors, the court said. Dharmarajan filed the petition demanding the money which the police recovered from the robbers. He claimed the stolen money belonged to him and Sunil Naik. The money was stolen while it was being taken to Ernakulam for a business purpose. The police had so far recovered around Rs. 1.5 crore, he said. However, there are many contradictions between Dharmarajan’s earlier statement to the police and the petition filed in the court. In the complaint lodged with the police, he said only Rs. 25 lakh was stolen. Later, during interrogation he admitted that there was Rs. 3.5 crore in the car. He allegedly admitted to the police that it was black money. But now he claimed it was meant for business. Dharmarajan said it was his driver who lodged a complaint with the police. The driver did not know how much money was in the car. The police suspect that the new move was to divert the investigation from BJP leaders. Meanwhile, there are reports that the move of the special investigation team were leaked from its own members. The police are continuing their search for Shigil, the 15th accused in the case.

Construction of hanging bridges across the Gosthani river, development of three beaches at Bhimili, Annavaram and Bhogapuram and seaplane terminals at Bhimili and Bhogapuram beaches are some of the other proposals, which have been approved. The Bhimili – Bhogapuram stretch of road will be developed at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,021 crore. The existing 30-km stretch, between RK Beach and Bhimili Beach, is already attracting 10 million tourists a year and there is immense scope for further development. “The sky tower will be constructed in the public-private partnership (PPP) mode at an estimated cost of Rs. 240 crore. An amount of Rs. 10 crore has been sanctioned for conversion of the Bangladesh ship, which ran aground near Tenneti Park, into a floating restaurant. A jetty will be constructed to berth the ship. A total of 11 beaches have been identified between Visakhapatnam and Bhogapuram for further development,” Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao told The Hindu . Meanwhile, AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) Division, Visakhapatnam, on Wednesday announced the sanction of seven works at a cost of Rs. 1,503.33 lakh, in Visakhapatnam district, under the ‘Swadesh Darshan’ scheme of the Union government. Six works were taken up by the AP Tourism Authority (APTA) at a total cost of Rs. 13.77 crore for provision of tourist amenities at Pandrangi, Krishna Devi Peta, Borra Caves and Araku. DPRs have been submitted to the Centre for approval for development of Araku Eco Tourism Circuit at an estimated cost of Rs. 156 crore and development of passenger jetty at Bheemunipatnam at a cost of Rs. 49 crore, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/plans-to-give-a-leg-up-to-tourism-in-district/article34775000.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Electricity tariff hiked by average 30 paise: KERC||People will have to pay more for electricity as the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) has approved an average increase in tariff by 30 paise per unit for all electricity supply companies (Escoms) for the ongoing financial year. According to the Commission, the revision has been made considering the increase in fixed or demand and energy charges for the financial year 2021-22, resulting in an average increase of 3.84%.  17.31% increase The Escoms had sought an average increase of 135 paise per unit, accounting for a 17.31% increase. The revised tariff would come into effect for electricity consumed from the first metre reading date falling on or after April 1 this year to “enable recovery of the revenue gap determined by the Commission”. Prevailing lockdown “However, to soften the burden of increase in tariff on the consumers during the prevailing lockdown situation on account of the COVID-19 pandemic in the State, the arrears towards revision of tariff for April and May 2021 is ordered to be recovered during October and November 2021, respectively, without charging any interest,” the Commission added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/electricity-tariff-hiked-by-average-30-paise-kerc/article34774286.ece
10 June 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mucormycosis patients lack hospital beds||The dearth of treatment facilities and supply of medicines in many cases is forcing mucormycosis (black fungus) patients in other districts to seek medical help in Bengaluru. However, when they arrive at the State’s capital, most are unable to find a bed as they were unaware of the official procedure where District Health Officers (DHOs) have to be alerted so that beds can be organised for them. Others travel to the city only to realise that they have been falsely diagnosed with black fungus. Anjaneya, a lineman from Raichur, developed pain in one of his nostrils days after he recovered from COVID-19. The local hospital diagnosed it as a case of mucormycosis, but said they had no medicine – Liposomal Amphotericin B – to treat the deadly fungal infection. Instead, they gave him an antibiotic and sent him home, asking him to try his luck after a week. But he panicked and reached the city, seeking immediate treatment. “It’s only after we came to Bengaluru that we realised the procedure. Our DHO had to write to the DHO in Bengaluru who had to recommend us to get a bed in either Bowring or Victoria Hospitals. After a lot of running from pillar to post, we went to Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, where it was diagnosed that it was not a case of black fungus,” said Rangareddy, a close friend of Anjaneya. “We spent four very tense days, unnecessarily,” he said. Umesh Nareppa, senior cardiac surgeon and part of BMC-92, a group of doctors across the world volunteering by offering teleconsultations, recently saw a patient from Hassan who had developed pain in the upper jaw days after recovering from COVID-19. He soon developed numbness in the chin. “I suspected it to be a case of mucormycosis and asked him to go to an ENT doctor. The local doctor ruled out black fungus. But within days he developed other symptoms which pointed to the fungal infection. We tried getting a bed for the patient in Bengaluru. Eventually, the district hospital responded and he was operated upon. Many districts do not have such good doctors and facilities,” he said, adding that the lack of proper diagnosis and treatment was a serious concern in several districts. “Ideally, all patients need to be treated in their respective districts only. But when there are gaps in facilities, expertise and medicines, people must be allowed to use infrastructure in the State’s capital,” he said. Also, the procedure in place, wherein the DHO writes to his counterpart in Bengaluru, is proving to be a hurdle. DHOs are hesitant to write the referral letters as they will be held accountable for not being able to treat patients in their districts, sources said. “In several districts, there seem to be clear instructions not to issue such referrals. If they are able to correctly diagnose and treat such patients, it’s fine. But when there are gaps, the patients are denied better care available in the State,” said H.V. Vasu, co-ordinator, Karnataka COVID-19 Volunteers Team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mucormycosis-patients-lack-hospital-beds/article34774305.ece

District Collector Vivek Yadav said the housing programme taken up by the State government was the biggest in the country and said that the house patta was being provided to every beneficiary within 90 days of applying.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stone-laid-for-housing-colony/article34774346.ece
10 June 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Early flood into Jurala allows power generation||Early flood into the Jurala project this monsoon season has not only improved the water storage in it to near full reservoir (FRL) level but has also allowed Telangana State Power Generation Corporation Ltd (TS-Genco) to commence power generation and allowed irrigation authorities to start water release/lifting to several systems based on the reservoir. With the arrival of about 4.5 tmcft of flood water into Jurala till Wednesday evening, the authorities have switched on pumps of the Bhima-I and II, Koilsagar and Nettempadu lift schemes also to the right, left and parallel canals of the project. Water storage On the other hand, Genco authorities switched on one of the 6x39 megawatt power houses of the Jurala Hydro Electric Station on Wednesday afternoon. “Good rainfall in the local catchment areas of Krishna and Bheema rivers between Narayanpur dam in Karnataka and Jurala project (in Jogulamba-Gadwal district) for more than a week has brought in sizeable quantity of water into the reservoir. But for release of water to various lifts and canal systems and discharge of water into the river course after power generation, the reservoir would have become surplus on Wednesday itself,” an engineering official who was monitoring flood at the reservoir said. The water storage in Jurala was 4.46 tmcft against its capacity of 9.66 tmcft on June 1 as the inflows were less than 600 cusecs. Steady increase However, they picked up from June 3 and increased steadily till June 8 night and went beyond 27,000 cusecs by early Wednesday. The flood that started receding steadily through the day reached 18,800 cusecs by evening. As the water storage in the reservoir crossed the 9-tmcft mark in the afternoon on Wednesday, Genco authorities switched on one unit to discharge about 5,200 cusecs into the river course after power generation. Besides, water lifting through Nettempadu, Koilsagar and Bheema schemes and release into three canal systems has also been taken up.  “Power generation at the Jurala project was possible only from July 14 last year as the inflows did not pick up till release of water from Narayanpur dam. However, good rainfall in the catchment areas between Narayanpur and Jurala has brought early flood and enabled us to take up generation more than month earlier,” Genco authorities said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/early-flood-into-jurala-allows-power-generation/article34774576.ece

10 June 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Directive withdrawn in Lakshadweep||In the face of criticism, the Director of Port, Shipping and Navigation in the Lakshadweep administration has quietly withdrawn the order for the deployment of government staff on fishing boats. Director Sachin Sharma also reversed the May 28 order by which the security around ports, jetties, ships and other vessels was raised to level-2 “on the basis of recent intelligence inputs”. In an e-mail message to the Deputy Director (S&T), Kochi; Assistant Directors; port assistants on the island; the CSO of the Lakshadweep Development Corporation Limited (LDCL); and the Assistant Commandant of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) in Kochi on June 7, Mr. Sharma cited the orders of May 28 and June 2 “regarding strengthening of security in ports/ships and jetties” and said “as per further inputs, all concerned may revert back to standard protocol and SOPs [standard operating procedures]”. The Lakshadweep Government Employees’ Union had recently taken exception to the order asking for government employees to go on board fishing vessels for intelligence collection. The order was also criticised by fishers’ forums. Sources said maritime security agencies were also peeved with the order, which was interpreted as interfering with their jurisdictional powers. The June 2 communication was about a security review meeting chaired by an Advisor to the Union Territory Administrator. It said decisions had been taken to deploy government staff on fishing craft, strengthen security measures to monitor local fishing boats, and intensify checking of motorised and passenger vessels. It had also ordered measures for the installation of CCTV cameras at berthing ports and the helibase, and the baggage and passenger checking facility at the Mangalore and Beypore ports. The LDCL had been asked to “inform ship masters to remain vigilant and alert”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/directive-withdrawn-in-lakshadweep/article34774293.ece
10 June 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||DJ night on Clubhouse an instant hit with Malayalis globally||As a DJ session in Loud Malayali, a voice chat room in the Clubhouse app, the new social media sensation, hit a crescendo, a listener who tuned in from the UAE desperately wanted to shake a leg, notwithstanding the fact that he was in a two-piece suit far from a dance floor. He went into his car, rolled up the windows, cranked up the volume of the Bluetooth speaker and tapped his foot wildly, or as much as the cramped space allowed. As it turned out, he wasn’t alone. Hundreds of Malayalis from across the world had a similar adrenaline rush listening to remixed Malayalam and Bollywood songs during the DJ night moderated by disc jockey (DJ) Savio, and radio jockeys (RJ) Karthik and Leo Paul on Monday. The session was a mix of tracks and interactions with listeners that lasted for over two hours. “The response was phenomenal as was evident from the Instagram stories and Facebook accounts. At a time when people are locked up in their houses, we wanted to make them feel good again,” Mr. Savio said. He has been a DJ for 22 years. What gave the event a real lively experience was the quality of the sound created using a club management software. “The sound quality was phenomenal when connected to a headset or Bluetooth speakers. It was like a DJ session coming alive at home and in these trying times, it was a great stress buster,” Mr. Karthik said. Loud Malayali was born almost accidentally just two days before its successful debut. Mr. Paul, an RJ in Qatar and now in Kerala, hit upon the idea of getting on Clubhouse with something different, which he shared with his friend, Mr. Karthik. Together they approached Mr. Savio. “Serious discussions are the trend in Clubhouse. But we wanted to set a new trend with entertainment-heavy events,” said Mr. Paul. They are now planning to hold thematic DJ sessions on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The next session is dedicated to Tamil ‘kuthu’ songs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dj-night-on-clubhouse-an-instant-hit-with-malayalis-globally/article34774291.ece
10 June 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Ravi Pujari involved in Kasaragod shooting case’||Gangster Ravi Pujari was involved in the Bevincha shooting case in Kasaragod where the assailants targeted a gold dealer, Mohammad Kunhi, in an attempt to extort money from him, according to the police. The role of Pujari in the second case booked in the State was revealed by the police in a remand extension report filed at the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, the other day. The Anti-Terrorism Squad of the Kerala Police had obtained the accused in custody in connection with the Panampilly Nagar beauty parlour shooting case. Seeking the extension of the remand of the accused, the police submitted that the source of weapons used in the Panampilly Nagar firing case could not be ascertained even after interrogating Pujari. The continued custody of the accused was required to probe the role of other accused in the case.  Two more accused need to be located and arrested. The investigation in the case was progressing and forensic analysis reports were awaited, the police submitted. The agency apprehended that the accused, an international gangster who was wanted in many grave crimes in India, would threaten or influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence if released on bail. They also apprehended that he would abscond if enlarged on bail and will not appear before the court for trial. The court, which accepted the submission of the police, sent Pujari back to the Parappana Agrahara Central jail. Beauty parlour case The First Information Report registered in the Panampilly Nagar firing case noted that the accused intimidated the actor Leena Paul and caused fear of death by firing at the beauty parlour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ravi-pujari-involved-in-kasaragod-shooting-case/article34774288.ece

10 June 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||CPI(M) criticises State govt. over Gangavaram Port sale||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary Penumalli Madhu has criticised the State government’s decision to part with its 90% stake in the Gangavaram Port connected to the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant(VSP). At a press conference here on Wednesday, Mr. Madhu said while the State government seemed to oppose the privatisation of the VSP, it was astonishing to see it parting with its stake in the port, an integral part of the VSP as all the raw material and finished products are handled here. “Why is the government bent on selling its stake to Adani, who was acquiring the 10% stake in the Gangavaram Port from D.V.S. Raju,” questioned Mr. Madhu and threatened to launch a Statewide strike if the State government did not reverse its decision on the port. The Adanis had already taken control of Krishnapatnam, Bhavanapadu, and Machilipatnam ports and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy must stop the onslaught of privatisation, he said. “People voted the YSRCP to power with a thumping majority to have a proper State capital and Special Status, not to lose their public assets,” he said, adding that the party that raised a hue and cry about the issues after the bifurcation was not bothered about them after coming to power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpim-criticises-state-govt-over-gangavaram-port-sale/article34774345.ece
10 June 2021||M. RajeevHYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||No clarity on mode of payment of arrears||As the government prepares to credit the revised salary into the accounts of employees of different categories taking 30 per cent fitment hike into consideration, clarity is yet to emerge on the mode of payment of the arrears due from April 1 last year. There is uncertainty over the definition of cash and monetary benefits announced by the Cabinet on Tuesday as part of the implementation of revised pay scales. The government has announced after the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that new pay scales will become operational with the salary of June, payable in July for 9.21 lakh employees, including those contracted and outsourced, and pensioners. The notional benefit of the revised pay scales will be implemented from July 1, 2018 and monetary benefit from April 1 last year. The cash benefit of the revised scales will be effective from April 1 this year. There is clarity on the payment of arrears of the revised scales to pensioners with effect from April 1 last fiscal as the government said they would be paid in 36 instalments. But the same is not the case with the salaries/wages of the existing staff. Employees are of the view that the arrears due for the month of June will be paid along with the salary in July and the government could opt for depositing the arrears for April and May in the accounts of the staff in due course. “There is, however, no clarity on how the arrears of the last financial year will be paid. Orders are awaited on whether they will be credited to the GPF accounts or whether the government opts for a separate head of account for payment of the arrears,” a representative of employees union wondered. Given the uncertainty prevailing on the issue, employees are anxiously awaiting orders over the implementation of the new scales with the hope that clarity will emerge on the payment of arrears, both of the current fiscal as well as 12 months of the last fiscal. Additional expenditure The government is likely to incur close to Rs. 1,000 crore additional expenditure every month on account of revised pay scales announced for more than nine lakh employees and pensioners including the contract and outsourcing staff. Though the PRC headed by retired bureaucrat C.R. Biswal announced fitment hike of 7.5 per cent amounting to additional expenditure of around Rs. 2,300 crore a year, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao took the initiative to enhance the hike to 30 per cent and thereby incur a huge expenditure on the State exchequer. The government reported expenditure of Rs. 3,045.38 crore in April for payment of salaries to staff at different levels and pensions to the retired staff. According to the unaudited provisional figures of the monthly key indicators available in the Comptroller and Auditor General of India’s website, the State government reported expenditure of Rs. 2018.36 crore for payment of salaries and another Rs. 1,027.02 crore for pensions during April. The additional outgo from the exchequer due to the implementation of the revised pay scales is of the order of Rs. 12,000 crore a year, according to senior Finance department officials. The department is busy finalising the modalities for releasing the orders on the actuals due to employees and mode of payment of arrears due to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-clarity-on-mode-of-payment-of-arrears/article34774578.ece

A delegation of BJP leaders led by Kummanam Rajasekharan and O. Rajagopal met Governor Arif Mohammad Khan to spotlight “gross abuse of police machinery by the Left Democratic Front [LDF] government to tarnish the BJP and to harass its leaders”. A senior leader said the high-profile visit to Raj Bhavan was a clear signal that the BJP had rallied behind Mr. Surendran. The party would politically and legally battle out the attempts to hobble the organisation by foisting false cases against its apparatchiks. In a petition to Mr. Khan, the BJP said the CPI(M) had subverted the investigation into the Kodakara highway robbery case and weaponised it to target the party’s State leadership. The BJP alleged political vendetta. The leaders said the police specifically targeted Mr. Surendran and his family to punish him for campaigning against the LDF on various sensitive issues, including the Sabarimala and the gold smuggling case. The police had slapped a case against Mr. Surendran in Majeswaram, falsely accusing him of bribing a political rival to withdraw his candidacy for the Assembly constituency. The leaders alleged that the police had prevented the BJP from holding its core committee meeting in Kochi on June 6 citing COVID-19 protocol. The BJP leaders requested Mr. Khan to “take note of the oppressive, anti-democratic and illegal actions of the State government and to take appropriate remedial measures”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-leaders-call-on-kerala-governor/article34774300.ece
10 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala CM promises digital education for all students||Amid escalating concerns over lack of access to digital classes, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has promised digital education for all students in the State, with priority for tribal children. He has entrusted the Chief Secretary with setting up a Secretary-level committee to address the problems with regard to online education, which the government plans to start in a phased manner next month. The Chief Minister was chairing a high-level meeting on online education for school students here on Wednesday. Children, he said, should be able to pursue their education without being bogged down by the digital divide. With uncertainty over how long the COVID-19 pandemic would drag on, digital classes were unavoidable. Children required digital equipment of their own, just like textbooks, to study. Internet connectivity Not having digital equipment was not a reason for a child to be deprived of the right to education. That was not all. Despite owing equipment, many children across the districts were finding it difficult to attend the classes owing to issues with Internet connectivity. Such pockets needed to be identified and steps taken to ensure Internet access, he said. Mr. Vijayan directed that utmost priority be given to addressing the problems in the tribal areas. In areas that lacked electricity supply, generators and solar power could be used. Facilities for students to study would be arranged in every tribal settlement. Support of individuals, institutions, and corporates could be sought for purchase of equipment. A special fund would be launched for the purpose.  An appeal would be made to Internet service providers to provide free connectivity to the needy and waive service charges. School parent-teacher associations should find out how many students require the facilities, he said.  Minister for Local Self-Government M.V. Govindan, Minister for Development of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes K. Radhakrishan, Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty, Minister for Electricity K. Krishnankutty, Chief Secretary V.P. Joy, and Secretaries and Directors of various departments took part in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-cm-promises-digital-education-for-all-students/article34774301.ece
10 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Surendran’s visit to New Delhi sparks rumours||Bharathiya Janata Party (BJP) State president K. Surendran’s presence in New Delhi on Wednesday triggered intense speculation about an impending leadership change in the party’s “embattled” State unit. Some in the BJP have postulated that the national leadership had summoned Mr. Surendran and his position was precarious. Notably, Mr. Surendran’s trip to the national capital comes against the backdrop of a rapidly expanding and politically touchy police investigation into the suspected role of BJP leaders in the alleged movement and subsequent highway heist of “unaccounted election funds” at Kodkara in Thrissur on April 3, barely three days before the Assembly elections on April 6. The controversy had also provided a heavy stick to the ruling front and the Opposition to assail the BJP in the Assembly. Bribery charges The factional fight in the Janadhipathya Rashtriya Party (JRP) headed by tribal leader C.K. Janu has arguably added to Mr. Surendran’s “woes.” At least two JRP leaders have accused Mr. Surendran of paying Ms. Janu Rs. 10 lakh to woo her back to the National Democratic Alliance fold. Ms. Janu and Mr. Surendran have denied the accusation. The BJP is also struggling to fend off the insinuation that it had paid a Kasaragod resident to withdraw his candidacy for the Assembly seat in Manjeswaram in favour of Mr. Surendran. ‘Position safe’ A BJP leader denied Mr. Surendran’s position in the party was shaky. He said the leader’s visit to New Delhi was planned and not an “incriminating summons” as made out in the media. A knee-jerk reaction like removing the party president for a temporary election reversal or a “baseless charge” orchestrated by political detractors had no precedent in the BJP, the leader said. Tree felling case At the same time, Mr. Surendran seemed set to utilise the New Delhi visit to turn the tables on the State government by seeking a Central inquiry into the illegal felling of centuries-old and valuable rosewood trees on assigned land in Wayanad. He was due to meet Union Minister for Environment and Forests Prakash Javedakar to spotlight the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/surendrans-visit-to-new-delhi-sparks-rumours/article34774298.ece

The clearance for probe was given on Wednesday on the basis of a recommendation made by Transport Minister Antony Raju. Internal inquiry has found serious lapses in fund management since 2010. Audit report The audit report pointed out that the personnel, including the accounts officer, had erred and misappropriated funds. The allegation is that the KSRTC had failed to maintain the bank and treasury account details during the UDF regime till 2013. A scrutiny by the Additional Secretary, Finance, had revealed financial mismanagement and pointed out lapses on the part of the officials who had to ensure financial discipline, according to a release from the office of the Transport Minister. Soon after taking over as Chairman and Managing Director of the KSRTC last year, Biju Prabhakar had been pressing for an inquiry into the missing money.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vigilance-to-investigate-ksrtc-money-missing-case/article34774297.ece
10 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||New plant species spotted in Wagamon||A new plant species belonging to the coffee family spotted in the scenic Wagamon hills has been named Argostemma quarantena to commemorate the millions who have died in the COVID-19 pandemic. A delicate herbaceous species from the family Rubiaceae, Argostemma quarantena was discovered along quick-flowing streams in an isolated evergreen patch along the Idukki-Kottayam border. The plant was identified by a research team consisting of Anoop P. Balan and A.J. Robi, faculty of the Department of Botany, Bishop Abraham Memorial College, Thuruthicad, Pathanamthitta district; and N. Sasidharan, former Chief Scientist, Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI), Peechi. Their findings have been published in the latest issue of Webbia journal of plant taxonomy and geography. Epithet link “The specific epithetquarantenaindicates the outbreak of coronavirus across the world in 2020,” the paper on the discovery noted. The new species sports similarities with two south Indian endemics, Argostemma anupama and Argostemma courtallense but differs in many attributes, including the stem, leaves and stipules, according to the researchers.  Argostemma quarantena is a perennial herb which grows to a height of 3-7cm and is characterised by striking white flowers. Very sensitive to microclimatic changes, the plant is found in wet rocks in shaded, undisturbed habitats, notably along streams in evergreen forests. Argostemma quarantena is known only from its type locality at Wagamon, according to the findings. The species has been classified Data Deficient (DD) under IUCN standards as extensive field surveys are required to assign an appropriate category. The discovery of the species underlines the need for urgent measures to protect the biodiversity of Wagamon, a popular tourist destination, Dr. Robi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/new-plant-species-spotted-in-wagamon/article34774302.ece

10 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan asks officials not to delay payment of YSR Bima benefits||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday asked the officials to implement the amendments done to the YSR Bima scheme from July 1, wherein the government would directly provide financial assistance to the kin of the deceased. A sum of Rs. 1 lakh would be paid, if the breadwinner of the family in the age group of 18 to 50 years dies a natural death, and Rs. 5 lakh if the beneficiary aged between 18 and 70 years dies in an accident. Special officer Reviewing the YSR Bima scheme, the Chief Minister asked the officials to revamp the existing guidelines to make the claim-settlement process simple and easy. He made it clear that the compensation amount should be paid within a month of receiving the application and ordered appointment of a special officer to monitor the implementation of the scheme. There should be no delay in payment of the money in case of death of farmers, accidental death of fishermen or death of livestock, said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and asked the district Collectors to ensure smooth settlements of the claims. The screening of applications could be handled by village and ward secretaries, he added. The officials explained that around 1.4 crore ration card holders in the State are being covered under the YSR Bima scheme. Despite the Central government, which paid 50 % of the premium amount earlier, withdrawing from the scheme, they said that the State government continued the insurance scheme by paying the entire premium amounts to ensure financial security to the families in need. Citing delay in the process of opening bank accounts, linking them to the insurance and non-settlement of claims and compensating the affected families, they said even as the premium was being fully paid by the government, there were issues such as failure of the beneficiaries to open accounts or linking them to the insurance, resulting in pendency of applications in bank branches. After completing the official formalities, 45 days is considered as the lean period and the authorities do not pay any compensation if the breadwinner of the family dies during that period. As many as 12,039 people died within 45 days of applying for the insurance and no compensation was paid to their families by the banks. But with the Chief Minister’s intervention, Rs. 254.72 crore has been paid to them on humanitarian grounds, they said. So far, only 60 lakh accounts have been opened while 58 lakh applications have been pending in the State. Of the 6,173 applications received till date, only 2,839 beneficiaries have uploaded documents and 152 families have received the benefits. Welfare schemes Expressing satisfaction over the hard work of the Finance Department to ensure that the benefits of the welfare schemes reached the needy even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chief Minister said leaving no scope for corruption, the government had transferred Rs. 95,000 crore through DBT and had spent Rs. 1.35 lakh crore in total, including on welfare schemes such as Aarogyasri, Sampoorna Poshana and housing for the poor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-asks-officials-not-to-delay-payment-of-ysr-bima-benefits/article34774987.ece

10 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. on a mission to increase population of Punganur cattle||As part of its livestock development programme, the government is focussing on the implementation of ‘Mission Punganur’ for improving the quality and numbers of the Punganur cattle, which are known for their nutritious milk and have proved to be effective in organic farming, in the next five years at Pulivendula University research centre. Embryo Transfer Technology According to an official release, the project aims at conserving and propagating the Punganur cattle breed and do rapid multiplication of the superior females through Embryo Transfer Technology (ETF). Another important aspect of the project is to efficiently use low genetic merit cows as surrogates and produce ‘elite offspring’. A three to four-fold increase in the reproductive efficiency of cows is targeted. The project envisages a production of at least 8.5 offspring from each cow in five years compared to 2.5 during the same period from each cow under normal circumstances. A total of 1,690 offspring are expected to be produced from 200 superior donors. Funds sanctioned The government has sanctioned Rs. 69.36 crore to the Andhra Pradesh Centre for Advanced Research on Livestock Limited for Punganur cattle production using IVF technology. Director of Animal Husbandry Amarendra Kumar has stated that Punganur breed milk has nutritive and medicinal values and their numbers have come down to a few hundreds now.

10 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mines Dept. to collect seigniorage based on weight and not value||Minister for Mines and Geology P. Ramachandra Reddy has announced the government’s decision to change the system of collecting seigniorage on mines from value to weight basis, and to provide sand for Jagananna Colonies project through coupons free of cost. Besides, the government has resolved to award minor mineral leases through the e-auction route. Addressing a review meeting on the Mines & Geology Department on Wednesday, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said that greater emphasis was being laid on curbing the illegal mining and accurate weighment of vehicles, which would increase the revenue by up to 20%. Further, keeping the complexity of monitoring the excavations (checking illegal mining and transportation) in view, the department reached the conclusion that by entrusting the collection of seigniorage to outsourcing agencies at the district level, it could focus on the regulation part. “This model is being followed in Rajasthan and some other States, and applies to all minor minerals,” he said. The overall steps were expected to increase the seigniorage by up to 40%. In FY 2020-21, the seigniorage revenue was Rs. 1,643 crore. The Minister insisted that the weight basis of seigniorage assessment was a more accurate way of calculating the charges than the value metric. Closed circuit cameras were being installed at the weighbridges for watching the process of weighment, while the officials did their duties. Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said the e-auction of minor minerals was likely to fetch Rs. 476 crore for the State exchequer this year. The department has already received 2,694 applications for excavation of minor minerals in 21,577 hectares. Jai Prakash Ventures has so far taken out 16 lakh tonnes of sand and sold 9.28 lakh tonnes and stocked 6.72 lakh tonnes for the monsoon season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mines-dept-to-collect-seigniorage-based-on-weight-and-not-value/article34774996.ece

10 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||RTC officials decide to run more number of buses from tomorrow||The occupancy ratio (OR) of the APSRTC bus services, which was around 40% in May, has slightly increased in the first week of June and is now hovering around 50%, according to the APSRTC officials from the Visakhapatnam region. With the COVID-19 cases slowly coming down in the State and the government seems to have started the unlocking procedure, many people are travelling in buses. Buses going towards Rajamahendravaram, Vijayawada, Srikakulam, Eluru, Vizianagaram and a few other areas are receiving a good number of commuters. City buses which are being run on several routes in the morning are also evoking good response from commuters. Keeping in view of increase in OR and further two-hour relaxation provided by the State government, the APSRTC officials have decided to increase the services from June 11. APSRTC Regional Manager M.Y. Danam said that in May they used to run about only 35% of buses, including city buses, from the region. “From June 11, relaxation hours have been extended till 2 p.m. So, we will run bus services in these two hours also. The number of services to run and the routes are being decided as of now. May be 10% more buses will be on the roads. This will definitely help people,” he said. Though the APSRTC officials have directed the passengers to follow COVID-19 protocol in the bus services and run with only 50% occupancy, a number of bus services are seen violating the norm. In many buses running towards Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and a few other routes, more than 50% of seating is being allowed. Moreover, passengers are also not leaving out those seats which are marked not to sit with an idea to ensure social distancing. This is the case even with the city buses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rtc-officials-decide-to-run-more-number-of-buses-from-tomorrow/article34775006.ece

10 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||A road to development in Maoist hotbed||At least nine out of the 11 mandals in the Visakha Agency have been under the stranglehold of the banned CPI (Maoist) for the last two decades, as a result of which they are deprived of basic infrastructure. Many tribal hamlets , especially those in the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) region, remain cut off from the mainstream due to poor road connectivity. Community policing But with the security forces making inroads into the AOB region and taking up “new-age community policing programmes,” the tribal people, who have been living under the fear , are beginning to witness the government-sponsored developmental activities. ‘Project Varadhi’ is one such programme that has been initiated by the Visakhapatnam District Police in the Chintapalli area of the Agency. The Chintapalli Police Sub-Division covers almost 1,400 sq km of the 6,200-odd sq km of the Agency, a Maoist hotbed bordering Malkangiri . “The aim of the project is to improve road connectivity to interior areas by involving the tribal people,” said Chintapalli ASP Vidyasagar Naidu. The tribal people of Cheruvuru had, for the first time, seen an ambulance visiting their hamlet when a road was laid to the village overnight in November last, he said. As of date, about 45-km of road has been laid in some of the Maoist hotbeds with the support of the tribal people, the police and the Paderu ITDA, benefiting an estimated 12,000 people. Aadhaar centre “We now have an Aadhaar centre, which benefits at least 4,000 people,” said a tribal from the Balapam area. Some roads laid under the project included a 6-km stretch from P.K. Gudem to Mandapalli, a 4-km road from Korukonda to Cheruvuru, and a 5-km road from Jerella to Assampalli, all recognised as Maoist strongholds. The project envisaged by SP B. Krishna Rao and OSD Sateesh Kumar involves laying of kutcha road. While it costs Rs. 70 lakh to lay one km BT road, a five-km kutcha road costs between Rs. 70,000 and Rs. 1.2 lakh. “We focussed on laying kutcha or gravel road to enable at least two vehicles move freely,” said Mr. Naidu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-road-to-development-in-maoist-hotbed/article34774995.ece
10 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Roundtable opposes move to hike property tax||The participants at a roundtable, held on the proposed property tax hike by the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), described the unilateral decision as ‘undemocratic’ and ‘illegal’. The roundtable was held on Wednesday on the issue of the draft notification to hike the property tax, based on the land values in different areas, instead of the earlier method of tax assessment based on rental value. CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy, TDP State general secretary Md. Nazeer, CPI(M) city secretary and 78th Ward corporator B. Ganga Rao, JSP leader and 22nd Ward corporator Peethala Murthy Yadav, Congress leader S. Sudhakar, Lok Satta leader V. Hari Ganesh and CPI-ML leader Ganesh Panda were among those who attended. The participants said that a unilateral decision on the hike in property tax, without discussing the issue in the GVMC Council meeting, when there was an elected body, was ‘undemocratic’. They also noted that the GVMC Commissioner has no right to hike the tax on the directions of the State government. They demanded withdrawal of the hike and announced their decision to stage a protest on the issue at the Gandhi statue, near GVMC, on June 11. The draft notification issued by the GVMC will lead to imposition of heavy burden on the Vizagites and is illegal and undemocratic, said members of Visakhapatnam Apartment Residents Welfare Association (VARWA). In a release on Tuesday, VARWA president N. Prakash Rao and Secretary B.B. Ganesh said that the VARWA is seriously opposing the changes and is demanding withdrawal of the notification.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/roundtable-opposes-move-to-hike-property-tax/article34775004.ece

Suresh to reconsider the decision to conduct the SSC examinations in the State. In a letter to the Education Minister on Wednesday, APPSA State chairman K.S.N. Murthy said that permission was given to the schools to conduct online classes from August 2020 onwards. ‘Syllabus not completed’ “Many students, however, could not avail of it as they did not have the facilities to follow the lessons. The classes were conducted for not more than 127 days. During this period too, there were half day schools on some days. Only 60% to 65% students attended the classes owing to fear of contracting coronavirus infection and other reasons. Even as 5% to 10% of the syllabus was reduced, even that could not be completed,” said Mr. Murthy. Later, despite trying to conduct online classes, the students could not concentrate on studies as their family members were infected by the virus. In many States including neighbouring Telangana, the SSC and Intermediate examinations have been cancelled, he pointed out. Mr. Murthy sought that grades be given depending on the marks obtained in the FA1 and FA2 examination and the students be promoted. He appealed to the Minister to ensure justice to the SSC students by cancelling the examinations. Alternatively, after the schools start functioning normally, a month should be given for conduct of the classes and then examinations should be held, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/appsa-seeks-cancellation-of-ssc-exams/article34774993.ece

They took shelter in the Vaikuntha Dhamam due to lack of facilities to isolate themselves in their thatched houses in the interior village, sources said. Aswaraopeta medical officer Rambabu said they had tried to shift the virus-affected villagers to the 60-bed isolation centre set up at the Ashram school premises in the nearby Sunnambatti village.

10 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Spotlight on diabetes risk in COVID-recovered patients||Discussions on the possibility of developing diabetes or uncontrolled blood sugar levels among COVID-recovered patients has been rife, but it was the spike in Mucormycosis cases that brought the non-communicable disease back into focus. ENT surgeons as well as general physicians have advised people to get their blood sugar levels checked after recovering from COVID-19, irrespective of a history of diabetes. Opthalmologists and ENT surgeons have pointed out on multiple occasions that the fungal infection can occurs in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, those on long-term steroid therapy and also among people with compromised immunity. Though the infection has been detected among a small percentage of post-COVID patients, awareness about it can help in early diagnosis, they say. Disease sneaks up Superintendent of Government ENT Hospital T. Shankar says they have come across a few patients who found out that they had diabetes only when being screened for Mucormycosis. He said that the patients might have had diabetes from the past few months or years prior to contracting COVID, but did not know about it. Senior consultant physician at KIMS Hospitals K. Shivaraju has advised that one must monitor their blood sugar levels post-COVID regardless of whether they had diabetes previously or not. This helps in avoiding various complications that could arise from uncontrolled diabetes. Symptoms “Apart from severe complications, people might have fatigue, excess urination and body pains, if blood sugar levels are not under control,” he adds. “If someone is detected with diabetes, they have to get checked regularly,” asserts Dr Shankar. Doctors say further research into relation between COVID and diabetes is needed to better understand effects of the infectious disease. Telangana Health department used to conduct Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) survey in which those above the age of 30 years were checked for diabetes and hypertension. The survey had to be kept on hold during the peak of the second wave. Officials said they will resume the survey in a few weeks, as that will help detect diabetes in the early stages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/spotlight-on-diabetes-risk-in-covid-recovered-patients/article34774890.ece
10 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Trench works pose another challenge to Charminar||Four trenches: two to carry waste water, and two to carry cables, are being laid just 60 metres from Charminar. “The work has been going on for the past 10 days. We will not dig beyond that point (paved stone surface),” informed a Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation staffer supervising an earthmover using pneumatic drill to tear the 8-inch concrete slab for the channels on the Laad Bazaar road to the west of Charminar. The layer of cobblestone laid two years back was torn apart in February. Workers laying a Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board pipeline said the work is challenging. “Under the layer of concrete are assorted cables, pipelines and channels laid over the past 100 years. It is difficult to know which cable is important and which is no longer in use,” said a worker fixing a water pipeline. Exactly three years earlier, the GHMC had used pneumatic drills to dig upto 6-feet around Charminar to lay a .9 metre sewage pipeline about 20 feet from the monument. A concrete flooring overlaid with cobblestones was part of the multi-crore Charminar Pedestrianisation Project. The Archaeological Survey of India made representations to the GHMC using the Ancient Monuments Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (AMASR) provisions. But the civic body managed to go ahead with its work. The new trench work is another challenge to the 430-year-old monument that is built using limestone mortar. While limestone mortar cured over a number of years is exceptionally strong, continuous exposure to water renders it brittle, say archaeologists. The work being carried out during COVID-19 lockdown has not affected traders who sell bangles and host of other goods but once the daytime business hours are restored it will be chaos. “We have sustained huge losses due to zero business over the past year. This lockdown and the trench work has stopped many visitors from shopping here. This may go on for two more months,” said Wasim Akram, who owns a bangle showroom in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trench-works-pose-another-challenge-to-charminar/article34774903.ece
10 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘File fresh affidavit on COVID drugs’||The Telangana High Court on Wednesday directed National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) Director to file a fresh affidavit, observing that an earlier one filed by the authority in response to its direction in a batch of PIL pleas connected to COVID-19 was “ambiguous and lacked clarity”. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said it was unfortunate that NPPA had failed to comply with the HC’s direction over Coronavirus-related matters. “Central government would not be permitted to play with lives of people who are running from pillar to post to secure life-saving drugs meant for treating Coronavirus-affected patients,” the CJ observed. While people were finding it difficult to secure such life-saving drugs at reasonable prices, the Central government failed to include these medicines under National Life Saving Drugs list, the bench noted. On May 17, the bench instructed NPPA to include life-saving drugs prescribed for treating COVID-19 patients in the National List of Essential Medicines to bring down their prices within reach of all people. After perusing the affidavit filed by the authority on Wednesday, the bench expressed dissatisfaction stating that it was not clear what steps were taken to include COVID-19 drugs in essential medicines list. The bench instructed the authority to file a fresh affidavit by June 23. The bench also took exception to the Telangana government not issuing a Government Order (GO) capping prices of diagnostic tests held for COVID-19 patients and their treatment, including hospitalisation. Health Secretary Syed Ali Murtuza Rizvi sought four weeks to release the GO. He claimed that the government was holding deliberations with private nursing homes and private hospitals on the matter. “Poor people are being ripped apart by some rogue nursing homes and private hospitals everyday....when are you going to release the GO capping the prices?” the CJ said. The CJ also noted the HC had been granting time to the government whenever it sought to issue the GO on the matter but the GO was not being released. The bench made it clear to the Health Secretary that the GO should be issued by next date of hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/file-fresh-affidavit-on-covid-drugs/article34774909.ece

10 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||For timely diagnosis and treatment of Mucormycosis||A Mucormycosis Early Detection Centere was launched by MaxiVision Eye Hospitals group at its Somajiguda branch here to identify the fungal infection in its initial stage. Early diagnosis and treatment of the fungal infection help save lives and prevent it from turning lethal. A team of doctors including an opthalmologist, ENT specialist and microbiologist examine patients for presence of Mucormycosis. If the fungal infection is detected, the team of doctors will check the severity. Patients are referred to government hospitals where treatment is offered free of cost. Founder and co-chairman of the hospital group, Kasu Prasad Reddy said Mucormycosis is an aggressive fungal infection, acquired primarily via inhalation of fungal spores in hosts with weak immunity or through direct entry during trauma. Some of the common symptoms are nasal discharge and stiffness, black discolouration of the nose, toothache, jaw pain, prolonged fever, headache, and facial edema (swelling). Swelling, pain in and around eyes, and thick discharge from eyes are some other symptoms. Stating that the infection can severely affect eyes, doctors have urged people, who recently recovered from COVID, to consult an eye specialist if they experience discharge from eyes. Medical director of the hospitals, Anil Kumar said some of the ways to prevent Mucormycosis is by avoiding repeated use of cloth masks without sterilisation or washing and consumption rotten vegetables and fruits, cleaning air conditioners and cooler filters regularly, keeping surroundings clean to avoid fungal growth in clothes, vegetables, furniture etc., and keeping blood sugar levels in check, using antibiotics, anti-fungals, steroids and other medicines judiciously.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/for-timely-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-mucormycosis/article34774891.ece

10 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Plea to turn RTC Hospital into COVID-19 care centre||Trade unions of the Telangana Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) have raised concerns over what they said is a delay in turning the TSRTC Hospital at Tarnaka into a COVID-19 treatment centre for employees. The demand for the turning the hospital into a COVID -19 treatment centre for staff and workers gained traction in June last year after the death of balladeer and TSRTC worker Mohammed Nisar who had contracted the virus. On Wednesday, the TSRTC Employees Union (TSRTC EU) reiterated the demand. It was pointed out that like last year, several workers had lost their lives to the pandemic. Their treatment in private hospitals is taking a toll on their financial condition, which is already hit by several salary-related issues. The union claimed that around 70 workers had lost their lives due to COVID-19. They said that it is due this that it is important that work to develop the TSRTC Hospital into a COVID-19 centre reaches its logical conclusion at the earliest. The TSRTC EU pointed out that there have been delays in the work and demanded that it be completed on war footing. The TSRTC EU also demanded that the those who have lost their lives to the novel coronavirus be given compensation of Rs. 50 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/plea-to-turn-rtc-hospital-into-covid-19-care-centre/article34774907.ece

The deceased were identified as D Vanitha, 30, Chaitanya, 9 and Rohitha, 7, residents of Revathi Centre locality in the town. Sources said that Vanitha, wife of D Ravi, an autorickshaw driver, took the extreme step along with her two children due to mounting debts in the midst of the pandemic.

10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Non-cardholders return with empty hands as ration runs out||The plight of city’s poor continued as several government centres distributing ration to non-cardholders kept their gates shut due to unavailability of ration. People who had queued up outside some of the government schools said it had already been four days that they were returning home unsuccessfully as foodgrains had run out of stock at the centres. Many said they were subjected to COVID-19 tests and given tokens and asked to return the next day, only to find the ration distribution centres closed. Desperate attempts Babli, a resident of Dakhshinpuri, who has been visiting a government school in Hauz Rani for the last four days said: “After hours of standing in a queue, I managed to enter the school on the second day but was told that I will not get the ration if I don’t undergo a COVID-19 test. So I got tested after which I was given a token and asked to come the following day by which time the stock had run out.” “I am the sole earner in the family and have been out of work for all these months. Will the governments never think about the poor? They win elections because of us and once elected, they forget about the poor,” said Babli. Zulekha Khatun, a resident of Jagdamba Camp in south Delhi, said: “First they said that we have to get tests done, which we did. But even after that all we have right now is a piece of paper which is supposed to act as a token. We did whatever they asked us to do but now what? How am I supposed to keep my children? My youngest child is five years old now.” “I have been borrowing grains from others and feeding the family currently. But how long can this arrangement continue? I can’t even return to my village in Samastipur as we do not have enough money to buy tickets. There is not even enough to take an auto to the distribution centre. I walk for half an hour each side in this heat,” said Khatun. Multiple trips With not enough money for basic sustenance, for many, making multiple trips to the distribution centres each day was equally challenging. Fifty eight-year-old Abrana Khatun said: “If the government does not want to give us ration they can clearly state that. We are spending money each day and visiting the centre just to return empty handed. Last year during the lockdown, I at least got ration for a month but this time there has been nothing.” Priyanka Devi, a domestic helper who has been out of work since the lockdown began said: “We are desperate at this point. I have been coming to the centre since Sunday. Most days we spend hours in the heat with empty-stomach as we feel that reaching early might improve our chances. But looks like there are no foodgrains available at this point.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/non-cardholders-return-with-empty-hands-as-ration-runs-out/article34774872.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Green economy and mobility key aspects of draft 2041 master plan||A dedicated Green Development Area (GDA) for incentivising large-scale implementation of green economies, transit-oriented development aligned with mass transit, multi-modal integration and facilitation of first and last mile connectivity are some of the key aspects of the draft Master Plan for Delhi (MPD) 2041, which was placed in the public domain while inviting suggestions and objections from stakeholders. Addressing pollution and climate change by promoting clean economic activities and minimised vehicular pollution by creating multi-modal hubs and encouraging green mobility are some of the aspects the MPD-2041 concentrates on. The draft states that polluting industries will not be permitted to operate within Delhi and the list of such industries will be periodically updated by the Delhi government and DDA. The draft also highlights the enhancement of a “Green-Blue Infrastructure” by taking into account the Aravali ridge, the Yamuna, forests, wetlands, parks and other assets. “The GDA policy has been proposed for green belt villages and it permits restricted development and prescribes substantial proportion of land to be maintained as wooded area and green cover,” according to the draft MPD – 2041. Affordable housing and in-situ rehabilitation of those living in slums and JJ clusters were other key aspects outlined by the MPD-2041 and the draft document said that in unauthorised colonies “settlement level improvements” are required to make all parts of the settlement accessible for emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire tenders. Forms of workspaces Apart from creation of strategic hubs of high investment, the draft MPD-2041 also lays out a plan for facilitating new forms of workspaces. “A finer network of decentralised workspaces in the form of small warehousing for e-commerce, co-working spaces for start-up economy shall be facilitated. The plan provides adequate space norms and facilities for supporting informal economies,” the document read. According to the draft MPD-2041, an area-based improvement approach will be adopted for revitalising the commercial and socio-cultural hubs of the city, including areas like Connaught Place, Mandi House, Pragati Maidan and Shahjahanabad (Walled City). Improved connectivity and transport infrastructure, shift from private to shared mobility and making the Capital “walkable and cyclable” are other key aspects mentioned in the MPD-2041. “A Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) shall be prepared for Delhi to achieve systematic integration across all levels and modes of urban transport,” the draft MPD-2041 stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/green-economy-and-mobility-key-aspects-of-draft-2041-master-plan/article34774870.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||60% of mothers return to work within six months of delivery, reveals study||A study on breastfeeding knowledge and practices of working mothers in the informal economy in New Delhi has shown that six months of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) was difficult as 38% of mothers returned to work under three months of delivery and 60% within six months of delivery, leading to early weaning. The study conducted by researchers from the Indian Institute for Human Settlements interviewed 150 mothers, including domestic workers, vendors, home-based and “barter” working mothers, out of which 79% were breastfeeding. Four sites covered Of the 21 women, who had a child under six months, 14 reported exclusive breastfeeding. The study was conducted in four sites in Delhi where the predominant employment is in the informal economy. The study found that while deciding to take one’s child to work, there was an overall hesitation to carry a child under 12 months to work, fearing infection, need for mother’s attention, and disruption at work. Work and duty “Only 37% of the sampled population reported taking their child to work regularly or often, of which 59% were working from their home,” the study said. It also found that local creches, run by the government, were not equipped to admit children under 12 months, and mostly preferred children over two years. The pathways for intervention suggested by the study include delayed return to work, increased spatial and temporal proximity of a mother with her child, effective knowledge and deeper understanding of the reasoning and implications behind the six-month exclusive breastfeeding recommendation and enabling the physical environment at home and workplace to the needs of a mother for managing child care.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/60-of-mothers-return-to-work-within-six-months-of-delivery-reveals-study/article34774868.ece
10 June 2021||New Delhi,||Head constable murder: court dismisses bail plea of accused||A Delhi court on Wednesday dismissed the bail plea of a man arrested in connection with the death of head constable Rattan Lal during the north-east Delhi riots last year. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav noted that the nature of allegations against accused Irshad Ali are “very serious”. The judge remarked that the public witnesses in the case are residents of the same locality as Ali and the possibility of him threatening or intimidating them, if released on bail at this stage cannot be ruled out. Prima facie opinion The court also said it was “prima facie evident that at or around the commission of crime, i.e the murder of Rattan Lal, there was nobody present at the roof of Mohan Nursing Home”. “The footage of NDTV does not appear to be contemporaneous to the commission of crime in this case. It is, however, a prima facie opinion which shall be ascertained during the course of trial,” it said. Ali’s counsel had relied on a viral video of news channel NDTV to argue that persons from the riotous mob, who were found stationed on the rooftop of Mohan Nursing Home, were firing upon the police personnel and persons of other community. “Mohan Nursing Home being not far away from the scene of crime (SOC), it is quite possible that deceased HC Rattan Lal might have suffered bullet injury from any such rifle and consequently died,” Ali’s counsel had argued. However, the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) played two video clips in the court. In the first clip, which is part of a news bulletin of NDTV, narrated by Mr. Ravish Kumar, showed a number of persons at the roof of Mohan Nursing Home firing through rifle. The second video, which is claimed to be contemporaneous to the attack upon the police party by the rioters, clearly showed that at that time there was nobody at the roof of Mohan Nursing Home. The SPP argued that the footage of NDTV did not show the correct picture as far as the time of commission of crime in this case is concerned; whereas, the other footage which is part of the record of this case, clearly establishes that nobody was there on the roof of Mohan Nursing Home at the time of incident. The court while dismissing Ali’s bail plea said the bail applications of several co-accused has already been dismissed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/head-constable-murder-court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-accused/article34774862.ece

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Satvir Singh Lamba said, “All the basic needs and necessities of the accused/applicant [Mr. Sushil] are being taken care of as per the provisions of Delhi Prisons Rule, 2018.” “The alleged special foods and supplements appears to be only the desires and wishes of the accused/applicant and are not in any manner the essential need or necessity for the accused/applicant,” the judge said while rejecting the plea. The Jail Superintendent strongly opposed the application. It said the desire of Mr. Sushil for special foods, supplements or extra protein “tantamount to discrimination among the prisoners.” It is further contended that allowing such kind of application may invite flood of applications from many more prisoners, who can afford such type of diets at their own expenses,” the jail authorities said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/court-rejects-sushils-plea-for-special-food/article34774861.ece

The court was hearing a plea by Ms. Fatima seeking a direction to release her in an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act case relating to alleged larger conspiracy that led to the north-east Delhi riots. The police said: “The present petition has been so drafted as to show the detention of the petitioner is illegal in the eyes of the law. However, a bare perusal of the prayer sought would reveal that the intent behind the present petition is to circumvent the well settled principles of law and secure bail of the petitioner.” A Vacation Bench of Justice Rekha Palli and Justice Amit Bansal asked Ms. Fatima’s counsel to file rejoinder to the police’s response and listed the case for hearing on June 18.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/police-oppose-gulfisha-fatimas-plea-claiming-illegal-detention/article34774863.ece

10 June 2021||Mumbai,||Fight COVID like a surgical strike: HC||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday asked the Maharashtra government if it had applied for permission to give door-to-door vaccination, and told the Central government, “COVID-19 is the common enemy, and you must consider the battle as a surgical strike!” A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by two city-based lawyers that sought vaccination at home for those above 75 years, bedridden or wheelchair-bound. Advocate Dhruti Kapadia, representing the petitions, told the court that Kerala had been conducting vaccination for bedridden people and the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation had started door-to-door vaccination. The court asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) how a senior political member got vaccinated at the beginning of the drive. BMC’s counsel Anil Sakhare said he would inform tomorrow. The court said, “We want to know today. We are hearing the matter today. We are talking about your model to the entire country and are appreciating your efforts. Did Kerala wait for the nod from the Central government? Either the defence can be that you have given him [politician] a different vaccine, or you have nothing to do with it then we will ask the State”. The Bench told Additional Solicitor General of India Anil Singh, “You have taken a decision for near to door vaccination. You have agreed that COVID-19 is the common enemy. You must consider the battle as a surgical strike! We know the areas and the people who may be carrying the virus. We should go to the borders and fight! We see that decisions are being taken by the Centre, but they are delayed. So many States are doing this. Then why not make it uniform for all States?”.

10 June 2021||Pune,||Uddhav warns of stern action against industries not following safety norms||Chemical factory owners must stringently adhere to safety norms, said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday. He directed the Pune district administration to ensure that the compensation announced by the State government reached the kin of the 17 labourers who were charred to death at a chemical manufacturing company in the district’s Mulshi area. “Industrial safety standards must be seriously reviewed in the aftermath of the explosion at a chemical company at Urware which resulted in the tragic deaths,” he said. The incident occurred late afternoon on Monday when two explosions caused a powerful blaze inside SVS Aqua Technologies, a chemical manufacturing company. Most of those killed were women while five other labourers were seriously injured. The government had announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 5 lakh for the kin of each of the deceased. The Chief Minister warned of stern action against errant industries that neglected safety norms and regulations. He said the committee comprising officials of the Pune district administration, which had been constituted to probe the accident, should submit its report immediately after a comprehensive inquiry. “The administration should also take action to provide assistance to the families of the deceased and provide financial assistance to their relatives as soon as possible. The chemical industrial safety standards should be reviewed frequently in industrial estates.”  Owner in police custody A local court remanded Nikunj Shah, one of the owners of the company, in police custody till June 13. Mr. Shah was arrested on Tuesday following questioning under relevant Sections of the IPC for ‘culpable homicide not amounting to murder’. The preliminary probe revealed gross negligence on the company’s part in adhering to basic fire safety norms and building permission rules. Authorities said the premises had no emergency exit doors, which had led to the workers being tragically charred to death when the fire began to spread.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/uddhav-warns-of-stern-action-against-industries-not-following-safety-norms/article34774466.ece
10 June 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra’s active cases dip to 1.61 lakh||Maharashtra continued to report low case surges, recording 10,989 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday as opposed to 16,379 recoveries. The State’s active case tally dipped further to 1,61,864. However, the State’s total death toll has crossed the one lakh mark, climbing to 1,01,833, with the State’s case fatality rate rising to 1.74%. A total of 661 deaths were added to the State’s progressive death toll, of which 170 occurred in the last 48 hours and a further 91 were from the past week. As many as 400 fatalities have been added in the ongoing ‘reconciliation’ process, as per the State Health Department. The State’s total cases have reached 58,31,781 while its cumulative recoveries have climbed to 55,97,304 with the recovery rate going up to 95.45%. “Of a total 3,71,28,093 laboratory samples tested thus far, 58,63,880 (with the average case positivity falling incrementally to 15.79%) have returned positive with over 2.21 lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said. Pune witnessed a heightened spike, reporting more than 1,300 new cases taking its total case tally to 10,30,325. As per the State Health Department figures, 27 deaths were recorded as the toll rose to 13,638. According to district authorities, the active cases have declined below 20,000 while the death count has touched 17,700. Mumbai recorded 785 new cases to take its total tally to 7,12,840 while the active count has increased slightly to 17,939. As many as 27 fatalities took the city’s toll to 15,033. In western Maharashtra, Kolhapur continued to see big surges, with more than 1,400 new cases taking its total cases to 1,27,113 of whom 17,822 are active. Forty deaths saw the toll go up to 3,923.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtras-active-cases-dip-to-161-lakh/article34774463.ece

Mr. Kumbhar said the government had also directed the State excise commissioner to issue necessary guidelines separately to make the process of licence execution transparent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/lifting-of-liquor-ban-irks-aap-leader/article34774464.ece
10 June 2021||Washington,||U.S. Senate passes huge innovation Bill||The U.S. Senate passed a sweeping industrial policy Bill on Tuesday aimed at countering the surging economic threat from rival China, overcoming partisan divisions to support pumping more than $170 billion into research and development. With both American political parties increasingly worried about competition from Asia’s largest power, the measure cleared the chamber on a 68-32 vote, one of the most significant bipartisan achievements in Congress since Joe Biden’s presidency began in January. It also represents the largest investment in scientific research and technological innovation “in generations”, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The Bill now heads to the House of Representatives, which earlier passed a different version. The two will have to be reconciled into a single Bill before it is sent to the White House for the President’s signature. Biden encouraged Mr. Biden said he was “encouraged” by the Senate’s passage of the United States Innovation and Competition Act. “We are in a competition to win the 21st century, and the starting gun has gone off,” Mr. Biden said. “As other countries continue to invest in their own research and development, we cannot risk falling behind. America must maintain its position as the most innovative and productive nation on Earth.” The package, a key provision of which addresses a shortage of semiconductors that has slowed U.S. auto production this year, will help U.S. industry bolster its capacity and improve technology. It is seen as crucial for U.S. efforts to avoid being out-manoeuvred by Beijing as the adversaries compete in the race to technological innovation. “Today, the Senate took a critical bipartisan step forward to make the investments we need to continue America’s legacy as a global leader in innovation,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement praising the passage of the Bill. “This funding isn’t just about addressing the current semiconductor chip shortage, it is about long-term investments,” she said. Mr. Schumer called the measure “one of the most important things this chamber has done in a very long time, a statement of faith in America’s ability to seize the opportunities of the 21st century”. Key areas The proposal aims to address a number of technological areas in which the U.S. has fallen behind China. The Bill allocates $52 billion in funding for a previously approved plan to increase domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. It also authorises $120 billion over five years for activities at the National Science Foundation to advance priorities, including research and development in key areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum science. And it facilitates tie-ups between private firms and research universities. “This is an opportunity for the United States to strike a blow on behalf of answering the unfair competition that we are seeing from communist China,” said Republican Senator Roger Wicker, one of the main co-sponsors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-senate-passes-huge-innovation-bill/article34774231.ece
10 June 2021||Washington,||UN rights rapporteur warns of starvation deaths in Myanmar||The UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar has warned of “mass deaths” from starvation and disease in the wake of fighting between rebel groups and junta forces in the east of the country. Myanmar has been in chaos and its economy paralysed since a February putsch and a brutal military crackdown on dissent that has killed over 800, according to a local monitoring group. Fighting has flared in several communities — especially in townships that have seen a high death toll at the hands of the police — and some locals have formed “defence forces”. Clashes have escalated in Kayah State near the Thai border in recent weeks. The UN estimates around 1,00,000 people have been displaced. “The junta’s brutal, indiscriminate attacks are threatening the lives of many thousands of men, women and children in Kayah,” Tom Andrews said in a statement on Twitter on Tuesday. “Let me be blunt. Mass deaths from starvation, disease, and exposure, on a scale we have not yet seen... could occur in Kayah State absent immediate action.”  Diplomatic efforts to halt the bloodshed have been led by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) — of which Myanmar is a member — but the bloc is riven with infighting and has managed to put little pressure on the junta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/un-rights-rapporteur-warns-of-starvation-deaths-in-myanmar/article34774229.ece
10 June 2021||COLOMBO,||No decision yet on Indian consulate in Addu Atoll: Solih||The Maldives has made no decision on opening an Indian consulate in its southern Addu Atoll, President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih said on Tuesday, a fortnight after the Indian Cabinet cleared a proposal for it. The President remarked on the proposed Indian consulate, during a press conference on the COVID-19 situation in the country, spokesman Mabrook Azeez told The Hindu from capital Male. “He [Mr. Solih] pointed out that having multiple sites offering consular services in one country is quite common,” Mr. Azeez said. President Solih’s comments appeared to keep the option open, amid an ongoing “#SaveAddu” social media campaign by a section of Maldivians sceptical of another Indian mission presence, in addition to the Embassy in Male. Legislators from Addu and local body representatives — from the ruling coalition widely perceived as India-friendly — have pledged support to the initiative. Speaker Mohamed Nasheed, who is currently in Berlin, recovering from injuries sustained in an assassination attempt last month, said in a recent tweet that  Addu’s thinking has always been one that is open to the world. “Both Addu and Maldives will benefit from the creation of an Indian consulate in Addu,” he said in a Dhivehi language tweet on June 5. Opposition voices, which earlier led an ‘#Indiaout’ campaign against enhanced military cooperation between the neighbours, have opposed the proposed consulate. Apart from its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, Addu is the second largest city in the archipelago, home to over 30,000 people. Indian government sources familiar with the proposal said the rationale for the consulate was to help Addu residents with speedy visa services. All the same, the frequent visa requirements of locals is yet to convince Maldivians who see a new consulate with suspicion, especially on the heels of a $33-million Maldivian police training facility that India is helping build in Addu. On June 3, local publication Times of Addu ran an editorial titled ‘Indian consulate in Addu City; A possible ‘safe house’ for Indian spies?’ Local sensitivities Further, the fact that the announcement appeared in the Indian media last month, before either government made an announcement, has prompted criticism of Indian “heavy handedness”. According to the Maldives’s former Ambassador to India Ahmed Mohamed, who served former President Abdulla Yameen’s administration, New Delhi must be more aware of the “sensitivities” within the Maldives. “We saw similar apprehensions among our people when India [in 2018] was reluctant to take back the helicopters sent here, even after our [former President Yameen] government requested them. It was seen as boots on the ground, a challenge on our independence and a violation of our sovereignty,” he told The Hindu . The decision to open a consulate in Addu invokes similar suspicion, in his view. “The fact that the decision was first reported in the Indian media also shows that sort of heavy handedness.”  U.K.-based Maldivian academic Hassan Ugail, who hails from Addu, underscored the need for a data-driven approach to establish a consulate. “In principle, I am supportive of consulates of countries, including India, to be established in Addu. However, I am not supportive of the present set-up being proposed,” he said. Pointing to the “economic growth prospects” argument made by some in favour of opening a consulate, he said there are no signs yet of “such economic growth, investments or mass tourism from India to Addu city”. “We must first demonstrate the case with facts, figures and numbers, and demonstrate signs that such activities are actually taking place. The argument of ‘let us establish a consulate and let us wait for economic growth to take place’ makes little sense,” Prof. Ugail said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/no-decision-yet-on-indian-consulate-in-addu-atoll-solih/article34774234.ece
10 June 2021||Washington DC,||Quad vaccine partnership goal still on track: U.S. official||A top Biden administration official has said the Quad group of countries — India, Australia, the U.S. and Japan — are on track to meet their goal of producing at least 1 billion vaccines for the Asia region by the end of 2022, despite the massive COVID-19 wave that has hit India in recent weeks. The Quad vaccine partnership was announced at a summit level meeting in March, before the pandemic situation in India deteriorated significantly. “Our discussions with both our partners in the private sector and also in government suggest that we are, knock-on-wood, still on track for 2022, but... the most intense efforts right now really are in the short term,” Kurt Campbell, the Biden administration’s top official for Indo-Pacific policy, said on Tuesday. He was speaking at an event organised by the Center for New American Security, a think tank in Washington DC. Mr. Campbell said the U.S. had been in close consultations with its partners and with India. He acknowledged that this has been an “extremely difficult period” for India and that the U.S. has tried to “stand with Delhi” and has tried to bring private and public sector support for India. “I think we’re feeling relatively confident as we head into 2022, but we recognise that what we are facing right now across Asia, in fact, across the world, are new strains that spread more rapidly. So even countries that did extremely well through social distancing and masking... are now facing outbreaks,” he said, adding the only way to counter this situation was through “vaccine diplomacy” and that the U.S. was trying to step that up. The second wave of the pandemic in India revealed the country’s COVID-109 vaccine shortages. The U.S. has initiated a programme to give 80 million of its excess vaccines to countries in need of them, by the end of June. In-person meeting Mr. Campbell said the U.S. intends to hold a “very ambitious” Quad leaders meeting in Washington. “But our goal is to hold an in-person Quad meeting… very ambitious meeting here in Washington in the fall with all leaders in attendance. We will ensure that we've taken the necessary steps on the vaccine deliverable — we intend to build on that,” he said. He also suggested there would be some infrastructure related outcomes from this Quad meeting. Mr. Campbell had suggested this at the end of May as well, at an event in Stanford. A White House official declined to confirm that Washington would be the location of the autumn Quad meeting, when approached by The Hindu on Tuesday following Mr. Campbell’s comments. “We want to do something constructive with respect to infrastructure and I think we’re going to take some other steps to build out the Quad to ensure that as an unofficial gathering, it still is the defining feature of modern diplomacy linking these key maritime democracies in a way that is deeply consequential for the 21st century,” Mr. Campbell said on Tuesday. In response to a question on whether the Quad would expand at some point or focus on deepening cooperation between the existing four members, Mr. Campbell suggested the current focus was for now to “deepen” and “broaden” familiarity within existing partners but did not rule out other countries eventually participating in Quad initiatives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/quad-vaccine-partnership-goal-still-on-track-us-official/article34774236.ece

A White House statement said that instead of banning the apps, the administration would carry out a “criteria-based decision framework and rigorous, evidence-based analysis to address the risks” from Internet applications controlled by foreign entities. Mr. Biden’s order seeks to identify any “connected software applications that may pose an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security and the American people”, including “applications that are owned, controlled, or managed by persons that support foreign adversary military or intelligence activities, or are involved in malicious cyber activities, or involve applications that collect sensitive personal data”.

10 June 2021||Ankara,||Erdogan to visit Karabakh region won by Azerbaijan||Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday he will visit Azerbaijan to celebrate its victory over Armenia in a brief war last year, touring a region recaptured in disputed Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan seized back swathes of territory in the separatist ethnic Armenia region with the help of Turkish combat drones and other weaponry from Ankara. The conflict claimed 6,000 lives and ended with a Russian-brokered truce in November that saw ethnic Armenians pushed out of large parts of the land they had won during a brutal post-Soviet war in the 1990s. Mr. Erdogan said he will fly to Azerbaijan from next week’s NATO summit in Brussels and watch Turkey play Wales in Baku in the Euro 2020 football championship on Wednesday. He said he and his “brother”, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, will then visit Shu- sha, which fell to Azerbaijani forces during the war.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/erdogan-to-visit-karabakh-region-won-by-azerbaijan/article34774227.ece

10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Strong-arm tactics weaken democracy||The results of the bitterly contested West Bengal elections were declared in early May. It has been more than a month since the Trinamool Congress won with a massive mandate, but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Central government still seem unable to get over the BJP’s loss in the State. The BJP has tried every tactic in the book to put the Mamata Banerjee government under pressure, including resurrecting corruption charges against four leaders (three from the Trinamool and one who was formerly with the party), and serving a show-cause notice to the now-retired Chief Secretary of West Bengal. The State Governor has played a partisan role both before and after the election. The Centre’s actions could be seen at one level as cynical politicking at a time when all its energy should be focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19. At another level, these designs serve to undermine the structure of federalism and democracy. Let’s look at the events — of the recent arrests and the show-cause notice, and the Governor’s role. The latter is an issue with historical antecedents and is not unique to West Bengal or the current BJP government. Arrests of Trinamool leaders On May 17, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested three Trinamool leaders, including two State Ministers, in connection with the Narada sting operation, carried out in 2014, showing top Trinamool leaders allegedly taking bribes. The footage had surfaced before the 2016 West Bengal Assembly elections. In 2017, the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate launched investigations into the scam. It is the timing of the arrests now that has raised suspicion, as did the sanction for prosecution given by West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to the CBI just days after the election result. Moreover, the CBI’s failure to proceed against former Trinamool leaders Suvendu Adhikari and Mukul Roy, both of whom are accused in the case but have defected to the BJP, has justifiably provoked allegations of political vendetta and bias on the CBI’s part. A bureaucrat in controversy The second event that has caused friction between the Trinamool government and the Centre is the controversy over the former Chief Secretary of West Bengal, Alapan Bandyopadhyay. Mr. Bandyopadhyay was scheduled to retire on May 31 but had been given a three-month extension by the Centre on the State government’s request. However, days before his original retirement date, he was unexpectedly asked to report to the Department of Personnel and Training in New Delhi on May 31. This order came hours after Ms. Banerjee skipped a review meeting on Cyclone Yaas with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Kalaikunda air base in West Bengal. While the rules allow the recall of IAS officers from States, the Centre usually does so with the concurrence of the State government. That was not the case here. The Trinamool government predictably refused to release him and asked for the order to be rescinded. When that did not happen, Mr. Bandyopadhyay resigned from his post. He was immediately appointed Chief Adviser to Ms. Banerjee. While Mr. Bandyopadhyay’s resignation may have temporarily stymied the Centre, it promptly responded by serving him a show-cause notice for violation of Section 51(b) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. According to Section 51(b), anyone refusing to comply with the directions of the Central or State government or the National Executive Committee or State Executive Committee or District Authority can be jailed or fined or both. The show-cause notice was issued because Mr. Bandyopadhyay did not stay back for the meeting on Cyclone Yaas with Mr. Modi and left with Ms. Banerjee to oversee relief work. Mr. Bandyopadhyay responded to the notice saying he was merely following the orders given to him by the West Bengal Chief Minister. While several lawyers and bureaucrats believe that the Centre’s position is untenable in a court of law, its actions once again highlight its intention to target an Opposition government at all costs. Governor’s role While the recent controversies do not bode well for federalism or indeed democracy, it is the West Bengal Governor’s actions that have had the most corrosive impact. Ever since his appointment, Mr. Dhankhar has needled the State government in every possible manner. However, since the election result, he has, in the words of a political analyst, taken the place of the “political Opposition” in the State. While there is no denying that there has been post-poll violence in parts of Bengal, Mr. Dhankhar went overboard in describing the situation as “total lawlessness and anarchy”. In a breach of protocol, he even visited violence-affected areas along with the BJP’s elected representatives. Though Mr. Dhankhar’s actions might be in keeping — in intent though not in degree — with many contemporary and past governors, they once again raise questions about the role of a governor. During the long period of Congress dominance, the governor’s position had largely been reduced to furthering the Centre’s interest in the States. While the Congress did occasionally appoint eminent personalities and technocrats as governors, such as Gopalkrishna Gandhi in West Bengal, the position by and large was reserved for superannuated politicians and party loyalists. The latter practice has continued under the Modi government. There was a heated debate in the Constituent Assembly in 1949 on the role of the governor. Members such as H.V. Kamath, K.T. Shah, Rohini Kumar Chaudhuri and Bishwanath Das were critical of the powers of the governor. They viewed the position as a relic of the colonial era, one that was “capable of creating mischief”. Das, a Prime Minister of Orissa Province in colonial India and later Governor of Uttar Pradesh, was one of the most vocal critics of the position. He had presciently noted that since the governor was appointed by the Centre, it was quite likely that he or she might not be acceptable in an Opposition-ruled State, especially if the “power to give administrative pin-pricks is vested in the governor”. B.R. Ambedkar attempted to address these misgivings by making a distinction between the “functions” and “duties” of a governor. He concluded that the governor was not a representative of a “party” but of the “people” of the State. There was arguably enough ambiguity in this formulation for a governor to be an activist and partisan, if he or she so desired. Ambedkar’s faith in the Centre and governors seems misplaced since most governors, especially in recent times, have proved to be representatives of the party that appointed them and not impartial constitutional authorities. The very fact that governors are expected to resign when there is change of government at the Centre is proof of that. Indeed, the West Bengal Governor’s actions illustrate the fears of the critics in the Constituent Assembly. If the Centre continues with its methods of using Central agencies and the Governor to keep up the pressure on the West Bengal government, it might score political points in the short term. However, in the long run, this will weaken India’s federalism and democracy. It also paradoxically hurts the BJP’s prospects in a State where it needs to politically mobilise against a party with a big mandate and not resort to strong-arm tactics.

10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The promise and perils of digital justice delivery||In popular perception, Indian courts are not associated first with the delivery of justice, but with long delays and difficulties for ordinary litigants. According to data released by the Supreme Court in the June 2020 newsletter of the e-Committee, 3.27 crore cases are pending before Indian courts, of which 85,000 have been pending for over 30 years. Can technology be used to revolutionise India’s courts? Yes, but only when it operates within the constitutional framework of the fundamental rights of citizens. If not, technology will only further exclusion, inequity and surveillance. The e-Courts project The e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India recently released its draft vision document for Phase III of the e-Courts project. Phases I and II had dealt with digitisation of the judiciary, i.e., e-filing, tracking cases online, uploading judgments online, etc. Even though the job is not complete, particularly at the lower levels of the judiciary, the project can so far be termed a success. This has been particularly so during the COVID-19 pandemic, when physical courts were forced to shut down. Despite some hiccups, the Supreme Court and High Courts have been able to function online. This was made possible by the e-Courts project, monitored by the e-Committee. Phase III of the e-Courts project, however, has reached the stage in a trilogy where the franchise starts trying to do too much and goes off the tram line. On the surface, the objectives remain noble. There is commitment to the digitisation of court processes, and plans to upgrade the electronic infrastructure of the judiciary and enable access to lawyers and litigants. However, the document goes on to propose an “ecosystem approach” to justice delivery. It suggests a “seamless exchange of information” between various branches of the State, such as between the judiciary, the police and the prison systems through the Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS). It has been pointed out by organisations such as the Criminal Justice and Police Accountability Project that the ICJS will likely exacerbate existing class and caste inequalities that characterise the police and prison system. This is because the exercise of data creation happens at local police stations, which have historically contributed to the criminalisation of entire communities through colonial-era laws such as the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, by labelling such communities as “habitual offenders”.  This is of particular concern since the data collected, shared and collated through the e-Courts project will be housed within the Home Ministry under the ICJS. A cause for concern Several individuals and organisations have warned against the zeal of the data collection exercises contemplated by the draft proposal. The “seamless exchange of information” relies on large-scale gathering and sharing of data. Data collection is by itself not an evil process. In fact, data can be a useful tool for solving complex problems. For example, to address the problem of cases pending simply for service of summons, Phase II of the e-Courts project saw the development of the National Service and Tracking of Electronic Processes, a software that enabled e-service of summons. It is only when data collection is combined with extensive data sharing and data storage that it becomes a cause for concern. The Supreme Court must take care not to violate the privacy standards that it set in Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017), especially since India does not yet have a data protection regime. Data can be useful when it provides anonymous, aggregated, and statistical information about issues without identifying the individuals. This could be made possible in Phase III by encouraging uniformity and standardisation of entry fields. Unfortunately, there has been a dangerous trend towards creating a 360-degree profile of each person by integrating all of their interactions with government agencies into a unified database. This approach has been perfected by social media platforms and technology companies, and the government is now trying to do the same. The difference is that when technology companies do this, we get targeted advertising, but if the government does it, we get targeted surveillance. This 360-degree approach is the main objective of Phase III. Once any government department moves online, their pen-and-paper registers will become excel sheets, shareable with a single click. Localised data will become centralised. Holdovers from the analog age ought not to have an issue with this process, since it can lead to great advancements in problem-solving. However, it is the next stage which is a cause for concern even for the most vocal proponents of the digital age, which is integration with other agencies. When integrating data from all the lower courts, the intersection lies at the higher judiciary, because those are the appellate authorities connecting all the lower courts. When integrating data of the courts and police stations, the intersection lies with the individual citizen, since it is the citizen’s interaction with these branches of the state that is being monitored. While it is understandable why the courts could reasonably benefit from access to police and prison records, courts deal with a variety of matters, some of which may be purely civil, commercial or personal in nature. No clear explanation has been offered for why the Home Ministry needs access to court data that may have absolutely no relation to criminal law. This process serves no purpose other than profiling and surveillance. Role of technology Since the Phase III vision document is a draft, there is still an opportunity to abandon the ecosystem approach. The objectives were to streamline judicial processes, reduce pendency, and help the litigants. To continue to do that within the framework of our fundamental rights, the e-Courts must move towards localisation of data, instead of centralisation. The e-Committee must prevent the “seamless exchange” of data between the branches of the state that ought to remain separate. Technology plays an important role in the project, but it cannot be an end in itself.

10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The murky space of ‘social audio’||Clubhouse, a new social networking app based around audio rooms, surpassed 2 million Android downloads across the world last month. The key feature of the app is the unique medium — audio — through which its users interact. This distinguishes it from well-established social media and messaging platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and YouTube, which employ text, images, video, or a combination of three. In Clubhouse, the concept of old-school text chat rooms is replaced with the immediacy of the human voice. The app neither has any separate texting features, nor the option to create elaborate online profiles, thus keeping the focus purely on audio-based interaction. Besides choosing their interests, users can also join various ‘clubs’, which are groups of members that share a common interest. After joining, users may get alerts for rooms hosted by such clubs. Clubs can also be used to interact with other people with whom they might share similar interests. A person can even start a club of their own, or ‘drop-in’ into any room mentioned on the Home or Explore page, as a listener or a speaker during a discussion. Regulation challenges The very nature of the app raises a number of questions on privacy and security. Audio rooms are likely to throw up new challenges for data regulators, who are yet to find effective ways to regulate traditional social media platforms. Audio-based interactions are faster and in real time, mirroring real-life far closely than text-based interactions. Hence, traditional methods of content moderation may not work here. Further, on an app like Clubhouse, cyberbullying and trolling, driven by sexism, racism and communalism, can be even more damaging. The app allows a person to join any room that their friends are a part of, which may allow anyone to ‘stalk’ a person as they move from room to room; the app even sends notifications to their followers. The experience on Clubhouse, therefore, involves constant hyper-awareness about how every action is being broadcast to followers. This is in contrast to popular platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and others, which, for all their flaws, allow browsing in relative invisibility. This awareness, along with a fear of being judged, might limit people from exploring the app’s content. Concerns have been raised over how Clubhouse temporarily records the audio in a room while the room is live, “for purposes of investigating the incident”, and deletes it when the room ends. However, with the lack of end-to-end encryption, the data is still potentially accessible. Furthermore, this recording is done without the consent of the user. According to privacy expert Alexander Hanff, the platform’s practices are violative of numerous provisions of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including rules on security, proportionality and necessity principles and confidentiality of communications (Article 5), rules related to consent for processing of personal data (Article 6), and provisions on data protection by design and by default (Article 25). According to a report by the Stanford Internet Observatory, the back-end infrastructure of Clubhouse is supplied by a Chinese start-up called Agora. The report also mentions a possibility of the Chinese government accessing raw audio, as well as other security flaws. It is important to note that India still lacks a stringent data protection law, and thus, its users are far more susceptible to data breaches and privacy violations. Currently, the Central government and WhatsApp are locked in a legal battle over the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which require breaching encrypted channels to trace the originator of messages. The lack of end-to-end encryption in Clubhouse could thus make it an easy tool for government surveillance. Clubhouse also seeks permission to access users’ contacts, which is a significant privacy concern, as it gives the app information about people who might never even join it in the first place. If a user chooses not to share their contact list, they are not allowed to send invites to others. In turn, the contact list is shared not only with app developers but also with people in a user’s contact list. There is no mechanism to control who can follow whom, which further affects privacy and contributes to the ‘harassment’ culture. App permissions on smartphones have always raised questions of privacy. Even apps that are meant for limited purposes, such as sharing or managing files, or playing music or videos, often require permissions to access the phone’s camera, contacts, or call history. The big picture The rise of Clubhouse cannot be studied in isolation. It is one of the several apps that have grown popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, as millions of people stuck in their homes look for new methods to communicate with each other. But its flaws aside, Clubhouse, with its promise of revolutionising social media and communication through audio rooms, represents an attempt to innovate and provide an alternative to traditional platforms. In competition law terms, one way through which powerful firms like Facebook and Twitter can be challenged is by exploiting opportunities in spaces that are adjacent to the market where these firms reign supreme. This is what upstarts like Clubhouse are trying to do, as ‘social audio’ is one such adjacent market that has opened up only recently. However, as has been observed over time, the Big Tech will strive to protect their dominant positions in one of two ways — either by simply acquiring the potential competitor, known as a ‘killer acquisition’, or by copying the unique features of their competitor apps and adding them to their own platforms. The Big Tech giants already enjoy, thanks to their massive user base, access to more data and network effects (a phenomenon whereby a product or a service gains additional value as more people use it). Thus, they have often made clones or added features of newly popular apps to their already bloated platforms. When Snapchat introduced stories, mainstream platforms also came up with the feature a few years later. Similar trends were noticed when Zoom shot to fame and Google introduced Google Meet, or when TikTok became popular and Instagram launched ‘reels’. With Clubhouse’s growing popularity now, Twitter has introduced ‘Spaces’, and Facebook is working on a similar feature as well. But this time, LinkedIn, Discord, Reddit and Spotify have also joined the bandwagon. One wonders what this means for innovation in the world of tech. However, it remains to be seen whether such moves will affect Clubhouse, which was valued at $4 billion as of April 2021. For the average user, Clubhouse might seem like a great, lightweight app with an innovative premise. But it does not offer much in terms of privacy and data protection, and in that sense, it is not very different from traditional platforms. Apps like Signal are an exception in this regard. While the market of ‘social audio’ is likely to soon become a battleground, the medium won’t truly progress until innovation is balanced with respect for privacy, security and data rights.

10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||South Asia’s healthcare burden||On May 18 this year, India recorded 4,529 deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll recorded in the world after the United States in January saw 4,468 deaths. As India combats the pandemic, its neighbours are experiencing spillover from the menacing second wave. The virus has swept through Nepal, while Sri Lanka added as many as 78,218 cases in May. Pakistan crossed over 200 daily deaths in April, its highest since the pandemic started. The situation in Bangladesh is precarious, given the recent detection of the highly contagious Delta variant. Bhutan is the only exception, with only one death and  1,724 cases so far. The country’s success stems from a well-funded and prepared public health system with stringent measures, responsible citizenship, and an accountable government. As bodies piled up at overcrowded crematoriums in India in the last few months, several things were to blame — “super spreader” events, a fragile health infrastructure neglected for decades, citizens not following health protocols, and logistical mismanagement. What has exacerbated the situation is a subpar public healthcare system running on a meagre contribution of a little over 1% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). While the private medical sector is booming, the public healthcare sector has been operating at a pitiful 0.08 doctors per 1,000 people, falling miserably below the World Health Organization’s (WHO) prescribed standard of 1:1000. India has only half a bed available for every 1,000 people, which is a deficient figure even for normal days. Bangladesh and Pakistan fare no better, with a bed to patient ratio of 0.8 and 0.6, respectively, and a doctor availability of less than one for every 1,000 people. While ideally, out-of-pocket expenditure should not surpass 15% to 20% of the total health expenditure, for India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, this figure stands at an appalling 62.67%, 73.87% and 56.24%, respectively. The situation in rural India, where people largely rely on threadbare healthcare facilities, is disconcerting. Numerous distressing reports have emerged in the media, from patients being treated on the hospital floor for lack of beds, to some walking hundreds of miles just to get to a hospital, let alone one with oxygen or drug supplies, and many being left to resort to homemade concoctions and local quacks. Further, the fact that hundreds of healthcare workers have succumbed to COVID-19, unable to seek a bed in the very hospitals they serve, is telling. While India has the world’s third-largest military expenditure, its health budget is the fourth-lowest. In Pakistan, even amidst the pandemic, the defence budget was increased by 12% in the fiscal year 2020-21, to $7.85 billion, while the spending on health remained around $151 million. Not too far behind is Bangladesh, with decades of underfunding culminating in a crumbling public healthcare system, pushing people to opt for private medical care even if it means exorbitant health payments. Major public sector investments by the ‘big three’ of South Asia, i.e., India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, are towards infrastructure and defence, with health taking a backseat. A quick look at pre-pandemic sectoral allocations explains the chronically low status of human development indicators in the three countries.  Learning from Southeast Asia South Asia can take lessons in pragmatic healthcare policy from Southeast Asia, which has prioritised investments in healthcare systems while broadening equitable access through universal health coverage schemes. From Vietnam’s preventive measures focused on investments in disease surveillance and emergency response mechanisms, to even countries like Laos and Cambodia making a constant effort towards improving the healthcare ecosystem, all have done much better than their South Asian peers. It took a debilitating global pandemic to push South Asian policymakers to direct special attention and resources towards strengthening the health systems. But is it too late? Though the Indian government in this year’s budget highlighted an increase of 137% in “health and well-being” expenditure, a closer look reveals a mismatch between facts and figures. Learning from the devastation unleashed by the pandemic, South Asian countries must step up investment in their public healthcare sectors to make them sustainable, up to date and pro-poor; most importantly, the system should not turn its back on citizens. Given the high chances of another wave or even the impending crisis of climate change, stopgap measures ought to be replaced by a well-thought-out vision and political commitment for long-term healing.

10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||A hospital’s misplaced priorities||A noted botanist of Indian origin working in the United States, Kamaljit Bawa, had expressed an important idea — that our identity is also determined by our geography. He had gone on to suggest that given the range of life forms found in India due to a variety of climatic zones, we should see biodiversity as part of our identity. As is only reasonable to expect, the botanist might have been motivated by the need to preserve his turf at any cost, but, at any rate, he has opened up scope for imagination. That we should think of the biodiversity of India as an aspect of our identity is not just perceptive but also a constructive suggestion, at a time when the ruling dispensation in India is hell-bent on beating the country into a homogenous mass professing Hindutva. Before Hindutva was sprung upon us, there was a linguistic majoritarianism project highlighted by the concerted effort to impose the Hindi language on all of India. And it would be naive to believe that the duo of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, who are prone to addressing this linguistically diverse country in Hindi alone, are the sole champions of this project. The team of Arvind Kejriwal and his Cabinet colleagues, which runs the Delhi government, has now constituted itself into a suitable B-team. Intolerant attitude In a curious case, the GB Pant Hospital, which comes under the Delhi government, issued a notice on June 5: “A complaint has been received regarding Malayalam language being used for communication in working places in GIPMER. Whereas maximum patient and colleagues do not know this language and feel helpless causing a lot of inconvenience … it is directed to all Nursing Personnel to use only Hindi and English for communication otherwise serious action will be taken.” The notice was soon revoked after it received a nationwide backlash. It is mind-boggling that language should be the Delhi government’s first concern during a raging pandemic. The entire country watched, with sympathy, how Delhi struggled without the most basic health infrastructure during the violent second wave of infections. It could neither provide adequate oxygen supplies nor prevent the black-marketing of essential drugs. Instead of supporting frontline workers, which includes doctors, nurses and support staff, it chose to shower a section of them with cultural intolerance. There is a saying in Malayalam that translates to: “Turning on your mother after losing in the bazaar.” Its relevance in this context is direct. On March 31, Kerala, the home of the nurses of GB Pant Hospital, had a COVID-19 case fatality rate that was only a little more than a third of Delhi’s, and a death rate that was less than one fourth by comparison (deaths per population). Perhaps the political leadership of the capital has something to learn. Far from being non-compulsory, bedside manner is a necessary qualification for medical workers. It is not negotiable that they should treat their patients with empathy, and language is a part of this human exchange. But it is odd that Malayali-speaking nurses are somehow found deficient in this area in Delhi alone when they have been prized members of the health system in West Asia, Europe and North America for decades now. Ultimately, it is a failure that Delhi finds itself at odds with a section of its health workers. It can surely learn from the treatment of migrant workers in Kerala. A publicly built housing complex for them in Palakkad is called “Apna Ghar” (our home). There is something hypocritical in accepting a person’s labour but hating their language.

10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||At home||Disasters may bring out the innate generosity of people, but sometimes even well-intentioned initiatives may go wrong. Many believe that children orphaned by calamities are free for adoption and that growing with well-off adoptive parents will give them a shot at a better life than they can get from impoverished surviving relatives. However, adoption can be an option only when the children’s safety and welfare can be ensured. By ordering that no adoption of children orphaned since last year should be permitted contrary to the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, the Supreme Court has made one more benign intervention to mitigate the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. It had earlier passed various orders on the economic and health aspects of the pandemic, including those aimed at the protection of migrant workers, prisoners and jail staff and the people at large. When its attention was drawn to advertisements and messages inviting people to adopt children who have lost one or both parents to COVID-19, the court warned that no such adoption could be permitted without the involvement of the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA). It is important that the order is adhered to, as past experience shows that the danger of children falling victim to traffickers under the guise of adoption is ever-present. Even when they reach the hands of genuine adoptive parents, there is a possibility that they will be uprooted out of their social and cultural milieu through inter-country adoptions without the option of growing up with a relative or adoptive parents closer home being explored. Many may recall that following the December 2004 tsunami, there were ill-advised campaigns calling upon the people to adopt children rendered orphans in several Asian countries. It took a while for some affected countries to wake up to the reality that lax enforcement of adoption rules may have led to child trafficking in some cases. In the present situation, it appears that the Union government and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights are quite alive to the problem. The NCPCR is collecting details of children affected by the pandemic from all State governments and the administration of Union Territories. It has drawn the Supreme Court’s attention to public announcements by some unscrupulous agencies inviting interested people to adopt the children and also disclosing the children’s identities. The court’s order asking all authorities to prevent illegal adoptions and fund-collection in the names of the affected children came in response to this. The court has also passed orders for the continuance of the children’s education and other steps to coordinate the implementation of schemes in their favour. These orders are a necessary reminder to the authorities that they have a special responsibility to protect the interests and welfare of children in times like this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/at-home/article34774209.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Encouraging accord||The Finance Ministers of the G7 nations appear to have heeded the advice to ‘never let a good crisis go to waste’ when they agreed last week to set a global minimum tax of at least 15%. With the COVID-19 pandemic having caused the world economy to shrink by an estimated 3.5% in 2020 and forced most countries to dip into their coffers to mitigate the fallout, the seven richest nations opted to use the opportune moment to plug a key loophole in the international tax regime. In a communique, the G7 Ministers stressed that as part of efforts to secure a ‘Safe and Prosperous Future for All’ they would strongly back the broader efforts under way through the G20/OECD to address tax challenges arising from globalisation and digitalisation of the economy. The rapid and relentless march of technological advancement, especially in the domain of global communications and connectivity, has resulted in a world economy where the digital sphere, estimated in 2016 at $11.5 trillion or over one-sixth of global GDP, is exponentially outpacing overall economic growth. The increasing digitalisation has, however, exacerbated the challenges to taxing multinational corporations, which have sought to minimise their total tax outgo by recognising a bulk of their revenue in low-tax jurisdictions. The OECD, which is with the G20 spearheading the ‘Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting’ initiative aimed at ending tax avoidance, estimates that countries are collectively deprived of as much as $240 billion in tax revenue annually due to avoidance by MNCs. As the OECD’s Secretary-General noted in a statement welcoming the G7 deal, such distortions “can only be effectively addressed through a multilaterally agreed solution”. The G7 also agreed on “an equitable allocation of taxing rights, with market countries awarded taxing rights on at least 20% of profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises”. For India, estimated to be losing more than $10 billion in revenue each year to “global tax abuse” by MNCs according to the Tax Justice Network and one of the more than 90 countries that have joined the BEPS framework, a wider agreement at next month’s meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and central bank Governors could have far-reaching implications. India could benefit from the levy of taxes on MNCs including technology and Internet economy giants, which have taken advantage of the loopholes in the global tax system. While there are still wrinkles to be ironed out, including the issue of local levies on digital transactions, the political will to ensure greater fairness and equity in revenue sharing is a positive augury.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/encouraging-accord/article34774212.ece

The parliamentarians have suggested that the Central Information Bureau should supply information in Hindi about defence, science and technology, agriculture, education and industry. The Central Government is, of course, anxious to introduce Hindi wherever possible and the new Defence Production Board, which is to control the ordnance factories, has been called the “Raksha Utpadan Board” … The article we published yesterday on “Why the World learns English” shows that even in Europe, where local languages are highly advanced, English is the favoured foreign language. But the Government of India wants English to be treated as a “library language” for higher education despite the fact historical circumstance has made it familiar in the world of business and industry as well as in schools and colleges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-global-not-a-library-language-from-an-editorial/article34774215.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.P. favours GST reduction on essentials for COVID-19 care||The BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh government is in favour of reducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) levied on COVID-19 essentials to minimise costs borne by people to cope with the pandemic, State Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said. The GST Council, that met on May 28, had formed a Ministerial group to review demands for slashing the tax rates or exempting COVID-19 supplies from GST. Mr. Khanna was part of the Group of Ministers (GoM) that submitted its report to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman this week. “The U.P. Government is in favour of reducing taxes in order to reduce the COVID-19 treatment costs for patients,” he said. He was responding to a query on the possibility of levying a 0.1% GST on COVID-19 material ranging from vaccines (currently taxed at 5%) and drugs, oxygen concentrators and cylinders that are taxed at 12% or 18%. Ms. Sitharaman had given the GoM just ten days to firm up its views ‘so that if there are any further reductions that need to be done, (they) will be done’. However, no date has been set for the Council to study the report. Mr. Khanna also asserted the State had not raised taxes on petroleum products despite the fiscal difficulties posed by the pandemic. On States’ GST compensation dues, he said U.P. had no pending dues since last year. While the Centre has announced a Rs. 1.58-lakh crore borrowing plan to meet States’ GST compensation dues this year, rating agency ICRA has estimated that Rs. 97,700 crore of States’ dues remain pending since last year and have to be paid this year, for which the funding options are unclear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/up-favours-gst-reduction-on-essentials-for-covid-19-care/article34774188.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Aim to vaccinate 70 cr. by Sept., run sites 24/7: FinMin||The Finance Ministry has made a strong pitch to vaccinate 70 crore people with at least the first dose by September to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19 and regain the momentum of economic recovery. As this would require 93 lakh doses to be delivered every day from now, the ministry has suggested making vaccination a 24/7 activity, particularly in August and September when vaccine supplies may improve. “As on date, 19.2 crore have got the first dose while 4.7 crore have been fully vaccinated. If 70 crore must be vaccinated by September, it is estimated about 113 crore doses are needed.” The ministry suggested aligning supplies with the September target and a system whereby ‘people already having antibodies (are) vaccinated later while people who have not been exposed (are) given priority.’ “Use of technology to ease the administration of the vaccine, increased shifts at vaccination centres and integration of mass vaccination sites like shopping areas, drive-ins, with schools and primary health care centres will enhance faster coverage under vaccination,” suggested the ministry in its monthly economic report for May issued by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA). “The peak daily vaccination rate attained till date is 42.65 lakh. This peak was achieved using one shift of 8-9 hours of vaccination,” it pointed out, suggesting an enhancement of this to two shifts or even 24 hour-vaccination sites. “Challenges pertaining to vaccine supply, vaccine hesitancy, operational aspects to achieve high daily throughput and widespread reach must be anticipated and planned for in advance,” said the ministry. “As we cautiously recuperate from the second wave, rapid vaccination and front-loading of the fiscal measures planned in the Union Budget hold key to invigorating the investment, and thereby, consumption cycle in the coming quarters.” Monsoon hopes A healthy monsoon bodes well for agriculture and softer lockdowns by States are expected to translate into a ‘softer economic shock’ for sectors such as manufacturing and construction. The ministry stressed that ‘quickening the pace and coverage of vaccination’ was critical to help India heal and regain the momentum of economic recovery.  The second wave’s spread to rural India had been rapid, but the share of rural districts in new cases was still lower than the levels seen at the first wave’s peak, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/aim-to-vaccinate-70-cr-by-sept-run-sites-247-finmin/article34774190.ece

Vedanta’s Volcan Investments told the LSE the group’s interest in the Ravva oilfield would rise to 47.5% post acquisition. “The bid for the Videocon asset consists of an upfront payment of almost $40 million,” Volcan said in the filing. “The remaining deferred payments shall begin post completion of 2 years from the acquisition date.” According to previous submissions made before the NCLT, all the financial creditors of VIL and 12 group companies had lodged claims of Rs. 34,370.75 crore. Besides lenders for the group’s oil and gas business had made claims of Rs. 23,120.90 crore with the Resolution Professional. With the oil and gas vendors’ claim amounting to about 40.2% of the total claims of the financial creditors of VIL, banks had a collective exposure of Rs. 43,743.35 crore. Sizeable haircut Given the Vedanta group company’s Rs. 2,962 crore offer banks have agreed to take a haircut well in excess of Rs. 40,000 crore. Declining to comment on the VIL deal, J.N.

10 June 2021||Paris,||Sakkari stops 2020 champ Swiatek’s streak||Maria Sakkari ended defending champion Iga Swiatek's 11-match and 22-set winning streaks at Roland-Garros on Wednesday and reached the semifinals of a Major tournament for the first time. The 17th-seeded Sakkari used strong and steady baseline play to eliminate Swiatek 6-4, 6-4 at Court Philippe Chatrier in the quarterfinals and ensure that the clay-court tournament will end with a new Grand Slam champion. All four women remaining in the field are making their Slam semifinal debuts. This is only the second time in the professional era that's been the case at any major tournament, according to the WTA; there also was a quartet of first-time semifinalists at the 1978 Australian Open. On Thursday, Sakkari plays unseeded Barbora Krejcikova, and No. 31 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova faces unseeded Tamara Zidansek. Krejcikova advanced earlier on Wednesday by beating 17-year-old Coco Gauff 7-6(6), 6-3. Sakkari, who is from Greece, and Krejcikova, who is from the Czech Republic, are both 25. Each has won only one Tour-level title. Neither had been past the fourth round at a Major until now. In the day's first quarterfinal, Gauff led 3-0 at the outset, then 5-3, and held a total of five set points in the opener, but failed to convert any. Krejcikova grabbed that set by taking the last four points of the tiebreaker and reeled off 15 consecutive points during one stretch en route to a 5-0 edge in the second set. Closing out the most important victory of her singles career was not easy, though. Krejcikova needed six match points to do it, raising her arms overhead when she finally won when Gauff sent a forehand wide. Krejcikova has won two Grand Slam doubles titles with Katerina Siniakova — and they're into the semifinals in Paris — but is playing in only her fifth Major tournament in singles. "Everybody, they just put a label on me like, ‘Yeah, you play doubles. You are a doubles specialist.' But I never thought I just want to be a doubles specialist," Krejcikova said. “So I was just working hard all the time. I just wanted to play singles,” she said. In the men’s section, Rafael Nadal dropped a set for the first time this year at Roland-Garros but ultimately advanced to the semifinals for a record-extending 14th time. The 13-time champion faced a stiff challenge from gritty 10th-seeded Diego Schwartzman before prevailing 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-0 on Court Philippe Chatrier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sakkari-stops-2020-champ-swiateks-streak/article34774307.ece
10 June 2021||Chennai,||South Africans in Kiwi colours||The backswing was straight, the head still, the footwork precise, and the timing exquisite. Confidence, not nerves, was on view on his Test debut as technique — he was so sure about his off-stump — tangoed with temperament. The astonishing debut of the Johannesburg-born left-handed opener Devon Conway was a reminder of the South African presence in New Zealand cricket. His first innings 200 on a fresh Lord’s pitch showed it was never too late, even at 29, to make a beginning; he moved to New Zealand in 2017. Prolific In New Zealand, Conway had been prolific across formats in the season gone by. The rest is history. If Conway is serene, the very physical Neil Wagner is a hustler, with his short-pitched bowling. And the left-armer can get the ball to straighten from over-the-wicket. The Pretoria-born Wagner impressed in South Africa at the junior level but he too, forced by circumstances, shifted to New Zealand. And how this never-say-die paceman has risen in stature! He has a whopping 222 wickets in 52 Tests, mixing his short-pitched stuff with movement and reverse swing. At 35, he endures pain and injuries, gives it his all. As feisty as Wagner, the Durban-born B-J. Watling left South Africa as a schoolboy for New Zealand. A tenacious top-order batsman, he developed into a competent wicket-keeper. The combative Watling cemented his place as a wicketkeeper and a middle-order batsman who relishes crisis situations. As many as 3,789 runs at 37.89 in 74 Tests and 262 catches plus eight stumpings showcase this 35-year-old battler’s contribution. No chokers And the South Africans who turn out for New Zealand do not choke. Take the case of Johannesburg-born Grant Elliott whose sensational 84 not out took the Kiwis to a come-from-behind last gasp victory in the ICC ODI World Cup semifinal against South Africa in Auckland, 2015. Heavy hitter Colin Munro, a South African by birth, has met with some success for New Zealand in white-ball cricket. These South Africans have been busy in New Zealand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/south-africans-in-kiwi-colours/article34774309.ece
10 June 2021||Paris,||Medvedev exits with underarm serve and a dig at scheduling||Daniil Medvedev’s campaign at Roland-Garros came to an end on Tuesday with an ill-judged underarm serve on match point followed by an impassioned outburst over his eagerly-awaited showdown with Stefanos Tsitsipas being played inside an empty stadium. The colourful World No. 2 was beaten 6-3, 7-6(3), 7-5 by the Greek fifth seed. It was only Tsitsipas’s second win over Medvedev in eight meetings and it ended in bizarre fashion. The mercurial Russian decided to serve underarm on match point down. But as he approached the net, hoping to finish the point with a volley, Tsitsipas merely fired a backhand winner beyond him. “I was thinking about this during the whole match, like that maybe in the important point I could do it because my opinion was that he was quite far back in the court, so that can always work,” explained the 25-year-old. “I didn’t see the opportunity before but I thought it’s going to be a good choice to bring him surprise. I sometimes do it on practice. “Usually guys are a bit surprised. But it didn’t work out at all. I won’t say it was a mistake. It was something that I dared to do and maybe next time I won’t do it knowing that he’s ready.” Tsitsipas had his own description for the ploy which backfired so badly for his opponent. “A very millennial shot,” said the Greek. “I saw he kind of stopped. I felt like there was something coming up, so at that point I think I got prepared for it.” Medvedev had never won a match at Roland-Garros in four attempts before this year. So winning four matches in one visit was progress even if he was dismayed that his match was selected for the penultimate evening session. It was played inside an empty Court Philippe Chatrier as spectators were banned under a 9 p.m. COVID-19 curfew. This year’s French Open is staging evening sessions for the first time under a broadcast agreement with streaming giant Amazon. “It was without a doubt the match of the day but Roland-Garros preferred Amazon to people,” said Medvedev.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/medvedev-exits-with-underarm-serve-and-a-dig-at-scheduling/article34774310.ece
10 June 2021||MUMBAI,||How Gavaskar, Pataudi and Srikkanth helped Sehwag||Former India batsman Virender Sehwag, on Wednesday, revealed how tips from former India captains Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sunil Gavaskar and K. Srikkanth enabled him to overcome a lack of footwork as an opener. Sehwag, who scored more than 8,000 runs in 104 Tests, revealed that near-identical suggestions by the trio early on in his international career were instrumental in him modifying his guard in Test cricket. Lack of footwork “When I came into international cricket, lack of footwork was lamented by many commentators and experts but no one advised a solution. Everyone would just say that you need to improve your feet-movement,” Sehwag said while launching Cricuru, a cricket learning app that he has co-founded along with former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar. “The only exceptions were Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sunil Gavaskar and K. Srikkanth. They told me moving the feet wasn’t paramount in cricket, what’s important is you play the ball close to your body and below your eyes. “Especially Pataudi and Gavaskar told me that if you are away from the ball, then it matters whether you move your feet or not. They offered the best advice I received so far: to take guard on middle- and off-stump rather than leg-stump so that you can be closer to the ball even if you don’t move your feet too much.” Mastering the skills Sehwag said along with Bangar and the 33 cricketers — men and women across the globe — that they have got on board for paid coaching modules and interactions with budding cricketers, the app may help players and coaches master the skills and mental aspects of succeeding on the field. Little late “Had I got this advice earlier in life, I may have played much better cricket and scored more runs. “Through Cricuru, you’ll get many more such critical tips by veteran cricketers about how to make these minor adjustments.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/how-gavaskar-pataudi-and-srikkanth-helped-sehwag/article34774320.ece
10 June 2021||New Delhi,||Indian Grand Prix scheduled for June 21||The Athletics Federation of India has scheduled the 4th Indian Grand Prix for June 21 at NS-NIS Patiala. There had been uncertainty over the event with the federation hoping to arrange competitions abroad for Indian athletes ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, but the travel restrictions and quarantine rules in most countries forced it to explore other options. A 40-member national team was expected to travel to Kyrgyzstan (T. Kolpakova International Competition in Bishkek) and Kazakhstan (Qosanov Memorial in Almaty) later this month. However, the AFI was informed of a mandatory 14-day isolation for those arriving from India, regardless of a negative PCR test or vaccination certificate, forcing the AFI to drop the idea. "We do not want to impact the training schedule of our athletes by making them go through a long quarantine process with six weeks left for the Olympic Games. We will focus on providing them with good competition in the Indian Grand Prix and National inter-state Championships from 25-29th June in Patiala," AFI president Adille Sumariwalla said. The worst affected athletes of the severe restrictions and cancellations have been shotputter Tajinder Pal Singh Toor and javelin thrower Annu Rani, besides the 4x100m women's relay team, all on the fringe of qualifying.  List of events: Men: 400m, 1500m, Long Jump, Triple Jump, Shot Put, Javelin Throw, 400m Hurdles; Women: 100m, 200m, 400m, 1500m, 5000m, Discus Throw, Javelin Throw, 4x100m relay .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-grand-prix-scheduled-for-june-21/article34774355.ece
10 June 2021||KOZHIKODE,||A move in the right direction, say veterans||Former Indian captain I.M. Vijayan believes the new ISL regulation — increasing the number of Indians in the playing XI to seven from six — is a move in the right direction. From next season, a team can only field four foreigners in an ISL match. “The ISL administrators have done the right thing,” Vijayan told The Hindu on Wednesday. “That is the way forward for Indian football.” Right ratio Bino George, former coach of Gokulam Kerala who is in talks with an ISL team, also thinks the new ratio is the right one for India’s premier football league. “But I hope there will be no further reduction in the number of foreigners,” he said. “The ISL has become what it is because of the quality players from abroad. Now that there will be seven Indians in the XI, it is a boost to local talent.” Vijayan said the change in rules was bound to benefit the Indian players. “At the moment there is nothing that will help an Indian footballer more than the experience of playing in the ISL,” said the former striker who is among the fastest goalscorers in international football. “If our national team is performing better these days, the ISL is the main reason for that.” Talking of the national team, he said he was impressed with the way it has fared so far at the World Cup qualifiers in Doha. After losing by a solitary goal to Qatar in the first match, India defeated Bangladesh 2-0 on Monday. Pat for Chhetri “I thought the Indians fought hard against Qatar and were superb against Bangladesh in that must-win encounter,” said Vijayan. “Sunil Chhetri was brilliant. I loved both the goals he scored against Bangladesh.” He said Chhetri had been doing a great service to Indian football for so long. “I have always admired his commitment and dedication,” Vijayan said. “However, he is now 36 and may be available for another two years. India needs to think of new players, though it will be difficult to find another striker like Chhetri.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-move-in-the-right-direction-say-veterans/article34774359.ece
10 June 2021||CHENNAI,||No comparison with Messi, says Chhetri||Sunil Chhetri might be among the upper echelon in global football, but he remains grounded to reality. The Indian football team captain has gone past Lionel Messi to become the second-highest international goal-scorer among active footballers, but he is quick to dismiss any comparison between him and the Argentine icon. “Here’s my take: there is absolutely no comparison between me and Messi. There is no comparison between me and anyone on that list. There are 1,000 footballers and all 1,000 of them, including myself, are fans of Messi,” Chhetri said in a virtual interaction on Wednesday. “That’s the reality and people who understand football know there is no comparison. What I am proud of is the fact that I have played over 100 games for the country” Chhetri struck a brace in the Blue Tigers’ 2-0 win over Bangladesh on Monday to take his tally to 74 international goals. He now trails only Cristiano Ronaldo, who has 103 goals. Chhetri, 36, has scored a whopping 52% — nine of 17 goals — of the national team's goals in the last two years. The recurring talks of “who after Chhetri?” do not bog him down. “I don’t take it as a source of pressure. I think we will get strikers who will score more than me. It is a process and takes time. We will have only four foreigners in the (starting XI) from the next ISL season and that will give time to more young strikers. Two mantras “There are only two mantras for strikers — more games and hard work. In the next 10-20 years there will be many players who will be scoring goals better than me. If you keep getting players like me we will be where we are. We will get better players and we will be better,” he said. He stressed the need to play more passes. “I want the team to be a little bit brave with the ball. I think we understand defence, diet and how to take care of ourselves. But many people do not like that we do not keep the ball and I feel the same way. “I also want to see my team pass more. I like passing and moving more than any other system. It means you run less and get more 1v1 opportunities and more chances.”  There are 1,000 footballers and all 1,000 of them, including myself, are fans of Messi||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-comparison-with-messi-says-chhetri/article34774361.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||IOA prepared to go with unbranded sports kits at Tokyo||Having snapped sponsorship ties with Chinese company Li Ning, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) is prepared to go with unbranded sports kits at the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. The IOA, however, has not given up hope on finding a replacement sponsor in the short time available but admits it won’t be easy. Time running out “The IOA, the athletes, sports everyone exists because of the public and if public sentiment is against something then there is no question of going ahead with it. We took a decision to withdraw from the contract after criticism and we are in the process of initiating talks (for a replacement sponsor). But we have only till the end of June to finalise things and honestly, it isn’t enough time,” IOA president Narinder Batra told The Hindu . Batra and secretary-general Rajeev Mehta had, on Tuesday night, issued a joint statement, withdrawing the contract without naming Li Ning. “We are aware of the emotions of our fans and we in the IOA have decided that we will withdraw from our existing contract with an apparel sponsor. Our athletes, coaches and support staff, will wear unbranded apparel...we would like our athletes to be able to train and compete without having to answer questions about the apparel brand. As it is, they have all been challenged by the pandemic over the past year and a quarter and we want them to not be distracted,” they had announced. Reaction Reacting to the announcement, China’s Foreign Ministry in Beijing said on Wednesday it “hoped that the Indian side will be objective and fair in viewing the normal cooperation between the two countries, rather than politicising the issue.” The IOA, along with the Sports Ministry, had unveiled the Indian kits for the Tokyo Olympics only last week at a virtual event. “Getting the kits ready is not an issue, they are being readied even now for those confirmed qualified and we have the measurements of all those who are on the long list. “If we manage something in time, great. Otherwise they will remain unbranded. But there can’t be a compromise with the standards,” Batra added. “Olympics is a huge stage and there can be no compromise with the prestige of representing the nation there. Anyone can spend huge amounts to get their name on the kit but we will have to look at the credentials also,” he insisted. Domestic brand best bet IOA treasurer Anandeshwar Pandey admitted that a well-known domestic brand was India’s best bet at the moment. “Given the conditions and the circumstances, I believe getting an Indian brand on board will be the best thing. Without compromising on quality, it will also be a proud thing on the global stage.” Shiv Naresh remains the front-runner for the same as the most experienced Indian manufacturer.

10 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram:,||Former KCA secretary Abdullah passes away||A.C.M. Abdullah, the former secretary of Kerala Cricket Association, passed away here on Wednesday. He was 89 and is survived by his wife and three children. Abdullah, who started his career as PE teacher at St. Joseph’s School, Thalassery, also served as secretary of Kerala State Athletics Association for a brief while in 1962 and was the Chief Sports Organiser of the DPI from 1971 till his retirement in 1988. He served as KCA secretary from 1973-74 and from 1979 till 1987. At a time when cricket administration was not glamorous, Abu Mash, as he was fondly known, worked selflessly and tirelessly, often with meagre grants from the sports council. It was under him that KCA first took steps to lay a turf wicket at the University stadium in Thiruvananthapuram in 1980. A year later, University stadium hosted the first international match in Kerala when MCC under Graham Gooch played an exhibition match against Board President’s XI. The crowning moment for him came three years later when KCA hosted the first one-day international match in Kerala in 1984 when India played Australia at the University stadium. Instrumental As chief sports organiser, ACM was instrumental in Kerala hosting the National School Games for the first time in 1971 and he implemented numerous schemes for the development of school sports which saw Kerala emerge as a strong force in National School Games. The KCA has condoled the death of its former secretary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/former-kca-secretary-abdullah-passes-away/article34774511.ece

Tom Latham will captain the side. However, the Blackcaps are confident he will be fit to lead the team in the inaugural World Test Championship final against India starting on June 18. To rest key bowlers Meanwhile, New Zealand is set to rest a few of its key bowlers for the Test to ensure that the team is fresh and raring to go when it clashes with India in the World Test Championship final from June 18. With pacer Trent Boult now available for selection for the final match of the series, New Zealand can easily rest one of its other key bowlers — Tim Southee, Neil Wagner and Kyle Jamieson. Williamson, who captained New Zealand in last week’s drawn first Test against England at Lord’s, has been managing the injury since first missing matches in March. “It’s not an easy decision for Kane to have to miss a Test, but we think it’s the right one,” New Zealand coach Gary Stead said.  The teams:   England (likely XI): Rory Burns, Dom Sibley, Zak Crawley, Joe Root (Capt.), Ollie Pope, Dan Lawrence, James Bracey (wk), Craig Overton, Jack Leach, Stuart Broad, and James Anderson.

10 June 2021||Gros Islet (ST. LUCIA),||Windies ready to pounce on unsettled South Africa||West Indies believes it has its best chance in 30 years to defeat an unsettled South Africa as the two-Test series begins at the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground on Thursday. Kraigg Brathwaite’s men are unbeaten in their last four Tests — a 2-0 triumph in Bangladesh and drawn matches at home against Sri Lanka. West Indies goes into the campaign ranked just above a Proteas team reeling from successive heavy defeats in two Tests in Pakistan. South Africa also has senior opening batsman Dean Elgar installed as Test captain following the retirement of Faf du Plessis from the traditional format. West Indies suffered a setback leading up to the opening Test when fast bowler Shannon Gabriel was ruled out through injury. Though it opens up the prospect of 19-year-old pacer Jayden Seales making his Test debut, his lack of experience — he has played just one First Class match — could see the selectors opt for Alzarri Joseph. Brathwaite, Joseph and senior seamer Kemar Roach have all benefited from stints on the English county circuit following the end of the Sri Lanka series.

10 June 2021||New Delhi,||Soaking it in||New Zealand’s two Tests against England before the World Test Championship final against India could end up creating workload management issues for the Black Caps, feels the Kiwis’ longest-serving coach Mike Hesson. Hesson also had some advice for the Indian team: Go with Mayank Agarwal in the opening slot instead of retaining the set combination of Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill. Limited preparation COVID-19 related restrictions have left India with limited preparation time ahead of the final beginning on June 18 while New Zealand will have the advantage of playing two games against England before the first ever WTC title clash in Southampton. Hesson doesn’t agree with that assessment. “It is an issue (playing three Tests in quick succession). New Zealand will have to look at the bowling attack and that’s potentially why Trent Boult will play this game (second Test against England from Thursday),” he pointed out. “That will give one of those other quicks to rest potentially, because it’s only four days between each Test. So, three on the bounce is a big deal, especially if you put in 45 to 50 overs in the second Test, or they just decide to manage the workloads which is not something you usually do going into a Test match,” he said. X-factor The 46-year-old, who coached New Zealand from 2012-2018, also backed Rishabh Pant to provide the x-factor like he did on the memorable tour of Australia earlier this year and is in favour of a best of three WTC final in the long run. One of New Zealand’s most successful coaches who is now currently director of cricket at the Royal Challengers Bangalore, Hesson expects Rohit and Gill to open but wants Mayank, who lost his spot in the eleven after two Tests in Australia, to be given a chance. Mayank was the team’s leading run getter in the away series against New Zealand last year when India lost 0-2 and was only one of the four Indian batsmen to get a half-century in an otherwise difficult campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/soaking-it-in/article34774315.ece

10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The (delivery) road not taken||“Where a consumer has a presence, a restaurant can follow. Facebook, Instagram, Google listings, WhatsApp... any of them can be worked into an ordering platform, and we are teaching restaurants how to do just that,” says tech entrepreneur Anurag Gupta. His non-aggregator platform DotPe, co-founded with Shailaz Nag and Gyanesh Sharma, has tied up with over 15,000 restaurants in 300 cities, in two years. This business is miniscule compared to giants like Swiggy and Zomato — Zomato boasted of 1.4 million active restaurants back in 2019, the year DotPe had just started out. But even as the giants continue to innovate, creating employment and providing essential delivery during lockdown, alternative food delivery platforms have been seeing a steady rise over the past two years. The commission conundrum Interestingly enough, they arrived on the scene to fill an urgent need, not of consumers, but of restaurants. Restaurateurs (as well as organisations like National Restaurants Authority of India, NRAI) have for years been seeking alternatives to mainstream aggregator apps. Statements galore have been made about how the deep discounts offered by delivery apps, combined with heavy commissions they charge, cut deep into profits of restaurants, bars and cafes, to the point of making business nearly unsustainable. While NRAI announced plans to launch its own delivery platform back in 2020, it was in May 2021 that Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association (KHRA) launched a food delivery app, Rezoy, as a response against the commission charged by larger food aggregators. “It is around 20% plus GST, which comes up to 21.5% or 22% of the bill amount. When you factor in the overheads, which include raw material cost and salaries, a restaurant owner is not left with much to run the business. Sometimes the bill amount [on a particular order] may not justify the commission. We needed to do something about it in order to continue in the business,” says Asees Moosa, Ernakulam district president of KHRA. Platforms like DotPe and Thrive, in contrast, charge anywhere between 1% to 3% commission per order, and have capped it at that. Thrive has been another popular option for individual restaurants in metro cities. Launched in October 2020 with one restaurant partner in Mumbai, Thrive built its base to 1,500 restaurants by February 2021. “That is when we launched our 2.0 version, which has helped double our count in the last two months alone. We now have over 3,000 restaurants on board,” says co-founder Dhruv Dewan. Dhruv does not see Thrive as an alternative to Swiggy or Zomato. “I think in the near future, direct-to-customer platforms and aggregators will coexist,” he says, “But for anyone building a business from scratch, a direct-to-customer option makes more sense than an aggregator.” A key reason why certain restaurants choose Thrive over Zomato or Swiggy, is access to consumer data. As Gauri Devidayal of The Table, Mumbai puts it, “It is very difficult to run a business online if you don’t know who your consumer is, which dish they prefer and why, what problems they had with a particular order.” Thrive gives its restaurant partner ownership over such data. “The data is hosted on our servers, because it isn’t feasible to have a separate server for each restaurant. But the data rests contractually with each restaurant, and they have full access to it. According to the terms and conditions, we [Thrive] can’t give a restaurant’s consumption data to anyone else. We can only use it to improve our operations, like keeping track of payment hiccups,” says Dhruv. Asees explains how hotels are encouraged by aggregators to have different prices — for online and offline orders. “Prices [on the online menu] and portion sizes are ‘adjusted’ in a way that justifies the commission they pay to the aggregators, some make extra too. So who gets the raw deal in the end? Our aim [with Rezoy] is that all stakeholders benefit, not just us,” he adds. The menu uploaded by the restaurant on Rezoy has to be the one displayed at the hotel. If there is malpractice then action is taken against the hotel — they are removed if they refuse to comply. “This is a reason why a few hotels are not keen on being on the app as they are used to the extra profit,” says Asees. Last-mile delivery is another factor where today’s giants appear to have an advantage; a restaurant needs a dependable delivery fleet, one that knows its city’s lanes and bylanes, shortcuts and detours. DotPe and Thrive address this with a hybrid model. As Anurag points out, “The last-mile delivery problem has already been solved by others — by Shadowfax, Rapido and Dunzo. We have tied up with them; restaurants have the option of using their own staff for delivery, these third-party teams, or a mix of the two.” Thrive’s model is similar. Riyaaz Amlani’s Impressario Handmade restaurants — the firm behind Social — recently snagged a headline-grabbing tie-up: Mumbai’s dabbawalas now deliver his restaurants orders to homes across the metropolis.  Learning curve  Innovating is one thing, getting smaller and newer restaurants to understand the nitty-gritties of online operations in the midst of a pandemic is another. NRAI has been conducting bootcamps to familiarise restaurants with DotPe’s system in multiple cities. In Mumbai, the gastropub London Taxi co-founded by Dhaval Udeshi and NRAI member Pawan Shahri, has doubled up as an incubator programme. Dhaval says, “This is the first time that a restaurant is opening up its kitchen to become an incubator for home delivery. There is no doubt about the adverse effect of the pandemic on India’s F&B segment, especially small business owners. Newer companies who want to start their own brand in the food business need SEO (search engine optimisation) to acquire direct customers. To make a business survive on its own it takes a good couple of months.” Dhaval says that partnering with known brands is one definite way forward, keeping in mind the importance of SEO in reaching end-customers online. “We have redone our entire marketing strategy towards online delivery, and have partnered with DotPe for the same,” he says. It appears to be a case of multiple Davids banding against a few Goliaths, in a tussle that promises to be fascinating, and ultimately rewarding for customers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-delivery-road-not-taken/article34774172.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Back to school at||“My name is Hangmila Jamang and I am 70... I am 79 years old,” narrates Hangmila Jamang with the cadence of a kindergartener, as she looks up from drawing water pots on her sketchpad. It is Art class today at Oasis Academy in Chatric Khullen in Kamjong district of Manipur. Even as children across India spend their time on online classes, for the elders of this village of 100-households, lockdown has meant a return to physical schools after decades. Leading this project is Sorinthan Haorei, founder of Gemson Haorei, an organisation named after his father. In February this year, the 28-year-old founded Oasis Academy for children up to Class VII, and in May, opened it up to 15 adult learners as well. His grandmother, Shoknaola Hungyo (70), is one of his students. They are learning numericals from one to 1,000, alphabets, and how to write their own names. For many of the elders, the upcoming exam will be the first one of their lives. “Most of the elders here did not receive basic education when they were young. The highest one of them had studied up to was Class IV,” says Sorinthan. But education was not the only reason this school was set up: “They (the elders) are involved in agricultural activities and most live away from their families. So another reason we took this up was to provide a platform for socialisation, to keep their mental health up in times like these,” he adds. In October 2020 that Sorinthan shifted base to his native village from Delhi where he got his Masters in Public Administration at IGNOU. “We returned due to the pandemic. On speaking to other people here, we realised that so many other children too had returned and were unable to go back to towns and cities to study. Which is why my mother and I came up with the idea of starting a school in the village itself,” he says. He turned his parents’ ancestral home into a school for children, and set their curriculum according to the Board of Secondary Education, Manipur. In 2019, he organised the first district-level literary meet in Kanjong, hosting a quiz, debate and spelling bee. The teachers at his school are not ‘trained’, he confesses — it is just him and his mother. But the organisation is looking for sponsors to employ teachers, or teachers from neighbouring towns to volunteer. For the elders, he and the other villagers together constructed bamboo sheds outside the main building. “We teach them to read the hymns at church. In due course, they will also be able to write letters to their sons and daughters.” Sorinthan moved out of his hometown in Ukhrul, when he was 16, in pursuit of higher education. However, every Christmas and New Year, it was a family tradition to visit his grandmother in Chatric Khullen. “We had to take a day bus from Ukhrul which dropped us off 40 kilometres from Chatric. So the next day, we would travel by foot, and reach the village around 4-5 pm,” he says. He recalls crossing a shabby bridge made of rope and chopped bamboo. “When I was young, elders would carry me on their backs, because the path was slippery.” He is now back at the same village, teaching his grandmother English. “My grandson is a good teacher,” says Shoknaola. “Once I am able to sign my name, collecting my late husband’s pension at the bank will become easier,” she adds.

10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Dorje spills||Despite the thunder, lightning and patchy phone connection, Sparsh Agarwal is undeterred. He bounces around his home at the Selim Hill tea estate in Darjeeling, recently renamed ‘Second Chance’ by his mother, in search of a better phone signal each time this interview is stalled by the storm. It is this cheery resilience that could give Darjeeling’s celebrated, but now struggling, tea estates a second chance to shine. But first, an experiment, which begins with an annual subscription plan that launches tomorrow, needs to go according to plan. “When Darjeeling tea is the pride of India, why are most of the 87 estates barely breaking even, some on the brink of collapse?” asks Sparsh, adding that the romance of this “champagne of teas” has drawn buyers from across the world, for two centuries. Over the past decade, however, a declining export market, climate change and now the pandemic are threatening the survival of many of the estates, which in turn threatens all that is special about Darjeeling. “The Selim Hill tea garden has been under my family’s stewardship for four generations, since 1871. Half of it is under forest cover, home to everything from hornbills to elephants,” says Sparsh. “We do not want to sell because we need to protect this ecology. But we needed to find a way to support the estate.” After a year of field research, Sparsh, who was working with the Centre for Policy Research, and his business partner Ishaan Kanoria, an investment banker, decided to quit their jobs and launch Dorje Tea, an innovative and sustainable model that re-introduces Darjeeling tea, embracing all its quirks, to an Indian audience, instead of exporting it piecemeal. Their mentor is the legendary Rajah Banerjee, whose family ran Makaibari tea estate for four generations before he recently moved on. A trailblazer, he created an organic oasis at Makaibari, inspiring other estates to follow suit, Rajah is a powerful influence in Darjeeling, and an ambassador for its tea. Seasonal moods Grown with a Chinese cultivar, Darjeeling tea captivated international buyers with its potent aroma and unique muscatel flavour, a pleasing sweetness with musky, spiced undertones. “However it never focussed on the domestic market and is seen as unaffordable,” says Sparsh, explaining why: “There are four seasonal flushes. While the first and second, which are spring and summer, are sold at premium, there isn’t a market for monsoon and autumn flush teas — though each has a unique taste, aroma and liquoring, which is additionally influenced by terroir.” Popular in Europe, America and Britain particularly, the spring and summer flush get exported at heady prices, while the monsoon and autumn flush are undervalued. Since the best tea is exported, and profits ride on sales of just the spring and summer flushes, often estates barely break even, says Sparsh. “The flush system is unique to Darjeeling and adds to the romance of our teas. Customers should be having all four. The biggest mistake is thinking there is a hierarchy.” There is another catch. “International clients want the whole leaf grade, so the tea is machine sorted. For one kilo of tea, only 30% is whole leaf, which means that the rest sells at a loss,” says Sparsh. “But, in the inconsistencies lie the charm of the product.” Stating that he is fundamentally against the export market, which buys relatively small quantities, and “destroys the harvest for rest of the year,” Sparsh says Dorje will be reaching out to Indian buyers with a subscription plan. “For an annual subscription of Rs. 2,100 per kg, we will send tea from each flush to customers through the year.” Since all flushes will be equally celebrated, without being wastefully broken up and graded, pricing is competitive, enabling customers to drink this champagne of teas everyday. Sparsh and his family are launching the Selim Hill Collective, helmed by Rajah Banerjee, to focus on the non-commercial rejuvenation of the tea garden, starting with a reforestation campaign. “Even as we work on getting the commercial part right, we want to focus on community welfare and wild life conservation,” says Sparsh, adding, “Within this crisis, there is opportunity.”  To order log on to https://dorjeteas.com/||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/dorje-spills/article34774183.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Pitch your story to Vikramaditya Motwane||You are in an elevator with director Vikramaditya Motwane, and you have your first screenplay in hand. You have a minute to pitch it. How would you do it? The filmmaker behind Trapped and Udaan is hosting the next edition of Art for Oxygen workshops this weekend. Motwane will be discussing a series of shortlisted film/web shows, and in the process, sharing his insights on how to perfect your pitch and make sure that your idea is being communicated well. This class is 12th in a series of workshops facilitated by Nisha Kalra, who wrote for Bhaag Beanie Bhaag , a Netflix series starring Swara Bhaskar. The funds from these workshops go towards COVID-19 relief funds. “I wanted the fundraiser to give people a chance to virtually interact and socialise with others. They would not only be able to contribute through it but also gain skills that they would otherwise not have the chance to pay attention to,” says Nisha. Onboard were writer Varun Grover ( Masaan , Sacred Games ), director Saurabh Khanna ( Kota Factory ), and film industry veterans such as casting director Tess Joseph, and acting coaches Bert Van Djik and Miranda Harcourt. In a session that saw the most number of participants so far (over 270), the trio shared practices to be imbibed particularly on audition day — on this virtual quasi ‘audition day’, the amateur actors were sent monologues to prepare. “The theme for the workshops is Art — any type of art,” emphasises Nisha, adding that the idea is for the host to introduce students to their world, post which they can have Q&A sessions and give feedback to pitches. And then comes the question of what to do with the feedback you have received. In his session, creative producer with Zee Studios, Vinit Masram explained how and when to take the call of pushing back to changes. The first workshop in the series was held by comedian Abish Mathew. “The Q&A section is the most informative part of the session,” he believes. Among other things, he was asked to explain the difference between writing a joke, and writing for a comedy show. “Writing is not your most important skill, editing is,” he informed his students. “The head writer looks at the jokes given to him and thinks about their political correctness, whether the host will be able to do it, how the producers look at it, artist management, creative director, technical director… A joke touches around 150 people before it reaches the audience; it has to be broad enough. In this way, you’ll be able to get a more wholesome understanding of how a show looks at a joke, as opposed to just writing one.” Abish is looking to host another workshop soon, as are fellow comedians Kannan Gill and Ashish Shakya.

10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Fighting the good fight||An isolated elderly patient with the Minamata disease lying on a hospital bed with ventilator support, is the opening scene of Minamata Mandala (2020). A sprawling six-hour-long documentary by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Kazuo Hara, it is both a humane story and a deeply political film, that exposes the Japanese government’s incompetence in handling the epidemic and painstakingly captures the decades-long legal and medical battle of the residents of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan. Having filmed the documentary across a span of 15 years, Hara says the idea originated in his mind sometime during the early ‘90s when the momentum around Minamata died down. The epidemic had forced an exodus among residents of Minamata to other cities in search of jobs. He came across one such: a fisherman, who moved to Osaka where they were discussing the impact the disease had on his life. There was anger among people and agitations led by Civil Action Groups, one of the representatives being a university professor, also an acquaintance of Hara. He suggested that the filmmaker make a documentary on Minamata; Hara says he postponed agreeing to it for a year, for he felt the subject was not his territory. Connecting over a video call from his residence at Shinjuku, Japan, Hara, joined by a translator, says, “Noriaki Tsuchimoto’s documentary had a profound impact on me and he was already following up on the case. I even tried meeting him, but they wouldn’t let me because he was in a hospital. I never had a chance to ask him, but in a way, I inherited what he started.” The filming for the documentary began in 2001 and roughly ended in 2015-16. Split into three parts with two intervals, Hara takes a matter-of-fact approach to the 372-minute documentary, bringing out a series of first-person interviews with patients, medical researchers and academics who were involved in the study, and the plaintiffs. Though its runtime may seem laboriously endless, the larger point of the documentary was to give the audience a taste of the long road it takes for justice and hence, the film’s runtime, though justifiable, seemed like it was intended to honour the memories of the people featured. Hara has not just invested a stupendous amount of time, but has also sacrificed 15 years of his life to realise this documentary. While admitting that he has changed as a person over the years, Hara says it has been a journey of self-discovery going as far back as the time he made The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On (1987), one of his most famous works, to draw a parallel to his older self. The protagonist of that film was a determined individual who took on the government single-handedly. “I realise now it is not about an individual but about the fighting spirit of the everyday people.” Minamata Mandala was screened at the recently-concluded International Film Festival Rotterdam 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/fighting-the-good-fight/article34774140.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Neighbours from the coast||Madras Naturalists’ Society (MNS) has released a field guide on Chennai’s coastal fauna, which marks the completed segment of an ongoing documentation project on iNaturalist. At 51MB, the field guide slips easily into digital pockets and can be downloaded free from MNS’ website (blackbuck.org.in). It lists 128 species that frequent the beaches, but remain largely unnoticed, let alone admired. The exercise comes midstep through an ambitious project to document Tamil Nadu’s coastal biodiversity and its irritants. Marine creatures featured in the guide were found at Pulicat lagoon, Adyar estuary, Kovalam-Muttukadu backwaters, Odiyur-Mudhaliyarkuppam lagoon, and Kaliveli Lake-Yedaiyanthittu estuary, hotspots in what MNS has demarcated as Zone I. For a taste of the guide, have a squint at two creatures that adorn its covers: the blue button and the ghost crab. Naturalist M Yuvan describes the ghost crab’s regular day at work. “Ghost crabs are public health officers on our beaches, because a carcass — of a fish, an eel or any other creature — can stay rotting for weeks, as beach sand has close to zero microbial activity. Ghost crabs make quick work of these carcasses, keeping the sands clean.” Yuvan continues: “The blue button has a calcium disc on top, which serves as its float. It lives floating on the surface of the ocean. With its tentacles below, it catches planktons and other very small crustaceans. When there is a strong wind, blue buttons get beached; the North-East monsoon is a good time to spot them on our beaches. This little creature can be up to 20 to 30 years old.” Vikas Madhav Nagarajan points out how the making of the guide led the team to appreciate how these life forms figure in fisherfolk’s workaday lives. Vikas explains: “During one trip, at Valmiki Nagar, we found 12 sea snakes. The fisherfolk were very nice and asked us if we would want to release a snake back in the waters. Though their bites are deadly, sea snakes are docile. Caught by its tail, a sea snake would just hang calmly, waiting for you to drop it.” Besides Yuvan and Vikas, Anooja A, Aswathi Asokan, Nanditha Ram Satagopan and Rohith Srinivasan carried out the field study.  When there is a strong wind, blue buttons get beached; the north-east monsoon is a good time to spot them on our beaches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/neighbours-from-the-coast/article34774155.ece

Spaces also helped put some focus on my art because I thought: Have people forgotten that I am a singer? ” If you drop by Chinmayi’s residence in Chennai, you will probably see her playing with her dogs and humming a tune. It might be a raga or alaap , or a tune from one of her superhits. It is this side of the singer that fans have lately been introduced to in her recent packed, Twitter Spaces outings, one of which spilled over to the wee hours of the following day. However, the ones that won the most hearts were her concert with composer Govind Vasantha and her rendition of ‘80s hits, a tribute to Ilaiyaraaja who turned 78 recently. In some of her Spaces, Chinmayi showcased her vocal prowess, thus leading to comments among Twitterati, many of whom said the music “healed them in tough times”. She also takes on impromptu requests, to the delight of her fans. “I had a great time performing,” she says. Also trending on social media in recent times was the hashtag #WeWantChinmayiBack, indicating that listeners wanted to hear more of her in films. “That was absolutely touching, but how much of this will have a change in ground reality is to be seen,” says the singer, who mentions that Govind Vasantha and Nivas Prasanna are among her closest friends in the music industry. Chinmayi, however, is not much of a music listener herself. “I don’t listen to music for relaxation or fun. For me, music is an all-consuming exercise; I cannot relax when it plays in the background. That’s why when I drive, I do not have music playing,” says the musician, whose playback singing career kickstarted with the hit ‘Oru Deivam’ song in Mani Ratnam’s Kannathil Muthamittal (2002). Since then, she has sung over 1,000 songs in various languages. She states that her film offers have dried up since her involvement with the #MeToo movement, which began in 2018, but there are still a few tracks on the cards. “I sang a solo Malayalam song for AR Rahman for the Prithviraj project ( Aadujeevitham ) four years ago. I am not sure of its status now. I have sung a few upcoming tracks in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam but nothing in Tamil.” So, what’s next? At the moment, Chinmayi is making sure she is heard on social media. She has been a part of two Clubhouse events discussing cinema. Also on the cards is a Twitter Spaces dedicated exclusively to ghazals , which she is planning to schedule in the next few days. “I speak about issues that need to be flagged, but people think I am into full-time activism,” she says, discussing the surge of support from listeners on Twitter Spaces. She adds. “These recent conversations helped changed that notion.”  For me, music is an all-consuming exercise.

Karadi Tales’ Karadi Path is one such resource for language learning, which was ideated and launched 10 years back. Now, the platform has been recognised as the winner by the 50th London Book Fair, in its International Excellence Awards category in educational learning resources — the only firm in India to receive the award this year. It began when schools started considering Karadi Tales’ audio books as a possible language resource. “We had Naseeruddin Shah, Nandita Das and so on giving voice to the characters,” recalls CP Viswanath, co-founder of Karadi Path. “Children loved the way the story was told, even when they did not know the language itself,” he adds, recalling an incident in Dharavi (Mumbai), where the crew realised that the children could speak three languages simultaneously. “In India, we are so effortlessly multilingual. But at the same time, we see children learning a language in theory for many years, without knowing how to speak or the meaning of the words,” he says. These observations together formed the cornerstone of a 10-year research process at Karadi Tales which led to Karadi Path. “After the research, we came to the conclusion that we should never teach a single word or a single meaning or even a single rule of grammar, if we want to teach a language. A language must be learned through prediction and discovery,” says Viswanath. This framework is what Karadi Path brings into classrooms. This approach of “don’t teach from the word up but teach from the story down” did not have many takers in the beginning. However, this methodology has had an amplified impact especially for students from rural India who are introduced to a language different from their mother tongue only through textbooks. “Here, they discover the language through stories, music, the use of body, action, theatre…,” explains Viswanath. One of the key aspects that the annual London Book Fair pointed out is Karadi Path’s access to disadvantaged sections and remote locations. Their app connects the school, students and their parents together. To minimise the digital divide during COVID-19, teachers in remote villages who own smartphones, were encouraged to teach small groups. “In parts of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, they were taught in streets and temple courtyards. We have also had teachers connecting their car speakers to the phones to make the content accessible,” adds Viswanath. Moving forward, apart from language resources, the platform hopes to concentrate on holistic learning for kindergarten and pre-kindergarten kids.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/from-the-story-down/article34774163.ece

He did not need tickets: Because this 46-year-old from India is the football team’s wellness consultant. Now, during season, he spends his days training with the team, and watching their multiple matches. “Cherai to Chelsea” is how he likes to describe his story. Incidentally, that is also the name of the biography his wife, Flomny Menon, wrote, which was published last year. “Cherai is a small village near Kochi in Kerala. Whenever I go back, I sit by the door, drink chai and look at the backwaters. That feeling of being home is wonderful,” says Vinay over a call from London. Seated on his balcony, overlooking the Thames, he narrates his story. “The only footballer I knew of was Diego Maradona,” he laughs. So, 12 years ago, when he was introduced to the team playing for Chelsea, he was not star struck despite big names like Didier Drogba being in the locker room. Vinay was working in Dubai with the Jumeirah Group, when he received an offer to join Roman Abrahamovich, owner of the the Chelsea football team, as his personal coach in London. Eventually, Vinay took on his new role with the team, also known as The Blues. The journey to Chelsea Though Vinay wanted to be a police officer, when he completed his Bachelor’s, he did not find an opening in the police force. So, he went on to pursue a Master’s in Philosophy in Physical Education at the Pondicherry University. “I also began training street children in physical education for free,” he adds. Following that he did a course in Yoga Science from Kaivalydhan Yoga Institute in Pune, before working as a senior wellness practitioner at Ananda in the Himalayas. There, not only did he discover the world of luxury wellness, he also met the most important person in his life: his wife. They moved to Dubai next. “I started something called full moon yoga. I often felt like Madonna. I would be dressed in a whitekurta, standing on a stage at the five star resort and instructing my clients,” he laughs. His current lifestyle in London is not something Vinay had ever planned or imagined. “My cousins worked in Mumbai or abroad and when they visited Cherai they spoke in English. I only spoke in Malayalam,” he says. But he always wanted to do something that brought recognition to his village, his State. “I always tried to walk a different path.” In his current role, Vinay is often a sounding board for Chelsea players. As he is “not a fan”, he can detach and critically evaluate the footballers, no matter how big a star they are. But back in Kerala, he is plain old Vinu (as he is fondly called), who walks around inchappals. “It is important to detach, especially for mental wellbeing,” says Vinay. This is his advice for the team. “If you want to perform at the peak, you have to have equilibrium.” It would then be fair to credit him for playing his part in Chelsea’s recent win at UEFA Champions League, where he admits he was overwhelmed. “I created ARFA. It stands for Awareness. Recovery. Focus. Achievement. I use this process to train players,” he says. He adds that fun is important to achieve best results. “If you are not enjoying something, you cannot be an elite performer.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-indian-in-the-army-of-stamford-bridge/article34774180.ece

When the football anthem was launched on DJ Martin Garrix’ 25th birthday on May 4, 2021, by Sony Music Netherlands, the collaboration with U2 greats, Bono and The Edge, was one of the big surprises for fans. In an email interview, Garrix reveals that as the tournament was pushed back due to the pandemic, they had to keep the secret for nearly two years. “Just being in the studio with them has been a surreal experience. Bono has such an iconic voice; I had goosebumps during the whole session. I love that they were so open-minded and involved in the creative process of the song,” he says. The EDM virtuoso rose to fame with the electronic theme titled ‘Animals’ in 2013, at the age of 17. Garrix has collaborated with Usher, Dua Lipa, Bebe Rexha, Troye Sivan and Khaled. Still, composing for an event like the EURO Championship is a special honour, he says. “My first response when UEFA reached out was disbelief, then when things were confirmed, it turned into being very nervous, but also excited and grateful that they put their trust in me.” The past year has been creatively challenging. “It was weird for me to make festival music without live shows. Normally this is the music I test at festivals, get the response, go straight back to the studio with the adrenaline and excitement from the show, polish it, and test it again.” “When we get back, the first shows will be absolutely insane. I think they’re going to be such an explosion of adrenaline, excitement, love, euphoria. It’s going to be really, really beautiful.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/at-the-top-of-his-game/article34774184.ece

Suruli [the name of his character] is one of my favourites. I have already been bugging Karthik [director Karthik Subbaraj] to write a sequel,” said Dhanush. Suruli, Dhanush said, will have some shades of Rajinikanth. “I am a huge fan of Rajini sir, and so is director Karthik. Earlier, in my films, I have made a conscious attempt to stay away from any Rajini-isms that might creep into my performances. But for Jagame Thandhiram , Karthik said, ‘Let Rajini be there.’” Dhanush is currently in the US, where he is shooting for Hollywood flick The Gray Man starring Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans. “It [ The Gray Man ] has been a huge learning opportunity. Though I had only 20 days of shoot, I had to stay for a long time because of COVID-19 protocols. I underwent one-month action training for my part. I have been here for four months now; I am really missing Chennai and home food. I hope to be back in the next two weeks.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/watch-out-for-suruli/article34774142.ece

But when he set foot in the film industry as a composer, there was little guidance. “Mentorship is important. It is a checkpoint to validate if you are going towards the right treasure,” says the musician. The Tamil film composer is looking forward to that and acquiring some new skills during his stint at the BAFTA Breakthrough Initiative. “I believe this [the programme] is more than just about enhancing core skill sets. For a successful career, it is also important to develop a few ancillary skillsets. This programme is customised based on the requirements of every honouree. So, the experience I have will be different from other honourees. I hope to find a new sound and genre, and open up a plethora of opportunities.” Most of these opportunities are coming to Murthy post his impressive work in 2019 Tamil film KD Engira Karuppudurai , directed by Madhumitha. “I was the first person to whom she [Madhmitha] narrated the storyline. I insisted that I would be part of it, whether she likes it or not,” he laughs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/karthikeya-murthy-music-composer/article34774152.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Yet another lockdown birthday?||Celebrations are hard this year, hollowed by loss. Battered by the second wave of COVID-19, it is difficult to drum up enthusiasm for locked down birthdays, anniversary dinners and Zoom parties. Yet, now more than ever, it is important to reach out. To celebrate milestones, despite the seemingly endless physical isolation of lockdown. Last year, when the pandemic began, Instagram was bright with home made meals, fuelled by energy and optimism. This year, we lean on the hospitality industry again, as they find ways to pack fuel and comfort into lunchboxes. When you don’t have the energy to orchestrate yet another virtual party, or bake a cake, here’s one more option: send a festive meal. To make it easier, popular city restaurants — also fighting to keep their doors open and staff employed — have been tweaking menus every month to continue to serve customers though an unpredictable year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/yet-another-lockdown-birthday/article34774167.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The (delivery) road not taken||“Where a consumer has a presence, a restaurant can follow. Facebook, Instagram, Google listings, WhatsApp... any of them can be worked into an ordering platform, and we are teaching restaurants how to do just that,” says tech entrepreneur Anurag Gupta. His non-aggregator platform DotPe, co-founded with Shailaz Nag and Gyanesh Sharma, has tied up with over 15,000 restaurants in 300 cities, in two years. This business is miniscule compared to giants like Swiggy and Zomato — Zomato boasted of 1.4 million active restaurants back in 2019, the year DotPe had just started out. But even as the giants continue to innovate, creating employment and providing essential delivery during lockdown, alternative food delivery platforms have been seeing a steady rise over the past two years. The commission conundrum Interestingly enough, they arrived on the scene to fill an urgent need, not of consumers, but of restaurants. Restaurateurs (as well as organisations like National Restaurants Authority of India, NRAI) have for years been seeking alternatives to mainstream aggregator apps. Statements galore have been made about how the deep discounts offered by delivery apps, combined with heavy commissions they charge, cut deep into profits of restaurants, bars and cafes, to the point of making business nearly unsustainable. While NRAI announced plans to launch its own delivery platform back in 2020, it was in May 2021 that Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association (KHRA) launched a food delivery app, Rezoy, as a response against the commission charged by larger food aggregators. “It is around 20% plus GST, which comes up to 21.5% or 22% of the bill amount. When you factor in the overheads, which include raw material cost and salaries, a restaurant owner is not left with much to run the business. Sometimes the bill amount [on a particular order] may not justify the commission. We needed to do something about it in order to continue in the business,” says Asees Moosa, Ernakulam district president of KHRA. Platforms like DotPe and Thrive, in contrast, charge anywhere between 1% to 3% commission per order, and have capped it at that. Thrive has been another popular option for individual restaurants in metro cities. Launched in October 2020 with one restaurant partner in Mumbai, Thrive built its base to 1,500 restaurants by February 2021. “That is when we launched our 2.0 version, which has helped double our count in the last two months alone. We now have over 3,000 restaurants on board,” says co-founder Dhruv Dewan. Dhruv does not see Thrive as an alternative to Swiggy or Zomato. “I think in the near future, direct-to-customer platforms and aggregators will coexist,” he says, “But for anyone building a business from scratch, a direct-to-customer option makes more sense than an aggregator.” A key reason why certain restaurants choose Thrive over Zomato or Swiggy, is access to consumer data. As Gauri Devidayal of The Table, Mumbai puts it, “It is very difficult to run a business online if you don’t know who your consumer is, which dish they prefer and why, what problems they had with a particular order.” Thrive gives its restaurant partner ownership over such data. “The data is hosted on our servers, because it isn’t feasible to have a separate server for each restaurant. But the data rests contractually with each restaurant, and they have full access to it. According to the terms and conditions, we [Thrive] can’t give a restaurant’s consumption data to anyone else. We can only use it to improve our operations, like keeping track of payment hiccups,” says Dhruv. Asees explains how hotels are encouraged by aggregators to have different prices — for online and offline orders. “Prices [on the online menu] and portion sizes are ‘adjusted’ in a way that justifies the commission they pay to the aggregators, some make extra too. So who gets the raw deal in the end? Our aim [with Rezoy] is that all stakeholders benefit, not just us,” he adds. The menu uploaded by the restaurant on Rezoy has to be the one displayed at the hotel. If there is malpractice then action is taken against the hotel — they are removed if they refuse to comply. “This is a reason why a few hotels are not keen on being on the app as they are used to the extra profit,” says Asees. Last-mile delivery is another factor where today’s giants appear to have an advantage; a restaurant needs a dependable delivery fleet, one that knows its city’s lanes and bylanes, shortcuts and detours. DotPe and Thrive address this with a hybrid model. As Anurag points out, “The last-mile delivery problem has already been solved by others — by Shadowfax, Rapido and Dunzo. We have tied up with them; restaurants have the option of using their own staff for delivery, these third-party teams, or a mix of the two.” Thrive’s model is similar. Riyaaz Amlani’s Impressario Handmade restaurants — the firm behind Social — recently snagged a headline-grabbing tie-up: Mumbai’s dabbawalas now deliver his restaurants orders to homes across the metropolis.  Learning curve  Innovating is one thing, getting smaller and newer restaurants to understand the nitty-gritties of online operations in the midst of a pandemic is another. NRAI has been conducting bootcamps to familiarise restaurants with DotPe’s system in multiple cities. In Mumbai, the gastropub London Taxi co-founded by Dhaval Udeshi and NRAI member Pawan Shahri, has doubled up as an incubator programme. Dhaval says, “This is the first time that a restaurant is opening up its kitchen to become an incubator for home delivery. There is no doubt about the adverse effect of the pandemic on India’s F&B segment, especially small business owners. Newer companies who want to start their own brand in the food business need SEO (search engine optimisation) to acquire direct customers. To make a business survive on its own it takes a good couple of months.” Dhaval says that partnering with known brands is one definite way forward, keeping in mind the importance of SEO in reaching end-customers online. “We have redone our entire marketing strategy towards online delivery, and have partnered with DotPe for the same,” he says. It appears to be a case of multiple Davids banding against a few Goliaths, in a tussle that promises to be fascinating, and ultimately rewarding for customers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-delivery-road-not-taken/article34774853.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Back to school at||“My name is Hangmila Jamang and I am 70... I am 79 years old,” narrates Hangmila Jamang with the cadence of a kindergartener, as she looks up from drawing water pots on her sketchpad. It is Art class today at Oasis Academy in Chatric Khullen in Kamjong district of Manipur. Even as children across India spend their time on online classes, for the elders of this village of 100-households, lockdown has meant a return to physical schools after decades. Leading this project is Sorinthan Haorei, founder of Gemson Haorei, an organisation named after his father. In February this year, the 28-year-old founded Oasis Academy for children up to Class VII, and in May, opened it up to 15 adult learners as well. His grandmother, Shoknaola Hungyo (70), is one of his students. They are learning numericals from one to 1,000, alphabets, and how to write their own names. For many of the elders, the upcoming exam will be the first one of their lives. “Most of the elders here did not receive basic education when they were young. The highest one of them had studied up to was Class IV,” says Sorinthan. But education was not the only reason this school was set up: “They (the elders) are involved in agricultural activities and most live away from their families. So another reason we took this up was to provide a platform for socialisation, to keep their mental health up in times like these,” he adds. In October 2020 that Sorinthan shifted base to his native village from Delhi where he got his Masters in Public Administration at IGNOU. “We returned due to the pandemic. On speaking to other people here, we realised that so many other children too had returned and were unable to go back to towns and cities to study. Which is why my mother and I came up with the idea of starting a school in the village itself,” he says. He turned his parents’ ancestral home into a school for children, and set their curriculum according to the Board of Secondary Education, Manipur. In 2019, he organised the first district-level literary meet in Kanjong, hosting a quiz, debate and spelling bee. The teachers at his school are not ‘trained’, he confesses — it is just him and his mother. But the organisation is looking for sponsors to employ teachers, or teachers from neighbouring towns to volunteer. For the elders, he and the other villagers together constructed bamboo sheds outside the main building. “We teach them to read the hymns at church. In due course, they will also be able to write letters to their sons and daughters.” Sorinthan moved out of his hometown in Ukhrul, when he was 16, in pursuit of higher education. However, every Christmas and New Year, it was a family tradition to visit his grandmother in Chatric Khullen. “We had to take a day bus from Ukhrul which dropped us off 40 kilometres from Chatric. So the next day, we would travel by foot, and reach the village around 4-5 pm,” he says. He recalls crossing a shabby bridge made of rope and chopped bamboo. “When I was young, elders would carry me on their backs, because the path was slippery.” He is now back at the same village, teaching his grandmother English. “My grandson is a good teacher,” says Shoknaola. “Once I am able to sign my name, collecting my late husband’s pension at the bank will become easier,” she adds.  Sorinthan Haorei founded Oasis Academy for children and later opened it up to adults||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/back-to-school-at/article34774848.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Fighting the good fight||An isolated elderly patient with the Minamata disease lying on a hospital bed with ventilator support, is the opening scene of Minamata Mandala (2020). A sprawling six-hour-long documentary by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Kazuo Hara, it is both a humane story and a deeply political film, that exposes the Japanese government’s incompetence in handling the epidemic and painstakingly captures the decades-long legal and medical battle of the residents of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan. Having filmed the documentary across a span of 15 years, Hara says the idea originated in his mind sometime during the early ‘90s when the momentum around Minamata died down. The epidemic had forced an exodus among residents of Minamata to other cities in search of jobs. He came across one such: a fisherman, who moved to Osaka where they were discussing the impact the disease had on his life. There was anger among people and agitations led by Civil Action Groups, one of the representatives being a university professor, also an acquaintance of Hara. He suggested that the filmmaker make a documentary on Minamata; Hara says he postponed agreeing to it for a year, for he felt the subject was not his territory. Connecting over a video call from his residence at Shinjuku, Japan, Hara, joined by a translator, says, “Noriaki Tsuchimoto’s documentary had a profound impact on me and he was already following up on the case. I even tried meeting him, but they wouldn’t let me because he was in a hospital. I never had a chance to ask him, but in a way, I inherited what he started.” The filming for the documentary began in 2001 and roughly ended in 2015-16. Split into three parts with two intervals, Hara takes a matter-of-fact approach to the 372-minute documentary, bringing out a series of first-person interviews with patients, medical researchers and academics who were involved in the study, and the plaintiffs. Though its runtime may seem laboriously endless, the larger point of the documentary was to give the audience a taste of the long road it takes for justice and hence, the film’s runtime, though justifiable, seemed like it was intended to honour the memories of the people featured. Hara has not just invested a stupendous amount of time, but has also sacrificed 15 years of his life to realise this documentary. While admitting that he has changed as a person over the years, Hara says it has been a journey of self-discovery going as far back as the time he made The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On (1987), one of his most famous works, to draw a parallel to his older self. The protagonist of that film was a determined individual who took on the government single-handedly. “I realise now it is not about an individual but about the fighting spirit of the everyday people.” Minamata Mandala was screened at the recently-concluded International Film Festival Rotterdam 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/fighting-the-good-fight/article34774854.ece

Spaces also helped put some focus on my art because I thought: Have people forgotten that I am a singer? ” If you drop by Chinmayi’s residence in Chennai, you will probably see her playing with her dogs and humming a tune. It might be a raga or alaap , or a tune from one of her superhits. It is this side of the singer that fans have lately been introduced to in her recent packed, Twitter Spaces outings, one of which spilled over to the wee hours of the following day. However, the ones that won the most hearts were her concert with composer Govind Vasantha and her rendition of ‘80s hits, a tribute to Ilaiyaraaja who turned 78 recently. In some of her Spaces, Chinmayi showcased her vocal prowess, thus leading to comments among Twitterati, many of whom said the music “healed them in tough times”. She also takes on impromptu requests, to the delight of her fans. “I had a great time performing,” she says. Also trending on social media in recent times was the hashtag #WeWantChinmayiBack, indicating that listeners wanted to hear more of her in films. “That was absolutely touching, but how much of this will have a change in ground reality is to be seen,” says the singer, who mentions that Govind Vasantha and Nivas Prasanna are among her closest friends in the music industry. Chinmayi, however, is not much of a music listener herself. “I don’t listen to music for relaxation or fun. For me, music is an all-consuming exercise; I cannot relax when it plays in the background. That’s why when I drive, I do not have music playing,” says the musician, whose playback singing career kickstarted with the hit ‘Oru Deivam’ song in Mani Ratnam’s Kannathil Muthamittal (2002). Since then, she has sung over 1,000 songs in various languages. She states that her film offers have dried up since her involvement with the #MeToo movement, which began in 2018, but there are still a few tracks on the cards. “I sang a solo Malayalam song for AR Rahman for the Prithviraj project ( Aadujeevitham ) four years ago. I am not sure of its status now. I have sung a few upcoming tracks in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam but nothing in Tamil.” So, what’s next? At the moment, Chinmayi is making sure she is heard on social media. She has been a part of two Clubhouse events discussing cinema. Also on the cards is a Twitter Spaces dedicated exclusively to ghazals , which she is planning to schedule in the next few days. “I speak about issues that need to be flagged, but people think I am into full-time activism,” she says, discussing the surge of support from listeners on Twitter Spaces. She adds. “These recent conversations helped changed that notion.”  For me, music is an all-consuming exercise.

Still, composing for an event like the EURO Championship is a special honour, he says. “My first response when UEFA reached out was disbelief, then when things were confirmed, it turned into being very nervous, but also excited and grateful that they put their trust in me.” The past year has been creatively challenging. “It was weird for me to make festival music without live shows. Normally this is the music I test at festivals, get the response, go straight back to the studio with the adrenaline and excitement from the show, polish it, and test it again.” “When we get back, the first shows will be absolutely insane. I think they’re going to be such an explosion of adrenaline, excitement, love, euphoria. It’s going to be really, really beautiful.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/at-the-top-of-his-game/article34774852.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Dorje spills||Despite the thunder, lightning and patchy phone connection, Sparsh Agarwal is undeterred. He bounces around his home at the Selim Hill tea estate in Darjeeling, recently renamed ‘Second Chance’ by his mother, in search of a better phone signal each time this interview is stalled by the storm. It is this cheery resilience that could give Darjeeling’s celebrated, but now struggling, tea estates a second chance to shine. But first, an experiment, which begins with an annual subscription plan that launches tomorrow, needs to go according to plan. “When Darjeeling tea is the pride of India, why are most of the 87 estates barely breaking even, some on the brink of collapse?” asks Sparsh, adding that the romance of this “champagne of teas” has drawn buyers from across the world, for two centuries. Over the past decade, however, a declining export market, climate change and now the pandemic are threatening the survival of many of the estates, which in turn threatens all that is special about Darjeeling. “The Selim Hill tea garden has been under my family’s stewardship for four generations, since 1871. Half of it is under forest cover, home to everything from hornbills to elephants,” says Sparsh. “We do not want to sell because we need to protect this ecology. But we needed to find a way to support the estate.” After a year of field research, Sparsh, who was working with the Centre for Policy Research, and his business partner Ishaan Kanoria, an investment banker, decided to quit their jobs and launch Dorje Tea, an innovative and sustainable model that re-introduces Darjeeling tea, embracing all its quirks, to an Indian audience, instead of exporting it piecemeal. Their mentor is the legendary Rajah Banerjee, whose family ran Makaibari tea estate for four generations before he recently moved on. A trailblazer, he created an organic oasis at Makaibari, inspiring other estates to follow suit, Rajah is a powerful influence in Darjeeling, and an ambassador for its tea. Seasonal moods Grown with a Chinese cultivar, Darjeeling tea captivated international buyers with its potent aroma and unique muscatel flavour, a pleasing sweetness with musky, spiced undertones. “However it never focussed on the domestic market and is seen as unaffordable,” says Sparsh, explaining why: “There are four seasonal flushes. While the first and second, which are spring and summer, are sold at premium, there isn’t a market for monsoon and autumn flush teas — though each has a unique taste, aroma and liquoring, which is additionally influenced by terroir.” Popular in Europe, America and Britain particularly, the spring and summer flush get exported at heady prices, while the monsoon and autumn flush are undervalued. Since the best tea is exported, and profits ride on sales of just the spring and summer flushes, often estates barely break even, says Sparsh. “The flush system is unique to Darjeeling and adds to the romance of our teas. Customers should be having all four. The biggest mistake is thinking there is a hierarchy.” There is another catch. “International clients want the whole leaf grade, so the tea is machine sorted. For one kilo of tea, only 30% is whole leaf, which means that the rest sells at a loss,” says Sparsh. “But, in the inconsistencies lie the charm of the product.” Stating that he is fundamentally against the export market, which buys relatively small quantities, and “destroys the harvest for rest of the year,” Sparsh says Dorje will be reaching out to Indian buyers with a subscription plan. “For an annual subscription of Rs. 2,100 per kg, we will send tea from each flush to customers through the year.” Since all flushes will be equally celebrated, without being wastefully broken up and graded, pricing is competitive, enabling customers to drink this champagne of teas everyday. Sparsh and his family are launching the Selim Hill Collective, helmed by Rajah Banerjee, to focus on the non-commercial rejuvenation of the tea garden, starting with a reforestation campaign. “Even as we work on getting the commercial part right, we want to focus on community welfare and wild life conservation,” says Sparsh, adding, “Within this crisis, there is opportunity.”  To order log on to dorjeteas.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dorje-spills/article34774851.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||11 held for duping 5L investors of Rs. 150 crore via mobile apps||Delhi Police Cyber Cell has arrested 11 men, including two chartered accountants, for allegedly cheating more than 5 lakh people of over Rs. 150 crore in two months on the pretext of lucrative returns via apps, the police said on Wednesday. A total of Rs. 11 crore of the cheated money has been blocked in various bank accounts and payment gateways, the police said. The police took notice of various posts on social media by people across the country about two mobile applications — Power Bank and EZPlan. These apps offered lucrative returns on investment, a senior police officer said. The Power Bank App projected itself as a Bengaluru-based start-up, but its server was found based in China. The apps, in order to entice large number of people to invest more and more money, initially gave a small payout amounting to 5% to 10% of the invested money, the police said. People, believing the scheme to be genuine, started investing more money as well as circulating and sharing the app among their friends and relatives. Shell companies “The police invested a token amount in the app and the money trail was followed. It was found that the accused persons had created a web of around 25 shell companies for routing the fraud money. These companies were located in different parts of the country and money was being moved from one account to the other to hide the trail,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber Cell) Anyesh Roy said. The police analysed the mobile numbers connected with the bank accounts and found that one of accused Sheikh Robin was in Uluberia, West Bengal. On June 2, raids were conducted at multiple locations. Robin was arrested. At the same time, nine others were arrested from Delhi-NCR, including two CAs — Avik Kedia and Ronak Bansal, the DCP said. The CAs created over 110 shell companies and sold these companies to Chinese nationals for Rs. 2-Rs. 3 lakh each, the police said. Robin, who was contacted by the Chinese national through Telegram, initially opened a bank account for these fraudsters, but later started acting as an operative, Mr. Roy said, adding that at the time of the arrest, he was operating around 29 bank accounts. The main Chinese handlers behind this massive scam, used to randomly contact people over various apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram and hired those interested as partners. Names of several Chinese nationals have been revealed so far. Investigation about their whereabouts, specific roles and their large fraud network is under way, the police said.  The police invested a token amount in the app and the money trail was followed.

10 June 2021||Chandigarh,||Cong. hits out at Haryana govt. over new rules for tube-wells||The Haryana government’s new policy for allotment of new tube-well connections for irrigating fields in the northern and southern parts of the State has come under severe criticism from the Opposition Congress. Hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party (BJP-JJP) government, Congress’ national general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said that on May 1, 2021, a new policy for providing tube-well connections was issued by power companies in Haryana. “As per this policy aimed at snatching the livelihood of the son of the soil, if the farmer’s land comes under the canal command area, then no tube-well connection will be allotted to him,” he alleged. “In the face of this grossly anti-farmer policy, tube-well connections will no longer be sanctioned in Ambala, Yamuna Nagar, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat, Kaithal, Jind, Hisar, Fatehabad, Bhiwani, Dadri, Narnaul, Mahendragarh, Mewat, Gurgaon etc. because in these districts, 80-90% of the area comes under the flow or lift command area of canal irrigation,” said Mr. Surjewala, adding that the farmers of northern and southern Haryana would be most affected by the order. Also, a condition included in the policy says tube-well motors of over 30 BHP (brake horse power) would not be sanctioned in future. They are completely banned. In the whole of southern Haryana and in the whole of Ahirwal, especially in Bhiwani, Dadri, Mahendragarh, Rewari, Mewat and Gurgaon, the groundwater table is so low that most motors are of 40-50 BHP. “This order means that now onwards no farmer will be sanctioned a tube-well connection in southern Haryana,” he added.  ‘Govt. should apologise’ Mr. Surjewala said the State government should immediately withdraw the policy and apologise to the farmers of the State for their anti-farmer stance. Former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the government should plan to provide relief to farmers instead of experimenting with policies during the COVID-19 pandemic.  ‘Farmers left clueless’ “It is being reported that connections will be given only to those farmers who get a ‘no objection certificate’ from the Irrigation Department. In such a situation, farmers who deposited the security [amount] many years ago are left clueless and wondering what to do next,” he said. “The government is changing the rules and standards time and again to thwart them [the farmers]. Sometimes the standards of electric motors are changed while at other times, rules on ground water level are changed. Farmers do not even have the freedom to take the motor of their choice,” Mr. Hooda said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-hits-out-at-haryana-govt-over-new-rules-for-tube-wells/article34774845.ece
10 June 2021||New Delhi,||Inoculation drive for 18-44 age group restarts at govt. centres||The Capital has received 1.25 lakh doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin vaccines for 18-44 age group, and the youth can now get vaccinated for free at government centres, AAP leader Atishi said on Wednesday. “Many people between 18-44 years had been administered the first dose but were unable to get the second dose. Now, Covaxin is available and people can get the second dose,” the AAP leader said. Ms. Atishi said that private hospitals were administering the vaccines at “exorbitant costs” and now vaccines are available at government centres free of cost. The Delhi government spokesperson said that after the arrival of the Covishield vaccine doses, booking for the first dose of 18-44 age group will restart from Wednesday. “From today [Wednesday], booking for the first dose of Covishield for 18-44 will restart on the CoWIN platform,” the spokesperson said. There was no stock of Covishield for 18-44 years in government facilities for the past many days and Covaxin was being given only for second dose. So, there was no free first dose for the age group. Ms. Atishi said that the total tally of vaccines administered in Delhi has reached over 57 lakh, and 13 lakh people have been administered both the doses. She also said that the government has received Covaxin for people of 45 years of age and above. “On Tuesday, we had said that the stock of Covaxin is over in Delhi and it was unavailable for the 45+ age group people at many centres. Yesterday, late in the evening, Delhi received 30,000 doses of Covaxin and they are being distributed to different centres. So, from Thursday, doses of Covaxin will be available for those above the age of 45 years,” Ms. Atishi said. Over 300 new cases The Capital reported 337 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, taking the total cases to 14,30,128, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Wednesday.

10 June 2021||New Delhi,||Replicate electoral machinery for vaccination: CM||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the entire population of India could be vaccinated within two to three months if the country’s electoral structure was utilised to reach out to residents for the purpose, just like the Delhi government was doing through the ‘Jahan Vote, Wahan Vaccination’ programme. The Chief Minister made the observation during his visit to a vaccination centre at Rajkiya Sarvodaya Vidyalaya on Lancer Road which is part ofthe Delhi government initiative which, he said, had received a “thunderous response”. “We were observing that not many people were turning up to the vaccination centres across Delhi. We thought that we had to invite people from their homes and spread awareness. So, this is a new initiative that you get vaccinated where you vote. In every Vidhan Sabha, the electoral machinery is very elaborate,” he said.  Booth-level officers “Just the way, booth-level officers go to houses to give election chits before the polls and inform people about the date and other details of the election, BLOs are going to the house of each and every person and giving slots for vaccination,” he said. Mr. Kejriwal said that a few beneficiaries who had come to the centre for vaccination, under the programme, told him that they were “very happy” with the arrangement. The BLOs, while visiting the homes of residents, were also removing any apprehensions that they may have regarding the vaccination. If, despite this, beneficiaries did not turn up, the BLOs would visit them once more to counsel them again. 45+ age group Under the initiative, he said, the Delhi government aimed to ensure that all residents above 45 years were vaccinated within four weeks and, if the Delhi government had adequate doses for the 18-44 age group, residents in this category too could be vaccinated the same way. ‘Can cover entire nation’ “We have an extraordinary administrative structure and electoral framework, if we are to use that then we can vaccinate the entire country in 2-3 months,” he said. “It is a very good thing that starting June 21, the Central government is going to provide us with the vaccines. So, if we get the vaccines, then we will start vaccinating everyone under this scheme,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/replicate-electoral-machinery-for-vaccination-cm/article34774395.ece

10 June 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi govt.’s home isolation model flawed: BJP||The BJP on Wednesday alleged that the Delhi government had “wrongly advised” self-isolation to residents suffering from COVID-19 to hide shortcomings in the government health infrastructure. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said 70% of the houses in Delhi measured less than 100 square yards with many occupants. “If they had been admitted to hospitals in the initial stages of infection, the COVID death rate could have been much less,” he said. “It is a crime by the Delhi government to force people to go for home isolation…the death rate per 10 lakh is maximum in Delhi and could have been much less,” Mr. Gupta alleged. Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said during the first wave, temporary COVID care centres were set up and later disbanded as the AAP government had no foresight to see another wave. Oxygen plants “Testing and vaccinations centres could have been started at mohalla clinics or these could have served as isolation centres if they were in proper shape,” he alleged. BJP Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta said, in April, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced setting up of 44 oxygen plants before May 31, but only nine plants had been operationalised till then. “We cannot afford to lose more lives because we were caught unprepared. The Delhi government must ramp up healthcare infrastructure,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-govts-home-isolation-model-flawed-bjp/article34774389.ece
10 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Training for teachers to reconnect with students’||To help teachers reconnect with their students before schools reopen for academic learning, the Delhi government will organise a training programme to help them deal with the fallout of the pandemic. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said that the pandemic has given us the opportunity to reimagine schooling and adapt to the new emerging realities. He was speaking at the inaugural workshop being organised by the Guerrand-Hermès Foundation for Peace (GHFP) for Delhi government teachers. Creating a space “Our teachers and students have gone through a lot of pain during the time of pandemic; we want to support them in overcoming the grief. We want to create a space for our teachers and their students for sharing, listening and a meaningful dialogue before resumption of teaching-learning activities,” Mr. Sisodia said. He added that school reopening is not just about opening books; it’s about opening the heart and mind to reconnect with each other. He stressed on the importance of teachers preparing themselves to counsel their students, support them if they are facing any challenges and help them to a stage where they are ready to resume teaching-learning activities. As a first step of the collaboration with the GHFP, a team of experts will conduct three days’ session with a small group of mentor teachers of the Delhi government. Mentor teachers Thereafter, the mentor teachers will conduct similar sessions with two teachers of each school. These two teachers will then help the fellow teachers in their own schools to initiate dialogue with their students and parents, if needed, the Delhi government said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/training-for-teachers-to-reconnect-with-students/article34774398.ece
10 June 2021||Jaipur,||‘Give incentives to counter jab hesitancy’||Health activists attached to Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA) here on Wednesday called for providing incentives to counter COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the rural areas, while affirming that it would help accelerate the pace of vaccination among the villagers who were reluctant to get the jab because of lack of knowledge or out of suspicion. The JSA, which functions as the Rajasthan chapter of the People’s Health Movement, said the incentives could be in the form of additional ration from the public distribution system, extra days of MGNREGA work, such as 150 days of guaranteed wage employment instead of 100 days in a financial year and hot cooked meals or additional ration to pregnant and lactating women from Anganwadis. Chhaya Pachauli, director of the voluntary group Prayas, said the reports had been received from some districts about the rural population being coerced by the administration to get vaccinated with the threat that they would not be given ration or MGNREGA wages if they did not get inoculated.  Violation of right to food “This is not only exploitative but also amounts to sheer violation of people’s right to food and employment,” she said. The JSA felt that the government should instead focus on the measures which aimed at educating the people about vaccines and dispelling their myths and fears. The provision for incentivising the people could motivate those who were reluctant to reconsider the option of getting vaccinated and push them to make up their minds quickly, said Ms. Pachauli, adding that such an approach could help increase the vaccination rate and reduce the waste of vials. The JSA has shot off letters with these suggestions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Medical and Health Minister Raghu Sharma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/give-incentives-to-counter-jab-hesitancy/article34774842.ece
10 June 2021||Patna,||BJP, JD(U) spar over blast at madrasa||A day after a powerful explosion in a madrasa in Bihar’s Banka district, ruling NDA alliance partners in the State, the BJP and the JD(U), on Wednesday came face to face on the incident. Police suspect an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) might have caused the blast. Demanding that such educational institutions be banned across the State, BJP MLA from Bisfi in Madhubani district, Hari Bhushan Thakur, said, “In madrasas and mosques in Bihar, education of terrorism is being given. Training to make bombs and to incite violence is given in madrasas. Children should be taken out from madrasas and given common education.” Probe demanded Mr. Thakur, in a video post, added, “The minority community in Bihar has been harassing Dalits. Incidents of Jamui, Gopalganj and Purnia are examples. I want a thorough investigation into the incident to ascertain under what circumstances the explosion took place.” JD(U) leader and party MLC Gulam Rasool Balyawi criticised the BJP MLA’s comment. He said, “Those making such comments should be sent to mental asylum.” “During the election, the BJP men do not see mosques and madrasas but soon after winning they come to their real agenda,” Mr. Balyawi said. On Tuesday, a powerful explosion took place in a madrasa near a mosque in Chamreli Navtolia village under the Banka town police station limits. The madrasa building collapsed and the Imam, Abdul Sattar Mobin, was killed in the explosion. The adjacent mosque was badly damaged. Due to the lockdown, the madrasa was non-functional and it is believed that the Imam was the sole resident. However, after the explosion, residents of the village left the place, leaving behind women and the elderly. The district police, probing the blast, suspected use of IED. “We are collecting details and a FSL team too has reached the spot,” Bhagalpur zone DIG Sujeet Kumar said. District Superintendent of Police Arvind Kumar Gupta said, “It was a powerful blast.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-jdu-spar-over-blast-at-madrasa/article34774386.ece

The State government on Wednesday notified Dihing Patkai as a National Park, four days after creating the 422-sq. km Raimona National Park in western Assam’s Kokrajhar district. The five older National Parks in the State are Kaziranga, Manas, Nameri, Orang and Dibru-Saikhowa. Kaziranga and Manas are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. They are also tiger reserves along with Nameri and Orang. The 234.26-sq. km Dihing Patkai straddling eastern Assam’s Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts is a major elephant habitat and 310 species of butterflies have been recorded there. The park has 47 species each of reptiles and mammals, including the tiger and clouded leopard. Illegal coal mining Dihing Patkai, in focus a year ago for illegal coal mining in the vicinity, encompasses the erstwhile Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary, the Jeypore Reserve Forest and the western block of the Upper Dihing Reserve Forest. “The forest village area diverted under Forest Conservation Act has been excluded. Short stretches of the Dirak and Buri Dihing rivers have been included in the park,” State Environment and Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya said. The newly notified National Park will be administered by the Soraipung Range of Digboi Forest Division and Jeypore Range of Dibrugarh Forest Division. Additional anti-poaching camps and manpower are being provided, the Minister said. Raimona, on the other hand, will be administered by the Kachugaon Forest Division of the BTC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dihing-patkai-is-assams-7th-national-park/article34774384.ece

10 June 2021||New Delhi,||AAP accuses BJP leaders of corruption||The Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday alleged that South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s BJP councillors and Mayor are involved in corruption. AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that the BJP-led municipal corporation is appointing members who have been involved in corruption as Mayor and Leader of the House. “Within just two years, Indrajit Sehrawat (Leader of the House of SDMC) has doubled the cash and tripled the property. Mukesh Suryan [Mayor of SDMC] had tendered an unconditional apology in the Supreme Court for misbehaving and threatening the officials,” Mr. Bhardwaj claimed, adding that the BJP is working persistently to loot as much as Delhi can be looted before the next elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aap-accuses-bjp-leaders-of-corruption/article34774387.ece

Dr. Sarma was sworn in as the 15th Chief Minister of the State on May 10, replacing Sarbananda Sonowal in the second successive BJP-led government.  ‘Best performance’ “Assam’s performance on the COVID-19 front has been one of the best in India with more than 40 lakh people vaccinated, hospitals ramped up and oxygen supply assured. We have also initiated the process of providing Rs. 3,500 a month to children orphaned by the coronavirus,” Water Resources Minister and government spokesperson Pijush Hazarika said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/tea-wage-hike-marks-a-month-of-assam-govt/article34774839.ece
10 June 2021||June 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Swara Bhaskar: artiste, LGBTQI+ ally, activist||One of Swara Bhaskar’s earliest memories of same sex relationships is from her days at Miranda College, New Delhi. “My best friend came out to me. I have witnessed his struggles in the years since. From the time I understood same sex relationships, I have been okay with it. It’s someone’s personal choice, so I don’t get why anyone should have a problem. Someone’s life is not a community participation project,” she says, displaying her scathing humour in a recent late night telephone chat. The 33-year-old’s new short film, Sheer Qorma , directed by Faraz Arif Ansari, is a tender love story between a woman (Bhaskar) and a non-binary person (Divya Dutta), who returns to India to meet their mother (Shabana Azmi). “It’s an interesting film because it tells the story of the LGBTQI+ community. Gender fluidity is not something that all of us are necessarily familiar with. Even I wasn’t entirely clear about what it meant when I did the film,” she explains. “Both the women are Muslim, both are lesbians. This film is very specific to the communities that are under-represented in our society.” But, at its core, she says the film has a universal emotional appeal (as does her second short, Dobara Alvida , which is about the “emotions one tries to hide when a relationship is over”). “You don’t have to be an LGBTQI+ person or ally to empathise or understand children feeling misunderstood by their parents, and parents struggling to accept the choices of their children.” It is only fitting that Sheer Qorma has started its film festival journey this month — celebrated as Pride Month all over the world — with a screening at the Frameline Festival in San Francisco.  Sheer Qorma locates itself quite comfortably within Bhaskar’s very versatile and, at times, risky choices as an actor. Her first film, Niyati , never saw the light of day and she had almost packed her bags when Tanu Weds Manu (2011) came her way. She shone once again as the heroine’s friend in Raanjhanna (2013), but it was the sole leads of Nil Battey Sannata (2016) and Anarkali of Aarah (2017) that really cemented her credentials. Her last big screen release was the sequin-fest, Veere Di Wedding (2018). Last year she had three OTT outings, with Flesh (Eros Now), Rasbhari (Amazon Prime), and Bhaag Beanie Bhaag (Netflix). “More than Bollywood” is what her Twitter bio reads, and it is accurate. In a parallel life, this JNU alumna with a Masters degree in sociology is at ease taking on trolls online and making speeches at on-ground protests against some of the present government’s most oppressive policies. She has a voice and is not afraid to use it. “If I wasn’t an actor, I would have been an activist, working at some NGO,” she says. The actor chats about the price she pays for her outspokenness, the direction she wants her career to take, and why she doesn’t like the ‘activist’ tag. What does it mean to you to be an LGBTQI+ ally? One of the important aspects of being an ally is to actually listen to the people from that community and learn from their lived experiences. When it comes to posting anything publicly, I always check with activists I know. Recently, I was tracking a debate about being outside the LGBTQI+ community and using the Rainbow flag, and if it is appropriation. Another time, I wanted to post a photo of myself in a pista-coloured lehenga on Instagram with the caption Tutti-frutti, and I checked with them if it is offensive. I always assume that I don’t know enough. While we have had a few films about same sex relationships, we are quite behind in our film industry. When there is diversity behind the camera, there will be diversity in the stories we see. This is not just true for LGBTQI+ stories, but also women, differently-abled, or Dalit stories. I am not making any value judgements, but compare a Gauri Shinde or Alankrita Shrivastava’s female protagonists with Madhur Bhandarkar’s and you’ll notice how different they are. You can see how a same sex story is handled in Onir’s film as compared to the more stereotypical lens of the ‘masala’ directors. People tell stories of their own lives and experiences. If we want our popular culture to be more inclusive, we just have to make sure that we have people from underrepresented categories behind the camera.  You have always been vocal with your opinions. But have you been more involved in social causes in the last few years [starting with the CAA-NRC protests]?  When I am called an activist, I feel like a bit of an imposter. I know real activists, and I know the everyday, grassroots kind of work that they put in and the lives they lead. I am a Bollywood actor who is trying to make more money, get famous, buy a bigger car. But yes, there is a side of me that is very involved and interested in what’s happening in the world. And that’s not something new. I have done it since college. What is new, however, is that now people recognise me at protests, and ask me to come and speak. You have often talked about how your activism has affected your acting career. Has it become better or worse?  What has gotten better is I’m not the only person who is vocal now. Ever since the CAA-NRC protests, I’m not the only person from the film industry who is speaking up. Having said that, I know that more and more people are getting nervous to cast me. They’re scared of controversy. There’s a lot of talk that ‘Swara is trouble’. Every producer that I’ve worked with since 2015 is concerned about my Twitter account. What’s different now, though, is that I’ve accepted it. I don’t care. Your last feature film wasVeere Di Wedding, a little over three years ago. Doesn’t that worry you? I’ve also had five releases on the web in that time. The industry is changing with different platforms that have come up and these are offering newer kinds of work. Also, of the three years, we’ve spent the last one in a pandemic. Of course, I’ve been concerned when I’ve lost brand work or when controversies [get attached] to my films. Every time something crops up, the right-wing social media will start a boycott Swara’s film or brand campaign. So, brands are scared to approach me unless it’s Women’s Day; then they want a strong, independent woman. It’s a negotiation. I’m old enough to understand that I chose a path and there is a price to pay. You have been writing scripts. Is that the direction you want your career to move towards? I’ve actually written two stories already and I’m struggling with a third. One is a very intense love story with a lot of angst, and the other is a happier film about friendship and a very messed up girl. So that’s more autobiographical. I want to write more and, hopefully, be able to produce it. But I don’t want to give up acting because I am still a vain and self-obsessed actor [please add that I am being self-deprecating so people don’t think I am an idiot!]||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/swara-bhaskar-artiste-lgbtqi-ally-activist/article34774451.ece
