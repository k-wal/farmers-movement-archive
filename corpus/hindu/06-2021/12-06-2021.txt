12 June 2021||Kolkata,||Mukul Roy rejoins Trinamool||The repercussions of the BJP’s comprehensive defeat in the West Bengal Assembly poll continued more than a month after the results were declared, with party vice-president Mukul Roy on Friday returning to the Trinamool Congress. One of the founding members of the party, Mr. Roy had switched to the BJP in November 2017. Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee and party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee were at the party headquarters to welcome Mr. Roy, 67. An effusive Mr. Roy described Ms. Banerjee “as a leader of the entire country”. He said he was feeling relieved after quitting the BJP. “I feel glad to meet all the old faces again… I feel that Bengal will return to its old position of prestige, and the person who will lead Bengal to that position, she is the leader of all of us, the leader of India, none other than Mamata Banerjee,” he said. In the present circumstances, no one can stay in the BJP in Bengal, he added. Ms. Banerjee, in turn, described Mr. Roy as an “old family member” and added that “old is always gold”. “Mukul is an old member of our family. I feel that upon coming back he has got some mental relief. I saw his health was deteriorating and he was perhaps unable to express that. It is not possible to work in the BJP. The BJP is such an authoritarian party; it is so cruel that they do not allow anybody to exist with dignity. Mukul’s return proves just that,” Ms. Banerjee said. Pointing that she “never had any difference of opinion with Mukul” and “Mukul did not say anything against our party”, the Chief Minister alleged that the former Railway Minister “was intimidated, threatened... agencies were brandished to harass him”. Ms. Banerjee added that many more leaders from the BJP may join Trinamool.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mukul-roy-rejoins-trinamool/article34793831.ece
12 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||State preparing for third wave of COVID: Pinarayi||The State is undertaking a large-scale infrastructure upgradation and strengthening of the health system on a war footing to prepare itself, should there be a third wave of COVID-19, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Friday. Talking to mediapersons, he said that while there seemed to be a lot of anxiety amongst the public about a possible third wave and that children were likely to be affected more, there was no basis for this fear. The State was preparing ahead, building isolation wards in all health-care institutions right from community health centres and up, special isolation blocks in the Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram government medical college hospitals, and strengthening paediatric care facilities and paediatric ICUs in all districts. This large-scale infrastructure improvement was being looked upon as a long-term investment by the government, Mr.Vijayan, added. Kerala was also monitoring new COVID cases and focussing on surveillance studies to detect if any new mutant virus variants were emerging in any part of the State. The State’s strategy was to extend the interval between the end of the second wave and the beginning of a possible third wave, so that the State will get ample time for preparing the health system. He said that going by the experience of other nations, the U.K. got two months before the third wave, Italy, 17 weeks while the U.S. got 23 weeks time Vaccination Kerala has administered at least one dose of vaccine to 25 % of its population, Mr. Vijayan, said. State’s vaccine stocks are again scraping at the bottom and there is just enough doses for the next two days. Mr. Vijayan also said that the State would no longer insist that people should have a fully vaccinated certificate for travel requirements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-preparing-for-third-wave-of-covid-pinarayi/article34794006.ece
12 June 2021||New Delhi,||Centre unlikely to allow return of four Kerala women, who joined IS||The four Indian women lodged in an Afghanistan prison, who accompanied their husbands to join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), are unlikely to be allowed to return to the country, a senior government official said. The women, all from Kerala, travelled to Nangarhar in Afghanistan between 2016 and 2018. Their husbands were killed in different attacks in Afghanistan. The women were among thousands of Islamic State fighters and affiliates who surrendered before the Afghanistan authorities in the months of November and December 2019. On April 27, Ahmad Zia Saraj, the head of the National Directorate of Security, told reporters in Kabul that 408 members of the Islamic State from 13 countries are lodged in Afghanistan prisons. This included four Indians, 16 Chinese, 299 Pakistanis, two Bangladeshis, and two from the Maldives, among others. Mr. Saraj also said the Afghanistan government had begun talks with the 13 countries to deport the prisoners. While Afghan officials in Delhi declined to comment, senior officials in Kabul indicated that they awaited word from India on what it proposes to do. A source, however, said there was no consensus among various government agencies on the return of the four women and it was unlikely that they would be allowed to come back. The women, accompanied by their children, were interviewed by Indian security agencies in Kabul in December 2019, a month after their surrender. In March 2020, Stratnewsglobal.com, a strategic affairs website, published a video of the interrogation of the three women. The four women who appeared in the video were identified as Sonia Sebastian, alias Ayisha; Reffeala; Merrin Jacob, alias Mariyam; and Nimisha, alias Fathima Isa. A senior official added that there were two other Indian women and a man who had surrendered to the authorities. ‘Highly radicalised’ “One line of thought was to allow them to come back and become approvers in the cases here. However, their interview revealed that they are highly radicalised. The France model may be followed and the Afghanistan authorities can be requested to put them on trial there,” said the official. The Interpol has issued red notices against the women on India’s request. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had filed a chargesheet in 2017 after a group of 21 men and women from Kerala, including Sebastian, left India in 2016 in batches to join the ISKP in Afghanistan. They crossed over to Afghanistan on foot from Iran. The NIA said Sebastian, from Kasargod in Kerala, had left India on May 31, 2016, with her husband, Abdul Rashid Abdulla, from Mumbai airport. The agency said, “The couple held secret classes in support of IS and jihad, as propagated by it, during last part of Ramadan.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-unlikely-to-allow-return-of-four-kerala-women-who-joined-is/article34793833.ece
12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Modi meets Adityanath, Amit Shah to iron out issues||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday had meetings with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as well as Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J.P. Nadda to sort out, what are said to be, several internal issues within the party and the government, including a possible Cabinet reshuffle. The state of play in the BJP’s State unit and the party-run government seem to be more or less settled in favour of Mr. Adityanath. The meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Adityanath lasted for over an hour. After this, the Chief Minister met Mr. Nadda and called on President Ram Nath Kovind. Sources close to Mr. Adityanath said his meetings with Mr. Modi and Mr. Nadda were “to do with governance and the coming Assembly poll next year”. He was asked to “take everyone along” in both the party and the government, accommodate various interests in the party, and may expand his Council of Ministers sooner rather than later. “The poorvanchal expressway is also going to be ready for inauguration by July 31 and an invitation for the ceremony was extended to the Prime Minister. The start of ground work of the proposed Jhevar airport was also discussed,” said a source.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/modi-meets-adityanath-amit-shah-to-iron-out-issues/article34793829.ece

Mr. Prasad, who was released on bail, is undergoing medical treatment at his elder daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti’s residence in New Delhi. Both the leaders had a closed door meeting for over 35 minutes at Mr. Manjhi’s residence in Patna. Party sources also said the HAM chief spoke to the RJD chief on the phone during the meeting. However, after the meeting both leaders dismissed political speculations. “It was just a courtesy meeting and such meetings between leaders should often take place. There was nothing political in the meeting and I’m in the NDA,” said Mr. Manjhi while Mr. Tej Pratap Yadav said, “I had come to meet Mr. Manjhi for guidance but if he wants to come with us, we’ll welcome him.” Mr. Manjhi also tweeted his birthday wishes to Mr. Prasad in Hindi which set off ripples among NDA leaders but they declined to comment on this. Friday’s meeting comes days after a meeting between Mr. Manjhi and Mukesh Sahani of Vikasheel Insaan Party, another NDA ally, in Patna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tej-prataps-meeting-with-jitan-manjhi-raises-eyebrows/article34793973.ece
12 June 2021||GUNTUR,||Set up petro complex at Kakinada, Jagan urges Pradhan||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy wound up his two-day tour of New Delhi after meeting Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas and Steel Dharmendra Pradhan and Union Minister for Railways Piyush Goyal. During the meeting with Mr. Pradhan, the Chief Minister raised the issues relating to the petro complex at Kakinada and the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). Mr. Jagan reminded that establishment of the petro complex was mentioned in the A.P. Reorganisation Act, 2014, and a DPR was prepared by HPCL and GAIL with a capacity of one million metric tonnes costing Rs. 32,900 crore. The Centre had asked the State to provide Rs. 975 crore for a period of 15 years as part of Viability Gap Funding. “At this stage, our government will not be able to bear such huge costs, and we have nominated members for the working group of the State government. We urge the Union Minister to initiate discussions on the project. Since the Centre had decreased corporate tax by 25% and the interest rates have fallen all over the world, the project can be initiated without viability gap funding,” said Mr. Jagan. Mr. Pradhan assured that the Centre would establish the petro complex and responded positively to the appeal made by Mr. Jagan on viability gap funding. VSP privatisation The Chief Minister also raised the issue of privatisation of VSP as over 20,000 employees were depending on it. More than 30 people had lost their lives during the agitation for the steel plant, and during 2002-2015, the steel plant had shown remarkable progress. It is spread over 19,700 acres and the land is valued more than Rs. 1 lakh crore. However, since 2014, there was a drop in the revenue as the management borrowed huge sums for expansion. A downturn in global steel industry and lack of captive mines had caused a steep decline in the fortunes of the VSP. “Due to these reasons, the VSP with an actual capacity of 7.3 million metric tonnes is working with current capacity of 6.3 million metric tonnes. But since December 2020, it is earring profits up to Rs. 200 crore per month. The plant is also buying raw material from NMDC at Rs. 5,260 per tonne, thus incurring an additional cost of Rs. 3,472 crore. Hence we request that the captive mines in Odisha should be allotted to VSP. I also urge the Minister to convert the huge loans into equity and provide an opportunity for the plant to be listed in stock exchange,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jagan-meets-pradhan-seeks-petro-complex-at-kakinada/article34793785.ece
12 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||DSC-2008 candidates to be appointed as SGTs||Education Minister A. Suresh on Friday said the government had approved the appointment of 2,193 candidates from the 2008 DSC batch as Secondary Grade Teacher (SGT) after resolving the case pending in the court for 12 long years. Addressing the media, Mr. Suresh said there were problems in appointments after releasing the notification for the 2008 DSC candidates due to change in the eligibility criteria. Because of this, more than 4,000 B.Ed students had lost job opportunities and moved the court. In the 2014 elections, the TDP had promised to address the issue but later placed it on the back-burner, he alleged. After the YSRCP came to power, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy ensured that the legal issue was resolved. A G.O. would be issued soon, and the candidates would be appointed after training, Mr. Suresh said. He said 6,361 candidates from the 2018 DSC had also been given appointment. On the SSC and Intermediate examinations, Mr. Suresh said it would take at least 40 days time to complete the process. “Due to the pandemic situation, it doesn’t seem possible to conduct the exams now,” he said. “We will conduct the exams in strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocol after the situation subsides,” he added. He released the syllabus for the Teacher Eligibility Test and said it would be available on the website: http://aptet.apcfss.in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dsc-2008-candidates-to-be-appointed-as-sgts/article34793825.ece

12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC rejects ex-Mumbai police chief’s appeal||The Supreme Court on Friday told former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh that “people who live in glass houses should not throw stones at others” while refusing to entertain his plea seeking the transfer of the inquiries/case against him outside Maharashtra to be investigated by an independent agency. He alleged that the State government is trying to “frame” him for levelling corruption charges against NCP leader Anil Deshmukh, who had to resign as Home Minister. Along with Mr. Singh’s petition, the Bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian was also considering an application filed by Mumbai police inspector Bhimraj Rohidas Ghadge, who accused Mr. Singh, in turn, of corruption and vindictiveness. Mr. Ghadge, represented by senior advocate S.B. Talekar and advocate Vipin Nair, accused his former boss of having tried to “silence” him by framing fake cases against him. “It is commonly said that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones at others,” Justice Gupta told senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Mr. Singh. Mr. Jethmalani raised an objection to the comment, saying it was a “prejudicial statement” and amounted to “pre-judging” the case. The court, however, was not impressed. Alleges frame-up bid Mr. Singh alleged that the government had instituted departmental inquiries against him as an act of reprisal for his complaint about Mr. Deshmukh. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta was present in court for the CBI. However, the court saw it differently. “You [Singh] are part of the Maharashtra IPS cadre. You have served the State for 30 years, and now you don’t have confidence in your own State. It is shocking… It is a shocking allegation you are making,” Justice Gupta addressed Mr. Jethmalani. The senior lawyer said there were other police officers in Maharashtra who, like his client, had been “victimised” by the government. He claimed that the Maharashtra DGP had approached him as a “mentor” to give up on his complaint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-rejects-ex-mumbai-police-chiefs-appeal/article34793827.ece

12 June 2021||HYDERABAD,||New pay scales for TS staff from June salary||Ending the agonising wait of employees, the government has issued comprehensive guidelines for implementation of the revised pay scales for staff in different categories. Accordingly, the employees will forthwith get fitment benefit of 30% instead of 7.5% recommended by the first Pay Revision Commission. The dearness allowance of 30.92% as on July 1, 2018 will be merged in the pay as recommended by the PRC and the revised pay would come into force from the same day. After the announcement that notional benefit would be given for almost two years with effect from July 1, 2018 to March 31, 2020, the government said monetary benefit would be allowed from April 1 last year. Arrears for the period from April 1 last year to March 31 would be paid at the time of superannuation of the employee or to the legal heirs in case of demise of the employee. The arrears for April and May would be paid in the due course during the current financial year and the employees would get the revised pay scales from this month’s salary payable next month. “The revised pay scales should come into force from 1.7.2018 and as regard giving monetary benefit, the government may take a view on the date from which the financial benefit would accrue keeping in view its resources and the demands on those resources,” the first PRC said in its report and the government had accordingly decided on the payment of arrears and monetary benefits. The government had by and large accepted the recommendations made by the first PRC headed by retired bureaucrat C.R. Biswal and decided to continue the concept of master scale and continuance of the existing (32) grades and (80) segments of the revised master scale. “The requests for any further revision of pay scales for the categories already included in the Schedule-II shall not be entertained in any case,” the orders said. The revised pay scales would however be not applicable to the teaching and other staff in government colleges. Including medical colleges, government aided private colleges who were drawing pay in the Revised UGC/ICAR/AICTE Pay Scales.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/new-pay-scales-for-ts-staff-from-june-salary/article34794315.ece

12 June 2021||Srinagar,||Centre takes steps to engage with J&K parties||Twenty months after the Union government ended Jammu and Kashmir’s special constitutional position, serious spadework is on, for the first time, to rope in the mainstream political parties of the Union Territory (UT), especially the Kashmir-based grouping, the Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), to engage with New Delhi and meet the BJP’s top leadership in the coming weeks. Top sources privy to the parleys on the backchannels told The Hindu that “people mandated by the Centre are in touch with the top leaders of the regional political parties of J&K for many weeks”. It included the region’s oldest political party, the National Conference (NC), whose president Dr. Farooq Abdullah heads the Gupkar alliance. Besides, Peoples Conference’s Sajad Lone and J&K Apni Party’s Altaf Bukhari may also be taken on board. The situation in Kashmir has not changed since the August 5, 2019 action by the Centre to abrogate all special provisions of Article 370. A bid to dislodge and discredit the traditional leaders and create a new crop of leadership in Kashmir has not yielded any desired results till date, which was evident during the District Development Council polls conducted last year. The sources said that if all went well, J&K leaders were likely to travel to New Delhi and hold a meeting with top BJP leadership. The talks were likely to revolve around the return of Statehood status to the Jammu and Kashmir and early Assembly elections for now. J&K remains under the Centre’s rule since 2018, after the BJP pulled out of the alliance with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Dr. Abdullah had dropped broad hints and showed his readiness to engage after the Gupkar alliance partners met at the official residence of PDP president Mehbooba Mufti in Srinagar on June 9. “We have not closed any doors [for talks]. If invited, we may look into it,” he told reporters. The sources said all the five parties associated with the Gupkar alliance, including the PDP, did discuss the offer of engagement from New Delhi. Delimitation process Dr. Abdullah had softened his position on delimitation and was likely to engage in the process, set off to create more constituencies ahead of Assembly polls. The NC MPs, who have abstained from the Commission’s meeting so far, are likely to be allowed to make recommendations and “will be given due consideration”, the sources said. Ms. Mufti, whose uncle and PDP general secretary Sartaj Madani, close aide Naeem Akhtar and party’s youth wing president Waheed-ur-Rehmaan Parra remain behind the bars, has also shared her viewpoint on the subject and stressed the need “to prove the intention” ahead of any grand optics. If the outreach by the Centre manages to get the regional parties onboard for a meeting, it is also likely to ease the pressure off from Prime Minister Narendra Modi from international and neighbouring countries on Kashmir. Any move to allow local parties to express their politics again will be seen as a confidence building measure both in Srinagar as well as Islamabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-takes-steps-to-engage-with-jk-parties/article34793742.ece
12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||How will food reach migrants without ration cards, asks SC||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre how it intended to take food to crores of migrant labourers who have no ration cards. “How will food reach migrant labourers without ration cards?” a Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M.R. Shah addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, for the Centre. The court said the schemes rolled out so far seemed to cover only ration card holders. Ms. Bhati explained that the Centre had kept its best foot forward with the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which covers 80 crore poor identified as beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act. The scheme provides 5 kg of free food grains to every person for May and June. It intends to help the poor tide over the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. Eight lakh metric tonnes of food grains have already been given, she added. “No doubt you [the Centre] are providing food… No doubt some migrant labourers have ration cards… But we are only bothered about those who do not have them. We want to know about your mechanism to identify and provide food for people who do not have ration cards…” Justice Bhushan addressed the government side. States’ role Ms. Bhati said the Centre was only in charge of making available or procuring food grains. The States had to distribute the food within their territories. The law officer said the Centre was ready to give the States whatever they wanted. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, who appeared for some activists along with advocate Prashant Bhushan, said the “Centre was leaving them [the poor without ration cards] to the mercy of the States”. “Those without ration cards cannot be allowed to die… The economic situation is far more dire now,” Mr. Dave said. Mr. Mehta strongly objected to Mr. Dave’s submissions, saying he was “dramatising” the issue. In the previous hearing, Mr. Bhushan had submitted that the Centre had last year recorded 8 crore migrant workers without ration cards. The States had identified 2.8 crore of them. At this point, the court pulled up the government for delaying the completion of a national database to identify and register migrant workers. The government said the delay had something to do with the “software”. The database would have helped the Centre work in tandem with the States to identify migrant labourers and provide them timely welfare during the pandemic. The government side said the database would be ready in the next three or four months. “Why do you need three or four months? You are only preparing a database portal,” Justice Bhushan asked. Ms. Bhati explained that the portal would be an “end-to-end” one, which would not only function as a database but also help in tracking and monitoring benefits meant for migrant labourers. “It will be a self-sustaining, self-managing portal,” Mr. Mehta assured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/how-will-food-reach-migrants-without-ration-cards-asks-sc/article34793751.ece
12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘USFDA move won’t affect India’||The rejection by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) of the emergency use application of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin has no impact on policies in India, Dr. V.K. Paul, NITI Aayog member (Health), said at a Union Health Ministry press conference on Friday. “Every country has its parameter for approval of vaccinations for its population despite the world sharing a common scientific framework for approval. India also follows its own regulatory process for approval that is tailor-made for our population. It’s their decision, it should be respected. Our regulator has endorsed this vaccine and there is no impact on use of Covaxin in our national programme,” he stated, noting that Covaxin phase-3 clinical trial data would be published in the next seven to eight days. “We expect that the Covaxin manufacturers will be able to comply with the regulators’ requirement. Our regulator has approved this vaccine. We have enough data on safety and efficacy,” he said.  Dr. Paul said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) was preparing for a national survey. “The ICMR will begin work for next sero survey this month. But if we want to protect our geographies, we won’t have to depend on national sero survey alone, we’ll have to encourage States for sero surveys too,” he said. Suggestions to reduce the gap between the two doses of Covishield and non-requirement of vaccination for those who have recovered from COVID-19 “are welcome”, he said, adding that revisions can be made “as per data analysis and consultations”. In a release on Friday, the Health Ministry said the expectation that vaccine wastage should be 1% or less is not at all unreasonable. The vaccines being used now did not have an ‘open vial policy’, i.e., they have to be used within a stipulated time once a vial was opened. The vaccinators were advised to mark the date and time of opening each vial and all opened vials should be used or discarded within four hours of opening. “Several States have organised COVID-19 vaccination in such a way that not only is there no wastage but they are able to extract more doses from the vial and thus show a negative wastage. Hence, the expectation that vaccine wastage should be 1% or less is not at all unreasonable. It is reasonable, desirable and achievable,’’ said the release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/usfda-move-wont-affect-india/article34793765.ece
12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi govt. under control of ration mafia, says BJP||The BJP on Friday accused the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government of being “under the control” of a “ration mafia”. It also alleged that the AAP’s proposal of home delivery of subsidised rations was to promote a “scam”. At a press conference, BJP leader and Union Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said fair price shops were at the core of supplies of subsidised food grains to the poor, as they were covered under legal provisions and thus accountable for any lapse. “If grains are home delivered, people will not get to know how much of it is going where and how much of it might have disappeared on the way,” he said. Mr. Prasad attacked the Delhi government for not implementing the One Nation One Ration Card scheme and not connecting its ration shops with the electronic point of sale machine to “evade” accountability. “Grains at doorstep is very much a jumla[rhetoric]. The Delhi government is under the control of ration mafia,” he alleged. “You want to break the law. You want to throw dust into the eyes of the people of Delhi. The Central government procures and spends money on the scheme and you have to follow the law,” he said. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had been saying that the Centre was refusing to approve his government’s scheme of home delivery of rations to the poor. Mr. Prasad said Mr. Kejriwal was free to launch a separate scheme outside the Food Security Act-covered programme. He noted that the Centre provided 37,573 tonnes of subsidised grains to 73 lakh people in Delhi at a cost of Rs. 1,163 crore. He asserted that the interests of Delhi were very much prioritised. The Centre was annually spending Rs. 2 lakh crore to give subsidised ration to people. The Delhi government could not deliver medicine and oxygen to people at home but it was now talking about delivering grains at home, he said. To help the migrant population receive their quota of ration at their place of work, the Centre launched the One Nation One Ration Card scheme, but Delhi was among the three States that had not implemented it. The government had stopped e-authentication of ration shops within four months of its launch in 2018 after lakhs of fake ration cards were spotted. It also had no data on Dalit and tribal beneficiaries of the scheme, he added.  If grains are home delivered, people will not get to know how much of it is going where Ravi Shankar Prasad Union Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-govt-under-control-of-ration-mafia-says-bjp/article34793748.ece
12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||‘BJP stands for India First’||After switching from the Congress to the BJP, Jitin Prasada speaks about the 180 degree change in his ideology, Brahmin politics and the internal dissensions in the Congress:  You said you were unable to serve people by remaining in the Congress. Why did you feel that? It is not about why or what I felt, it is for everyone to see. The distance between the people of this country and the Congress party has been growing. Successive debacles in the polls clearly show this. It is not an overnight decision. I realised that I was not able to serve the people by being in the party that I was in. And on the other hand, I see, the BJP, which is a national party, not only its organisational set-up, the way of its functioning, the institutionalised culture and process, it truly represents the sentiment of the new India. We have seen PM Narendra Modi’s popularity and people’s trust in him. I faced successive debacles in my elections. I won some, lost some. And the ones we lost, I can surely tell you that, the people didn’t want to connect with us. How do you reconcile to an ideology which is a 180 degree change from the one that you have gone by, your whole life? Times have changed, the only ideology today, I can say, is of national interest — India First. Like I have said, my decision is a well thought-out one. Securing India’s boundaries and our national interests is best placed in the hands of our leader Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP. With changing times and changing scenarios, people much bigger than me have moved parties. Lot of socialists and communists moved to the Congress at one point of time, a lot of Congressmen of the likes of Subash Chandra Bose moved out of the Congress. This is part and parcel of a vibrant democracy where things change shape for the better. Today, the BJP and PM Modi, are taking us to a point where India will be transformed and scale new heights. It is time that we all come together and strengthen the hands of PM Modi. If I was opportunistic and I was hankering for a particular post, I wouldn’t have waited for seven years. In other parties, and I will not name any in particular, it is the leaders who have made the parties instead of being the other way round. Everything revolves around these personalities. This satrap-centric politics weakens the idea of India. There is no policy, programme and no long-term growth. In a recent interview to The Hindu , you had stated that the Yogi Adityanath’s government in Uttar Pradesh was anti-Brahmin, do you still stand by this view? I was invited regularly and I participated in an organisation called Brahmin Chetna Parishad. In my interaction with people, I found there were a lot of grievances, from jobs to police atrocities. I tried to amplify them, as an Opposition leader, so that they are heard. Now, being in the BJP, I will be in a better position to deliver, rather than just amplify. Not only about the community that I belong to but about every one. You were one of the 23 signatories who demanded reforms in the Congress. Had those suggestions been implemented, would you have stayed back? It is not about would I or would I not. I have pondered over this decision before taking the plunge. I have tried to do what I could in the Congress; I put forth my views but ultimately I had to take the stand. The U.P. elections are nine months away and there is a lot of resent- ment against the government over the handling of the pande- mic. What prospects do you see for the BJP under the leadership of Adityanath in the polls. I can tell you that I will work as a dedicated worker. I have seen the popularity of Narendra Modi. There is no easy or difficult victory. We strive and reach out to the people and I can see the sentiment on the ground. The BJP will return with a better result.

12 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Slowing of projects worries Railways||The lack of progress in key railway projects across the country was resulting in an “embarrassing” situation for the Ministry of Railways during review meetings convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to the Railway Board. In an advisory issued on Thursday to general managers of all Zonal Railways, Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd., IRCON International Ltd., Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation Ltd., and other major construction organisations, the Railway Board said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was monitoring several railway projects through the Proactive Governance And Timely Implementation (PRAGATI) portal. Besides assessing data management and analysis, geo-spatial applications and video-conference inputs, Mr. Modi was also viewing videos captured by drones of the project sites to review the progress. “It is seen that regular monitoring and follow-up is not being done for these projects and issues discussed before Prime Minister and this results in an embarrassing situation for Ministry of Railways. Targets given by Zonal Railways/PSUs during meetings are frequently changed and this gets adversely commented upon during meetings,” the advisory said. The Railway Board was referring to 90 projects across India, the progress of which were discussed in 36 meetings (from March 25, 2015 to February 24, 2021). The listed projects included the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (1,856 km), Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla (272 km), Mumbai Urban Transport Project (Phase-II), Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Project (508 km), Madurai-Thoothukudi via Aruppukottai (144 kms), Angamali-Sabarimala Line (111 km) and others. The note said officers working on these projects may be sensitised to avoid procedural delays and follow up with other statutory authorities and State governments for early completion of the projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/slowing-of-projects-worries-railways/article34793745.ece
12 June 2021||New Delhi/Jaipur,||Pilot dismisses reports of talks with BJP leaders||While former Rajasthan Congress chief Sachin Pilot on Friday dismissed reports of BJP leaders being in touch with him, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Rajasthan Ajay Maken asserted that there would soon be a Cabinet expansion of the Ashok Gehlot-led government. The AICC general secretary also played down reports of Mr. Pilot being “angry” with the party. “When I am here, how is it possible that views of the MLAs are not heard? We are taking future steps after talking to everyone and ascertaining their views. The vacant posts that are there, be they in the Cabinet or the Boards of Commissions, appointments will happen very soon,” Mr. Maken said on the sidelines of a symbolic protest against the continuous fuel price hike. On his part, Mr. Pilot took part in a protest against fuel hike in Jaipur and categorically rejected the claims that Congress-turned-BJP leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi had spoken to him. “I also heard that Rita Bahuguna Joshi had spoken to Sachin. Maybe she spoke to Sachin Tendulkar. She doesn’t have the courage to speak to me,” Mr. Pilot quipped to reporters at the protest venue. Amid speculation that the former Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister could be the next to exit from the Congress after Jitin Prasada, Mr. Maken said he is in regular touch with Mr Pilot. “I speak to him regularly [Mr Pilot]. If he was angry, then would he have spoken to me,” Mr. Maken said. However, a source close to Mr. Pilot told The Hindu that the Pilot camp is not happy that the Congress High Command has not been able to “deliver” on the promises made to him and his supporters even after 10 months. After his unsuccessful revolt against Mr. Gehlot, the Congress had removed Mr. Pilot both from the post of the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief as well as the Deputy Chief Minister. The MLAs and the Ministers, who support him, were also stripped of all official positions. Last August, the AICC had formed a three-member committee with Congress general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal, Mr. Maken and Ahmed Patel, to look into the grievances of Mr. Pilot. However the panel made little progress due to Mr. Patel’s prolonged hospitalisation due to COVID-19 and his subsequent death. While the pro-Gehlot MLAs are resisting the return of Mr. Pilot’s supporters in the government, the AICC is said to be working on a formula that will ensure an important party position for Mr. Pilot and a few portfolios for his supporters in the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pilot-dismisses-reports-of-talks-with-bjp-leaders/article34793754.ece
12 June 2021||Chennai,||Former chairman of IL&FS Group arrested||The Economic Offences Wing of the Tamil Nadu police arrested Ravi Parthasarathy, 69, former chairman of the IL&FS Group, in connection with the alleged cheating of a Chennai-based private limited company to the tune of Rs. 200 crore through its subsidiary IL&FS Transportation Networks India Limited (ITNL), Mumbai. Mr. Parthasarathy was arrested by the police in Mumbai and brought to the city on Thursday. He was produced before the Special Court for cases under the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interests of Depositors (TNPID) Act and remanded to judicial custody for 15 days. He has been lodged in the Saidapet sub-jail. Last January, the Economic Offences Wing of the State Police arrested Ramchand Karunakaran, former managing director, and Hari Sankaran, former vice-chairman and director of ITNL, who were also cited as accused in this case. Additional Director-General of Police, Economic Offences Wing, Abhash Kumar, told The Hindu , “The case was registered by us last year against 21 accused, including the firms ITNL and IL&FS, for the alleged offences of cheating and criminal breach of trust in the repayment of deposit amount of Rs. 200 crore invested in debentures by the complainant M/s 63 Moons Technologies Private Limited, Anna Salai, Thousand Lights, Chennai. Ravi Parthasarathy has been cited as the seventh accused in this case. He has been arrested by us following the Madras High Court recently rejecting the anticipatory bail petition.” Inflated balance sheets ITNL, Mumbai, is one of the major subsidiaries of IL&FS. Its directors and key managerial personnel were responsible for the formulation of strategies and implementation on behalf of ITNL. The complainant, 63 Moons Technologies, said in 2014 and 2015 that ITNL notified the public domain about the issuance of 1,000 and 2,000 non-convertible debentures having a face value of Rs. 10 lakh each aggregating to Rs. 100 crore and Rs. 250 crore, respectively, on private placement basis. The information memorandum was also supported with credit ratings by reputed credit rating agencies and highly inflated balance sheets by its statutory auditors, who falsely showed that ITNL and IL&FS were highly profitable. Further, in order to induce innocent investors, the ITNL falsely assured guaranteed annual return of up to 11.80% per annum, payable on a semi-annual basis until redemption, to its investors against their deposits with ITNL. The complainant company relied on the representations and assurances made by ITNL and key managerial personnel, and invested Rs. 200 crore in debentures. In 2018, IL&FS defaulted on their financial obligations, and subsequently, ITNL also defaulted on the payment of interest on the debentures. Detailed investigations by agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate and the Serious Fraud Investigation Office exposed the alleged role of key management personnel in mismanaging the lending business. Lending was carried out to the entities without any due diligence. The complainant company alleged that it had lost Rs. 200 crore due to fraudulent representations of the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/former-chairman-of-ilfs-group-arrested/article34793773.ece
12 June 2021||Chennai,||Experts point to widening scope for allied health sciences||As part of the online Career Counselling 2021 series presented by Hindustan Institute of Technology & Science (HITS) along with The Hindu Education Plus, two webinars were hosted on Thursday. The first on “A Career in Allied Health Sciences: Current Trends & Future Prospects”, presented a holistic picture of the sector in India. According to Dr. B. Rajashekhar, Founding/ Former Dean, Advisor for AHS Programmes, Manipal College of Health Professions, India is still 50 years behind the rest of the world in Allied Health Sciences (AHS) education and career. “In India, the absence of a central regulatory council has led to non-uniformity of curriculum, infrastructure, faculty, and clinical exposure,” he said, insisting on the need to review and drive transformation in this sector. Dr. Jeyaprakash Shetty K., Vice-Dean, Professor and HOD, Pathology, K.S. Hegde Medical Academy, NITTE University, Mangalore, and Dr. R.W. Alexander Jesudasan, Pro Vice-Chancellor, Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science followed up with an overview of the various courses available ranging from Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees to Diploma courses in Medical Laboratory Technology and Respiratory Therapy, Pharmacology, Nutrition and Dietetics and General Duty Assistant, among others. The take-aways included notes on the soft skills required, various avenues for work from hospitals to sports clinics. While one is not required to write the NEET to get into AHS programmes, each college has its own admission criteria, the experts said. The session, moderated Ramya Kannan, Chief of Bureau – Tamil Nadu, The Hindu , can be viewed athttp://bit.ly/HITSTHYT2 The second session focused on ‘How a Liberal Arts education helps promote interdisciplinary learning’. Liberal arts “Liberal arts education addresses what jobs and organisations expect in students, which is critical thinking and writing, creative collaboration, art aesthetic visualisation … while an interdisciplinary education offers a broad knowledge of multiple disciplines, improving contextual learning capacity, problem-solving, and critical thinking,” explained Dr. Afrose Farid, Professor and Head-Admissions, School of Liberal Arts and Applied Sciences, and HOD, Department of Fashion Design and Arts, HITS. Dr. Salil Sahadevan, an independent education researcher, explained that the relevance of interdisciplinary education arose from the obsolecence of the linear path from education to career. “With newer patterns of work emerging thanks to technologies like AI and Machine Learning, there is a lack of certainty. Thus, it is sensible to have a broad-based plan so that we may remain pivoted and agile in an evolving job market… by continuing to pursue a wider range of topics that fascinate you,” he said. Offering a counter-argument, Dr. Joya John, Assistant Professor of Literature, Krea University, felt that there is a general tendency to reduce liberal arts education to a set of skills necessary for employability. “A domain where the link between Liberal Arts and interdisciplinary education has become important is in the understanding of complex problems like environment, climate change or public health,” she said, elaborating how different disciplines have an interface when addressing these issues. The session was moderated by Yashasvini Rajeshwar, founder and CEO, AuxoHub, and can be viewed at:http://bit.ly/HITSTHYT3||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-point-to-widening-scope-for-allied-health-sciences/article34793734.ece
12 June 2021||Mumbai,||Prashant Kishor’s meeting with Sharad Pawar raises eyebrows||A meeting between Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and former political strategist Prashant Kishor, which lasted for over three hours, has raised eyebrows across political circles in Maharashtra. Mr. Kishor in the 2019 State Assembly polls had worked with the Shiv Sena, which is now in alliance with the NCP in a tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. When asked about the meeting, Mr. Kishor replied saying it was “a private lunch”. He did not elaborate further. The meeting took place a day after Mr. Pawar addressed party workers on the party’s 22nd foundation day. The NCP chief had said that he did not care about the discussions on the stability of this government. “Nobody had thought that we can work together with Shiv Sena. But we gave the option and it was accepted by the people. Leaders of all three parties are moving in the right direction keeping the commitment to the government,” he said. Mr. Kishor, who helped the Trinamool Congress in the party’s astounding win in the West Bengal elections last month, has already declared that he will not be working as a political strategist any more. Speculations are rife that he may enter politics. His meeting with Mr. Pawar in the context of the ongoing developments in national politics is said to be with an eye on the 2024 elections. NCP sources were tight-lipped about the meeting between two. The meeting was reportedly attended by NCP MP Supriya Sule and party MLA Rohit Pawar. But when asked, Ms. Sule denied being an attendee at the meeting. Mr. Pawar did not respond to a phone call. A senior NCP Minister from the State government said that Mr. Pawar had held the meeting to ask about Mr. Kishor’s experience in West Bengal. “There was discussion on national politics. Everyone knows that Mr. Kishor is no longer in the good books of the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and is most likely to be in the Opposition camp,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/prashant-kishors-meeting-with-sharad-pawar-raises-eyebrows/article34793725.ece
12 June 2021||Islamabad,||Pak. passes Bill to let Jadhav appeal||Pakistan’s National Assembly passed a Bill to provide the right of appeal to death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav amidst a ruckus and boycott by the Opposition. The Lower House of Parliament passed the ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Bill, 2020 on Thursday. The Bill is aimed at allowing Jadhav to have consular access in line with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) verdict. Jadhav, a 51-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence. The Hague-based ICJ had ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay. The Bill was among 21 laws passed by the National Assembly on Thursday evening, ignoring protests by Opposition MPs who wanted a proper reading of the Bills. However, the government suspended rules of business to bulldoze 21 laws in a single sitting. Speaking after the passage of the Bill, Law Minister Farogh Nasim said had they not passed the Bill, India would have gone to the UN Security Council and could have moved contempt proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ. Mr. Nasim said the Bill was being passed in the light of the verdict of the ICJ which had asked Pakistan to provide a credible review opportunity to Jadhav.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pak-passes-bill-to-let-jadhav-appeal/article34793738.ece
12 June 2021||New Delhi,||Roll back fuel price hike: Cong.||Congress leaders held protests outside fuel pumps across the country against the rising prices of petrol and diesel and demanded a complete rollback of the price hikes. Party general secretaries K.C. Venugopal and Shakti Singh Gohil reached a petrol pump next to the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium on a horse cart. Arguing that the tax on petrol and diesel stood at Rs. 9.20 during the UPA government, Mr. Venugopal said it was now Rs. 32. “The government should stop imposing excise duty on petrol and diesel. It should come under the purview of Goods and Services Tax. We demand a complete rollback of fuel price hike,” he said. Indian Youth Congress (IYC) president Srinivas B.V. accused the government of spending the tax collected on diesel and petrol on “extravagant projects”. “The reduction in fuel prices comes only on the occasion of elections. The BJP’s loot starts again as soon as it gets time from the election campaign,” he alleged. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted, “During the pandemic, Modi government collected taxes on petrol-diesel: Rs. 2.74 lakh crore.” “What all could have been done with this money: Vaccines for the whole country (Rs. 67,000 crore) + oxygen plants in 718 districts + AIIMS hospital in 29 States + Rs. 6,000 as help to 25 crore poor people. But nothing was done,” she said. Former party chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “GDP crashing, Unemployment soaring, Fuel prices skyrocketing.

12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Online module to map out-of-school kids||With COVID-19-related disruptions to education leading to higher levels of dropouts, the Centre has set up a module to map out-of-school children and connect them to mainstream education through special training centres. In a letter to State governments on Friday, Education Ministry Joint Secretary, Maneesh Garg, directed them to upload data about all out-of-school children at the block level for monitoring purposes. “In order to facilitate age-appropriate admission of out-of-school children in the age group of 6-14 years in regular schools, financial provisions are made in the [Samagra Shiksha] scheme for arranging special training to bridge their learning gaps and mainstreaming them in schools,” said the letter. The online module, it said, would allow for the mapping of the children with the nearest Special Training Centres to provide bridge courses. “For out-of-school children in the 16-18 years of age group and belonging to Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Group, financial assistance has been made available for the first time from the year 2021-22 to continue their education through Open/Distance Learning mode,” it added. In January, the Education Ministry had directed States to conduct comprehensive door-to-door surveys to identify children who were out of school and migrant students affected by COVID-19 disruptions. They were told to prepare an action plan to prevent increased dropouts, lower enrolments, loss of learning and deterioration in the gains made in providing universal access, quality and equity in recent years. Schools were also asked to relax detention norms in order to prevent dropouts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/online-module-to-map-out-of-school-kids/article34793770.ece

The court said it cannot possibly intervene and stay the registration of FIR against Mr. Singh. “Mr. Jethmalani, you are an experienced criminal lawyer. How can there be a blanket stay by a court on the power of the police to register an FIR against any person” Justice Gupta asked. The court had initially dismissed the case, but later allowed it to be withdrawn on the request made by both senior advocate Puneet Bali, also for Mr. Singh, and Mr. Jethmalani. Mr. Singh had alleged a “witch-hunt” against him. Earlier in March, the Supreme Court refused to intervene in a petition filed by Mr. Singh for a CBI investigation against Mr. Deshmukh.

He was asked to “take everyone along” in both the party and the government, accommodate various interests in the party, and may expand his Council of Ministers sooner rather than later. “The poorvanchal expressway is also going to be ready for inauguration by July 31 and an invitation for the ceremony was extended to the Prime Minister. The start of ground work of the proposed Jhevar airport was also discussed,” said a source. The proposed Cabinet reshuffle in U.P., and a bid to repair the party’s current downward slide is also linked with a possible Cabinet reshuffle at the Centre. On Thursday, Pravin Nishad, MP from the Nishad Party and an ally of the BJP, met Mr. Shah. He was accompanied by his father, Sanjay Nishad. Apna Dal’s Anupriya Patel, also an ally of the BJP and an MP from the State, did the same. The sources said these parties would be adjusted either in the State Council of Ministers or at the Centre. Ms. Patel’s husband, Ashish, an MLC, could become a minister in the State. Stocktaking exercise Besides the almost daily meetings last week between Mr. Modi and Mr. Nadda, the former has had meetings with groups of three or four Union ministers in a stocktaking exercise.

With Mr. Roy, the BJP MLA from Krishnanagar Uttar, rejoining the TMC, the cycle of defections that has dominated the State politics for the past few years has come full circle. Mr. Mukul Roy was one of the first to defect from the TMC to the BJP almost three years and seven months ago. He is also the first BJP leader to return to the TMC. Several BJP leaders have started warming up to the TMC after the saffron party’s poll defeat. During the day, BJP leaders like Anupam Hazra also questioned about the functioning of the party in the recent elections. The speculation of Mr. Mukul Roy’s return to the TMC gained momentum last week after Mr. Banerjee visited a city hospital to inquire about the health of his wife. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too called up Mr. Roy. Miffed during polls The veteran politician was reportedly upset for not being given much importance during the 2021 Assembly polls, where Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari emerged as the important face of the BJP. Mr. Roy played a crucial role in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when the BJP won 18 out of the 42 seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mukul-roy-rejoins-trinamool-congress/article34793743.ece

Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam was married to Bestin Vincent, a resident of Palakkad. Both escaped to Afghanistan in 2016 to live in the IS controlled territory. The couple converted to Islam after their marriage and Vincent assumed the identity of Yahya. Vincent was later killed in Afghanistan. Vincent’s brother Bexon and his wife, Nimisha alias Fathima, who also converted to Islam had also escaped to Afghanistan with them. Reffeala was married to Ijas Kallukettiya Purayil, 37, a physician from Kasargod, who was likely one of the IS terrorists who stormed a prison in Eastern Afghanistan’s Jalalabad in August 2020. Around 30 persons were killed in the attack. A June 1, United Nations Security Council report said the ISKP “remains diminished from its zenith, following successive military setbacks that began in Jowzjan in summer 2018.” “However, since June 2020, it has had an ambitious new leader, Shahab al-Muhajir and it remains active and dangerous” adding that the territorial losses have affected the group’s ability to recruit and generate new funding but it is assessed to retain a core group of approximately 1,500 to 2,200 fighters in small areas of Kunar and Nangarhar Provinces. 77 attacks The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) recorded 77 attacks claimed by ISKP during the first four months of 2021. Mainly comprising defectors from Tehrik-i-Taliban (TTP), the Wilayat Khorasan of Islamic State in Afghanistan came into existence in 2015.

12 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Two doses of COVID-19 vaccines cut risk: study||A study carried out at CMC Vellore has found that two doses of COVID-19 vaccine offer high protection against infection and hospitalisation, even among healthcare workers, who have a high risk of being infected. While the study found vaccination to be protective, it did not investigate the proportion of cases caused by the Beta (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants. The results of the study have been published in the journalMayo Clinic Proceedings.  “We were not able to individually study the efficacy of Covishield and Covaxin as only a few received Covaxin,” said Dr. Joy J. Mammen, Professor at the Department of Transfusion Medicine, CMC Vellore, and the corresponding author of the paper. Though over 93% received Covishield, the study shows that vaccinated individuals are better protected compared with unvaccinated individuals. In total, 8,991 (84.8%) healthcare workers were vaccinated between January 21 and April 30, 2021. A majority of them (nearly 8,400) received Covishield. While not a single death was reported among the 8,958 vaccinated individuals, there was one death among the 1,609 unvaccinated healthcare workers. The study found that among the 7,080 healthcare workers who received two doses, the vaccines offered 65% protection against infection, 77% protection against hospitalisation, 92% protection against the need for oxygen and 94% protection from ICU admission. The study found that even a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine offered significantly high protection against both infection and hospitalisation. In 1,878 healthcare workers who received only one dose, protection against infection was 61%, while that against hospitalisation was 70%. In the case of those needing oxygen care and ICU admission, the protection offered by a single dose was 94% and 95%, respectively. Among the 1,878 healthcare workers who received only one dose, 200 (10.6%) were infected, while only 22 (1.2%) needed hospitalisation. In comparison, among the 7,080 healthcare workers who received two doses, 679 (9.6%) were infected, while 64 (0.9%) needed hospitalisation. Among those who received two doses, only four needed oxygen support and just two needed ICU care. “Vaccines are working well! Good against infection (in healthcare settings where there is a high risk of transmission), great against severe disease,” Professor of Microbiology at CMC Vellore Dr. Gagandeep Kang said on Twitter. She is not involved in the study.  Among the 1,609 healthcare workers who were not vaccinated, 438 (27.2%) got infected, while 64 (4%) needed hospitalisation. Eleven (0.7%) individuals who did not get any vaccine needed oxygen support and eight (0.5%) needed ICU care.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/two-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-cut-risk-study/article34793761.ece
12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Acharya association||At some point of time in our journey through the cycle of birth, when one’s past good karmas bear fruit, one comes under the beneficial influence of an acharya. He instils good conduct in us, strengthens our belief in mantra japa, and inspires in us the atma tatva jnana and leads us towards seeking salvation. In this context, the stories of what happened in the case of the sinner Kshatrabandu and of the virtuous Pundarika are quoted to explain how by the good graces of Narada, they are able to redeem themselves, pointed out Asuri Sri Madhavachariar in a discourse. Kshatrabandu was known for his penchant to kill people and eat them. Once Narada came in his way and when he wanted to kill Narada, the sage explained that he is on the wrong path and incurring harmful doshas. Narada taught him Govinda Nama and miraculously, this confirmed sinner turned a new leaf. He began meditating on Govinda Nama and was eventually liberated. If this instance shows that even sin need not be a hurdle to moksha if one gets the acharya association, the story of Pundarika exemplifies the truth that without an acharya’s grace, good deeds by themselves cannot lead to salvation. Pundarika was noted for his righteous conduct, was very devoted to God and followed religious practices as ordained in the sastras. All this only tied him to samsara and did not lead him to moksha. But owing to his good fortune, he got Narada as his acharya who imparted the Dwadasakshara mantra. He meditated on this and gained moksha. So, sadly when the jivatma is compelled into further births owing to both punya and papa, and continues in the state of ajnana, contact with an acharya can help him out of this tricky situation. The acharya can direct him to think of God and moksha and the way to seek Him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/acharya-association/article34793759.ece

12 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation’s zero waste plan will take off before year-end||The COVID-19 pandemic may have put a spanner in the Greater Chennai Corporation’s ambitious ‘Zero Waste Management’ project but it is still on track to take off next year. The civic body had planned to go zero waste by December 2020, and had initiated various projects in the dump yards at Kodungaiyur and Perungudi. Despite the delays caused by the pandemic, the civic body is hopeful the projects will be up and running before the end of the year. A senior Corporation official said if not for the pandemic, the city would have gone zero waste by the start of January. While the pandemic led to the postponement of the project, several initiatives under solid waste management, including the reclaiming of dump yards through bio-mining, construction of bio-CNG plants, clearing of debris and the processing of legacy and combustible waste, were in various stages of completion. A few initiatives had been completed and were functioning successfully. The civic body proposes to create dry and wet waste processing facilities, and segregate and dispose of garden waste. The civic body has also initiated projects to remove construction and demolition debris from the Kodungaiyur and Perungudi sites. In a city which generates over 5,000 metric tonnes almost equally of dry and wet waste daily, the civic body has constructed 199 composting plants, established 50 plants for vermicomposting, installed 34 biogas plants, six biomethanation plants and put up 743 mulch pits for wet waste removal. The civic official said nearly 600 tonnes per day (TPD) of wet waste was being processed in these centres. Of the six bio methanation plants, construction work for setting up the plant was complete in Anna Nagar and a trial run was in progress. The remaining five plants would come up at Madhavaram, Pallikaranai, Sholinganallur and Koyambedu, he added. For dry waste, the civic body has commissioned 74 resource recovery centres, pyrolysis plants at Sholinganallur and Madhavaram to convert plastic waste into fuel, a 300 MT plant for converting combustible waste to fuel for cement factories, established e-waste collection centres in all 200 divisions and domestic hazardous collection centres in 17 places. The civic body has awarded the contract for setting up processing units to deal with demolition and construction debris from Kodungaiyur and Perungudi under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) agreement and has also identified primary collection and secondary transportation options for the waste. While the Kodungaiyur dump yard will cater to zones 1 to 8, Perungudi will service zones 9 to 15. The Corporation, which initially had two dumping sites at Kodungaiyur and Perungudi, has now got three more at Pallikaranai, Athipattu and Sathankadu after the city’s expansion in 2014. One of the biggest environmental issues the civic body has been faced with was the legacy waste dumped at these sites over the past several years. The civic body initiated the processing of legacy waste through bio-mining. The process was under progress in Pallikaranai, Athipattu and Sathankadu at a cost of Rs. 18.5 crore. The legacy waste at the Perungudi dump station has been estimated to be about 30.63 lakh cubic meters, for which preliminary work has been started. The civic body has made an outlay of Rs. 350 crore for removing huge dump piles and reclaiming land situated near the Pallikaranai marshland.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporations-zero-waste-plan-will-take-off-before-year-end/article34793929.ece
12 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Children make cards to fete doctors and hospital staff||Notice boards in hospitals usually display health-related circulars for staff or informative posters for patients. But the boards at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) are now filled with “thank you” messages from children. To express gratitude for the work of healthcare providers during the pandemic, the artwork of many children were pooled in and handed over to the RGGGH. “Thank you for being there for us. You are a superhero,” read a card on display, while another one said, “Thank you so much for risking your lives for us. It is the most kindest thing anybody has done.” Spreading smiles The works brought smiles on the faces of doctors, nurses and staff of RGGGH. “We got more than 200 cards from the volunteer-children. There were drawings, paintings and letters, all thanking us for our work during the pandemic. Looking at the contribution from the children definitely made our day. I wanted all our staff to take a look at the messages, and so displayed the cards on boards outside the COVID-19 block, my office and at the Madras Medical College campus,” E. Theranirajan, Dean of RGGGH, said. In fact, in one of the drawings, a child had portrayed a healthcare staff as “Captain America” fighting coronavirus, he pointed out. This is part of “Project Joy”, an initiative that has been training children to create gratitude cards for healthcare workers, said Vedika Agarwal, who has been carrying out the project. By school students “We are doing this project in the city by involving students registered from various schools. We train all of them in an art module to create gratitude cards and are sharing them with the healthcare workers in various hospitals,” Ms. Agarwal said. So far, the initiative has trained 250 children, and shared the cards with a number of government and private hospitals, Ms. Agarwal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/children-make-cards-to-fete-doctors-and-hospital-staff/article34794235.ece

12 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Finance Minister urges banks to extend credit to MSMEs||A special meeting of the State Level Bankers’ Committee, chaired by Finance Minister P.T.R. Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, was held on Friday through video-conference. The government had requested that the meeting be held with the bankers to discuss the need to support micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that have been affected by COVID-19, according to a release. Role of banks Stressing the important role of banks in the economy, Mr. Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said the pandemic had disrupted the economy and affected the lives and livelihoods of people working in the unorganised sector and the MSMEs to a great extent. The MSMEs were important to the economy as they provided jobs to lakhs of people, he said. The MSMEs did not have the luxury of restructuring or diversifying like big businesses and were therefore in need of support from banks, he said, urging the banks to focus on extending credit to these units through the schemes of the State and Union governments. He said the benefits of various relief measures announced by the RBI should reach the beneficiaries. Collation of data The Minister also highlighted the importance of collating data pertaining to the disbursement of loans to the MSMEs at more frequent intervals in order to better assess the impact of the support extended to the sector. He called for creating more awareness of the schemes and relaxations announced by the RBI and the government to support the sector. State government agencies would also create awareness through multiple channels, he said. The Finance Minister lauded the banks for their continued efforts through these challenging times. He also highlighted the efforts of the government in combating the second wave of the pandemic. Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu; Additional Chief Secretary, Finance, S. Krishnan; Secretary, MSME, Arun Roy; Indian Overseas Bank Managing Director P.P. Sengupta; and other officials and bank representatives attended the meeting.  MSMEs do not have the luxury of restructuring or diversifying and are therefore in need of support from banks||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/finance-minister-urges-banks-to-extend-credit-to-msmes/article34794245.ece
12 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ramadoss condemns govt. move to open Tasmac shops||PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Friday strongly condemned the State government’s decision to allow the opening of Tasmac shops from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the extended lockdown period till June 21. In a Twitter post, he said the decision goes against the interest of the people and would lead to the spread of COVID-19, at a time when the State is showing a declining trend in the number of cases. Dr. Ramadoss said the move to allow spas, salons and beauty parlours to open would also lead to an increase in the number of cases. The DMK had opposed the AIADMK government’s move to open Tasmac shops last year but it was committing the same mistake now, he said. Poor families would lose their income and get pushed into poverty due to the opening of Tasmac shops, and it would also result in an increase in atrocities. Dr. Ramadoss urged the State government to roll back the decision and focus on implementing prohibition. Rajiv case convicts On securing the release of Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convicts, Dr. Ramadoss said the doors of the Raj Bhavan in Chennai should be knocked, and not those of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. In a statement, he said that June 11 marked the completion of 30 years of their arrest, and alleged that the Raj Bhavan had been playing a hide-and- seek game on the issue and it was condemnable. Referring to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s letter to the President last month on the issue, Dr. Ramadoss said leaving it to the President would delay the release of convicts and would amount to compromising on the State’s rights. The courts had pointed out that the Governor had the authority to decide, he said. Mr. Ramadoss urged the Chief Minister to write to the Governor to quickly decide on the recommendation made by the previous government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ramadoss-condemns-govt-move-to-open-tasmac-shops/article34794216.ece
12 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Hospital organises a ‘drive-thru’ vaccination camp||MGM Healthcare began a ‘drive-thru'  COVID-19 vaccination camp for people aged 45 and above on Friday, a press release said. Tamil Nadu Medical Minister Ma. Subramanian flagged off the initiative. The idea behind the ‘drive-thru’ vaccination camp is to offer a convenient way for residents to get vaccinated without the hassle of stepping into the hospital. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Subramanian stressed the need for all eligible residents to get vaccinated as soon as possible, and said public-private partnerships sent a strong message to the people. The hospital said people could drive through a specially-designated area set up on the hospital premises, get the shot without exiting their vehicles, wait for 30 minutes to check for any reaction and then drive back home. Residents can book their vaccination appointments in advance, and there is on-the-spot registration too. Prashanth Rajagopalan, director, MGM Healthcare, said the initiative saw enthusiastic participation from residents, and hoped it would encourage more people to come forward and get vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hospital-organises-a-drive-thru-vaccination-camp/article34794237.ece
12 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ensure release of Cauvery water as per SC order: Stalin||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday wrote to Union Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat requesting to take steps to advise the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) to ensure the realisation of water as per monthly schedule prescribed by the Supreme Court. As per the judgment, Tamil Nadu was to receive 9.19 tmc of water in June and 31.24 tmc in July. Since the Cauvery delta region did not benefit much from the southwest monsoon, the kuruvai crop was dependent on the continuous release of water from the reservoir, he said. “Any shortfall in release of water as per the schedule will severely impact the standing crop as well as commencing and continuing the samba cultivation, from next month,” Mr. Stalin contended in his letter. A copy of the letter was released to the media.  ‘Lifeline of delta’ Mr. Stalin, who visited the Cauvery delta region on Friday, said the region was the “rice bowl” of Tamil Nadu and the Stanley reservoir at Mettur is the lifeline of the delta. “We depend on them to a great extent for our agricultural production. This year, our delta farmers are eagerly waiting to commence the cultivation of Kuruvai and Samba crops.” The government was planning to open the reservoir for the delta irrigation on the usual date on June 12, considering the current levels of storage at the reservoir and the IMD’s forecast of a normal southwest monsoon. “This is being done under the justified assumption that the water release in the Cauvery would be as per the monthly schedule fixed by the Supreme Court.” The quantum of water received at the Billigundulu gauging the site of Central Water Commission had to be realised as per the monthly schedule fixed by the Supreme Court. “Considering this issue impacts the lives of lakhs of farmers, I look forward to your ntervention,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ensure-release-of-cauvery-water-as-per-sc-order-stalin/article34793935.ece
12 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||The nuances of Tamil Nadu’s GER||The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) 2019-20, released on Thursday, showed that Tamil Nadu’s Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) crossed the 50% mark — nearly double the country’s overall GER. Tamil Nadu’s GER growth was steep from 42% in 2012-13 to a nearly 10 percentage points increase in 2019-20 to 51.4%. In contrast, India’s GER, during the same period, grew by close to six percentage points, from 21.5% to 27.1%. The State’s GER is only next to Chandigarh (52.1%) and Sikkim (75.8%). While Tamil Nadu is certainly ahead by a wide margin in terms of enrolment in higher education, compared to almost all other States, a closer look shows that the sharp increase in recent years can be partially attributed to the decline in population in the 18-23 age group due to a declining birth rate. According to the report, GER is arrived at by adding the total number of students enrolling in various levels of higher education, and calculating their ratio to the total population in the 18-23 age group. In Tamil Nadu, according to AISHE reports of previous years, the population in the age group has declined consistently. The decline between 2012-13 and 2019-20 was by (-)10.4%, from 76.5 lakh to 68.5 lakh. India’s population in this age group, meanwhile, grew marginally by 1.3% during the same period. The sharp increase in the State’s GER being influenced by a decline in population becomes evident if the growth in the actual number of students getting enrolled is considered. Tamil Nadu saw roughly 32.14 lakh students getting enrolled in 2012-13, which increased by 9.5% to 35.2 lakh in 2019-20. This was accompanied by a 9.6 percentage-point increase in GER. Meanwhile, the number of students getting enrolled in India increased by 27.8% in the same period. This was accompanied by just a 5.6 percentage point increase in GER. Tamil Nadu also witnessed a decline in the total number of students getting enrolled twice in the past eight years, in 2015-16 and 2018-19. The last two years also witnessed a decline in the growth rate in enrolment, particularly among women and the Scheduled Castes (SC). Though the State has done relatively better in enrolling SC and Scheduled Tribe students, their respective GERs were 39.6% and 40.7%. The GER of women has, however, improved considerably, standing at 51%. M. Vijayabaskar, part-time member of the State Development Policy Council and Professor at MIDS, said the declining growth rate in enrolment compared to India was due to the “base effect”, as the State had already enrolled over 50% of those in the eligible age group. However, he said the State should be more worried about the employment of those graduating.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-nuances-of-tamil-nadus-ger/article34794227.ece
12 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Now, a song will herald arrival of waste collectors in all city areas||The Greater Chennai Corporation plans to launch a solid waste management anthem to indicate the visit of battery-operated waste collection vehicles to residential areas. Currently, conservancy workers use a whistle to inform residents about the vehicles’ presence. This method of whistling and collecting garbage will stop from this month. In all zones Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi, at a review meeting with private conservancy operators, on Friday directed officers to introduce the solid waste management anthem in all zones of the city. Corporation officials will launch the solid waste management anthem in a few days in all the 200 wards in the city. All battery-operated vehicles collecting garbage in the 42,000 streets will get an audio system to play the solid waste management anthem. Once residents hear the anthem, they can hand over garbage to the conservancy workers. Upkeep of hygiene Officials have ordered private conservancy operators to also disinfect each bin in every street during the pandemic. Residents have been requested to report deficiency in solid waste management to the Corporation. The Greater Chennai Corporation is planning to collect penalty for failure pertaining to key performance indicators, such as cleaning of bins, segregation and safe disposal of waste from homes of COVID-19 patients. Deputy Commissioner (Health) Alby John Varghese said instructions had been given to ensure street sweeping in all areas. The Corporation has focused on the removal of waste in all areas to prevent public health problems in residential areas during the pandemic. The civic body has directed private conservancy operators to improve mechanical sweeping during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-a-song-will-herald-arrival-of-waste-collectors-in-all-city-areas/article34793927.ece
12 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Study declaration of COVID-19 deaths: HC||The Madras High Court on Friday observed that the Tamil Nadu government could conduct a study, by a specialised team, of the declaration of COVID-19 deaths since there were complaints of many deaths not having been attributed to the contagion. The First Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy also said it would only be “fit and proper” to revise death certificates already issued, “if necessary,” on the basis of the proposed study. The judges called for a preliminary response from the State within a fortnight so that the issue could be addressed in a more detailed manner. Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram agreed to do so. Further, observing that there were grievances all over the country regarding COVID-19 deaths not having been recorded appropriately, the judges directed Additional Solicitor-General R. Sankaranarayanan to ascertain the Centre’s response. The interim orders were passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by Chennai-based advocate H.A. Shrirajalakshmi through her counsel T. Mohan. The litigant had said the families of many COVID-19 victims in the State were unable to get cash relief and other benefits as the deaths had been recorded to have been caused by lung or heart problems and not by the pandemic. Stating that the petition had raised an important issue, the judges said that as far as Tamil Nadu was concerned, there were reports in some quarters that unless a COVID-19-positive report had been issued with respect to a patient, his/her death would not be recorded as COVID-19 death. There were also complaints of many deaths not being attributed to COVID-19 if the patients were suffering from other ailments. “Without attempting to go into the specialised domain of doctors and persons trained in such regard, it is elementary that the major ailment suffered by a person may result in the heart being attacked and death due to such attack. However, the cause of the death in such a case may not be appropriately attributed to just a heart attack, but the underlying reason for the heart being attacked ought to be regarded as the real cause. So has it to be done in case of deaths triggered by COVID-19 even if the person suffered from co-morbidities,” the court said. The judges said that only accurate recording of deaths would help in studies being undertaken to deal with a pandemic of this nature in future. “Also, the immediate concern in some cases is that the relief that the family of a person who died due to COVID-19 is entitled to may not be available unless the death certificate attributes the cause of death to COVID-19,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/study-declaration-of-covid-19-deaths-hc/article34794220.ece

Dismissing a petition filed by the duo, principal sssions judge R.

12 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘It is worse than East India Company’||Even the British East India Company had not imposed as many taxes as the Narendra Modi Ministry did at the Centre. Instead of helping people during the pandemic, it was only causing more distress by increasing taxes and raising prices, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri said. Mr. Alagiri was leading the party’s protest against fuel price rise. The Congress organised demonstrations outside fuel stations across the State to condemn the massive increase in prices. “Even the East India Company taxed only 1/6th of the produce. The Modi government is imposing 100% tax on fuel. The base price of petrol is Rs. 32. The excise duty is Rs. 32. This is worse than the East India Company,” Mr. Alagiri said. He said the Centre had been causing massive hardship to the people. “These are things a dictator would do, which is what Mr. Modi is doing,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/it-is-worse-than-east-india-company/article34793938.ece

Mr. Vaiko said as per a G.O. issued on June 23, 1967, the Tiruvalluvar portrait sketched by K.R.

Communal politics “But in the previous AIADMK government, efforts were made to hide the original image of Tiruvalluvar and the portraits went missing from the offices of Ministers. The picture started slowly vanishing from government publications as well,” he said. After this, they started to paint an image of communal politics on Tiruvalluvar, he said.

12 June 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||18 women police personnel get two-wheelers, laptops||The Coimbatore District Police distributed two-wheelers and laptops to 18 women police personnel working in various police stations in the district here on Friday. Superintendent of Police S. Selvanagarathinam flagged off the vehicles at the Police Recruit School campus. Speaking to the mediapersons, he said that the two-wheelers and laptops were allocated by the Office of the Director General of Police, Chennai, to Coimbatore district. These would help the women police personnel investigating cases on crimes against women and children to reach the location of the complainants with their vehicles and receive their statements using their laptops on the spot. This will also prevent the elderly and differently abled complainants from visiting the police stations, he said. The number of cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act in Coimbatore district was around 20 so far this year. A release said that three of the vehicles and laptops were allotted to the All Women Police Stations in Thudiyalur, Perur and Pollachi and the remaining d to the personnel in Thudiyalur, Periyanaickenpalayam, Mettupalayam, Annur, Vadavalli, Perur, Madukkarai, Sulur, Kovilpalayam, Karumathampatti, Chettipalayam, Pollachi East, Pollachi West, Gomangalam and Anamalai police stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/18-women-police-personnel-get-two-wheelers-laptops/article34793964.ece
12 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination drive for industrial workers slows down||The vaccination drive for industrial workers in the district has slowed down mainly because of shortage of vaccines. Official sources said that as many as 37,000 workers and employees aged between 18 and 44 and 21,000 workers aged above 45 years had received the vaccination so far. The number may be higher as in some industries the workers had taken the vaccine at health centres and nearby villages or the industries had organised vaccination camps through tie-ups with hospitals. As many as 105 more units have placed requests with the District Industries Centre (DIC) so far to vaccinate 48,000 workers and are waiting for allocation. At the SIDCO Industrial Estate at Kurichi, 275 units employ nearly 5,000 workers. So far, the SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers Welfare Association had held special camps jointly with Coimbatore Corporation and the Health Department and vaccinated 1,100 workers above 45 years and 1,100 workers aged below 45. The association has asked for vaccination for 2,000 more workers. “We asked for it two weeks ago. But vaccines are not available. We have been told that the vaccines will be available before June 15,” said P. Nallathambi, president of the Association. At a textile mill that had placed requests with the Coimbatore and Tiruppur district administrations to vaccinate its workers at units in the two districts, about 250 workers were vaccinated in Tiruppur district. “We are told that vaccines are not available now and will be available next week,” said an official of the mill. While availability of the vaccine is a challenge, another issue is reluctance among workers. At a unit at Pollachi that employs migrant labourers, the workers fear that the vaccine will result in health complications and hence do not want to take it. “Some units are creating awareness among the workers through videos and by talking to the workers,” said the General Manager of the DIC B. Karthigaivasan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-drive-for-industrial-workers-slows-down/article34794246.ece
12 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Do not believe in rumours’||The Coimbatore Corporation that has been fighting to contain the COVID-19 spread has been forced to open another front – one to control the spread of rumours.  Unverified messages On Thursday night, the civic body issued a release appealing to people to not give into rumours and spread unverified messages on social media platforms. It said rumours were being spread that a mutant of the SARS-CoV-2 was spreading fast in Nanjundapuram and that a greater number of people had died there. The message said that of the 965 persons tested, 680 were found positive and 30 had died thus far. The samples of a few persons had revealed that they had a mutant of the virus and that the ICMR had even named the mutant as SARS-CoV-3 TNCBE. It also claimed that mutant would spread faster than the other variants and particularly affected children. The message also spoke about beds kept ready at the Government Medical College and ESI Hospital and Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. Countering the claims, the Corporation said it had thus far collected 650 samples and of those only 56 persons had tested positive in the last 10 days. It had barricaded the area and deployed health and sanitary workers for door-to-door survey, to conduct fever camps, deliver medicine kits and disinfect the place. Reiterating its appeal to the city’s residents to not fall prey to such rumours, the Corporation said it had lodged a complaint with the police to initiate action against those who authored the unverified message.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-believe-in-rumours/article34794258.ece

12 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Industries welcome lockdown relaxations||Industries here have welcomed the State government’s announcement of relaxations for lockdown that will continue for one more week. According to Southern India Mills’ Association chairman Ashwin Chandran, permitting exporting units to operate with 25 % workers will enable the textile mills to function with workers staying in hostels on the mill premises. The South India Spinners Association said that small-scale textile mills also plan to resume partial operations from Monday according to the government announcement. It has written to the Chief Minister on Friday seeking time for payment of electricity charges. Coimbatore District Small Industries Association president M.V. Ramesh Babu said that permitting export units to work with 25 % labourers would benefit those units. With no support from banks and the MSMEs not permitted to operate, it is a difficult situation for the units. The government officials are also taking action on units that are operating without permission. The MSMEs need to pay wages though the units are not functioning, he said. According to J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, continuing lockdown for industries will hit hard the micro units as there is no support from the government to these units that are not functioning for a month. Banks have started insisting on the units to repay the dues. If the government does not support, the micro units will be wiped off, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industries-welcome-lockdown-relaxations/article34794247.ece

Collector C. Kathiravan, in a release, said Bio-Medical Waste Management, 2016, outlined clearly collection of bio-medical wastes properly, segregation and proper disposal to ensure safe disposal and reducing the impact on the environment. Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) was vested with the responsibility to monitor the process. He said medical waste should be handed over to the processing company for disposal and waste that could spread diseases should not be stored for more than 48 hours.

12 June 2021||KARAIKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Centre making profit via fuel price: Chidambaram||The former Union Minister and senior Congress leader, P. Chidambaram, on Friday flayed the Centre for levying exorbitant taxes on fuel to fill its coffers at the cost of the common man. Talking to reporters after taking part in a protest in Karaikudi against the rising prices of fuel, Mr. Chidambaram said the cost, including commission for petrol outlet operators, worked out to Rs. 40 a litre, whereas the retail price was close to Rs. 100. The rising prices of fuel had a cascading effect on all essential goods due to additional transportation charges. Making a comparison of fuel price with respect to international crude oil price, Mr. Chidambaram said given the lower cost of international crude oil now, petrol should be sold at Rs. 55 a litre. By imposing higher cess on petroleum goods, the Centre was depriving the States of their rightful share in revenue. Cess was imposed with a specific purpose such as development of agricultural sector, education or library facilities. “But, now there is no such specific purpose. The Centre is using the funds to spend as per its whims and fancies,” the former Union Finance Minister alleged. Finding fault with the wrong fuel taxation policy of the Narendra Modi Ministry, Mr. Chidambaram said the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government wanted to bring fuel under the GST, but the States did not agree to it. The Centre should bring down the cess, and he hoped that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government in Tamil Nadu would announce reduction in its tax on fuel as promised in its election manifesto. The wrong economic policy of the Centre had pushed over 23 crore lower middle class people below the poverty line, whereas the previous UPA government had lifted 27 crore people above the poverty line, he said. Vaccine shortage Shortage of COVID-19 vaccines would not be solved as the BJP government at the Centre did not know how to plan, Mr. Chidambaram said. Even if 5 crore people were given double doses till date, India required 175 crore doses to vaccinate all eligible people by December 2021 as promised by the Centre. “Assuming that the two local vaccine production companies have a capacity to produce 10 crore doses a month, they can produce only 60 crore doses and we will face a shortage of over 110 crore doses,” Mr. Chidambaram said. While the developed countries like the U.S. and Japan had placed orders for vaccines in May 2020, the first order by the Centre was given only in Janaury 2021 and that too for only 1.11 crore doses as against the requirement of 180 crore doses. The Union Government made advance payment only on April 20, 2021,” he said. With such a huge delay in booking orders and making advance payment, how could the Centre make vaccines in June, he wondered. The Centre had not yet given emergency use approval (EUA) for any other vaccine except for Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. “Without giving EUA, the Centre is only peddling white lies that India will soon get foreign vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson,” he said. Pointing to the announcement that orders had been placed for 44 crore doses to be delivered from July to December 2021, Mr. Chidambaram questioned where the remaining doses would come from. ‘Missing Minister’ The Modi government should come out with details of the way out, how the remaining doses of vaccines would be procured and which company would supply them. “However, there is no answer for all these questions. The Union Health Minister (Harsh Vardhan), who had been repeatedly claiming that there was no shortage of vaccines all these days, has gone missing for the last 10 days. I don’t know whether he is still in the Cabinet or not,” he said. Stating that 36 districts in Tamil Nadu had run out of stocks of vaccines, he wondered what kind of vaccination plan it was. The Modi government was betraying the people of Tamil Nadu. Asked for an alternative to manage the crisis, Mr. Chidambaram felt that only a change of guard could save the people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-making-profit-via-fuel-price-chidambaram/article34793933.ece

12 June 2021||KOCHI,TAMIL NADU||Several leaders, workers quit Lakshadweep BJP||The sedition case against filmmaker Aisha Sultana snowballed into a crisis of sorts within the BJP in Lakshadweep, leading to the resignation of several leaders and workers on Friday. Among those who resigned were Abdul Hameed, party’s state secretary; Ummul Kulus, member of the Lakshadweep Wakf Board; and Saifulla Pakkiyoda, member of the Lakshadweep Khadi Board. In a strongly-worded letter submitted to Abdul Khader, president of the party in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, they said BJP workers on the islands were well aware of the frightening nature of the “anti-people” policies being pushed by administrator Praful Khoda Patel. While these concerns had been taken up with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, several islanders spoke to the media on the same, the letter said. The complaint made by Mr. Khader against Ms. Sultana, who had only expressed her view on how COVID-19 reached the islands during a television channel discussion, and the case launched thereon was what forced them to quit the party, the letter said. “While all BJP workers on the islands were protesting against the undemocratic steps taken by the administrator, you [Mr. Khader] lodged a false complaint against a native of Chetlat to destroy her and her family’s future,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/several-leaders-workers-quit-lakshadweep-bjp/article34793794.ece

Till date only a small percentage of children have been infected by COVID-19, said D. Rajkumar, professor of Paediatrics at GRH. “At GRH we have treated a maximum of six COVID-19 positive children at a time,” he said.

12 June 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Plea to identify beneficiaries to issue patta||A retired government employee has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a direction to authorities to identify eligible beneficiaries to issue patta for lands in Thanakkankulam near Tirupparankundram in Madurai district. A Division Bench of Justice T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi sought a response from the State. The petitioner, K. Duraipandi, said the lands were acquired under the Harijan Welfare Scheme more than 20 years ago to issue house pattas to eligible Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes members. But, 90% of the house sites were not occupied by the beneficiaries. The petitioner said he sent representations seeking re-allotment of the lands by identifying beneficiaries. He was informed that steps would be taken in this regard. The petitioner alleged that the authorities were wrongly identifying ineligible persons and were issuing pattas for extraneous considerations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-identify-beneficiaries-to-issue-patta/article34794031.ece
12 June 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Living near pools of sewage||Huge pools of stagnant sewage on Vaigai South Bank Road at Ismailpuram here have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and have been causing severe inconvenience to the residents. The residents complain that underground drainage pipelines in the area were damaged during the construction of a retaining wall along the Vaigai by Madurai Corporation as part of the Smart City projects. P. Saravanan, a long-time resident, says that Ismailpuram has been plagued with faulty underground drainage system for many decades. “The sewage from the area is usually pumped to Santhaipettai pumping station, which is very old and overburdened. Sometimes, sewage is directly discharged into the Vaigai whenever the Santhaipettai pumping station is overburdened. But, since the construction of the retaining wall, sewage cannot be discharged into the river, resulting in sewage stagnation along the retaining wall,” he said. The stagnant sewage leads to breeding of mosquitoes, causing inconvenience to the residents. “The stench of the nauseating sewage also makes it difficult for residents to reside along the river,” said S. Kala, another resident. The residents say that despite registering complaints with the Corporation officials several times, no action has been taken to address this issue. A Corporation engineer said that smart City works have been suspended currently due to the imposition of complete lockdown. But, steps will be taken to address the issue, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/living-near-pools-of-sewage/article34794040.ece

Chamber president N. Jegatheesan said installation of such medians to ease traffic congestion was welcome. But, they must not be installed on narrow roads as they would lead to accidents. The road width from Munichalai to Ganesh Theatre junction was only 40 feet. With a median on the road, only 20 feet of the road could be used. The area had residential houses, trade and commercial establishments and schools. Once COVID-19 lockdown was relaxed, public transport would commence services and there would be an increase in vehicular traffic. Therefore, the authorities must inspect the area and remove the median, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/remove-road-median-says-chamber/article34794043.ece

12 June 2021||Sivakasi,TAMIL NADU||Congress stages protest against fuel price hike||The BJP that came to power criticising the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre for ‘high’ fuel prices, was now fleecing the common man with exorbitant prices of fuel despite decline in international crude oil price, said Sivakasi MLA G. Ashokan on Friday. After staging a protest in front of a petrol bunk in Sivakasi, Congress MLA said that when crude oil price was $130 a barrel under the UPA regime, the prices of petrol and diesel were Rs. 71 and Rs. 58 per litre respectively. Under the BJP rule the price of petrol rose to Rs. 85 a litre when the crude oil price was $30 and has now touched Rs. 100 a litre when crude oil price was priced at $55. “The Manmohan Singh government was taxing the affluent through direct taxes and had spared the poor by keeping indirect taxes at a lower rate. But, the Narendra Modi government was just doing the opposite,” Mr. Ashokan said. Excise duty on fuel had increased at least three times in the last seven years. After fleecing the poor through indirect taxes, the Centre was not ready to pay for vaccines, he charged. Madurai Congress members held protests at 11 places across Madurai district. Madurai district party president V. Karthikeyan said the protests were held in a peaceful manner at petrol bunks in compliance with COVID-19 safety precautions. Mr. Karthikeyan said, “though, the people are struggling to make both ends meet due to the financial crisis caused by COVID-19, the Centre is taking no measures to reduce fuel prices.” Dindigul district president Manikandan organised a protest on the Main Road in the town and demanded that the Centre reduce fuel prices. Meanwhile, in Theni district, Congress district president Jeeva led a protest at a petrol bunk in Chinnamanur. Tirunelveli Congress cadres staged a demonstration in front of a fuel station in Palayamkottai. Led by the party’s Tirunelveli City district president Sankarapandian, they raised slogans against the fuel price hike. In Thoothukudi, district president Muralidharan led an agitation. Led by MLA Palani Nadar, the Congress cadres also staged a demonstration in Tenkasi. In Nagercoil, the partymen, led by district president Radhakrishnan, staged a demonstration in front of a fuel station near the Collectorate.

12 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Bathing ghats cry for attention||The bathing ghats along the right bank of the River Cauvery at Chinthamani in the city are in a pathetic condition owing to poor maintenance, unchecked sewage flow, indiscriminate dumping of solid waste and encroachments. Worried over the apparent lack of concern to these ancient structures, some of which are considered to be heritage structures, a section of activists and residents have called for urgent intervention from the civic body and the district authorities. “There had existed several bathing ghats and mandapams along the right bank of the Cauvery between the Ayyalamman Padithurai and Odathurai. Now, hardly a couple exist and that too are crying for proper upkeep, besides the Ayyalamman Padithurai, “said N.Ramakrishnan, founder, MGR Nalpani Mandram. A survey should conducted to identify the historic structures and they should be properly maintained, he demanded. Former councillor and resident of the locality, J.Senthilnathan, claimed that there had existed more than a dozen bathing ghats on the stretch several years ago. “Many have vanished and some are under encroachments. Only the Gandhi Padithurai and the Keezha Chinthamani padithurai are surviving now,besides the Ayyalamman Padithurai. But here too, the indiscriminate dumping of waste and sewage in the Chinthamani area flow pollute the bathing ghats ,” he said. Mr.Senthilnathan was among those who had staged protests against the letting out of untreated sewage from a nearby treatment plant/pumping station as early as 1998. “When I was councillor during 2006-11, we had managed to check the sewage flow. But now garbage dumping and sewage flow goes on uncheched. Many of the houses on the banks directly let out the sewage into the river and dump wastes. Residents too need better awareness,” he observed. Emphasising the need to maintain the bathing ghats which are heritage structures, Mr.Senthilnathan said they had represented the matter to Tiruchi East MLA Inigo Arockiaraj, who had reportedly promised to address the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bathing-ghats-cry-for-attention/article34794429.ece
12 June 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Former VC on a mission to educate rural women||K. Meena, former vice-chancellor of Bharatidasan University (BU), remembers carting a boxy personal computer in the 1990s in a van to villages near Tiruchi and the look on the faces of people who would crowd around them immediately. “There was a lot of curiosity; like a circus had come to town. Our team would explain the different parts of the machine, and allow children to play basic games on it,” she told The Hindu . In 2021, with a much narrower urban-rural divide in technology, the story is being recast, with major changes. “Now I just take a laptop with me, and seek out women in rural areas to show them how the computer can be a tool of empowerment,” she said. At the age of 59, Ms. Meena has had a long and distinguished career in higher education. She was the first woman vice-chancellor of Bharatidasan University (2010 to 2013), and has served in both academic and administrative capacities in several educational institutions in Tiruchi for over two decades. She has balanced this with a voluntary mission to educate rural women about technology, particularly the vocational skills that can help them with employment. “In the 1980s, Computer Science wasn’t very popular and there were few graduates in the subject, especially in Tamil Nadu. Nehru Memorial College in Puthanampatti (affiliated to BU), introduced the very first Bachelor’s course in Computer Science in India in 1983, following which students began to pursue it as a core subject,” said Ms. Meena. Ms. Meena earned an M.E. in Computer Science Engineering in 1991 from Anna University under the cross-migration programme, where M.Sc Maths and Physics graduates could apply directly without having to do B.E. or B.Tech degrees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/former-vc-on-a-mission-to-educate-rural-women/article34794409.ece
12 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Swab lifted from elephants to test for COVID-19||A Forest Department veterinary team collected swab samples for COVID-19 tests from six captive animals housed in the Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at M.R. Palayam on Friday. The tests were conducted as a sequel to the death of one of the lions at the Vandalur Zoological Park near Chennai due to COVID-19 and a few other lions having tested positive for the viral infection recently. The veterinary team led by A. Sukumar, Forest Veterinary Officer, Coimbatore, arrived at the Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre adjoining the Tiruchi - Chennai national highway to collect the swabs from the six elephants. Rectal swabs for COVID-19 tests were collected from each elephant. In addition, trunk wash samples were taken from each animal to screen for tuberculosis and herpes virus, he added. Mr. Sukumar said the rectal swab samples were sent through courier to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute situated at Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh approved by the Central Zoo Authority. The exercise of collecting swab samples from the pachyderms with assistance of the mahouts was completed in one hour after which the team carried out a health check for all the six elephants. He said the health condition of the six elephants was well and good and there was no weight loss. District Forest Officer Tiruchi D. Sujatha, who was present, said a team of six mahouts and four kavadi were taking care of the six elephants at the centre. Necessary arrangements for supply of provision and other items were being made to the mahouts and kavadis who resided inside the nearly 20-hectare centre which is equipped with a host of facilities. Ms. Sujatha said the mahouts and kavadis had no symptoms of the viral infection as they did not venture out of the centre which is a very secluded place. The centre functioning in a huge reserve forest area is equipped with a host of facilities. The centre became functional in 2019 when the first captive elephant 'Malachi' was translocated from Madurai.

12 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||SDPI’s humane gesture during pandemic||Members of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in Tiruchi, along with the Popular Front of India (PFI), have been on their toes, conducting burials for the rising number of COVID-19 victims over the last year. In the last three months alone, 130 bodies have been buried, in accordance with the families’ religious preferences. The number of burials goes up to 10 to 15 a day, these days, the volunteers say. "At this time last year, the daily count of deaths used to be just two or three," PFI district Secretary V. Mujibur Rahman said. "We mostly conduct burials, in consultation with the families of the deceased. Some families, however, prefer cremations, we try to keep their requests in mind," he said. Seven 7-member teams of SDPI and two six-member teams of PFI regularly keep in touch with the Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital where unclaimed bodies are handed over to them. The dead of families who are unaware of the procedure to be followed for COVID-19 burials, and those who are unwilling to, contact the volunteers. Along with learning the World Health Organization's prescribed method of COVID-19 burials, the volunteers also learned how to recite Christian and Hindu burial rituals. "We perform the rituals ourselves as the families usually do not accompany us," Imam R. Hassan Faizi, Tiruchi District President, SDPI, said. The bodies of the people who hail from other parts of the state or country, and die of COVID-19 are not allowed to be sent to their hometowns, because of which they too are buried in Tiruchi. "We have written to the district administration seeking permission to send the bodies to their hometowns," he said. Such an effort would provide peace to the family and would reduce the increasing pressure on the limited burial grounds in Tiruchi, he added. Mr. Rahman said that they request the families of the deceased to purchase PPE kits to be worn by the volunteers and also pay for the earthmover to dig the grave. "According to WHO norms, a 10x10 feet grave has to be dug, and the body has to be buried in a body bag, wrapped properly," he said. "For those who cannot afford it, we have stock of some PPE kits, while some donors come forward to pay for the burial rituals and earthmovers," he said. Mr. Rahman has written to the Chief Minister seeking his intervention in creating a burial ground on the outskirts of the city solely for COVID-19 deaths. "At this rate, we will not have enough space. If the death rate in the subsequent waves is also high, we will need a designated burial ground," he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sdpis-humane-gesture-during-pandemic/article34794423.ece

12 June 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Plan to increase green cover through ‘Miyawaki’ method||Efforts are on to create forest on school premises under ‘Miyawaki’ method by involving school authorities and nature lovers. It all began in the virtual meeting organised for Green Corps and environmental groups of schools in connection with the World Environment Day recently. Heads of all schools, environment coordinators and other volunteers attended the meet. M. Sivakumar, Chief Educational Officer, Tirunelveli, who presided, said that everything – right from preparing unused campus of schools fit to planting saplings – would be kept ready for creating the ‘Miyawaki’ forest before the onset of northeast monsoon this year. Since this exercise would require a few hundred saplings, schools might start identifying potential sponsors for saplings, mostly native varieties like neem, thespesia etc., which can withstand any adverse climatic conditions. “The green cover on school premises should be increased to the maximum extent by employing the ‘Miyawaki’ technique. The district, with all five types of lands described in ancient Tamil literature, should set a model to others by increasing the green cover in schools,” he said. Action plan for this exercise has been set in motion instantly by identifying schools with sprawling hitherto unused space, where pits will be dug to get them cooled for a while so as to ensure smooth growth of saplings once they are planted. “If the students can return to the school after the intensity of the pandemic subsides to a greater extent, they will play an active role in protecting the saplings planted on their school campus,” said an official attached to the Office of the Chief Educational Officer. Assistant Conservator of Forest Hemalatha and District Coordinator of National Green Corps Selwyn Samuel stressed the need for conserving water bodies, biodiversity in the surroundings and increasing green cover by planting more saplings and assured the CEO of all possible help.  Stock When the documenting of plants, trees, birds, insects and animals’ species on the premises of CEO’s Office near the Collectorate was conducted on Thursday, it was recorded that the campus has 15 Saraca asoca (nettilingam) trees, 13 neem, 11 pongam, 5 manjanaththi, 4 Terminalia catappa (Badam), 3 Helicteres isora (valampuri), 3 Albizia lebbeck (Manjal vaagai), 3 pantri vaagai, 2 teak,1 each peepal, curry leaf, guava, lemon, custard apple, mango areca-nut, Cascabela thevetia (Thanga arali), fig, Indian jujube (Ilanthai) and Madras Thorn (Kodukkaapuli) trees, 3 oleander (Arali) and 1 each veld grape (pirandai), marul, Solanum trilobatum (Thoothuvalai), 10 squirrels, 10 yellow butterflies and 3 reddish black butterflies 4 peacocks, 2 cuckoo birds and 2 woodpeckers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plan-to-increase-green-cover-through-miyawaki-method/article34794389.ece
12 June 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||3 plants to generate oxygen||Infrastructure including medical-grade oxygen generation to effectively face the possible ‘third wave’ is being created in the district, Minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu has said. He was speaking to reporters here on Friday after inaugurating a COVID-19 treatment centre with 180 beds in the presence of Speaker M. Appavu at Gandhimathi Higher Secondary School near Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, which also acts as triaging and COVID Care Centre with 200 more beds.

12 June 2021||TIRUVARUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Form apolitical panels in agri. sector’||The Coordination Committee of All Farmers’ Associations in Tamil Nadu has made an appeal to the State government to ensure that all the committees having a direct or indirect link to the agriculture sector are apolitical. In a memorandum submitted to Chief Minister M.K.Stalin in Tiruchi on Friday, the Coordination Committee president, P.R. Pandian pointed out that the State-level and district-level committees formed subsequent to the declaration of the Cauvery Delta region as a “Protected Agriculture Zone” by the previous AIADMK government have failed to serve the purpose since they have not been formed with public welfare as the objective but with political leanings. Similarly, the election of administrators and formation of administrative committees of the agriculture cooperative societies were also being influenced by political leanings and hence these societies have soaked in corruption. Regretting that the Centre was refusing to waive the loans taken in nationalised banks, he claimed that the farmers were unable to bear the pressure exerted on them to repay the loans. Since the farmers were aware of the fact that the Tamil Nadu government headed by Mr.Stalin was in the midst of economic crisis, the Committee president urged the Chief Minister to insist the Prime Minister waive the loans taken by the farming community. He also urged the Chief Minister to initiate necessary steps for the revival of disbursement of crop loans through primary agriculture cooperative societies on submission of documents issued by the village administrative officers which had been prevented by the Central government from last year. Procurement of paddy at a rate of Rs. 2,500 per quintal from the current `kuruvai’ season, construction of a dam across the Cauvery river at Rasimanal and other demands were also stressed in the memorandum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/form-apolitical-panels-in-agri-sector/article34794421.ece

In Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee working president Mayura S. Jayakumar led the protest in front of a refuelling station on Avinashi Road. Around 100 persons participated in the protest with groups of 10 each moving to the front for a while to shout slogans. The cadre placed a two-wheeler atop a makeshift hearse to mark their protest. Mr. Jayakumar blamed the Centre for failing to check fuel prices, particularly at a time when people suffered under the impact of the second wave of COVID-19. The oil marketing companies should reduce fuel prices and the Centre excise duty. Asked about the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s promise of reducing fuel prices after returning to power, he said the DMK government was busy fighting the COVID-19 spread in the State. It would very soon reduce the State tax on fuels. In Tiruppur, members of the Congress party led by Tiruppur North District Congress Committee president P. Gopi staged a demonstration at a fuel station on Dharapuram Road. The members were masked up and ensured physical distancing norms as part of COVID-19 safety protocol, he said. At Dharapuram, Tiruppur South District Congress Committee president K. Thennarasu and former Dharapuram (Reserved) constituency MLA V.S. Kalimuthu participated in the demonstration held at a fuel station on Pollachi Road. In Erode, the cadre of Erode Urban District Congress Committee staged a demonstration. Led by its president E.P. Ravi, the cadre said the hike almost every day in May was causing hardship to the common people who lost their livelihood due to the pandemic and the total lockdown. They said when the price of international crude oil was stable, oil marketing companies in the country continued to hike the prices to earn more profits. In Salem, the cadre protested in front of petrol pumps and condemned the Centre for not taking measures to control the hike. In Krishnagiri, the protest was led by A.Chellakumar, MP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-stages-protest-against-fuel-price-hike/article34793962.ece

12 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||A man of fiery poetry and wry humour||Noted poet Dr. Siddalingaiah, who passed away on Friday, was in the 1970s known for his fiery poetry that inspired a generation of not just Dalit activists, but also all those speaking up against the many forms of oppression. In later years, he employed laughter and irony as forms of resistance to great effect. His early poetry and his later autobiography Ooru-Keri , which was described by critic D.R. Nagaraj as a work that showcased “the power of poor people’s laughter”, mark these two phases of his literary expression that have been recognised beyond the Kannada literary circles. Dr. Siddalingaiah maintained that he had changed his method of expressing anger, though his ideology had not altered. Activist days Dr. Siddalingaiah was not only a poet, but also an activist and public intellectual all his life. A key figure in the Dalit movement of the 1970s and 1980s, he was one of the co-founders of the Dalit Sangharsha Samiti along with another prominent writer, Devanur Mahadeva, and Prof. B. Krishnappa in 1974. He also helped found Bandaya Sahitya Sanghatane in 1979. “He was a key person in bringing the Dalit consciousness to an entire generation. He showed us the world in a different way,” said Mavalli Shankar, a senior DSS leader. The Dalit movement was fuelled by Dr. Siddalingaiah’s fiery poetry. “I travelled all over Karnataka spreading the cause and the movement. I saw the suffering of the people from close quarters, and as I was an emotional person it flowed out of me as poetry,” he had told The Hindu during an interview in 2019. “Like the Africans say, Dr. Siddalingaiah seemed to also say that whatever you do, you can’t stop me from singing. His songs captured the imagination of Dalits and oppressed classes,” observed writer and critic Rajendra Chenni. His early poems “ Ikrla oadirla... ”, “ Nanna janagalu ”, “ Saviraru nadigalu ”, “ Yarige bantu, ellige bantu, nalavattelara svatantrya? ” have today attained cult status. They seem to embody the spirit of D.R. Nagaraj’s slogan at the Bandaya literary meet, “ Khadgavagali Kavya... ” (let poetry be sword). Writer Baraguru Ramachandrappa, who was Dr. Siddalingaiah’s teacher and later his colleague at Bangalore University, recalled the excitement when his first poetry collection, ‘ Holemaadigara Haadu ’, was released in 1975. “It was such a break from poetry as we knew it till then. It was an assertion of the subaltern that captured the imagination of a generation,” he said. His doctoral thesis, a study of village deities, based on which he later wrote ‘ Avataragalu ’, is also a landmark work in subaltern studies in Kannada. His autobiography Ooru-Keri , written in three parts with the first appearing in 1997, marked a change in tone for the poet. “Dalit autobiographies in Marathi and Telugu are an unflinching recounting of hard realities. But Ooru-Keri stands apart in Indian Dalit autobiographies for the use of laughter, satire and irony as resistance,” said Dr. Ramachandrappa, who described Dr. Siddalingaiah as a great raconteur with an eccentric sense of humour. Complex legacy However, in later years, Dr. Siddalingaiah was accused of becoming a “part of the system”, as he was nominated as a member of the Karnataka Legislative Council for two terms and occupied various governmental positions. Known for hyperbole, Dr. Siddalingaiah had once described B.S. Yediyurappa as a “modern Basavanna” and Siddaramaiah as a “modern Ambedkar” when they were Chief Ministers. He made waves when he, as a leadingDalit intellectual, released a book on the positive aspects of “Manu Smriti”. Mr. Chenni said that though many disagreed with his later positions, Dr. Siddalingaiah remained an important voice and nobody else could have opened up the Dalit world, with it rich subaltern cosmology, like him. “Though he leaves behind a complex legacy, he will remain alive in his fiery poetry that is a staple for everyone fighting for their rights,” Dr. Ramachandrappa said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-man-of-fiery-poetry-and-wry-humour/article34793903.ece
12 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Malls lost Rs. 2,000 crore per month since April 2020’||Malls in Karnataka lost sales worth Rs. 2,000 crore every month in the last 15 months, and the State lost revenue of Rs. 360 crore in the last two months alone, Shopping Centres’ Association of India (SCAI) has claimed. Nationally, malls have lost up to Rs. 15,000 crore since the COVID-19 pandemic hit markets in March 2020. In the second wave, so far, the country as a whole lost Rs. 25,000 crore in tax revenue. Malls in the country employ over 40 lakh people, and 30% of them have lost their jobs, both in retail and food sectors, in the last 15 months. If malls were not allowed to open and operate soon, mall owners and developers won't be able to hold up further and eventually it would lead to bigger job and revenue losses, cautioned Mukesh Kumar, Chairman, SCAI, an apex body that represents over 650 large malls and more than 1,000 shopping centres under 100,000 sq.ft. in the country. SCAI on Friday reached out to the government of Karnataka seeking parity and a level playing field while re-opening businesses across the State after the lockdown. In a letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the apex body said the industry incurred massive financial losses and millions lost jobs. Malls in the State used to employ over 300,000 people and some 30% of those jobs were already lost. The association pointed out that malls are now better equipped to monitor and control crowds, are capable of ensuring a safe and hygienic environment with the help of a trained workforce that can comply with safety guidelines. Mr. Kumar further said, “Over 50% of mall owners in the State, and majority of standalone shopping centres are at risk of closure. More jobs will be impacted if support is not extended.” To help the industry from collapsing, SCAI has sought waiver of rental/lease, property tax, fixed electricity charges, upcoming renewals of existing permits/licences, among other things.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/malls-lost-rs-2000-crore-per-month-since-april-2020/article34793882.ece
12 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Schools to start from July 1 with bridge courses||With schools unlikely to hold physical classes in the coming months, the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) has released a detailed set of guidelines for alternative education for the upcoming academic year which will begin on July 1. It has also decided to conduct bridge courses in the month of July. In a circular issued on Friday, the DPI instructed schools to conduct bridge courses for students in all grades and in all subjects, too. Teachers have to conduct a recap of the lessons taught last year that can be done using practice sheets - both online and offline. Digital divide The DPI has also issued instructions to schools to adopt and execute these guidelines keeping in mind a student’s access to the internet, laptops and smartphones. V. Anbhukumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction said, “This year, we want to have a structured approach and ensure that no student is left behind. Schools need to divide students into two categories — those who have access to the internet, smart phones and television, and those that do not. The department has decided to conduct lessons on all mediums - on Youtube, DD Chandana, Radio and so on.” Education experts are disappointed with the guidelines, which they criticized as vague. Niranjanaradhya V.P., senior fellow, Centre for Child and Law, National Law School of India University said that the operational aspects of learning have not been specified clearly. “The guidelines are very vague and do not have many details. There was a need for a more holistic approach and the department needed to come up with concrete solutions for different school managements and different districts,” he said. The guidelines underscored the need for student profiles and regular assessments. “We are gearing up for a third wave of COVID-19 and want to conduct regular assessment so that the students can be graded even if the final examination cannot be held in 2022,” said officials. Schools have been asked to collect and record the education qualifications of parents as well so that volunteers can be arranged to help students if their parents are unable to do so. Surprisingly, the guidelines remain silent on the Vidyagama programme, where teachers went to neighbourhoods of students and held physical classes in small groups. It was introduced in July 2020, but was discontinued in October after a few COVID-19 positive cases were reported among students who attended these classes. It was re-started again in 2021 but stopped in March 2021 during the peak of the second wave.  “This year, we want to have a structured approach and ensure that no student is left behind.” -- V. Anbhukumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/schools-to-start-from-july-1-with-bridge-courses/article34793877.ece

Sasikala in Bengaluru central prison when she was serving sentence in corruption case against former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the direction while disposing of a PIL petition by K.S. Gita, a 65-year-old social worker and an educationist from Chennai. Though the Bench noted that there is considerable delay in completing investigation as the ACB had registered the First Information Report (FIR) way back in 2018, it said that is granting two months of outer limit to submit final report in view of prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier, the Bench was informed that the government in February 2018 had directed the ACB to conduct the probe into allegations of corruption in giving preferential facilities to Sasikala, and sought four months of outer limit to the ACB to submit final investigation report. It was alleged in the petition that no final report was filed in the case despite registration of the case three years ago, even though a preliminary inquiry found sufficient ingredients of illegalities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-seeks-final-report-on-facilities-for-sasikala/article34793893.ece
12 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Karnataka added most colleges in India in 2019-20||Karnataka established the maximum number of colleges [181] in the country in 2019, according to data from the All-India Survey on Higher Education 2019-2020, which was released on Thursday. However, most of these colleges were in the private unaided category. Only 18 were government colleges, while 10 were in the aided category, and the remaining 153 fell under the private unaided category. The survey also revealed that 7,915 students were enrolled in these 181 colleges. On an average, this works out to around 43 students per college. M.R. Doreswamy, adviser to the State government on education reforms and Chancellor of PES University, attributed the low enrollment in some colleges to the trend of students choosing professional courses, such as engineering, medical and management courses. Karnataka also has the highest number of students enrolled in nursing courses--55,338 students. “There is huge demand for some courses, but conventional course combinations in BA and BSc programmes do not see many takers. One of my recommendations to the State government is to make these courses more attractive,” said Mr. Doreswamy. An official in the Higher Education Department however said that this year with all class 12 students deemed as pass without examination, seats across all courses are likely to be filled. Although Karnataka has the third highest number of colleges in the country, the average enrolment per college dipped from 426 in 2018-19 to 415 in the 2019-20 academic year. Incidentally, the average enrolment per college across the country stood at 680 for the 2019-2020 academic year. Bengaluru Urban district had the highest number of colleges (1,009), a trend seen in previous years, too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/karnataka-added-most-number-of-colleges-in-india-in-2019-20-survey/article34793889.ece

12 June 2021||Benglauru,KARNATAKA||DPUE considering declaring II PU repeaters ‘pass’ this year||The Department of Pre-University Education (DPUE) is considering passing second pre-university (II PU) students who have registered for the 2021 examination as repeaters. These are candidates who had failed to clear the II PU board examination in the past. Initially, the State government had announced that repeaters and private candidates would have to sit for an exam after the COVID-19 situation eased. This rule, however, is now under review, but only for repeaters. The move comes after the department was flooded with calls from candidates and their parents questioning the government’s decision to pass only freshers without an examination. They argued that students, who would have otherwise failed to clear the board exam if it had been held, would be given a passing grade/score. As many as 76,000 candidates had registered as repeaters for the 2021 examination. “We got calls from candidates who were repeaters saying that the rule was unfair. They pointed out that going by the pass percentages of previous years, around 40% of fresh candidates would not have cleared the II PU examination if it had been held. Many also threatened to seek legal recourse. Therefore, we are considering passing repeaters, too,” said a DPUE official. Not all lecturers and principals are happy that the government is reconsidering its decision. Ninge Gowda A.H., president of the Karnataka State Pre-University College Lecturers’ Association, said that they were against the move to deem all repeaters as pass. “It is an extraordinary situation this year and they have decided to declare all freshers as pass. These students have attended online classes and have appeared for some form of assessment. It is true that thousands of freshers also fail the examination. But the percentage of freshers failing the exam is far lower than the percentage of repeaters and private candidates failing the examination. If repeaters are also declared as pass, the sanctity of the examination and the teaching learning method is lost,” he said. Senior education officials in the department said that the 76,000 candidates who have registered as repeaters this year fall in different categories. “Some candidates will be those who failed in the 2019-2020 academic year and will want to appear for the examination again. Many had written the examination years ago and will be attempting again to clear it. So we have to decide on whether we will pass all the repeaters or declare only one category of them as pass,” the official added. The department has already announced that 5.86 lakh candidates who have registered as freshers are deemed as pass candidates for the 2020-2021 academic year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dpue-considering-declaring-ii-pu-repeaters-pass-this-year/article34793887.ece

12 June 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||A stellar student and a dedicated activist||“What we shared was more than a teacher-student relationship. We were partners in social activism and took part in many movements through the 1970s and 1980s. And Siddalingaiah’s flair for language — be it poetry or prose — came to the fore during many of the agitations,” recalled Kalegowda Nagavar, who taught Dr. Siddalingaiah when the latter was an M.A. student at Bangalore University. Describing Dr. Siddalingaiah as a brilliant debater, Kalegowda Nagavar said he first came in contact with him in the early 1970s during the “Boosa Chalavali” and they remained in touch during subsequent years. His talent for language and description of the living conditions of the downtrodden was such that the collection of poems Holemadigara Haadu was published when Siddalingaiah was still a student of Dr. Nagavar. Among the many events that influenced Dr. Siddalingaiah was his interaction with the legendary Periyar E.V. Ramaswamy, who was in Bengaluru a few months before his death in 1973. “But Siddalingaiah was among those beaten up by the right-wing activists of the day who were opposed to Ramaswamy,” recalled Dr. Nagavar, who along with the late writer Poornachandra Tejaswi and other activists had taken the lead in inviting Ramaswamy to Bengaluru. Into politics In subsequent years, the government was keen to appoint Tejaswi to the Upper House of legislature. But Tejaswi turned it down, and as did another Dalit writer and activist, Devanur Mahadeva. But Mr. Mahadeva suggested Dr. Siddalingaiah’s name, saying his talent for debate would come in handy during discussions in the Council, and this was accepted by all, recalled Dr. Nagavar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-stellar-student-and-a-dedicated-activist/article34793905.ece

They warn that people will have to learn to live with some restrictions in place even beyond December. The State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), that has recommended staggered unlocking in its report submitted to the government, has made it clear that all social, political and religious gatherings, public rallies, sit-ins/dharnas, fairs and festivals should not be allowed in all of 2021. Besides, it has recommended that all elections that involve canvassing and rallies or any other super-spreading event should not be held in 2021. High-risk places “Activities and places having high risk, such as cinema halls, pubs and bars, should be the last to be opened up,” the report stated adding that district administrations should impose stricter restrictions as and when such a need arises. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said while it is advisable to continue commercial activities after June, people should not become complacent. “Going by our experience in the second wave and with the third wave expected in October-November, restrictions on super-spreading events should continue even beyond December. Whether the government eases such restrictions or not, people should continue following precautions. Masks should become a part of our attire,” the doctor said. TAC member Giridhar R. Babu, who heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India in Bengaluru, said restrictions are essential if lives have to be saved. “This is how it has been the world over. Total lockdown has not been lifted in the U.K. even after the situation has eased. A combination of containment measures and restrictions are required whenever the cases are high and health systems are overwhelmed,” he said. “After seeing the high number of deaths in the second wave, we, as a society, should be more responsible. Only way out is continuing aggressive testing and expanding vaccination coverage,” he added.  Live with curbs V. Ravi, TAC member and nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said, “All COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and restrictions related to crowding have to be continued for the next one year, or until nearly 90% of the population is vaccinated.” Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the nature of the pandemic and the virus is such that none of us are safe until each one of us is safe. “Now, we have set a target to vaccinate every adult by the end of this year. So, there is a need for all of us to learn to live with this virus and make necessary changes in our lifestyle. We cannot expect our lives to be completely back to pre-COVID-19 level normalcy at least in the near future,” he said. He said that government will take an appropriate call on imposing restrictions from time to time depending on the situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/expect-restrictions-till-year-end/article34793884.ece

The officers have written to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests dismissing the remarks ofthe board chairman after spot visits.  Mr. Ashisara, in a press release recently, stated that he had received complaints of large-scale tree cutting at Vagarerahalli in Kadur range. He stated that forest vegetation on 480 acres has been lost. In Balur forest of Mudigere taluk 472 trees were cut, and in Koppa division more than 42 acres of forest was lost. He also listed similar incidents in parts of Sorab, Hosanagar, and Thirthahalli taluks in Shivamogga district. The chairman said that miscreants had exploited the lockdown situation to cut trees, and that he had submitted a report based on the information gathered to Forest Minister Arvind Limbavali. Following the claims, senior officers visited the places cited and submitted a detailed report to the department heads. An incident involving the cutting of 25 trees was reported in Sorab taluk recently and the accused were arrested. Except for that, nothing was found on the ground. A senior officer in Shivamogga district, who wished not to be named, said, “No major tree-felling has happened in recent days.” Spot inspection In Chikkamagaluru, Deputy Conservators of Forests conducted inspection and submitted reports. Sunil Panwar, Conservator of Forests of Chikkamaglauru, visited two places and submitted a report. “I have inspected the spots and the forest area is intact. We will verify if the board chairman gives us specific information about any illegal tree cutting in the forests of our circle,” he said. When The Hindu contacted Mr. Ashisara, he said that he had no copy of his report with him at the moment, and that he would discuss the issue after a few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/forest-dept-disputes-claims-of-large-scale-cutting-of-trees/article34793896.ece
12 June 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Illegal constructions sprout in Munnar||Taking advantage of the COVID-19-induced lockdown, illegal constructions are being completed in a fast pace in Munnar. Works on some of the buildings that had been issued stop memos are almost over. Construction activities were reported at Ikka Nagar, Rajiv Gandhi Colony, and MG Colony. As per a preliminary inquiry by the Revenue Department, six illegal constructions were coming up in these sites. Allegedly, buildings were constructed on encroached land and sold using fake documents. Quick work As per a High Court order, any construction in Devikulam taluk requires the prior permission of the Revenue Department. Sources in Munnar said that with the double lockdown in force, movement of people was very limited in Munnar. The modus operandi was to encroach a plot and illegally construct a building during days of restricted activity when there was little monitoring by Revenue officials. The extended lockdown period benefited the encroachers, they said. A temporary shed was erected on encroached land and constructions completed in a short time, especially at night. Attaching properties on encroached land is time-consuming and often encroachers create legal hurdles to the process. A small building may turn into a bigger one in a short time, creating an impression of legality. The encroachers would sell the property at the hill station at an inflated price. Meet on Monday Devikulam Subcollector S. Prem Krishnan on Friday said a meeting of the Revenue Department officials would be convened on Monday to take action against encroachers. Those constructions completed despite the issuance of stop memos would be attached, he said. “Only half of the Revenue officials are on duty now and the encroachers seem to have taken advantage of the situation,” he said. As per a 2017 report of the Revenue Department, 330 buildings, including multi-storey commercial buildings and resorts, were constructed without the no objection certificate (NOC) from Revenue authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/illegal-constructions-sprout-in-munnar/article34794400.ece

The diseased were identified as Kesavan (75), a retired teacher, and his wife Padmavathy (70). According to the police, the incident occurred around 8.30 p.m. on Thursday when the duo was alone in the house. Their relatives nearby rushed to the spot upon hearing Padmavathy’s loud cries for help. Kesavan was found dead in a pool of blood and Padmavathy had sustained serious injuries. She told the relatives that they were attacked by two persons who had their faces covered with masks. Though Padmavathy was admitted to the Government Medical College hospital at Mananthavady, she succumbed to her injuries around 4.30 a.m. on Friday. Senior police officials, including Wayanad district police chief Aravind Sukumar, along with forensic experts later reached the crime scene. “ Prima facie , it appears to be a case of murder for gain. However, we have begun a probe,” the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/retired-teacher-wife-hacked-to-death/article34794057.ece

Muraleedharan has alleged that the Left Democratic Front government is the first State government in the country that has issued an order for the sake of timber mafia. After visiting Muttil South village in Wayanad on Friday, where massive rosewood tree felling had been reported, Mr. Muraleedharan said usually the government would protect employees who had taken stringent action against the mafia. Here, the State government was taking measures on the contrary. The government had given a free run to the timber mafia through an order to fell precious rosewood trees in a region prone to natural calamities such as flood and landslips, Mr. Muraleedharan said. Though many months had passed since the felling of trees came to light, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who represents the constituency in the Lok Sabha, had failed to utter a single word against the plunder, he said. Moreover, the government was yet to make any official document regarding the tree population in the State. Meanwhile, Anto Augustine, Josekutty Augustine, and Roji Augustine, the first, second and third accused respectively in the case, filed an anticipatory bail petition in the Kerala High Court on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-gave-free-run-to-timber-mafia-says-muraleedharan/article34794370.ece

Mohanan has demanded realignment of the proposed flyover in the city, stating that the existing plan would not help ease the traffic congestion. He has a written a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, stating that the city was facing problems due to severe traffic congestion. “Due to the narrow national highway, lack of a bypass and flyover, several long distance goods vehicles pass through the city. This has further worsened the situation here,” he said.. Mr. Mohan said the proposed flyover begins at South Bazaar and ends at the Chamber Hall. It would not solve the traffic congestion in any way. The plan should have been designed taking into view the development and traffic in the next 30 years.  Mr. Mohan told The Hindu that the flyover had been planned without consulting the Kannur Corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mayor-for-realignment-of-flyover/article34794055.ece

Chandrasekaran on Friday said the department issued the order allowing to chop reserved trees, except sandalwood, by owners of patta (private) land in good faith, but it was misinterpreted and misused. In the wake of the controversy over the felling of trees in the cover of the order, Mr. Chandrasekaran told mediapersons that the order was withdrawn after its misuse came to notice. According to the Land Registration Act, 1964, farmers were allowed to cut the trees which had been planted or uprooted on the allotted land. However, felling of the trees would not be allowed on all patta land. The decision to withdraw the order was taken after its misuse came to notice, he said. Mr. Chandrasekaran said such an order was issued considering the request of farmers and farmers’ organisations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/order-issued-in-good-faith-chandrasekaran/article34794362.ece
12 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Police to launch drive against domestic violence||Abused, traumatised and threatened with sleaze videos was how the Kochi City Police found the victim of an alleged rape by her live-in partner at a flat in the city. The seriousness of the case has prompted the police to launch a special drive focusing on domestic violence out of the public gaze. “We receive on an average 10 such petitions, including on rape, in a month. We now plan to conduct a special drive with the help of residents’ associations,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). The proposed drive will focus on apartment complexes, as they offer increased anonymity. In the ongoing case, the victim was being abused inside the apartment for nearly a month, and the police feel that someone would have noticed something but may have chosen to remain quiet. Station House Officers have been asked to get in contact with apartment association office-bearers and collect information on suspicious activities. “Unlike in the past, rape cases now involve parties known to each other and may already be in a relation. The trust reposed by one person is exploited by the other, and this mostly happens in the case of live-in relations. It has to be said that unlike the tested institution of marriage, live-in relations, though not illegal, lack social control and commitment and come under strain at the drop of a hat,” Mr. Nagaraju said. The State Women’s Commission is set to survey domestic violence cases in the last one year since the outbreak of COVID-19 compared to the period before to evaluate whether there has been a spurt. “Domestic violence is a social reality, and over the last one year I have received calls every day from women, a majority of whom were married for decades, enduring it silently for the sake of their children,” said M.C. Josephine, Chairperson, State Women’s Commission. Rangadasa Prabhu, president of the Ernakulam District Residents’ Association Apex Council, said often apartment associations had no clue about the goings-on in individual apartments, as owners often leave them with caretakers who may indulge in anti-social activities. “Apartment associations should be made accountable for the happenings under their watch, and they should constantly share information with the police,” Mr. Prabhu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-to-launch-drive-against-domestic-violence/article34794069.ece
12 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Lockdown fines add Rs. 12 cr. to coffers||Kerala’s exchequer has received nearly Rs. 12 crore on account of fines collected by the police from those guilty of violating norms of the Statewide lockdown that kicked in on May 8 to check the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Rs. 8.66 crore fine was collected in May, the first eight days of June brought in Rs. 3.33 crore under the Kerala Epidemic Disease Ordinance (KEDO), accounting for a collective Rs. 11.99 crore as the lockdown completed a month. This is just the fines collected directly by the police from 20 different police station limits across 14 districts and does not include the amount paid through courts. The police are slapping Rs. 500 for not wearing masks and Rs. 2,000 for not maintaining physical distancing as a deterrent against violating the lockdown protocol still in force. The police have fined 3.47 lakh people for not wearing masks. 65,901 vehicles seized Another deterrent police deployed was the seizure of vehicles. They have seized 65,901 vehicles till June 8. “On an average, we seize around 300-400 vehicles a day in a district. Considering that a district has around 32 police stations, holding the vehicles is not a big logistical challenge. We release the vehicles three or four days later after verifying that their papers were in order and they weren’t stolen or involved in any crime,” said Additional Director General of Police Vijay Sakhare. FIRs registered However, vehicles were released on the same day in some police station limits for want of space. Police registered 1,18,306 cases and arrested 47,097 persons during the first month of the lockdown. First Information Reports (FIRs) have been registered against 1,653 persons found in violation of quarantine. “Inspection of the home quarantined done mostly with the help of an app turned out to be effective. Those found violating the quarantine protocol were moved from the comfort of their homes to the COVID First Line Treatment Centres,” said Mr. Sakhare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lockdown-fines-add-rs-12-cr-to-coffers/article34794010.ece
12 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Rejig of SIT raises many eyebrows||The rejig of the special investigation team (SIT) probing the nearly Rs. 200-crore illegal tree felling case in the State has run into a fresh controversy with one forest official, who was reportedly instrumental in digging out the case in Wayanad, being shunted out of the team and another one assigned the work at a place of his choice. P. Dhaneshkumar, Divisional Forest Officer (Flying Squad Division, Kozhikode), who was earlier heading the investigation into the “felling and transport of government trees (reserved species and reserved trees)” in Thrissur and Ernakulam has been removed from the post for “administrative reasons.” He has been replaced with Baiju Krishnan, Divisional Forest Officer (Flying Squad Division, Punalur). Mr. Dhaneshkumar will now assist the Conservator of Forest (Inspection and Evaluation), Kottayam, for the investigation in Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur and Ernakulam districts, according to an order issued by Ganga Singh, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Vigilance and Forest Intelligence). A. Shanavas, the Divisional Forest Officer (Flying Squad Division, Thiruvananthapruam), was shifted to Idukki and Kottayam reportedly on his request. While Shantri Tom will look into the felling of trees in Kasaragod, Kannur and Wayanad, Raju K. Francis will cover Kozhikode, Malappuram and Palakkad and C. P. Aneesh Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram districts. The team leaders have been asked to file their reports before June 22. The department has also asked Saju Varghese, Divisional Forest Officer (Flying Squad Division, Kothamangalam), to assist the Conservator of Forest (Inspection and Evaluation) to probe the cases in Idukki, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Alapuzha, Kollam and Thiruvananthapruam districts. As many eyebrows were raised over the rejig of the investigation teams, Mr. Singh said changes were made due to administrative and personal reasons. Speculations regarding the reasons for transfer were baseless, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rejig-of-sit-raises-many-eyebrows/article34794073.ece
12 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Handful of private hospitals procure vaccines||While some major private hospitals in Ernakulam district have managed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, others are either awaiting supplies, or have not been able to place bulk orders. Going by the CoWIN portal, a total of 179 sites were conducting vaccination sessions in Ernakulam on Friday. Of them, 122 were in the government sector and 57 were private ones. Dr. M.G. Sivadas, nodal officer for vaccination, said around 5,000 doses were being administered daily at private hospitals. A total of 30,348 doses were administered in the district on Thursday across all centres. Exact figures on the daily number of doses administered at private centres were not available. Private hospitals that have purchased vaccines are mostly using doses available to them to tie up with companies and organisations to vaccinate employees, health officials noted. At least eight private hospitals conducted vaccination sessions for private companies and other establishments on Friday, and five of the sites administered more than 450 doses each on the day, with one centre hitting a high of over 700 doses, according to figures on the CoWIN dashboard. The medical director of a hospital that had purchased 10,000 doses said demand was high, and even quantities purchased in bulk do not last long. Other hospitals have managed to procure quantities that are much larger, he added. But, only bulk purchasers have been able to procure doses, said Dr. Joseph Benaven, secretary, Kerala Private Hospitals’ Association. “For Covishield, the minimum quantity for purchase is 3,000 doses at a price of around Rs. 20 lakh, which has to be paid up front. Medium and small hospitals are unable to buy bulk quantities paying such large amounts. If small hospitals get doses, availability across the State will be more,” he added. SHA may step in The State Health Agency (SHA) is now likely to step in and streamline the process. Private hospitals in the State had an online meeting with the SHA on Thursday. The meeting, chaired by SHA Executive Director Rathan Kelkar, decided that the agency would facilitate the procurement for private hospitals. Hospitals have been directed to submit details of their requirement and capacity, and they will be consolidated and submitted for procurement, said the minutes of the meeting. Some hospital managements in the district that have purchased substantial stock have been collaborating with other hospitals to distribute the vaccine quickly, officials said. “Some hospitals have procured huge quantities, and it is in their interest to finish off stock that they have already acquired, since policy changes frequently,” Dr. Benaven said. To make more slots available to the public, the district has been running ‘outreach’ vaccination centres in collaboration with six private hospitals. At these centres, the vaccine is supplied by the district administration as provided by the State or Union government, but the centres use the private hospital's resources. They are staffed by the hospital and adverse events post immunisation are also managed by the private hospital. Only private hospitals that have not yet purchased the vaccine are being used as outreach centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/handful-of-private-hospitals-procure-vaccines/article34794059.ece
12 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Nod for Kadamakudy rural tourism hub||A Rs. 5-crore project by the Ernakulam District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) to woo guests to Kadamakudy, a cluster of 14 pristine isles located off Kochi, by readying infrastructure for diverse tourism avenues like farm and aqua tourism, received the much-awaited no-objection certificate (NOC) from the panchayat on Thursday. The innovative project abutting the backwaters is aimed at taking tourists back to the 1950’s, when traditional farming practices held sway in Kerala, said Mahesh Gopalakrishnan, architect and Sunil N.S., project coordinator, who made the project presentation. Kadamakudy grama panchayat president Mary Vincent said the NOC had been issued on condition that the project would not affect local ecology and would adhere to CRZ norms. “It will also earn revenue for the panchayat,” she said. The project is replete with initiatives like creating cycle tracks by reinforcing bunds that separate the famed Pokkali paddy fields in the area, walkways, and mangrove trails. “The project has been conceived in such a way that there will be little reliance on concrete. Footpaths will be laid using laterite or burnt bricks, doing away with reliance on concrete tiles that is the norm in most urban areas. Emphasis will also be given to setting up floating pontoons made of recycled plastic, at boat jetties,” Mr. Gopalakrishnan said. UN certification In short, the project will be a unique venture aimed at environmental restoration of the isles, even as people from urban areas visiting Kadamakudy will be able to go back to their roots. “Efforts will be made to get green certification based on UN guidelines. Among others, we have envisaged bio-toilets which will not pollute waterbodies even when the groundwater level is high. Similarly, families will be able to hire bamboo cottages, where they can cook. There will also be a watch tower for bird watching,” Mr. Gopalakrishnan added. Village life activities A whole lot of activities have been identified in Kadamakudy to further the cause of rural tourism under the DTPC’s Rs. 5-crore project, said DTPC Secretary S. Vijayakumar. “They include boating, angling, organic farming, village walks, cycling tours, and a mangrove trail on Charianturuth isle where guests will be able to walk through bamboo foot overbridges and explore vast area of mangroves. Kadamakudy, Charianturuth and Pizhala isles have been identified for cycling tours,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nod-for-kadamakudy-rural-tourism-hub/article34794063.ece
12 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Probe into financial means||The Kochi City Police have launched a detailed investigation into the financial means and livelihood of rape-accused Martin Joseph who was arrested from a hideout at Mundoor in Thrissur district on Thursday night after a three-day-long intense manhunt. Addressing a press conference here on Friday, District Police Chief (Kochi City) C.H. Nagaraju emphasised the need to find out the means of the luxurious lifestyle of the accused involving premium flats and multiple vehicles. The police had seized two cars and a motorcycle. The Ernakulam Central Police had registered a case against Martin who was accused of restraining and raping a woman with whom he was allegedly in a live-in relation at a flat in Kochi. The investigation team had also arrested three of his aides, one of whom was accused in a ganja case registered in Thrissur, on the charge of harbouring the accused. “We will probe in detail how people of such antecedents could easily move between districts without being intercepted. We are checking whether there were more victims,” said Mr. Nagaraju. Already, one more case has been registered against Martin under Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) on another woman’s petition. Mr. Nagaraju shot down allegations that the police had sat on the petition for two months without doing anything and even let the accused flee an apartment at Thrikkakara a day after the incident was reported. The officer, however, conceded that more focus and resources were dedicated to the probe only after the report painted the gravity of the incident. “We were already on the trail of the accused who had always been absconding since we registered the case. We took all legal measures, including issuing lookout circulars, to stop him from fleeing the State and getting his anticipatory bail plea stayed,” said Mr. Nagaraju. However, an inquiry by an Assistant Commissioner has been ordered into the delay in alerting senior officials about the grievous nature of the crime. “We are looking at a Standard Operating Procedure to be followed in such cases so that such lapses are not repeated in the future,” he said. The victim, hailing from Kannur and settled in Ernakulam for work, managed to flee the rented apartment when the accused had gone to fetch food one day. However, she lodged a police petition only on April 8, a month after she had escaped from the alleged torturous life. Mr. Nagaraju lauded residents of Mundoor and the Thrissur City Police for helping in nabbing the accused from a hostile terrain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/probe-into-financial-means/article34794070.ece

Among those who resigned were Abdul Hameed, party’s State secretary; Ummul Kulus, member of the Lakshadweep Wakf Board; and Saifulla Pakkiyoda, member of the Lakshadweep Khadi Board. In a strongly-worded letter, submitted to Abdul Khader, president of the party in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, they said that the BJP workers on the islands were well aware of the frightening nature of the anti-people policies being pushed by Administrator Praful Khoda Patel. While these concerns had been taken up with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, several islanders spoke to the media on the same, the letter said. The complaint made by Mr. Khader against Ms. Sultana, who had only expressed her view on how COVID-19 reached the islands in a television channel discussion, and the case launched thereon were what forced them to quit the party, the letter said. “While all BJP workers on the islands were protesting the undemocratic steps taken by the Administrator, you [Mr. Khader] lodged a false complaint against a native of Chetlat to destroy her and her family’s future,” it said. The Save Lakshadweep Forum decided to extend solidarity to Ms. Sultana in the wake of her clarification as to what she really wanted to convey in the panel discussion. A resolution to this effect is learnt to have been passed by the core committee of the forum at its meeting late on Friday evening. The forum also asked the BJP representative (Kasim Koya) to explain why the collective was not consulted before Mr. Khader filed a complaint against Ms. Sultana. P.P.

The State alone gets Rs. 12,000 crore every year from this. This prohibitive retail pricing can be avoided if fuel is brought under the GST regime, where tax is curtailed to 27% of the retail price,” Mr. Thomas observed.

12 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||PCB issues notice to 17 companies in Munnar||The Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB) has issued notices to 17 commercial establishments that include resorts located near the banks of the Periyar river in Munnar for their faulty sewage/effluent treatment plants. Lapses The lapses came to the fore after a joint committee appointed as per the directions of the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) inspected the units. Of the 17 erring firms, 13 are resorts and tourist homes in the region. The sewage treatment plants were found not working. The tribunal had asked the board to act against the violators based on the inference that untreated sewage from various institutions was discharged into the river. Further probe The board assured the Bench that further investigations would be carried out in the post-lockdown phase to ascertain whether the erring units had complied with the directions to make the faulty plants operational. Some of the resorts were remaining closed in view of the lockdown following the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The samples could be taken only after the normal occupancy levels were restored, it said. Faecal contamination The monitoring carried out by the joint committee along the river stretch in Idukki revealed dumping of untreated sewage from households into the waterbody. Test results of the samples taken from select sites showed higher levels of biological oxygen demand and coliform count, an indication for faecal contamination. On the delay in fixing the environment compensation on local bodies in Idukki district found lacking in solid waste management measures, the board informed the tribunal that a proper assessment could not be done in view of the anomalies in the formula prescribed for fixing the compensation. Reply being awaited The board said that it was awaiting a reply from the Central Pollution Control Board for assessment of the compensation for local bodies with lower density of population and where a decentralised system for managing waste would be ideal instead of a centralised system.  Of the 17 erring firms, 13 are resorts and tourist homes in the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-issues-notice-to-17-companies-in-munnar/article34794401.ece

When a case relating to vaccination issues came up for hearing before the Bench consisting of Justice Anil K. Narendran and Justice Ziyad Rahman A.A., M.

Police intervention The protest, staged on the MC road near the Pattithanam junction, lasted only a few minutes following an intervention by the local police, which forced the group to disperse. Cases were registered against the protesters for violation of the COVID-19 protocol. Chackochan Manamel, State committee member of the samithi, accused the State government of arbitrarily going ahead with the project against public will. Despite repeated requests, the government has refused to carry out a social impact assessment of the project and is even refusing to share the detailed project report in the public domain. He also accused the agency that had conducted the environmental impact assessment of committing serious flaws in their study. “Given the current alignment of the project, at least 5,000 families in Kottayam are set to be evicted from their houses. The protest staged on Thursday marks the beginning of a sustained public protest against the SilverLine project,” he also said.

Of the 111 remand prisoners, 75 had contracted the virus, posing a tough challenge to the jail authorities and the Health Department. The situation now appears to be under control as there are only 10 more prisoners undergoing treatment in first-line treatment centres. According to officials, the condition of 28 prisoners who were brought back to the district jail on Thursday after COVID-19 test is satisfactory and they will be able to take up assigned responsibilities soon. Efforts are also on to administer vaccines to all the cured persons within the recommended period. They are likely to be included in the priority category for vaccines. The Health Department authorities are also in touch with the Kerala Prisons and Correctional Services  Department to complete the task on time. Double screening Meanwhile, no jail officials have so far tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. They had been screened twice by complying with the State-level directives. Considering the increased COVID-19 cases, preventive measures had been intensified on the jail premises. In-house activities “By the end of this week, we will be able to resume all in-house activities, including the production of jail-brand items for sales. For over two weeks, all revenue generating ventures have remained closed,” said Jail Superintendent K.V. Jagadeshan. He expressed confidence in resuming distribution of jail-made food items through the three outdoor counters and two mobile supply units. As part of the extension of money generating ventures, mechanised production of footwear will also be launched with the support of a private industry in the sector. The machines required for daily production will be installed soon to start commercial production in two weeks. According to jail officials, 80 sandals can be made in an hour using the machines. The products would be available in the open market and through special counters of the district jail, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-district-jail-bouncing-back-from-covid-19-challenge/article34794048.ece

Some towns witnessed traffic jams as people came out in bikes, cars, autorickshaws and mini-vans. The district witnessed a shopping spree as people went about collecting various items, including footwear, mobile phone accessories, textiles, home appliances, stationery and hardware, in a hurry. Many parked their vehicles by the roadside, leading to congestion in towns. Particularly affected was Manjeri town, where the entrance to the Government Medical College was blocked for quite a while, following traffic jams. “This rush is a testimony to people’s frustration. Apparently they do not fear the spread of COVID-19 as they ought to,” said Mohammed Aslam, a school teacher who came out to buy stationery items. The police too appeared confused as people poured out in large numbers for “valid reasons”. Shops offering repair of various items, including mobile phones, computers, electronics, eyewear and hardware, were open. “Almost everyone is coming out with a plausible reason. Sometimes we get confused when hundreds of vehicles pour into the town in the guise of lockdown relaxations,” said a police officer. District Police Chief Sujith Das S. said it was tough to implement a relaxed lockdown. “When there is a complete lockdown, it is easy to implement. Our job becomes really tough when there is relaxation to the restrictions,” he said. Long queues of people were seen in front of vaccination centres in the district. Introduction of spot registration for COVID-19 vaccine also made people rush for the jabs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/scramble-for-goods-services-as-malappuram-eases-curbs/article34794056.ece
12 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||State’s borrowing limit raised to 5% of GSDP||Reeling under a financial crisis due to COVID-19, Kerala has got a breather with the Centre increasing the borrowing limit for the State from 3% to 5% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). The Centre’s gesture is for registering progress in implementing four key institutional reforms, including seeding of ration cards with Aadhaar. Along with Kerala, Goa and Uttarakhand, which have implemented all four required reform measures, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, which have implemented three measures, will benefit. The borrowing limit of all other States is 4%. The seven States can take loans above Rs. 1 lakh crore. The borrowed fund can be used for any development project, except the Atma Nirbhar Bharat. The enhanced borrowing limit would allow Kerala to borrow an additional amount of Rs. 18,087 crore. Implementing the nationalised ration card scheme, removing government discretion for ease of doing business by making renewal of licences under 12 commercial laws digital and bringing in a randomised process for selecting factories for inspection, setting a minimum floor rate by urban local bodies for property and sewerage tax and rationalising electricity subsidy through DBT (direct benefit transfer) to farmers are the reform measures. GST meet today In January, the Finance Ministry had enhanced Kerala’s borrowing limit by Rs. 2,261 crore, after the State joined seven others in completing reforms to improve the ease of doing business as stipulated by the Centre. Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal will raise the States’ demand for extending the Goods and Service Tax compensation shortfall for another five years at the GST Council meet on Saturday. PDRD grant Kerala has also received Rs. 1,657.58 crore as the third instalment of Post Devolution Revenue Deficit (PDRD) grant of Rs. 9,871 crore for 2021-22 released to 17 States by the Department of Expenditure. With the release of the third instalment, Rs. 29,613 crore has been released in the first three months of the current financial year as PDRD grant. The grants are released as per the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission to meet the gap in Revenue Accounts of the States post-devolution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-borrowing-limit-raised-to-5-of-gsdp/article34794365.ece
12 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Malayalam films may take OTT route||With cinemas expected to remain closed for some more time, producers of some big-budget Malayalam films that were earlier set for a theatrical release are now mulling a release on over-the-top (OTT) platforms. Producer Anto Joseph has written to the Film Exhibitors United Organisation of Kerala (FEUOK) and Kerala Film Exhibitors Federation (KFEF) informing them of his plan to release his productions Malik and Cold Case directly on OTT platforms. Shelved releases  Malik , directed by Mahesh Narayanan, was initially slated for release on May 13, along with Priyadarshan's Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham , starring Mohanlal. However, with the cinemas downing their shutters in April following the second wave of COVID-19, the release plans had to be shelved. Cold Case , directed by Tanu Balak, was also getting ready for release. FEUOK president K. Vijayakumar told The Hindu that considering the uncertainty, the exhibitors’ body decided not to object to the producer’s decision. The FEUOK had in the past opposed moves by producers to get a direct OTT release. “Anto Joseph's Malik was set to release on May 13. Further delay in release could create financial pressures for the producer. We will not object to any film producer choosing to release their films on OTT platforms until the government gives us permission to reopen the cinemas. But, there are a couple of big films for which the exhibitors have paid huge advance amounts. We will not allow these to be released directly on OTT,” said Mr. Vijayakumar. Selective about content Kerala Film Producers Association president M. Renjith said quite a few producers want to go the OTT way, but major players such as Netflix and Amazon Prime are very selective. “They buy outright only the big films that are sure to make revenue. Also, the current profit-sharing model is not very favourable for smaller producers. In the past one year, they have bought only about 10 Malayalam movies,” said Mr. Renjith. Although the film bodies have planned an OTT platform on their own, viability still remains a question, as some of the smaller players are visibly struggling in the market. Own platform “For people to subscribe in large numbers, we should have quite a few films that they would like to watch. Even if one or two films get viewers, it will not sustain in the long run. So, the idea of a platform of our own is still being thought about,” says Mr. Renjith. The first direct to OTT release in Malayalam happened a year back, on July 3, when Shanavas Naranipuzha’s Sufiyum Sujathayum was released on Amazon Prime. Over the past year, quite a handful of major releases, including Drishyam , Joji , The Great Indian Kitchen and C U Soon have been released directly on these platforms, garnering viewers from other States as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/malayalam-films-may-take-ott-route/article34794367.ece

12 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Cats score over dogs in terms of bites in the State||A sassy dog or mellow cat, which is more dangerous? With its shrill bark and suspicious stare, the comparatively tough looking canine would be the natural choice of a majority of people over the cute little cat, if anyone poses such a question. But, the reality is a bit different, at least in Kerala, if the information provided by the State Health Department in a recent RTI (under the Right to Information Act) reply can be believed. According to the State Health Directorate, the number of people suffering from ‘cat bites’ and seeking treatment in the State is much higher than those doing so for dog attacks in the last several years. In January alone this year, at least 28,186 people had suffered cat bites while the number of those attacked by the canines stood at 20,875, as per the figures provided by the directorate. The data were released as per an RTI query submitted by the Animal Legal Force, a State-based animal outfit. Statistics The statistics of people who suffered bites by dogs and cats between 2013 and 2021 and the amount spent for anti-rabies vaccine and serum were attached with the reply. This has been shared to the media by the force. The number of people who suffered kitten bites has been showing an upward trend since 2016, the year in which 1,60,534 people had sought treatment for cat bite against 1,35,217 people for canine attack. If cats bite as many as 1,60,785 people in 2017, the number rose to 1,75,368 persons in 2018 and increased to 2,04,625 and 2,16,551 in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Compared to the figures of 2014 and 2020, there has been an 128% increase in the number of people who suffered cat bites in the State. However, the number of those who suffered dog bite and sought treatment was 1,35,749 in 2017, 1,48,365 in 2018, 1,61,050 in 2019 and 1,60,483 in 2020.  At least five people had succumbed to rabies infection in the State last year and one of the major causes of death was the attitude of people taking the animal bite in a light manner, said Angels Nair, general secretary, Animal Legal Force. Though cats normally do not attack human beings compared to dogs, its unintentional tooth or nail scratch was the reason forcing people to take anti-rabies vaccine or seek medical aid. Such cat scratches would also be recorded as ‘cat bite’ in the medical data and that may be the reason for showing a spurt in ‘cat bite’ cases in the State, the outfit said, adding that it is essential to take vaccine even if people suffer a minor scratch from the animals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cats-score-over-dogs-in-terms-of-bites-in-the-state/article34794361.ece

12 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||All village offices will be smart in five years: CM||Thrusting on the need for a marked change in the functioning of village offices, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has announced the State government’s plan to make all village offices smart within five years. In an interaction through videoconference with village officers from across the State on Friday, he said that all services through village offices would be made available online within October 2. Out of the 1,666 village offices in the State, 126 had already been transformed into smart offices. The work was progressing in 324 other offices. The remaining ones would also be transformed during this government’s tenure, said the CM. He said that a change in the mindset of the employees was required along with the upgrading of infrastructural facilities and service delivery. “The public depends a lot on village offices. Hence efficient and quick service delivery is important. The employees should also be able to adapt to these timely changes. The government aims for a people-friendly and corruption free service,” he said. Against corruption Mr. Vijayan said that corruption in civil services had come down drastically. The practice of making people visit offices multiple times for the same purpose, of not taking timely action on applications, and making people to come directly to the offices without sufficient reason in online applications, all could be counted as corruption. Stringent action would be taken in such cases, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/all-village-offices-will-be-smart-in-five-years-cm/article34794022.ece

Krishnankutty’s office said on Friday. An action plan for achieving this target will be drawn up within a month. The government has identified more than 60 tribal settlements which lack access to electricity. Mr. Krishnankutty had held discussions with Minister for Devaswoms and SC/ST Welfare K. Radhakrishnan on Thursday. The remoteness of some of the tribal hamlets, situated inside forests, poses a challenge in providing power supply. Construction of distribution lines may prove next to impossible in such regions, forcing the Power Department to look at options such as solar photovoltaic systems. The action plan will cover apt technologies for providing the settlements with access to electricity. It has also been decided to form a committee of Secretaries of the departments concerned at the State- and district-level panels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/remote-tribal-hamlets-to-get-power-supply/article34794405.ece

Many trees were felled from the Machad forest range in Wadakkanchery. Trees were felled misusing a government order. It is reported that trees worth Rs. 5 crore were smuggled out even after the order was withdrawn. The Forest Department has registered 10 cases in this connection and an FIR has been submitted in a Wadakkanchery magistrate court. It is reported that 33 passes were issued in the Machad range alone for felling of trees. Around 500 trees , including teak and rosewood, were felled using these passes. The maximum number of trees were felled from the Pulakkode forest area. Search intensified Most of the trees cut from Thrissur were smuggled to Malappuram. A search has been intensified in other districts too. The Machad range officer died in the office recently while the investigation was progressing on the issuing of passes for felling trees even after the government order in this regard was withdrawn. Meanwhile, the Forest Department closed Akamala, Poongode, and Ponganamkad Forest stations.

12 June 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||For them, home is where the library is||Deprived of outdoor games, friends, and facilities such as libraries, children are among the worst affected during the COVID-19-induced lockdown. A teacher in Thrissur has taken an innovative step to positively engage her students during these worrying times. P.U. Daya of Sree Ramakrishna Gurukula Vidyamandir Lower Primary School, Puranattukara, has arranged a small library at the houses of all students in her class. “We have a library in the school and a small collection of books in each class. But due to the lockdown, students are not able to access these books. My aim is to inculcate the habit of reading in children from a tender age, so as to engage them creatively,” she says. There were 42 students in her class, III B, in the last academic year. Students of the school are mostly from families in Adattu grama panchayat. Ms. Daya organised books for her students with the support of various publishers. There are 100 copies of Pularithuval , poet P.K. Gopi’s latest book for children, in the library. She added books from her own library too to the collection. “Arranging books for every house during lockdown was difficult,” she says. She asked parents to buy books instead of other gifts for children. The students were asked to collect books from neighbours too. “Everyone cooperated,” she says. A surprise gift There are 10-100 books in the personal libraries of each student now. At the school reopening on June 1, her student P.V. Diya gave a surprise gift to her teacher by reciting one of the poems from Pularithuval . Ms. Daya plans to extend her effort to other classes too this academic year. “Children should grow up reading. Their home should become a library.

A young painter from Thrissur has drawn the entire Left Democratic Front government Ministers on a bottle. N.G.

Among the easiest were Ministers Veena George and K. Rajan,” says Gopika. All the ministers were drawn in just one bottle. When she sent the video of the work to Revenue Minister K. Rajan, he agreed to meet the artist. She presented the work to the Minister.

12 June 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC upholds CCI order to probe Amazon, Flipkart||In a setback to e-commerce majors Amazon and Flipkart, the Karnataka High Court on Friday upheld the Competition Commission of India’s January 2020 order to conduct an investigation through its Director General into whether the companies had entered into anti-competitive agreements in violation of the provisions of the Competition Act 2002. Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar passed the order while dismissing the petitions filed by Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd., and Flipkart Internet Pvt. Ltd. The e-commerce companies had questioned January 13 order of the CCI, which had ordered probe through its Director General. “It is expected that an order directing investigation be supported by 'some reasoning', which the Commission has fulfilled. Therefore, it would be unwise to prejudge the issues raised by the petitioners in these writ petitions at this stage and scuttle the investigation. Therefore, the impugned order does not call for any interference,” the Court said. While vacating the stay granted in February 2020 on CCI’s January 13, 2020 order for investigation, the High Court said that an order, passed by the Commission for investigation under Section 26(1) of the Act, is an 'administrative direction' to one of its wings departmentally and without entering upon any adjudicatory process. On contention of the companies that CCI had not given them prior notices before ordering investigation, the Court said that the Section 26(1) of the Act does not mention about issuance of any notice to any party before or at the time of formation of an opinion by the Commission on the basis of information received by it requiring investigation into certain agreements and dominant position of enterprise. The High Court also agreed with the contention of the CCI that there is no bar on conducting a parallel investigation by its DG when the Enforcement Directorate is conducting a probe against the two companies on the allegation of violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999. The CCI had acted on a complaint by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (DVM), which had alleged that Amazon and Flipkart were giving preference to select sellers and this has led to foreclosure of 'non-preferred sellers' from the online market places; offering deep discounts by indulging in anti-competitive agreements. The High Court, on February 14 2020, had passed an interim order staying the CCI’s order. Following this, the CCI had approached the apex court, which in October 2020 had asked the CCI to approach the High Court. With Friday’s order, the Director-General can proceed with the investigation and submit a report to the CCI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-upholds-cci-order-to-probe-amazon-flipkart/article34793782.ece

Forest officials heaved a sigh of relief after it came to light that 20 other elephants of the herd had escaped unhurt. The fresh casualty is the twelfth in Chittoor district in the last two years. According to information, the herd was found moving close to the fields late on Thursday night. Around midnight, some villagers rushed to the fields to prevent the herd from damaging groundnut crops. The noise generated by the farmers led to confusion among the pachyderms and they ran helter-skelter. In the melee, a sub-adult female uprooted an electrical pole. The overhead unwired power lines snapped and fell on the jumbo, killing it on the spot, while the others had advanced forward and did not make an attempt to return. Meanwhile, the farmers on their way to the fields on Friday found the carcass of the elephant with snapped power lines wrapped around it. Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West) S. Ravi Shankar conducted enquiries with the villagers, forest watchers and elephant trackers. He said the circumstances leading to the casualty would be thoroughly probed. “The elephant uprooted a power pole, which was whitewashed. The elephants’ aversion to white-coloured objects could be a reason for it to uproot the pole,” he said. After a post-mortem, the carcass was cremated at a forest location , while some locals conducted prayers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jumbo-dies-after-uprooting-electricity-pole-in-chittoor/article34794442.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday appealed to Union Minister of Railways, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Piyush Goyal to release the pending arrears of Rs. 3,229 crore to the A.P. State Civil Supplies Corporation, as it would come in handy for paying farmers towards rabi crop procurement. During discussions held at Rail Bhavan in New Delhi, Mr. Jagan said free rice distribution would continue for two more months due to COVID-19, adding that effective measures were being taken by the government to overcome the pandemic crisis.  Food Security Act “Under the National Food Security Act, till December 2015, nearly 1.29 crore ration card holders in the State were provided with 1,85,640 MT of rice every month, but after December 2015, considering 2011 Census, the distribution has been limited to only 60.96% households in rural areas and 41.14% households in urban areas, where only 0.91 crore ration card holders are receiving the ration and the allocation was reduced to 1,54,148 MT,” Mr. Jagan said. He said this was a serious injustice to the State, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat were receiving more supplies. The Chief Minister pointed out that the allocation basis for ration rice was decided before the bifurcation of the State, where all the allocations in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were being carried out on the same basis without any reality check. He reminded the Supreme Court verdict stating that the State government was responsible for identifying those eligible for ration cards and in this regard, the government had surveyed and identified 1.47 crore ration card holders. Further, he said that the poor were suffering severely due to unreasonable restrictions under the National Food Security Act, where the burden was being carried by the State government and appealed that it be rectified at the earliest possible. He said that the government was procuring paddy for 2020-21 rabi season, providing remunerative prices to farmers and ensuring timely payments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-urges-goyal-to-release-arrears-to-civil-supplies-corporation/article34794444.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy’s visit to New Delhi was aimed at garnering funds for the development of the State. Mr. Reddy said Mr. Jagan had met five Union Ministers and Vice-Chairman of Niti Aayog and discussed several pending issues. “How can the Opposition play dirty politics by claiming that these meetings have a hidden agenda. These meetings had nothing to do with politics. It was N. Chandrababu Naidu who used to make secret pacts with the Centre and it is well known that he has compromised Special Category Status (SCS) to the State by accepting special packages,” said Mr. Reddy. Mr. Reddy lashed out at TDP and a section of the media for politicising the Delhi tour, and said the Chief Minister had been trying sincerely to get resources to the State which has been hit financially due to COVID-19. “Even a senior leader like Yanamala Ramakrishnudu had alleged that the Chief Minister had visited New Delhi to save himself from cases. If this is the case, why were the cases not waived till now, as he visited Delhi many times,” said Mr. Reddy. He came down heavily on Mr. Naidu for claiming credit for release of Godavari water to delta through spillway, and said Mr. Naidu had delayed the works for three years to get his package, he alleged. “Mr. Jagan went to Delhi with a list of issues and has requested the Centre regarding civil supplies pending arrears, infrastructure in newly formed colonies, Polavaram project, decentralisation of administration and Special Category Status,” said Mr. Reddy. He said that they had requested to appoint a Supreme Court judge to solve bifurcation problems and added that there won’t be any solution to these problems through conflicts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tour-aimed-at-securing-more-funds-for-state-sajjala/article34794446.ece

12 June 2021||Harish Gilai,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ganja smuggling on the rise in Visakha Agency, say officials||Ganja smugglers appear to be taking advantage of the partial curfew to ship huge quantity of the contraband from the interior parts of Visakha Agency to other States. This is evident from the series of smuggling rackets being busted by the district police and the seizure of a huge quantity of the dry ganja. The district police had registered 101 smuggling cases with the seizure of 16,926 kg of contraband and arrest of 200 persons between January 1 and April 30. From May 1 to till date, the district and the city police have registered over 20 cases and seized over 15,362 kg (15.3 tonnes) ganja, which includes over 12,000 kg by the district police alone. The police arrested 58 persons in these cases. For the first time, the city police, a couple of days ago, seized around 3,000 kg near Lankelapalem. The seized ganja is estimated to be worth around Rs. 4 crore in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam, but it could fetch close to Rs. 15 crore in other States, according to the officials. The recent seizures include around 2,645 kg and 3,040 kg at Sabbavaram, 3,000 kg at Lankelapalem, 2,160 kg at Makavarapalem, 1,920 kg ganja at Narsipatnam and 1,150 kg ganja at Araku. Similarly, the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) has also detected a few ganja cases, including around 1,100 kg seizure in Ananthagiri mandal a few days ago. According to a senior police officer, with the police being busy in enforcing partial curfew throughout the day, the smugglers are suspected to be transporting the contraband camouflaged under loads of vegetables and other daily essentials. Assuming that police have shifted their focus on COVID-19 containment, the smugglers might be resuming their activities, he added. A few officials from the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) said that due to the curfew and lockdown, the consumption of ganja in several States has come down. ‘Good demand’ “Ganja from Vizag Agency has a good demand in several States. As most of the States are suffering due to COVID-19, we assume the sale and consumption of ganja has been hit. With cases coming down gradually and the government increasing relaxation timings, ganja smugglers are anticipating demand in the coming months and are transporting the stock,” said a former excise official, who works with the SEB, Visakhapatnam district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ganja-smuggling-on-the-rise-in-visakha-agency-say-officials/article34794460.ece
12 June 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Approval for Covaxin in U.S. set to take longer||In a development bound to extend timelines for Covaxin to get approval in the U.S., vaccine maker Bharat Biotech’s partner Ocugen Inc has been advised by US Food and Drug Administration to seek a Biologics License Application (BLA) instead of Emergency Use Authorisation, for the vaccine. “Although we were close to finalising our EUA application for submission, we received a recommendation from the FDA to pursue a BLA path. While this will extend our timelines, we are committed to bringing Covaxin to the U.S.,” said Shankar Musunuri, CEO and co-founder of Ocugen. The US firm, which is co-developing Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine candidate for COVID-19 in the U.S. and Canadian markets, said it will no longer pursue an EUA for Covaxin. This follows the regulator’s feedback regarding the master file it had previously submitted, the firm said. USFDA “recommended that Ocugen pursue a BLA submission instead of an EUA application for its vaccine candidate and requested additional information and data.” Stating this, the firm said it is in discussions with the regulator to understand the additional information required to support a BLA submission. The company anticipates that data from an additional clinical trial will be required to support the submission, it said. Separately, Bharat Biotech, which has developed Covaxin in collaboration with the ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), said “with good herd immunity and a significant percentage of the population vaccinated, the pandemic is reducing in the U.S. On the sidelines of this, the USFDA had earlier communicated that no new EUA would be approved for new COVID-19 vaccines.” Stating that its US partner Ocugen has received a recommendation from the FDA to pursue BLA path for Covaxin, which is "full approval,” the Hyderabad-based firm said all applications have to follow the BLA process, the standard process for vaccines. “Therefore, for BLA, data from an additional clinical trial will be required to support the marketing application submission for Covaxin. This process will extend our timelines,” it also said. In the same statement, Ocugen, which had recently announced securing exclusive rights to commercialise Covaxin in Canada, said it has initiated discussions with Health Canada for regulatory approval.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covaxin-approval-in-us-may-take-longer/article34794324.ece
12 June 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Eatala ouster shows KCR’s arrogance: Chugg||Senior BJP leaders led by State in-charge and general secretary Tarun Chugh held a luncheon meeting with expelled TRS minister Eatala Rajender at his house on Friday to discuss his joining the party in New Delhi on Monday. Later, Mr. Chugh spoke to media persons when he said the ouster of Mr. Rajender from the Cabinet reflected the arrogance of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and struggle for self-respect by Mr. Rajender. The voice of Mr. Rajender against the arrogance, corruption and family rule of Mr. Rao was scuttled both within the party and outside. It appeared that separate Telangana was a reality only for the benefit of KCR’s family. The objective of statehood was lost. Mr. Rajender was forced out of TRS because he spoke the language of BJP against Mr. Rao within the party. The BJP was committed to ending the dictatorial rule and arrogance of KCR. For this, the party would take along all the workers and leaders who wished to go along. Arrogance would be defeated and family rule would end in the State, Mr. Chugh added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/eatala-ouster-shows-kcrs-arrogance-chugh/article34794346.ece

12 June 2021||MALAPPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||His hobby is a ticket to the old normal||Hamza Mundummal, a 46-year-old trader from Perinthalmanna in Malappuram, has a unique hobby. He has created several albums with tickets of all films he watched in theatres. From Rs. 2 to Rs. 130, the price range and the tickets Mr. Hamza has preserved will perhaps surprise the new generation cinema buffs. He has neatly kept over 1,100 of them in half a dozen albums, with the name of the movie and the date of watching written on each. But Mr. Hamza is not an ardent movie fan. He says he only used to go to theatres with friends on weekends. “It has been more of a social engagement for me. But I collected all the tickets of the movies I have seen since 1991. There are tickets collected until the lockdown brought closure of cinemas in Kerala due to COVID-19,” says Mr. Hamza. The hobby of Mr. Hamza, who runs a roof tile shop at Manjeri, evoked curiosity in his neighbourhood when his children shared the albums with friends. Mr. Hamza has in his possession the tickets of Kadinte Makkal , the first film that he watched at Alankar Theatre, Perinthalmanna, and Kappela , the last one that he caught at Vismaya Theatre, Perinthalmanna. “The biggest change I find in cinema tickets is in colour and size. Until a few years ago, cinema tickets used to bear peculiar colours and were small. But these days, larger, computer-generated tickets are not colourful and do not last much longer either as the print fades within days,” says Mr. Hamza. UAE ticket He possesses tickets of films that ran in theatres not only in Perinthalmanna, Kozhikode, and Thrissur, but also in Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the United Arab Emirates. “The UAE film ticket was the most expensive,” he said. Several theatres that he has bought tickets from have become memories now. “It is sad to see the sites of some of theatres that have since been demolished. Some have changed their names,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/his-hobby-is-a-ticket-to-the-old-normal/article34793790.ece
12 June 2021||Mangaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sri Lankan nationals staying illegally in Mangaluru held||The Mangaluru city police on Friday announced the arrest of 38 Sri Lankan nationals who could be part of a human trafficking racket. They had been staying illegally in the city for about two months. The police also arrested six people who had allegedly arrangedtheir stay here. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar told reporters that the arrests were made based on inputs from intelligence agencies as well as their Tamil Nadu counterparts. The foreigners were picked up from Hotel Sea Port on Azizuddin Road near Bunder, City Lodge at Rao and Rao Circle, and two houses at Bengre. The foreigners and their handlers are said to have told the owners of the accommodations that they were workers in fishing boats. Cases under the Indian Penal Code, Foreigners Act and Rules, and Passport Act have been registered against them at Mangaluru South police station. According to initial inquiry, the foreigners, mostly from North Lanka, landed at Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu in boats on March 17. They were supposed to be taken to Canada by the sea route thereafter. Since vigilance was intensified in Tamil Nadu for the Assembly polls, they were sent out to Karnataka, initially to Bengaluru and then to Mangaluru by road. They had reportedly paid up to 10 lakh Sri Lankan rupees to agents for moving to Canada. Mr. Kumar said people from Sri Lanka had earlier too moved to Canada seeking asylum. Some of them were in touch with those now attempting to move to Canada and had told the foreigners that they could get good jobs in Canada. The Tamil Nadu police have already arrested 40 more persons, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sri-lankan-nationals-staying-illegally-in-mangaluru-held/article34793786.ece

12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Italy has paid Rs. 10 crore, Centre tells SC||The Central government informed the Supreme Court on Friday that Italy had paid Rs. 10 crore compensation for disbursal among the families of fishermen shot dead/injured by two Italian marines detailed on Enrica Lexie , an Italian-flagged vessel in 2012, who mistook them for pirates off the coast of Kerala. Earlier this year, the government approached the court for closure of the pending trial against marines Salvatore Girone and Massimiliano Latorre, following a United National tribunal decision that the duo would be tried in Italy. On April 9, the court said it would consider passing an order to quash the criminal proceedings only after Italy deposited Rs. 10 crore as compensation for the bereaved families of the fishermen. “They [Italy] have deposited Rs. 10 crore. This is compensation over and above the ex gratia amount paid earlier to the families. We have accepted the award of the tribunal as a nation. Kerala has filed an affidavit, saying Rs. 10 crore is acceptable to it. The affidavit has annexed letters of consent from the families also,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, submitted. For Italy, advocate Suhail Dutt, submitted that India’s jurisdiction over the marines had stopped as soon as Italy paid the compensation amount. Rs. 4 cr. each to 2 families The court, however, asked how the money would be apportioned among the families. The lawyer for the victims’ side said the two families would get Rs. 4 crore each while the owner of the boat on which the fishermen were sailing would get Rs. 2 crore. Kerala government lawyer, senior advocate K.N. Balagopal, said compensation could be paid to the victims through the State government. The court expressed concern about whether the money received as compensation would be “frittered away” once it reached the families. The Bench asked whether any orders should be passed to protect the capital, like putting it in a fixed deposit, for the time being. “Four crore is not a small amount... It should not be frittered away. How do we protect their [families’] interests,” Justice Shah asked. The victims’ lawyer said the legal heirs of the fishermen have attained the age of majority. Mr. Balagopal said the State had earlier conducted a preliminary verification of the legal heirs and found them responsible. The money the families had earlier received as ex gratia payments had been utilised well. Justice Shah suggested that the Supreme Court dispose of the case by asking the Kerala High Court to disburse the amount. The Bench finally shifted the case to Tuesday for passing orders. In April, the Supreme Court directed that the Republic of Italy transfer the compensation amount to an account number, which would be handed over to it by the Ministry of External Affairs. The Ministry would in turn deposit the money with the Supreme Court. The international tribunal’s finding that the marines had immunity came seven years after the Supreme Court ordered the Centre to “proceed with the investigation and trial of the marines” in a decision on January 18, 2013. The Supreme Court had ordered the Centre to set up a special court to try the case. Prior to the Supreme Court verdict, the Kerala High Court had also found that the marines enjoyed no immunity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/italy-has-paid-rs-10-crore-centre-tells-sc/article34793792.ece

12 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||SIT to probe felling of trees in Wayanad||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday announced a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the illegal felling of centuries-old rosewood trees from revenue land assigned to farmers for cultivation in the forested Wayanad district. Mr. Vijayan said the scale of the environmental crime warranted a joint investigation by the Forest Department, Crime Branch and Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB). Suspects had twisted a Revenue Department order allowing farmers to harvest trees they had cultivated on assigned land to steal the protected and rare species. An official said the illegal felling detected in Wayanad was just the tip of the iceberg. The Forest and Revenue Departments and the police Intelligence had reportedly conducted a random survey and concluded that there could be a similar loss of protected trees from assigned land in other localities. Investigators said the crime was multifaceted. It involved manipulating revenue records, government orders and connivance of forest and revenue officials at multiple levels. Hence, the government felt that varied agencies should probe the case jointly to investigate the different aspects of the offence. They said a set of timber merchants, depot owners, transporters, Revenue and Forest Department officials would come under the ambit of the probe. Some of the officials risked facing corruption charges. The SIT required to move fast to quantify the loss of timber and confiscate the loot. The crime entailed convincing farmers to permit the felling of hardwood trees on their assigned land. Some landholders were taken in by the government order furnished by the accused. Others had knowingly conspired with the offenders. Such persons could face prosecution and cancellation of their land assignment, including loss of title deed, officials said. Oppn. charge The South Muttil tree felling had given a stick to the Congress and the BJP to assail the government. The Opposition had walked out of the Assembly on June 8, accusing the government of issuing the dubious order that led to the illegal felling.  Suspects twisted a Revenue Department order allowing farmers to harvest trees they cultivated on assigned land to steal the protected and rare species.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sit-to-probe-felling-of-trees-in-wayanad/article34793787.ece

The Manuguru Area has earned the praise of the top brass of the State-owned coal mining giant for recording 124% production growth with a whopping coal production of 10.96 lakh tonnes as against the set output target of 8,88,000 tonnes last month. The Kothagudem Area comprising two underground coal mines and two Opencast Projects has produced 10.12 lakh tonnes of coal, recording 100% growth. The Yellandu Area too followed suit by clocking 5.65 lakh tonnes of coal exceeding the set monthly target of 5.35 lakh tonnes in May this fiscal. The overall coal production in all the 11 coal mining areas of the Singareni Collieries Company Limited together stood at 54.4 lakh tonnes last month.

12 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID-19 duty hits property mutations in GHMC||Huge number of applications for property mutations are lying unresolved with GHMC, adding to the woes of the property owners and denting the income of the corporation. The number of pending applications for property mutations hovers about 20,000 in GHMC, and the pendency has increased fourfold since March this year, as per official sources. GHMC staff on COVID-19 duty is not helping the matters, say officials on the condition of anonymity. Pending applications are especially high in circles such as Serilingampally, Chandanagar, followed by Begumpet, Khairatabad, Musheerabad and Goshamahal. Mutation is a mandatory requirement in GHMC records when a property changes hands either through sale or through inheritance. A large number of properties remain in the previous owners’ names in GHMC records, due to apathy of the latest owners in having the mutations effected even after getting them changed in Revenue records. After recent reforms in the property registrations, data about the property sale and mutations are arriving to GHMC directly from the Registrations department. Officials attribute the large pendency of applications to the registrations done without mentioning the Property Tax Identification Number (PTIN). PTIN details “We are having to collect the door numbers of the properties, and send them to the Centre for Good Governance so that they push the respective Circle officials to obtain the PTIN. It is consuming a lot of time,” informed an official. Close to 8,300 applications are pending across the 30 circles due to non-availability of PTIN. Over 4000 applications with PTIN too have remained unresolved, while over 7,600 applications which were received directly from property owners through Citizen Service Centres too are awaiting action. Since last year, several applications have been resolved in mission mode upon instructions from the GHMC Commissioner D. S. Lokesh Kumar bringing down the pendency to about 5,000 applications by March this year, officials informed. However, the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has hampered the work severely, as the bill collectors and Revenue staff have been deployed on COVID duty. “Our staff were even deployed in graveyards. Now majority of them are on vaccination duty,” said the official.  Our staff were even deployed in graveyards. Now majority of them are on vaccination duty.

12 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Centre, State looting people: Cong.||With petrol hitting Rs. 100 mark and diesel price at its highest ever, Telangana Congress leaders and cadre across the State staged protest at petrol stations across the State and blamed the BJP government at the Centre and the TRS government in the State for filling their coffers ‘looting people’ even in the pandemic. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy who staged a protest at Secretariat petrol station said petrol prices had risen by Rs. 25 and diesel by Rs. 23.90 in just one year. Both Modi and KCR governments at the Central and state levels had made life miserable for people. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has got the dubious distinction of raising the prices of petrol and diesel for 43 times in one year,” he said. Mr. Reddy said that since coming to power in 2014, both BJP and TRS had increased taxes on petrol, diesel and gas frequently. He said that the retail price of LPG refill had doubled, from around Rs. 410 in 2014 to around Rs. 850 now. The TPCC chief reminded that in April 2014, when UPA-II demitted office, excise duty on litre petrol was Rs. 9.48 and diesel was Rs. 3.56. Excise duty had now increased by over 2.5 times on petrol and almost 8 times on diesel. TPCC working president and Malkajgiri MP, A. Revanth Reddy who led protests at Ghatkesar on city outskirts targeted the PM and CM saying both had been inhuman in their approach when millions had lost jobs. Out of the Rs. 100 per litre Modi is levying a tax of Rs. 33 while KCR is collecting Rs. 32 per litre, he said speaking at Ghatkesar petrol station where a large number of cadre gathered. The Malkajgiri MP argued that BJP government earned Rs. 3 lakh crore as excise duty in 2020 while it collected Rs. 11 lakh crore from 2014 to 2018. “This is nothing but looting. Hike has impacted all the sectors that are directly related to the common man like transport and essential commodities.” CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, who led the protests in Khammam said the UPA government did not pass on the burden to the common man when the crude oil prices in the international market were more than US$ 105 per barrel. Now though the prices havd come down by 50% in the international market Modi government had doubled the prices. Criticising the TRS government, leaders said the Congress government in combined AP had levied VAT of 31% on petrol and 22.25% on diesel. But the TRS government was collecting a VAT of 35.2% on petrol and 27% on diesel. TPCC working president, Ponnam Prabhakar and MLAs T. Jayaprakash Reddy, Seethakka, D. Sreedhar Babu, and AICC secretary Sampath Kumar held protests in their constituencies. Novel protests were held across the State. In Himayathnagar TPCC general secretary Vinod Reddy rode a rickshaw from Himayathnagar to Liberty to register his protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-state-looting-people-cong/article34794348.ece
12 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Flipkart to lead consortium on drone delivery of medicines||E-commerce firm Flipkart will lead a consortium tasked with development and execution of drone deliveries to remote areas under the ‘Medicines from the Sky’ project in Telangana. Learnings from its tech-enabled supply chain will be utilised to deploy drones and enable deliveries of vaccine and medical supplies. These efforts will be complemented with technologies such as geo mapping, routing of shipments and track and trace of location, developed by the company over the years, Flipkart said on Friday. A combination of these technologies will be used to conduct Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) deliveries in remote areas of the State where road infrastructure is not conducive for fast delivery of vaccines. The pilot project, which is expected to be conducted for over six days, will be tested out for delivering thousands of vaccines while keeping in mind all the safety and efficiency parameters, a release from the firm said. Senior Vice-President and Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Rajneesh Kumar said “We are proud to partner Telangana government in leading the consortium by utilising our nuanced understanding of supply chain and technologies governing automated movement of shipments. This pilot [project] will set the premise for the utilisation of drone systems in providing healthcare and product delivery in remote areas and even during disasters.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/flipkart-to-lead-consortium-on-drone-delivery-of-medicines/article34794325.ece
12 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Severity of COVID different for Europeans, South Asians’||In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is still unclear why some people experience more severe symptoms and adverse outcomes than others. An earlier research done on European population suggested variations in a specific DNA segment strongly associated with severe COVID-19 infection and hospitalisation. This DNA segment is present in 50% of South Asians as compared to 16% of Europeans. An international team of scientists have analysed the role of this DNA segment in determining COVID-19 outcomes among the South Asian population and they concluded that the “genetic variants responsible for COVID-19 severity among Europeans may not play a role in COVID-19 susceptibility among South Asians.” This finding has been published in the journal Scientific Reports . “We have compared infection and case fatality rates with South Asian genomic data over three different timelines during the pandemic. We have especially looked into a large number of populations from India and Bangladesh,” said Director, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics & chief scientist, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Dr Thangaraj, here on Friday. The study was directed by him and Banaras Hindu University’s Prof. Gyaneshwer Chaubey. “Our result reiterates the unique genetic origin of South Asian populations. A dedicated genome-wide association study on South Asian COVID-19 patients is the need of the hour for us in the Asian sub-continent,” said BHU’s Prajival Pratap Singh, first author of this study. The study also suggests that the genetic variants correlated with COVID-19 outcomes differ significantly among caste and tribal populations of Bangladesh. “Scientists working in the area of population studies should be more cautious to interpret their findings by differentiating caste and tribal populations, more explicitly so in the Bangladeshi population”, said University of Bern (Switzerland) Prof George van Driem, a renowned linguist and co-author. “With growing data, it is becoming quite clear that there are several factors including genetics, immunity and the lifestyle are the contributing factor for COVID-19 susceptibility. CCMB’s expertise in population studies are proving useful in understanding these details of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said CCMB Director Dr Vinay Nandicoori. Other researchers of this study include: BHU’s Anshika Srivastava, Nargis Khanam, Dr Abhishek Pathak and Prof Royana Singh, Dr Gazi Sultana from Dhaka University, Bangladesh; Dr Pankaj Shrivastava, Forensic Science Laboratory, Sagar, MP., and Dr Prashanth Suravanjhala, Birla Institute of Scientific Research, Jaipur.

12 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Muslims face social exclusion and physical threats: Asad||Hyderabad parliamentarian Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday said that Muslims face a double whammy of social exclusion and physical threats, and that there is a pressing need to discuss issues of social justice. Mr Owaisi was delivering the keynote address at the virtual release of the book Muslims in Telangana - A Discourse on Equity, Development and Security . The book has been edited by former bureaucrat G Sudhir, development economist Amir Ullah Khan, academician Prof Abdul Shaban, and educationalist M A Bari. Sharing his observations about the book, Mr Owaisi said, “Firstly, as the volume recognises, there is “double whammy” that Indian Muslims face. They face social exclusion, but also physical threats to life and property during communal pogroms and police atrocities. In addition to this, they also face a bureaucracy that does not take their concerns seriously,” even as he opined that backwardness is systematic and structural and is wrongly blamed on culture. He said that Muslims have been made relevant only in contexts of Hindu-Muslim or secular issues. While there is a need to celebrate communal harmony, there are other factors that affect the community, and there is a need to discuss issues of social justice. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president said that cultural explanations are given to the dismiss the concerns of Muslims. These include a lack of education being blamed on children being sent to madrassa, and an increase in their population on their faith, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/muslims-face-social-exclusion-and-physical-threats-asad/article34794329.ece
12 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC notices to two IAS officers for contempt of court||Telangana High Court on Friday directed Telangana State Public Service Commission Chairman B. Janardhan Reddy, who earlier worked as School Education Principal Secretary and present School Education Principal Secretary Sandeep Kumar Sultania to appear before it on June 16 in a contempt of court case. A division bench of Justices M.S. Ramachandra Rao and Abhinand Kumar Shavili issued notices to them in this regard. The contempt of court petition was filed by a person from Nimboliadda of Hyderabad, Mohd. Farooqi, seeking action against the State government officials for contempt of court as they failed to comply with the direction of a division bench in a writ appeal relating to his request for job on compassionate ground. The petitioner’s father Mohd. Fareeduddin, a government school head master, died in 2002. He applied for government job on compassionate ground in 2010. However, the government rejected his application as he was 15-years-old then. In 2017, he represented to the District Educational Officer to give him exemption in compassionate appointment. DEO forwarded the petition to District Collector who turned down the request. Eventually, the petitioner approached the School Education Principal Secretary. Following rejecting of his petition, Farooqi moved the HC. With the single judge of the HC dismissing his petition, he filed an appeal before a division bench which passed a direction in 2018 stating the matter should be resolved. Stating that the officials were not complying with the division bench’s order, he filed the contempt of court petition. During the hearing, the government counsel sought some time to implement the court direction stating that the file was in the Chief Minister’s Office for consideration. The bench observed the point for consideration was not where the file had been sent. It was a fact that the court direction was not enforced and it amounted to contempt of court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-notices-to-two-ias-officers-for-contempt-of-court/article34794340.ece

Kaushik Reddy is likely to join the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) after a picture of himself with TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao appeared on social media. Mr. P. Kaushik Reddy, who contested in Huzurabad against dismissed minister Eatala Rajender, has clarified that he met KTR by chance in the 10th day ceremony of his childhood friend’s father, who passed away recently. “KTR attended the 10th day ceremony and I also happened to be there. Nothing much should be read into it,” Mr. Reddy clarified in a video statement. “I will contest on the Congress ticket whenever the by-poll is held.” However, there were rumours of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) trying to lure him to offer the ticket once Mr. Rajender officially resigns and the by-poll is necessitated. Mr. Reddy, who garnered nearly 60,000 votes in the 2018 Assembly elections contesting against Mr Rajender, has been a severe critic of the latter. Mr. Reddy, who is also the cousin of TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, took to media alleging illegal land deals by Mr. Rajender soon after he was dismissed from the Cabinet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-leaders-picture-with-ktr-leads-to-rumours/article34794351.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao’s administrative bankruptcy. Mr. Bhatti said government’s responsibility was to save lands for future use and utilise them for public purpose and not sell them to make money. He criticised the Chief Minister for deciding to sell 33,000 acres with 1,000 acres in each district. KCR was trying to cover up his financial mismanagement to the tune of thousands of crores by selling government lands, he alleged. Mr. Bhatti said Congress governments since Independence had been safeguarding the lands and created public wealth by improving infrastructure rather than selling them to private parties. Lands were always used for public purposes but not to make money by the previous Congress governments. The CLP leader alleged that after exhausting all the public money and mismanaging the economy through irrational redesigning of irrigation projects the KCR government was now depending on selling the lands. “We created Telangana with Rs. 15,000-crore surplus budget and KCR in the last seven years has made Telangana debt-ridden state raising loans of Rs. 4 lakh crore.” It was unfortunate that CM had expressed his inability to save the lands and this was nothing but an excuse to loot the state.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/selling-lands-is-kcrs-administrative-bankruptcy/article34794349.ece

12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Speed limits revised for greater uniformity||In view of the traffic scenario and safety of road users, the Delhi Traffic Police on Friday enforced revised speed limits for all categories of motor vehicles on National Highways, the Ring Road and other important stretches in the Capital. Passenger vehicles The speed limit for M1 category vehicles is now 60-70 kmph for high speed/access-controlled roads, including stretches of National Highways passing through Delhi, Noida Toll Road, Saleemgarh Bypass Road, Barapullah Nallah, Northern Access Road, Central Spine Road, Ring Road, Outer Ring Road, Pusta Road and IGI Airport Road. Passenger vehicles comprising not more than eight seats in addition to driver’s seat such as cars and cabs fall under the M1 category. The speed limit for M1 category vehicles for all other arterial roads in areas between Ring Road and Outer Ring Road, beyond Outer Ring Road, inside Ring Road and entire Trans Yamuna area, is 50 now kmph. The speed limit for taxis and cabs is now at par with private cars on these roads, said the traffic police. The last revision of speed limits on majority of roads and stretches was undertaken in 2011. Thereafter, in 2017 and 2019, the speed limit for a few roads was further revised, said the traffic police. The maximum speed limit for two-wheelers on National Highways was 70 kmph, which has now been reduced to 60 kmph. Speed limits for two-wheelers is separately notified as 50 kmph on roads where speed limit of cars is 50 kmph, and 60 kmph on roads where it is 60-70 kmph. Meenu Choudhary, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic), said: “There have been a number of changes and improvements in the road infrastructure in the city in the past few years, including construction of flyovers, underpasses, high speed/signal-free corridors as well as improvement in vehicle technology. Further, there was a need to make speed limit uniform on Delhi roads as far as possible. Therefore, a revision of the existing speed limits was necessary.” “The maximum speed limit for M2 and M3 categories vehicles (passenger vehicles comprising nine or more seats in addition to the driver’s seat) has been notified as 50 kmph on roads where speed limit of cars is 50 kmph, and 60 kmph on roads where it is 60-70 kmph,” a police officer said. Transport vehicles “The speed limit for all types of transport vehicles, including Gramin Sewa, TSRs, Phat-Phat Sewa, Quadricycle, and N-category vehicles (goods vehicles), has been notified as 40 kmph,” the officer added. The speed limit in residential areas, markets, service lanes and minor roads is now 30 kmph. The speed limit for loops of flyovers is now 40 kmph. According to a police statement, then Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik had constituted a Speed Review Committee under the chairmanship of Taj Hassan, Special Commissioner of Police (Traffic). The committee included officers from the Delhi Traffic Police, expert members/officials from the Central Road Research Institute Delhi, and the Transport Department of the Delhi government to examine existing speed limits, through a notification dated April 6, 2018. The revised speed limits have been notified in the Delhi Gazette based on the recommendations of the committee. The Delhi Traffic Police has requested road-maintaining agencies to erect corresponding speed limit sign boards at all prominent locations, for guidance and convenience of all road users and the general public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/speed-limits-revised-for-greater-uniformity/article34794310.ece

A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel observed that the DPCC had failed to address relevant issues in the report furnished by it. “DPCC has filed a report in a careless manner, unmindful of its statutory duties. This calls for accountability of the chairman and the member secretary of the DPCC. Before taking action against the officers, we grant one more opportunity to take effective remedial action for enforcement of rule of law and environmental norms in coordination with other concerned authorities,” it said. In case of non-compliance, the erring officials would be held accountable and “dealt with sternly”, the Bench added, while noting that the DPCC had taken action against only two godowns instead of all the units that were in violation of the master plan. The directions came on a plea moved by petitioner Sunil Kumar against the operation of illegal garbage godowns in Soniya Vihar. The plea had contended that the units were releasing dangerous oxides and leading to noise and air pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/ngt-pulls-up-dpcc-over-illegal-godowns/article34794313.ece

DSEU will focus on building talents and skills of students,” Mr. Sisodia said, adding that instead of vying for grades, the university will enrol students based on an aptitude test which will be held in December-January. The aptitude test will focus on ‘360 degree assessment’ and will be a “revolutionary move” in education as most universities continue with the old practice of admitting students based on grade lists, said the government. “Universities like Oxford admit children based on conditions for them to complete courses and projects, not on their grades in Board exams. Similarly, our children can be secure in the fact that they will be admitted into a university that will not stress on their grades but on their intent and their interest to study skills and become entrepreneurs,” Mr. Sisodia said. “Generic undergraduate courses do not encourage students to become entrepreneurs and be future-ready... the government will encourage students to pursue vocational and skill courses,” he added. DSEU will have 12 job-oriented bachelor programmes and will offer internships in industries 50% of the time, the government said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/dseu-will-enrol-6000-students-says-sisodia/article34794305.ece
12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||DUTA asks V-C to set up COVID care facility||The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) has urged the university administration to take requisite measures and prepare for the next COVID-19 wave by setting up of a COVID care facility. A proposal for setting up an oxygen plant was discussed in a meeting with vice-chancellor P.C. Joshi on Thursday, said DUTA. DUTA president Rajib Ray said, “We discussed a proposal to set up an oxygen plant through contribution of teachers and employees. The V-C assured they are exploring various ways of materialising it, including requesting funds from the government. It was agreed that DUTA will join the appeal call in case the university requires raising funds for the plant.” The teachers’ body also demanded the inclusion of elected DUTA members in the university’s Covid Task Force. It also urged the administration to ensure that employees of the 12 colleges that are fully funded by the Delhi government get their salaries on time. “University officials were informed that most colleges are facing shortage and may not be able to give salaries of June and many have not been able to give full salaries for May. It is important that DU remind the Delhi government about the promise of Rs. 28 crore to settle the issue of this gap in grants and requirements,” added Mr. Ray.

Anirudh was arrested by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch on Thursday. A total of 10 people, including Mr. Kumar, have now been arrested in connection with the incident. The police produced Anirudh before Metropolitan Magistrate Divya Malhotra and sought his custody for seven days. The court, however, allowed his police interrogation for only four days. Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, representing the police, told the court that Anirudh’s custody is required as he has to be taken to Jammu. The court was also apprised that Anirudh has been spotted in the purported video of the brawl. Mr. Kumar and his associates allegedly assaulted wrestler Sagar Dhankar and two of his friends Sonu Mahal and Amit Kumar on the intervening night of May 4 and 5 over a property dispute. Mr. Dhankar, 23, succumbed to his injuries later. Sushil custody extended The two-time Olympic medallist faces charges of murder, culpable homicide, kidnapping and criminal conspiracy. Police have called him the “main culprit and mastermind” behind the alleged murder and said there is electronic evidence in which he and his associates could be seen beating Mr. Dhankar with sticks.

12 June 2021||Mumbai,||Bombay HC initiates inquiry into Malad building collapse||The Bombay High Court on Friday initiated judicial inquiry into the building collapse at Malwani in Malad, which killed 12 people. The court ordered that a preliminary report be filed on June 24.  A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni said the incident proved that there existed absolute lawlessness in the municipal wards. The Bench said it was pained by the incident, in which eight children lost their lives. The court took note of four incidents of building collapse from May 15 to June 10 this year, which resulted in the death of 24 people. The court said, “What is happening? How many lives will be lost? What type of buildings are these? Were they identified as dangerous or illegal, but not demolished, or were they not identified? You [the municipal corporation] can’t play with the lives of people. We have to hold those in charge of the ward concerned responsible. Eight innocent children died on the first day of the rains.” The court said, “This is nothing but lawlessness. You can realise the pain we are facing due to the death of people, including [of] innocent children. This pain should also be felt by the corporators. We are shocked. This is a man-made disaster. Every monsoon it has to happen. Why can’t it be prevented?” The court also told the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to ask Mayor Kishori Pednekar whether she had said that the civic body was not able to demolish buildings because of HC orders. The court said, “We are not going to tolerate politics over building collapses. We have said that if a building is dangerous or dilapidated, then the concerned authority should approach the court for demolition. We are surprised that despite giving liberty to the corporations to approach the courts, the corporations are shifting the blame on us.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bombay-hc-initiates-inquiry-into-malad-building-collapse/article34794000.ece

12 June 2021||MUMBAI,||HC: why can’t Centre start door-to-door vaccination||The Bombay High Court on Friday asked the Union government if it has different policies for different States on door-to-door vaccination. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni said it was unable to understand what the Centre’s problem was in starting door-to-door vaccination when Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir were doing it successfully. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh told the court that COVID-19 had a national impact and all States needed to work in coordination with the Centre. “The Centre formulates guidelines and it is expected of all State governments to follow them and update them from time to time.” The court, however, told Mr. Singh to take a uniform policy decision. “We want to save as many lives as possible. We are not able to understand what the Centre’s problem is. Why don’t you communicate with these States and if it appeals to you, you can ask other States to start the drive,” the court said. It asked the government to take a sound decision. “BMC Commissioner said ‘Chase The Virus’... It was a catchy phrase,” the court told the corporation’s counsel. “Did you have to take the permission from the Union for it?” The court said it was happy with the job being done by the BMC and asked why it was hesitant about introducing door-to-door vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-why-cant-centre-start-door-to-door-vaccination/article34793999.ece

The accused, Fazal Ayub Qureshi, had been arrested last year for his involvement in 22 chain snatching cases. “We identified Qureshi from CCTV footage,” said senior police inspector Giridhar Gore from Crime Branch’s Unit II.

Police teams were deployed near Vartak Nagar, Kalyan, Bhiwandi, Mumbra and Thane railway stations. The accused kept changing his location and was finally arrested from Kalyan on Wednesday. “We recovered two vehicles and gold chains worth Rs. 5 lakh,” Mr. Gore said.

12 June 2021||Carbis Bay,||G7 to pledge 1 bn vaccine shots for world||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson greeted world leaders at the Group of Seven (G7) summit on Friday, offering elbow bumps to dignitaries gathered for the first time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus was set to dominate their discussions, with leaders of the wealthy democracies’ club are set to commit to sharing at least 1 billion vaccine shots with struggling countries. A commitment from U.S. President Joe Biden to share 500 million doses and one from Mr. Johnson for another 100 million shots set the stage for the G7 meeting in southwest England, where leaders will pivot Friday from their “family photo” by the seaside directly into a session on “Building Back Better From COVID-19.” “We’re going to help lead the world out of this pandemic working alongside our global partners,” Mr. Biden said. The G7 also includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. The leaders hope the meeting in the resort of Carbis Bay will also energise the global economy. Despite the moody skies, the group walked away their photo as cheerful as children who had just built a sand castle. Led by Mr. Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron threw his arm around Mr. Biden’s shoulder. Talks were animated, but inaudible. Global minimum tax On Friday, they are set to formally embrace a global minimum tax of at least 15% on multinational corporations, following an agreement reached a week ago by their Finance Ministers. The minimum is meant to stop companies from using tax havens to shift profits and to avoid taxes. It represents a potential win for the Biden administration, which has proposed a global minimum tax as a way to pay for infrastructure projects, in addition to creating an alternative that could remove some European countries’ digital services taxes that largely hit U.S. tech firms. But the endorsement from the G7 is just one step in the process; the hope is to get many more countries to sign on — a fraught proposal in nations whose economies are based on attracting business with low corporate taxes. For Mr. Johnson, the first G7 summit in two years — last year’s was scuttled by the pandemic — is a chance to set out his vision of a post-Brexit “Global Britain” as a midsized country with an outsized role in international problem-solving. It’s also an opportunity to underscore the U.K-U.S. bond, an alliance often called the “special relationship” — but that Mr. Johnson said he prefers to call the “indestructible relationship.” Climate change is also a top issue on the agenda, and hundreds of protesters gathered in Cornwall to urge the leaders to take action. Demonstrators deployed a barge off the coast with two large inflatable figures depicting Mr. Biden and Mr. Johnson on board. At another protest, demonstrators carried flags that read “G7 drowning in promises” and “Action not words.” The official summit business kicked off on Friday, with the customary formal greeting and a socially distanced group photo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/g7-to-pledge-1-bn-vaccine-shots-for-world/article34793711.ece
12 June 2021||London,||Johnson hails U.K.’s ‘indestructible’ ties with U.S.||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the U.K.-U.S. relationship as “indestructible” after his first meeting with President Joe Biden ahead of the G7 leaders’ summit on Friday. “It’s a relationship, you can call it the ‘deep and meaningful relationship’, whatever you want, the ‘indestructible relationship’,” Mr. Johnson said. “It’s a relationship that has endured for a very long time, and has been an important part of peace and prosperity both in Europe and around the world.” During their meeting on Thursday, the two leaders discussed “about 25 subjects in some detail”, including the Brexit-induced disruption in Northern Ireland, he said. Mr. Johnson played down the displeasure of Mr. Biden, who is proud of his Irish origins, over London’s attempts to reverse the “Northern Ireland Protocol”, which seeks to avoid the return of a border with EU member Ireland but which has disrupted trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. “Everybody has a massive interest in making sure that we keep the essential symmetry of the Good Friday Agreement,” which ended three decades of conflict in the British-ruled province. In his meeting with Mr. Biden, Mr. Johnson said he also raised the case of British teenager Harry Dunn, who was killed in a road accident caused by the wife of an American diplomat. She fled the country, claiming diplomatic immunity. Mr. Biden was “actively engaged in the case”, Mr. Johnson said. “As you know, he has his own personal reasons for feeling very deeply about the issue,” he said, referring to Mr. Biden losing his first wife and one-year-old daughter in a car accident in 1972.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/johnson-hails-uks-indestructible-ties-with-us/article34793719.ece

Mr. Netanyahu says he is the victim of a “deep state” conspiracy. “They are uprooting the good and replacing it with the bad and dangerous,” Mr. Netanyahu told Channel 20 TV station this week. “I fear for the destiny of the nation.” Mr. Netanyahu and his loyalists are making a final desperate push to try to prevent a new government from taking office on Sunday.

12 June 2021||Geneva,||Myanmar violence escalating, creating rights catastrophe: UN||The UN rights chief said on Friday that violence was escalating across Myanmar, warning that the country had plunged into a “human rights catastrophe” since the February 1 coup. Pointing to reported military build-up in several regions of the country, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called for a halt to the already spiralling violence to avert even greater loss of life and a deepening humanitarian emergency. “In just over four months, Myanmar has gone from being a fragile democracy to a human rights catastrophe,” she said in a statement, adding that the military leadership was “singularly responsible” for the crisis. The country has been in turmoil since the generals ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1. The UN rights office pointed on Friday to credible reports showing that at least 860 civilians had been killed in a brutal crackdown by security forces on near-daily protests against the coup. Fighting has flared in several communities -- especially in townships that have seen a high death toll at the hands of police -- and some locals have formed “defence forces”. Ms. Bachelet pointed to intensifying violence in many parts of Myanmar, including Kayah State, Chin State and Kachin State. Human shields “State security forces have continued to use heavy weaponry, including air strikes, against armed groups and against civilians and civilian objects, including Christian churches,” she said. She pointed to “credible reports” that security forces have used civilians as human shields, shelled civilian homes and churches, and blocked humanitarian access, including by attacking aid workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-violence-escalating-creating-rights-catastrophe-un/article34793716.ece
12 June 2021||COLOMBO,||China-Sri Lanka Friendship Hospital opened||President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Friday inaugurated the China-Sri Lanka Friendship Hospital in Polonnaruwa, built with a Chinese grant of $60 million. The hospital, located in Sri Lanka’s North Central Province, will specialise in treating kidney ailments, a widely prevalent and recurring concern in the region, especially among farmers. For years now, residents of this agriculture-intensive area have been frequently diagnosed with a kidney disorder that the country’s medical experts have identified as Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu), a condition for which causal factors remain unknown. Following a request from former President Maithripala Sirisena during his time in office — he is from and currently represents Polonnaruwa in Parliament — the Chinese government provided the grant. The facility was built within 30 months, a press release from the President’s office said. The hospital, said to be one of the largest in South Asia for nephrology care, with a capacity of 200 beds, follows China’s earlier grant projects in Sri Lanka, also built as large public spaces, such as the well-known Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall in Colombo, that Beijing gifted in the 1970s, and the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Threate, that China funded during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s time in office. In addition to sanctioning loans and a currency swap facility worth more than $2 billion since the pandemic struck last year, China also announced $90 million grant to Sri Lanka in October last year, following a request from President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, when a high-powered Chinese delegation visited the island nation. Meanwhile, the Jaffna Cultural Centre, built with Indian assistance of $11.5 million, whose construction was completed a year ago, awaits inauguration as authorities “iron out” issues over the administrative set up to the run the Centre. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking in February at an election rally in Chennai, ahead of the Tamil Nadu Assembly polls, said he hoped to open the Centre in Jaffna “soon”.

12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Persecuted in Pakistan, ignored in India||For two decades, Jogdas Maharaj waited in vain for Indian citizenship. Last month, the 82-year-old man, highly respected  in the Kali Beri settlement of Pakistani Hindu migrants near Jodhpur, Rajasthan, died stateless. Maharaj crossed the border into India with nine family members in August 2000. He decided to stay in the country, in Jodhpur, to escape the economic hardship and discrimination he was facing in Rahimyar Khan district in the Punjab Province of Pakistan. “Our father passed away waiting for citizenship. Our family has 19 members and we have nowhere to go,” says Harjiram Bheel, Maharaj’s son. Bheel says the family has been wandering from one citizenship camp to another over the years. These camps were organised by the Union Home Ministry from time to time to receive new applications for citizenship and dispose of or clear old ones. But the camps have not been successful because of red-tapism. Bheel’s family is one among many whose Pakistani passports and Indian visas have expired. Karamshi Koli, 43, who migrated to India in 2015, lives as an asylum-seeker in the Anganwa hutment. Koli says he has not even succeeded in getting a long-term visa which would enable him to find a private job or take up self-employment to sustain his family. The weary residents of the mud houses in Anganwa, adjacent to a water filtration plant, have no access to electricity, water, toilets and sanitation facilities. Women and children fetch water from a well in the Shri Khetanand temple situated 2 km away, while solar lights — some donated by philanthropists and some purchased by some of the migrants — are used at night. The number of Pakistani Hindu migrants staying in 21 settlements in Jodhpur district is estimated to be about 30,000. The land where they have built their ramshackle dwellings belongs either to the Municipal Corporation or the village panchayats and Forest Department. These migrants came to India expectantly, but their eagerness has turned into disillusionment over time. They are unhappy with the way they are being treated in a country which they had hoped would accept them wholeheartedly and they could call home. No sense of belonging Young Laxman Singh, who hails from Sindh’s Mirpur Khas district, says unhappily that migrants like him seem to belong nowhere. “We faced persecution on the ground of our religious identity in Pakistan. In India, we are being ostracised for being Pakistanis,” he says. Most men like him, who were landless farmers or daily labourers in Pakistan, have failed to find any gainful employment in or around Jodhpur. The pandemic-related lockdowns have only made matters worse. Hemji Koli, who is a shelter manager on a contractual basis with the Municipal Corporation, runs a ‘Chetana’ study centre on behalf of a non-governmental organisation, Universal Just Action Society, in the Anganwa settlement. The centre provides basic literacy to children up to five years of age and tuition to those going to nearby government schools. About 350 children who were attending school before the COVID-19 outbreak have been confined at home for over a year due to the pandemic. “No person in this locality has been given citizenship so far. This is a relatively new settlement. The only saving grace is that we have not been driven out of this land,” Hemji says. Some migrants in the other settlements have got citizenship after completing the mandatory 11 years of stay for eligibility under the Citizenship Act of 1955, but even they struggle daily to get food, water, healthcare and education. Since 2014, most Hindu migrants have been entering India, into western Rajasthan and northern Gujarat, on a pilgrim visa. They often leave their family members in Pakistan in the hope that they can travel later when they find employment in India. However, they are invariably disappointed when they are left to fend for themselves. The migrants are mostly Dalits from the Meghwal, Koli, Bhil, Jatav, Kumawat and Mali communities. They are considered underprivileged on both sides of the international border, though some caste Hindus, belonging to the Rajput, Maheshwari and Brahmin communities, have also crossed into India. They all say that they were segregated and persecuted in Pakistan on religious grounds. They say young girls are sometimes abducted and forcibly converted to Islam in the interior areas of Sindh. Their children faced discrimination in government schools. Their shops and commercial establishments were attacked by robbers. And Hindu residents were not allowed to buy property. Hindu Singh Sodha, president of the Seemant Lok Sangathan, an organisation working for the welfare of migrants, points out that there have been three waves of migration of Hindus to India from Pakistan. The first was during and after Partition. During the 1971 war, about 90,000 persons migrated to India when Indian troops strategically occupied important areas 50 km deep inside Pakistan. The third wave, which started as a result of a backlash against Hindus during the Ram temple movement and after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, has been a prolonged one. Migrants still continue to come to India. Also, in 1996, the Taliban captured power in Afghanistan. This led to a change in atmosphere in Pakistan, with the minority communities in the Balochistan and Sindh Provinces increasingly being targeted. A maze of rules and regulations While a growing sense of insecurity in Pakistan has led to the migration of thousands of Hindus over the past two decades, they cannot expect to get the status of refugees because India is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, nor its 1967 Protocol. The Pakistani immigrants do not receive the protection or benefits which they would have been entitled to on getting official refugee status if India had been a signatory. All foreign nationals, including asylum-seekers, are governed by the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946; the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939; the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; and the Citizenship Act, 1955, as well as the rules and orders framed under these laws. The Union government possesses the power to detain and deport foreigners and restrict their movements, but it has no international obligation to enact a legislation for refugees. For accessing legal entitlements and services, Indian citizenship is the only viable option for the migrants. But the migrants face major challenges in obtaining citizenship status, ranging from the condition of having stayed in India for a certain number of years to keeping the registration permit from the Foreigners Regional Registration Office up-to-date and paying a hefty fee for frequent renewal of their long-term visas. Having all the Indian documents is not enough. The migrant must also hold an unexpired Pakistani passport, which can only be obtained at the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi. Bhagchand Bhil, who left his medical practice in Karachi and crossed the border in 2014, says that most of the migrants are illiterate and unable to decipher and navigate this maze of rules and regulations, which makes them vulnerable to deceit and exploitation by government officials. Even when they do get citizenship, their problems don’t end. Obtaining documents such as ration cards and caste certificates is no easy task and they find it difficult to avail themselves of the benefits of the government’s healthcare, education and employment schemes. Sodha, who had himself migrated as a young boy from Tharparkar district’s Chachro town in 1971, rues that there is no provision for the rehabilitation of people from Pakistan. The Seemant Lok Sangathan has raised these issues repeatedly with the Union Home Ministry over the past few years. While affirming that the government needs to be migrant-friendly, Sodha has sought the grant of citizenship through special camps, which will benefit the migrants who still have their family members in Pakistan. “During the last 30 years, I have not found a single family which says it has no member over there. The families are divided,” he says. Improving the lives of migrants Sodha feels that the Pakistan High Commission should be persuaded to withdraw the increased fee that the migrants are charged for renunciation of their Pakistani citizenship, which is mandatory for them to do before getting their Indian citizenship, and provide easy facilities for renewal of passports and identity cards. Besides, he says, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees should be approached for incorporating the minority migrants in its regular programmes for refugees. Moreover, the gaps in livelihood development and rehabilitation status should be identified at the State level and a robust policy for rehabilitation introduced at the Central level for migrant families, he says. Stateless persons belonging to higher castes, who comprise 20% of the migrant population, manage the hardship better because of their socioeconomic condition. They are generally engaged in business or private employment. The children of these migrants are the worst affected. Schools reluctantly give them admission and do not provide them emotional support and counseling. The children struggle as their medium of instruction was Urdu and Sindhi in Pakistan and Hindi in India. They are often singled out by the teachers and other students because of their Pakistani origin. Government schools, which earlier demanded their identity proof, started giving them admission only a couple of years ago. Despite this, some migrant children have excelled in their studies. Chandra Prakash, son of a migrant teacher, Manjhiana Rana, topped Class 12 at the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad School, run by the Marwar Muslim Educational and Welfare Society, in 2019. Chandra Prakash is now studying MBBS at the Sardar Patel Government Medical College in Bikaner. The Marwar Muslim Educational and Welfare Society’s CEO, Mohammed Atiq, says plans are afoot to open a primary school this year exclusively for the children of migrants at a plot of land situated near the Maulana Azad University in Bujhawar village. The school will be gradually upgraded to include higher education after the intake of 60 children in the first year. As an indication of the State government’s consideration for the rehabilitation of the migrants, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot inaugurated the Vinoba Bhave Nagar housing scheme for them, comprising 1,700 plots at the land measuring 300 bighas, in Chokha village near Jodhpur earlier this month. The residential scheme, announced in the 2021-22 State Budget, will be executed by the Jodhpur Development Authority. Hope and despair On the one hand, the government is making efforts to improve their quality of life, but on the other, the migrants have also had to face the problem of exploitation by government officials. In May 2018, a racket involving extortion of money from the migrants for extension of long-term visa, visa transfer, and grant of citizenship came to light after the arrest of a Home Ministry official by the Rajasthan Anti-Corruption Bureau. The official visited Jodhpur regularly to attend hearings on writ petitions moved by the migrants in the Rajasthan High Court. The official had three agents who identified themselves as Pakistani migrants with Indian citizenship. The case indicated that a larger nexus was at work to exploit the migrants for money. The Anti-Corruption Bureau’s probe revealed that the official had demanded and accepted bribes from about 3,000 migrants in 2017 alone. The inordinate delay in the grant of citizenship has led to a host of problems for the migrants. In November last year, a migrant woman, Janta Mali, was reunited with her family in western Rajasthan after being stranded in Pakistan for 10 months during the lockdown. Since her No Objection to Return to India (NORI) visa had expired, she was not allowed to travel back. Mali’s husband and children, who are Indian citizens, travelled back to India in July 2020 after visiting her ailing mother in Pakistan’s Mirpur Khas. The Seemant Lok Sangathan took up the issue with the Rajasthan government and the Centre and succeeded in bringing her back after six months by getting her visa extended. Though the migrants have been staying in cities in western Rajasthan such as Barmer, Jaisalmer and Bikaner for several years, Jodhpur emerged as the preferred destination after the Thar Express train linking Karachi with Bhagat Ki Kothi railway station started in 2006. The train was stopped in August 2019 when tensions escalated between India and Pakistan following India’s revocation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The Munabao-Khokhrapar rail route was restored after a gap of 41 years following the 1965 war to reduce the distance and journey of time for people from central and southern Indian States travelling to Pakistan. It gained popularity among the Pakistani Hindus who wanted to migrate to India. The train was also used by migrants frustrated by the delay in the grant of long-term visa or citizenship to return to Pakistan. Bone of contention On May 28, the Union Home Ministry issued a notification inviting non-Muslim migrants residing in 13 districts of five States to apply for Indian citizenship. It also empowered the Collectors of these districts to grant citizenship certificates. This has become the latest bone of contention between civil rights activists and asylum-seekers. The notification is applicable to migrants belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. While the Collectors of Jodhpur, Jaipur and Jaisalmer districts were empowered to grant citizenship in 2016, the new notification has now delegated the same powers to the Collectors of Jalore, Udaipur, Pali, Barmer and Sirohi districts. Sodha says these powers should be conferred on the Collectors of all districts in the State to speed up the process of application, security check, and inquiry for grant of citizenship. The Home Ministry says that the latest notification is not related to the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) of 2019, which has not come into effect and seeks to benefit the undocumented or illegal migrants from the six “persecuted communities” who entered India before December 31, 2014. The CAA will reduce the requirement of 11 years of aggregate stay in India to five years for citizenship, which would help fast-track the applications of migrants. The president of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties in Rajasthan, Kavita Srivastava, disagrees. She says that the notification amounts to implementation of the CAA “by stealth” even as the law has been challenged in the Supreme Court. “The delegation of powers to the Collectors is only with respect to the communities covered by the CAA and not those otherwise eligible for citizenship by registration and naturalisation,” she says. While demanding immediate withdrawal of the notification as well as nullification of the CAA, Srivastava says the notification’s intention is to rush through citizenship without waiting for the court’s verdict. She says it is also in complete disregard to the massive protests against the law in late 2019 and early 2020. “It is the first salvo towards implementing the 2019 Act, as its intention is to keep Muslims out of the purview of the citizenship law,” she says. Civil rights groups have called for taking measures to smoothen and hasten the process for grant of citizenship to migrants irrespective of their religious identity. Popular Front of India’s State president Mohammed Asif says the organisation will stage protests against the May 28 notification in a democratic manner once the COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted, as it bears resemblance to the CAA which discriminates on the ground of religion. COVID-19-related problems A new issue that the migrants are now facing is inaccessibility to vaccines. This remains unresolved despite the intervention of the Rajasthan High Court. The State government has refused to inoculate those who do not possess Aadhaar cards or other prescribed documents. About 15 migrants, including those who tested positive for COVID-19 and those suspected to have the virus or are symptomatic, have died in Jodhpur during the second wave of infections. A Division Bench of the High Court, which earlier ruled that the Centre’s standard operating procedure on vaccination did not exclude the migrants from Pakistan, has hauled up the State government for seeking clarification from the Union government, and sought an explanation from the Chief Secretary. The migrants settled in Barmer have started getting vaccinated on the basis of their Pakistani passports. Hearing the additional submissions made on behalf of the migrants in a suo motu case, the court also directed the State government to supply ration material and food packets to them through the Food and Civil Supplies Departments, local bodies and non-governmental organisations. It was submitted to the court that only the migrants residing in Jodhpur were getting the food packets, while those in Jaisalmer, Barmer and Jaipur districts were deprived of food supply during the pandemic. Hoping against hope that their basic needs will be met, the Pakistani Hindu migrants are caught in a vicious circle of poverty and vulnerability. They face an unresponsive government and uncertain legislation. Out of their homeland and across the border, the migrants wait endlessly for the day when they can call India their true home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/persecuted-in-pakistan-ignored-in-india/article34793706.ece
12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Refocused vaccination campaigns are possible||Poornima and Ashok, 80-year-old parents of two and grandparents of three, have been hunkered down in their Mumbai apartment for a year. When a COVID-19 vaccine became available in March 2021, they went to the local hospital to get their first dose of the Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine — the vaccine that was supposed to save the world. Seeing long lines and not wanting to risk being infected while waiting to be vaccinated, they returned home. This happened again the next day before a very helpful staff member of the World Health Organization (WHO) stepped in to help, taking them to a health centre early one morning and making sure they did not have to wait in a line to get vaccinated. This played out again in April 2021 for their second dose. This couple was lucky. Where the focus must be As we look ahead to what is promised to be a transition from a lack of vaccine supply to one of greater availability, the plan must be to prioritise people like the two octogenarians in Mumbai — older adults who remain unvaccinated, and very much at risk. Ensure we vaccinate them before we open vaccination to younger adults. This would prioritise people based on the risk of severe disease, and need — essential principles if we plan with justice in mind. Local governments and municipalities should also prioritise vaccines for the historically marginalised by focusing through the lens of equity and justice. What does it mean to focus through a lens of equity and justice? It would mean ensuring that the vaccine roll-out does not result in avoidable differences in vaccine uptake — and hence preventable disease and death — between marginalised groups and the rest of the country. It would require prioritising the poor, religious minorities, socially disadvantaged castes, Adivasi communities, those living in remote areas, and women. In Chhattisgarh One example of an equity-focused vaccination plan came from the Chhattisgarh government. The plan prioritised ration card holders, specifically because they are poor, and often live in multi-generation, larger households, putting them at higher risk of infection. They also often lack access to mobile phones and the Internet, which are necessary to register for vaccination. Though the High Court asked that the plan be modified to provide vaccines to the general public alongside ration card holders, we would propose prioritisation of the marginalised when vaccine supply is limited in order to minimise the risk of severe outcomes due to COVID-19. WHO’s strategic advisory group of experts on immunisation recommend prioritising sociodemographic groups at significantly higher risk of severe disease or death (for vaccination) in the context of limited supply (https://bit.ly/3pGy99C). We should ensure that we remove barriers to vaccination for the most vulnerable in India to minimise preventable disease and deaths. India depended, and continues to depend on the AstraZeneca vaccine because it was stable in a refrigerator for longer periods than mRNA vaccines (https://bit.ly/3gv02Ny). Presumably, this was so that vaccines could be made available where freezers do not exist. But it also enables the vaccine to be transported in vaccine carriers, and taken to the people where they are. In Indian villages, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Auxiliary Nurse-Midwives (ANMs) have vast experience and expertise with campaign-style pulse polio vaccination and newborn vaccination; their expertise should be harnessed to take vaccines to villagers. Urban slums and neighbourhoods, where socially disadvantaged caste and community groups, and migrants from Adivasi communities often reside, have poor access to and low levels of trust in the health-care system. Vaccines should be provided in camps or door-to-door in such areas. Appropriately, local governments are considering providing vaccines to older adults in door-to-door campaigns. A similar approach — vaccination camps where people live and work — could also greatly enhance vaccine uptake among essential workers and the poor. We need to ensure that those who work for daily wages are able to get the vaccine without having to forego work or pay. Adivasi communities also reside in remote and forested areas that are also being ravaged by waves of death, presumably due to COVID-19; vaccine distribution should be prioritised to districts where they live. In India today, perhaps the most marginalised are religious minorities, and, specifically, poor Muslim communities. Vaccine distribution should also be prioritised to Muslim-dominated tier-3 towns across the country. An explicit focus on justice would prioritise the engagement of trusted spokespeople to engage in effective risk communication with vulnerable and marginalised communities, and to build trust in the vaccine. Women-only vaccine days We need women-only vaccine days to ensure that women know that they are being prioritised. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, India was one of few locations where mortality was higher in women than in men (https://bit.ly/3gfc4vH), and we barely understand the drivers of this observation. In the current pandemic, it is very possible that if women are not explicitly prioritised, economic pressures to protect the (often male) breadwinner in families, and the historically marginalised stature of women in society, will end up resulting in gender inequities in vaccine uptake — early signs of exactly this have been recently reported. Unfortunately, our data during the pandemic do not allow us to examine whether gender, caste, religious, and indigenous identities have impacted the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or death. Despite global calls for better surveillance (https://bit.ly/2TjQxZU), including among vulnerable groups, India does not regularly report even gender-disaggregated data. Despite crowd-sourced efforts to collect and make data available, reporting of geographic and other meta-data for tests conducted and sequenced samples is variable across laboratories and States. Better leadership to standardise and enforce meta-data collection and timely reporting is essential to inform data-driven interventions and prioritised resource mobilisation. Equity and justice Local planning will need to go hand-in-hand with a refocus on equity and justice at the national and global levels as well. Nationally, people have recognised that digital apps for registration are a recipe for inequity along age, gender, and economic dimensions, and reports have highlighted the plight of those on the wrong side of the digital divide. CoWIN data that are available to date (https://bit.ly/2RJWQFw) show that vaccination rates have been inequitable between tribal and non-tribal areas (https://bit.ly/2TY9qBU), for example. Going forward, let us focus on first doing no harm — get people vaccinated to save the lives most at risk. At the national level, the recent decision to procure vaccines centrally and make COVID-19 vaccines available free of cost through the public system goes a long way towards ensuring equity and justice. WHO has been tireless in its call for the urgent need for vaccine equity at the global level. In an ideal world, vaccines would be procured and equitably distributed to countries based on need through the COVAX facility (https://bit.ly/3pRoXPS). But instead, wealthy countries have once again, as during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, secured more doses than they need to vaccinate every member of their population (https://bit.ly/3zmRa5a), and even pre-ordered booster doses (https://reut.rs/3pHT1NL). This leaves only poor countries to be dependent on supplies through COVAX, and they find themselves at the end of the line. This is a wake-up call for setting up vaccine distribution systems with equity in mind for the next pandemic. At this time, unfortunately, poor countries are at the mercy of the European Union and the United States, who need to donate vaccines now. They need to vaccinate the world alongside their own communities — they need to vaccinate grandparents everywhere alongside children and adolescents within their borders. Work during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic showed that willingness among the U.S. public to donate vaccines to the poorer countries was appreciable (https://bit.ly/3iAvnRU). Today as well, surveys show that U.S. public support for immediate donation of COVID-19 vaccine exists (https://bit.ly/3pIs9gx). Doses need to be donated to COVAX now so that they can be distributed to countries based on need. Every life matters in this world and world leaders need to follow the lead of WHO and embody global solidarity in this pandemic. Refocused, rejuvenated local, national, and global vaccination campaigns are possible. Let us ensure that we plan now so that we get those shots in arms when they are available. Let us get to work in India. Supriya Kumar is a public health researcher focused on health equity in South Asia. N.S.

12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||The signal from the Iran presidential election is clear||On May 25, the Guardian Council in Iran announced a slate of seven candidates who would compete in the presidential election on June 18. The council, in a non-transparent process, selected these seven candidates from among 592 applicants, including 40 women. The list does not include a woman candidate. Iran has a dichotomous political order whose two parts are constantly at odds with each other. It has the institutions of a normal democratic system — a directly elected President, an elected national assembly, and a government responsible to the assembly. The other part of the political order is devoted to safeguarding the ideology and principles of the Islamic Revolution; this has provided the country with institutions that are unique to Iran and do much to dilute, if not undermine, the country’s democratic credentials. Placed above the popularly elected President is the Supreme Leader, who wields supreme authority in all matters of national governance — security, defence, foreign relations, the judiciary. One of the bodies under the Supreme Leader is the 12-member Guardian Council. The council has now carefully rejected reformist candidates and retained two who seem to be centrist, so that the slate has five so-called “hardliners”. But many of them are relatively light-weight: prominent personalities such as Assembly Speaker Ali Larijani, have also been excluded. Clearly, the Guardian Council has decided to ensure the election of one specific candidate, Ebrahim Raisi. Raisi at the helm Raisi has been a high-profile legal luminary in Iran since the days of the Revolution. He is now head of the judiciary and deputy chief of the Assembly of Experts which selects the Supreme Leader. Raisi had stood against Hassan Rouhani for the presidency in 2017, but was soundly defeated. Raisi has been in campaign mode for the last two years and has made “fighting corruption” and “caring for the down-trodden and the under-privileged” the centre-piece of his platform. The list announced by the council has evoked sharp criticisms across the political spectrum. President Rouhani has expressed concern about the “minimal participation” in the elections that could now occur. Ali Larijani’s brother has called the list “indefensible”. Surprisingly, the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei himself has said that in the vetting process “some candidates were wronged”, but,so far, the Guardian Council has not revised the candidates’ list (https://bit.ly/3cBIXR7). Khamenei appears to have backed the narrow selection of candidates to ensure that Iran’s politics will now shift from Rouhani’s moderate reform to the hard ideological posture of Ebrahim Raisi, who is his long-term political associate. As Iran is now once again engaged in dialogue on the nuclear issue with the United States and other interlocutors in Vienna, Khamenei would like the credit for the lifting of sanctions to go to the hardliners. But Khamenei has taken this gamble despite considerable public hostility to the overt manipulation of the election. Recent polls suggest a low voter turnout of about a third of the electorate which could dilute the credibility of the new President and condemn the country to domestic turmoil. Economic despair There could be longer term political implications as well. The economist Djavad Salehi-Isfahani has pointed out (“Iran’s middle class and the nuclear deal”; brookings.edu) that the educated middle class plays a central role in determining the direction of Iran’s elections: earlier, in the absence of harsh sanctions, Iran’s economy had grown exponentially and expanded the size of the middle class. In 2013, with the prospect of the end of sanctions, Rouhani won the presidential election, when the middle class was nearly 60% of the population. The lifting of sanctions after the nuclear agreement saw him through during the 2017 elections as well. However, the re-introduction of sanctions by the Donald Trump administration cost the economy about $200 billion: the middle class has been reduced by eight million, while those living in extreme poverty have increased five-fold to 20 million. Poor medical facilities have caused pandemic-related deaths of around 80,000 people. U.S. sanctions have also changed political attitudes: support for the nuclear agreement has gone from 80% in 2015 to just 50% today, while reformist politicians have been discredited due to their failure to obtain the easing of sanctions. Domestic, regional outlook The principal concern of the new President will be economic: Iran’s inflation rate has gone from 10% in 2017 to 50% today, the national currency has depreciated four times in value, while unemployment is over 12%. The easing of sanctions after an agreement on nuclear issues in Vienna will remove restrictions on Iran’s oil and financial sectors and help bring much-needed relief to the beleaguered population. However, it does not seem that much else will change. Iran’s politics is likely to remain fractious, with the clerics seeking to ensure that effective authority remains with them, while the reformists will try to nibble away at the ideological edifice, usually with limited success. In the regional arena, Iran is likely to continue its present approach of combining pragmatic peace moves with confrontation: quiet dialogue with Saudi Arabia on the Yemen conflict could make progress, though Syria will take longer to settle as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its ally, Hezbollah, are deeply invested in that theatre. Again, there will be no let-up in Iran’s confrontation with the U.S. and Israel. The Carnegie scholar, Karim Sadjadpour, has reported Khamenei’s observation that “the revolution needs enmity with America” (https://bit.ly/3veSaoW). However, hostility to Iran and its Revolution is also deeply ingrained in the U.S. psyche,which has meant that earlier peace overtures from the Islamic republic have repeatedly been rebuffed by Washington. Thus, the “Cold War” between the two will continue, along with occasional skirmishes with Israel, not just in Syria, but also in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Iran will seek strategic comfort in closer ties with Russia and China. Donald Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure” that, with its crippling sanctions, was meant to achieve regime change in Iran, has had the ironical effect of tilting Iran’s political balance sharply in favour of the hardliners. They will now control the levers of power in Iran for the foreseeable future.

12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Monsoon malady||The monsoon over the greater Mumbai region has come to be characterised by the unsettling annual spectacle of collapsing buildings, and this year is proving to be no different. An unsafe multi-storeyed building in a core area of the city has collapsed on to another, leaving at least 11 people dead and exposing once again, the decrepit base of dwellings in India’s much-romanticised economic powerhouse. The disaster has brought in its wake the familiar litany of accusations, of people occupying unsafe and illegal buildings, and civic authorities failing to act in time. Mumbai’s Mayor Kishori Pednekar has responded to criticism with a helpless exhortation to the city administration to remove dangerous structures. Going beyond these predictable impulses, the overburdened city needs a time-bound and accountable system of ensuring the safety of its housing stock. Coinciding with this year’s monsoon, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority identified 21 structures in Mumbai as being extremely dangerous, with an advisory to over 700 occupants to move to transit accommodation, while reconstruction is undertaken. Understandably, the occupants are reluctant, since the alternative housing is far away from their education and work locations. This is a conundrum that Maharashtra will have to address, treating it as a crisis that will only be aggravated by changes to monsoon rainfall intensity over time. Coastal Maharashtra sits in the pathway of extreme monsoon weather events, which are forecast to increase in frequency due to ongoing warming of the Arabian Sea. Scientists including those of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology have proposed, in the context of the deluge a few years ago, that accurate monsoon forecasting over central India, incorporating changes to sea surface temperature, would help governments prepare better to save lives and agriculture. For Mumbai, what this means is to accelerate its repair and rehabilitation programme for weak structures and replace those that cannot be salvaged. The city desperately needs channels for huge volumes of water to flow out, and a plan to create new urban wetlands where feasible to store the precipitation. A rejuvenated Mithi river — its planned clean-up has been delayed by the COVID-19 crisis — could offer some relief, but more waterbodies are needed. And it will take a mass housing programme to make life safer for the thousands in hovels. A far-sighted plan to shift people from squalid buildings to modern ones is also a health imperative; such a start must be made with the most dangerous structures. It is also unseemly for political parties to use a disaster such as the one in Malad as a cudgel against the government, considering that Mumbai’s civic base lies neglected over the decades regardless of who ruled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/monsoon-malady/article34793694.ece
12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Counting the dead||The real time mortality impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is an important statistical measure to guide policy responses. But measuring the actual count is not an easy task. WHO, in January 2021, had estimated, based on excess deaths data in Europe and the American continents, that actual deaths were at least 1.6 times over the official count. The problem of under-counting, even in mature public health systems across the developed world, is largely because patients who die due to cardiovascular issues among others even after apparent recovery from COVID-19 are sometimes not tracked and registered as COVID-19-related deaths. This is why even in Kerala — with 100% registration of deaths and a relatively low case fatality rate — following criticisms about the methodology to evaluate whether a death was related to COVID-19, the health administration in the districts, rather than a State-level audit committee, will now audit deaths. But there is another class of under-counting across States, where health bulletins mislead by reporting a lower number of cases and deaths. This is the case with Bihar where the reported toll was suddenly increased by 72% following a Health Department review after the Patna High Court found discrepancies in figures cited by different agencies in Buxar district. Bihar is among the States in India with the lowest civil registration of deaths, with barely 34.1% of the dead being registered, according to the Civil Registration System (CRS) report of 2018. Estimations of the actual count of the dead are difficult to obtain in other States such as Uttar Pradesh as well, where public health systems are poor and neither the infections nor deaths have been effectively tracked, especially in rural areas, where many have died outside of hospitals. One method to assess the actual number of deaths due to COVID-19 is by calculating the excess deaths during the given period when the pandemic has raged, compared to the baseline mortality occurring in similar time frames before the pandemic. This exercise also works best if death registrations are relatively high, which should be possible in most districts as registration of deaths has improved to 76% according to CRS 2018. Excess deaths analyses in Gujarat, Chennai and Kolkata based on collations of preliminary registration data by news organisations suggest that they were nearly 10, five and seven times higher, respectively, than reported fatalities during the second wave. If the CRS datasets, maintained by the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India besides State registrars and municipal officials with a good quality of registration, are made available, it would enable better estimation of the actual mortality figures. In the meantime, only honest reporting of the deaths will help provide better mitigation strategies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/counting-the-dead/article34793695.ece
12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Review GST sop’s timing, urges industry||While the GST Council meets on Saturday to discuss tax cuts on critical COVID-19 related material including vaccines, medicines and equipment, industry donors are urging a rethink on the timing for the applicability of the Integrated GST (IGST) exemption announced on imported relief supplies after the council’s last meeting. At its May 28 meeting, the Council had decided to extend the IGST exemption granted on relief material received free from abroad as donations to State-approved entities, effective since May 3, to those wanting to make such donations after purchasing the material overseas. The May 31 notification on the grant of this waiver was, however, prospective and tax experts said a judicial intervention may be required to make it applicable on imports made earlier amid the surging second wave. Several firms including MNCs had imported oxygen equipment and other supplies urgently for donations to State governments, domestic charities and hospitals. “The date of applicability for the reduced rate will remain a subject matter of debate and judicial intervention may be required,” said Abhishek A Rastogi, partner at Khaitan & Co. The Delhi High Court has taken up a petition challenging the Centre’s exclusion of such imports from the ‘ad hoc’ GST exemption for COVID-19 relief material received from abroad. Gujarat and Haryana had introduced schemes to reimburse the IGST paid by domestic entities importing material for free donation in their jurisdictions. ‘Prepared for third wave’ Regulatory experts said ensuring parity on the IGST waiver would help India prepare better for a possible third wave, by freeing up resources used in GST levies for fresh donations. “Extending exemptions from May 3 would indeed be beneficial, as the duties already paid by the corporates on such imports would be a cost to the companies, and this would bring parity with imports received free of cost,” said Mahesh Jaising, Deloitte India partner. “Industry hopes for a clarification on spends on COVID material clarifying eligibility of GST input credit, where the material has been used for donations or CSR purposes or used for their employees,” he added. Mr. Jaising also called for a more dynamic approach to tax exemptions on COVID relief material as the requirements may keep changing. The list of “relief material may therefore be updated real-time or kept open ended, to ensure better preparation during these challenging times,” he suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/review-gst-sops-timing-urges-industry/article34793683.ece
12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||IIP edged up 0.08% in April from same month in 2019||India’s April industrial output edged up 0.08%, from the level recorded during the same month in 2019, index of industrial production (IIP) data released by the National Statistical Office on Friday showed. The IIP data was not comparable with the year-earlier figures as ‘a majority of the establishments did not operate in April 2020’ as a result of the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 infections, the NSO observed. The manufacturing sector, hit hardest by last year’s national lockdown, posted a 0.9% decline when compared with April 2019. Economists said the IIP data needed to be seen in perspective, given the impact of the second wave. Sequential contraction On a sequential, month-on-month basis, April’s IIP contracted more than 12%, reflecting a hit on production activity as major industrial hubs like Maharashtra and Delhi led the localised lockdowns, said Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global Financial Services. Maharashtra has an 18% share in India’s manufacturing Gross Value Added (GVA), she pointed out. “Last year, output had come to a standstill in most sectors,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings. “Therefore, the growth numbers for April... need to be ignored. A similar situation would arise in May too and it would be only from June that there could be reasonable numbers forthcoming,” he added. PMI, e-way bills “It would be better to track PMI, e-way bills and GST collections to get a fair assessment of activity in the industrial sectors,” Mr. Sabnavis suggested. Electricity output was 6.81% higher than the pre-COVID-19 levels of April 2019. Similarly, mining output was 0.2% higher than the same month in 2019. ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said that capital goods and consumer durables output trailed the April 2019 levels by 14.3% and 11.6%, respectively, which suggests that the widening State-wise restrictions that were imposed during the month impacted production amid a weakening outlook for investment activity and consumption. “Manufacturing moderated by 12.6% in April from the previous month, narrower than the slippage of 17.5% in the GST e-way bills generated over the same time period,” Ms. Nayar said. “This suggests that inventories may have built up, with dispatches being limited by the second COVID surge that was underway in April,” the economist added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/iip-edged-up-008-in-april-from-same-month-in-2019/article34793685.ece
12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Finance Ministry tightens belt||The Finance Ministry has told ministries to slash ‘controllable’ spending by 20% and drop other wasteful expenditure, introducing fresh austerity steps amid concerns with breaching the fiscal deficit target for the year following the second COVID-19 wave. Expenditure related to containment of COVID-19 is excluded from the scope of this order. A suggestive list of object heads of controllable expenditure has been shared, that includes advertising and publicity, foreign and domestic travel, office and administrative expenses and overtime allowance. “The government has decided that all ministries take steps to curb wasteful expenditure and aim for a 20% reduction in controllable expenditure,” the Department of Expenditure wrote in a memo, approved by Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan, to all ministries. Base year Urging departments to take steps to curtail all avoidable non-scheme expenditure, the memo has told them to take the expenditure incurred in 2019-20 as the base for this purpose. The Expenditure Department has been directed to review the progress in the matter. The other items where spending may be controlled are general grants-in-aid, royalty payments, publications, rents and taxes, ration costs, clothing and tentage, minor works and maintenance. Separately, ministries have also been told to expedite appraisals and clearances for schemes in their domains that need to be extended beyond March this year. Ministries that are yet to seek the requisite expenditure clearances have been given till July to do so, in order to secure funds. “No further extension to ongoing schemes and release of funds will be allowed,” said the Expenditure Department.

At a review meeting with the Departments of Telecom and Atomic Energy and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), Ms. Sitharaman said that enhanced capital expenditure would play a critical role in revitalising the economy post-pandemic and encouraged them to front-load such spending. While the Budget had a capital outlay of Rs. 5.54 lakh crore, the Minister said PSUs need to complement the capex efforts and ministries must tap innovating funding methods for new projects. Ms. Sitharaman also sought early clearance of pending dues to MSMEs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/hasten-vehicle-scrapping-says-fm-sitharaman/article34793688.ece

12 June 2021||CHENNAI,||CG Power turns Rs. 674-crore net, to incur Rs. 135-cr. capex||CG Power and Industrial Solutions, which was acquired by Tube Investments of India in November last year, has returned to black by reporting a standalone net profit of Rs. 674 crore for the quarter ended March. The company had reported a net loss of Rs. 184 crore during the corresponding year-earlier period. Revenue from operations more than doubled to Rs. 1,022 crore from Rs. 465 crore. There has been a complete rebound in manufacturing and sales of all the divisions, CG Power said. Margins were impacted due to a steep increase in material costs (impact at 5% of sales) as the company could not procure or cover these items earlier due to financial difficulties. Other expenses were higher with Rs. 46 crore incurred in expenses relating to legacy issues. But for the above, the profit before taxes would have been higher, CG Power said. On Friday, the board approved capital expenditure of Rs. 135 crore for the current financial year. This would be spent on balancing, de-bottlenecking and modernising facilities at plants to improve production and productivity, and will be financed from internal resources. Barring four wholly owned subsidiaries operating in Sweden, Germany, Netherlands and the U.S., the rest are either being closed or in the process of being wound up, the company said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cg-power-turns-rs-674-crore-net-to-incur-rs-135-cr-capex/article34793690.ece
12 June 2021||Paris,||Tsitsipas ticks another box, in maiden final||Stefanos Tsitsipas became the first Greek player to reach a Grand Slam final on Friday when he defeated Germany's Alexander Zverev in a bruising five-setter at Roland-Garros. Tsitsipas got an early break in the opening set, aided by two double faults from Zverev, and remained solid against the German's heavy groundstrokes to hold onto his narrow advantage on a sun-bathed Philippe Chatrier court. U.S. Open finalist Zverev built a 3-0 lead at the start of the second set but Tsitsipas showed exemplary athleticism and staunch defence to win the next six games, leaving Zverev staring at his coaching team bewildered. The sixth-seeded German, however, regrouped and added more power to his shots with early breaks in the third and fourth sets enough for him to level the match at two sets apiece. Tsitsipas needed to change his game in the decider and the 22-year-old managed to find an extra gear to seal the contest on his fifth match point and booked a final outing. Barbora Krejcikova will play Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in women’s final after the Czech World No. 33 saved a match point to defeat Greek 17th seed Maria Sakkari 7-5, 4-6, 9-7 on Thursday. Krejcikova, 25, is the fourth unseeded women’s finalist in five years at Roland Garros. She won the doubles title here in 2018 but her best previous result in singles was a run to the fourth round last year. It will be the sixth successive French Open to crown a first-time women’s major champion. “I always wanted to play a match like this, when I was younger, playing juniors, I always wanted to play such a challenging match where we both had chances and were playing so well,” said Krejcikova.  Women’s final at 6.30 p.m. IST.   Maiden Grand Slam singles final for Tsitsipas. He had lost all three of his previous semifinals (Aus Open 2019 & 2021, French Open 2020) Tsitsipas' fifth win in nine five-set matches in his career Tsitsipas' fourth win over a top-10 player at a Major in nine attempts. Three of those have come this year (Nadal at Aus Open, Medvedev and Zverev at French Open) Only Zverev's second loss in his last 10 five-setters.

12 June 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Women’s Speed Chess from today||India’s three strongest woman players are all set to make their best moves as yet another high profile online chess tournament kicks off on Saturday. Koneru Humpy, Dronavalli Harika and R. Vaishali could face some of the biggest names in the game at the Women’s Speed Chess championship, organised by FIDE and chess.com .  The second edition of the tournament features 16 players, including World No. 1 Hou Yifan of China, the Russian trio of Kateryna Lagno, Alexandra Kosteniuk and Valentina Gunina, Ukraine’s Anna Muzychuk and Antoaneta Stefanova of Bulgaria. The knockout event will have games of varying time controls, from one to five minutes. Humpy, the reigning women’s World champion in rapid chess, said the format made the tournament unpredictable. “Anything can happen in a knockout tournament,” she told The Hindu.  “Last year’s event was held over four legs, so you could play right through the event till the two finalists were decided,” she said. Humpy had finished runner-up in the fourth leg and seventh overall. “I had played with no expectations and I wasn’t too keen on playing online chess then,” she said. “This time, I have been preparing for the tournament by playing against the computer.” Though she is one of the eight players seeded directly for the tournament — Harika and Vaishali made it after winning qualifying events — she is taking nothing for granted. “It is a very strong tournament with so many fine players,” she said. “I am glad that three Indians are in the fray.” Tough openings Humpy will take on Bibisara Assaubayeva of Kazakhstan in the opening round on Saturday. Harika will face a stronger challenge on June 16, against Kosteniuk, a former World champion. Vaishali too has a tough opponent in China’s Lei Tingjie. The final will be played on July 3. All games will be streamed live on YouTube.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/womens-speed-chess-from-today/article34793853.ece
12 June 2021||St. Petersburg,||Will Belgium live up to its top ranking?||What’s being billed by some as the last hurrah for Belgium’s “golden generation” begins with two of the team’s long-time stalwarts likely missing from its opening match of the European Championship. De Bruyne, Hazard out Injury and fitness concerns mean neither Kevin De Bruyne nor Eden Hazard is set to start against Russia on Saturday at Saint Petersburg Stadium, where the Belgians’ World Cup hopes in 2018 died in a loss to France. It returns to the same venue three years later as the world’s top-ranked team — it has been in that position since October 2018 — but with doubts about the availability of its two star attacking midfielders.  The experience of more than 1,300 international appearances in the squad should also stand Belgium in good stead when it comes to pressure situations in a major tournament. There is a widespread acceptance that this might be Belgium’s best chance of winning a European Championship or World Cup for the first time, at least for this current generation.  Russia plays its first two Group-B games in St. Petersburg. It was on home soil that Russia reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup in 2018, beating Spain along the way.  Mostovoy tests positive On Friday, Russia winger Andrey Mostovoy became the first player to be cut from a team at the tournament after testing positive for the virus.  Dylan Levitt and his teammates, a group that includes Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, will open their Euro 2020 campaign on Saturday against Switzerland in faraway Azerbaijan. In a squad with a strong youth contingent that includes midfielder Ethan Ampadu and right back Neco Williams, Bale has faith in his younger teammates.  Finland goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky didn’t sugar-coat things when summing up the difference between his team and Denmark at the European Championship. “They have better players than us in every position,” Hradecky said bluntly ahead of Finland’s major tournament debut at Euro 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/will-belgium-live-up-to-its-top-ranking/article34793803.ece
12 June 2021||Bengaluru,||Five newcomers who made it||With the big guns busy in England, there was room for fresh faces to be included in the Indian team for the limited-over tour of Sri Lanka. The selectors thus handed maiden India call-ups to five players — Devdutt Padikkal, K. Gowtham, Chetan Sakariya, Ruturaj Gaikwad and Nitish Rana. Stylish opening batsman Padikkal has enjoyed a fast rise to the top. In the lead up to the IPL earlier this year, Padikkal smashed four consecutive centuries in the 50-over Vijay Hazare Trophy for Karnataka. The 20-year-old carried this fine form to the IPL, scoring the fastest century for an uncapped player with an unbeaten 101 off 52 balls against Rajasthan Royals.  Padikkal’s State teammate Gowtham has built a reputation for being a match-winner. His accurate, flat off-spin and big hitting prowess have time and again rescued Karnataka in the domestic circuit. The 32-year-old struck gold in the 2021 IPL auction, when he was signed for a record sum of Rs. 9.25 crore by Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Gowtham, however, could not find a spot in the CSK playing eleven in the curtailed IPL season.  Overcome tragedies  Left-arm pacer Sakariya has overcome tremendous personal tragedies in the past year to make a mark. A month before bagging a Rs. 1.2 crore IPL contract with Rajasthan Royals, his brother passed away. Sakariya then lost his father to COVID-19 complications. On the field, the 23-year old Saurashtra fast bowler picked up seven wickets in seven IPL games, including two three-wicket hauls. That Sakariya was chosen ahead of his Saurashtra senior Jaydev Unadkat — a left-arm speedster with a stellar record — has raised some eyebrows.  Ruturaj has witnessed a steady rise through the ranks, under the guidance of former India captain Rahul Dravid in the India-A structure. In the IPL this year, he opened the batting for CSK, making two fifties (75 vs Sunrisers Hyderabad and 64 vs Kolkata Knight Riders). The compact Maharashtra batsman was the lone bright in a disappointing IPL 2020 for CSK, recording three fifties to finish with a tournament average of 51. His talent was obvious to CSK teammate and South African captain Faf du Plessis, who stated that Ruturaj reminded him of a young Virat Kohli. Southpaw batsman Nitish Rana faced a stumbling block even before the IPL began, having tested positive for COVID-19. In his first match after recovering from the virus, Rana claimed the man-of-the-match with a 56-ball 80 against Sunrisers Hyderabad. A thinking player, Rana is adept at both keeping the scorers busy with singles and going for the big blows.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/five-newcomers-who-made-it/article34793811.ece
12 June 2021||KOCHI,||The move that made the difference for Neeraj Chopra||Returning to the international circuit after nearly one and half years, javelin star Neeraj Chopra felt his throws were good at the City of Lisbon athletics meet in Portugal on Saturday. But strangely, the measuring equipment told a very different story. “I felt there were some problems with the measurement. Despite good throws, the measuring equipment was not showing that. I felt that with my first two legal throws (first and fourth) but I did not object to that,” Chopra told The Hindu from the Portuguese capital on Friday. And then he came up with a move that made a big difference. “Before the last throw, I told physio Ishaan to go near the 80m line to find out whether there was a problem with the distance. And when I threw, it looked something like 83m but they said it was just 78m so I told them to measure with a measuring tape. They measured and realised that it was an 83-plus throw.” That move by Chopra made a big difference, it added a whopping five metres to his effort. He was finally given 83.18m for that throw which helped him win the title comfortably. “Obviously, he was a little frustrated during the whole thing. Everybody was,” said Manisha Malhotra, the head of sports excellence at JSW Sports which supports Chopra. “There was a lot of confusion. They first said they had calibrated the (measuring) equipment but it was definitely not calibrated.” “It is very nice to be back, am able to focus better now,” said the Asian Games champion who is currently No. 3 in the world list with his national record of 88.07m which came in Patiala in March. The next stop for the 23-year-old will be Sweden where he will be in action in the Karlstad GP on June 22||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-move-that-made-the-difference-for-neeraj-chopra/article34793907.ece
12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Having context for Test cricket is amazing, says Ashwin||Ahead of the World Test Championship final, R. Ashwin spoke to The Hindu about his 10-year Test journey, his evolution as a spinner and the title clash against New Zealand. Excerpts: It has been 10 years since your Test debut. You are India’s fourth-highest wicket-taker (409) and not far off Harbhajan Singh’s (417) and Kapil Dev’s (434) tally. What has the journey been like? I find myself in one of the happiest phases of my life. I am enjoying my cricket. I am not looking too far ahead. I wouldn’t do it for a simple reason because if you want to enjoy the moment, you have to stay in the present and embrace it. The first and foremost goal is the WTC. To look beyond the next Test or tour is something I have gone past. But to be putting myself on a list as elite as this is a matter of pride. I never expected to get this far in my life. What is your assessment of the WTC as a concept? The idea of having some context to the whole Test arena is amazing. It was long pending and I’m so pleased the ICC have done it. There are areas that will be addressed. But considering the pandemic, they have done a phenomenal job. To keep Test cricket healthy going forward is healthy for the world cricketing arena. It will help other forms of the game as well. Your thoughts on the final against New Zealand? We have played good cricket to get to the WTC final and we are deservedly there. They are a fantastic team and have a lot of exciting cricketers coming through. The fact that they would have played a couple of Test matches before the final will be good preparation for them. So we have to adapt, use our experience and be ready for it. From being seen as a spinner with variations early in your career, in recent times it feels like you have succeeded with more subtle variations. Can you elaborate on your evolution? I feel the way the game is explained is very basic. For a lot of cricketers, perception precedes them. When I came to play Test cricket, I was seen as someone who had a lot of variations. But in my entire career, I would have bowled only 2-3% carrom balls. In 2012 against England, I picked 14 wickets but people dissected that I was trying too much and needed to go back to basics. What was happening was, I was missing my length. It is a basic mistake and a crucial aspect of a spinner. In my career, I have had to leave some aspects behind to acquire something and take my game higher. Things like a change of angle, seam position like cross-seam, is something I have started to do a lot more now, which I agree. But I have a lot of subtle variations and I have been doing these things for a long time. It is just that it is being noticed now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/having-context-for-test-cricket-is-amazing-says-ashwin/article34793799.ece

Ltd. The online meetings between KFA, DFAs and general body members of KFA, which ended this week, failed to reach a consensus with some of the DFAs seeking more time from the parent body to study the draft proposal. Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram Alappuzha, Wayanad, Kasargod, Palakkad and Kollam DFAs have opposed the draft proposal and have sought more time from the KFA. And most of DFAs have already set up internal committees to study the proposal and have also sought opinions from their affiliated clubs. Some support However, there has been voices of approval with Ernakulam, Thrissur and Pathanamthitta backing the draft proposal. While most of the DFAs were not opposed to KFA seeking professional help for marketing the game in the State, they were against implementing the agreement in its present form. Some DFAs even wanted the KFA to restart the bidding process. The DFAs have told KFA that they needed more clarifications on many clauses in the draft proposal which they felt were favouring the consortium. They also expressed concern about the DFAs losing their relevance and pointed out the absence of any schemes to develop grassroots football or of any welfare measures to help former footballers in the draft proposal. They also wanted KFA to allay the fears expressed by clubs and academies. KFA on its part said the move was for the betterment of football and has assured the DFAs that it will not rush the agreement. The KFA said it will take all stakeholders into confidence before signing the final contract. Assurance to coaches Meanwhile, the KFA has also reached out to coaching community, whose members had expressed their reservations and assured the coaches that their interests will be protected. KFA will also be holding talks with other stakeholders to whip up support.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kfa-fails-to-convince-dfas-on-draft-proposals/article34794046.ece
12 June 2021||Chennai,||Waking up to a delightful news||Quite late in the night on Thursday when he had retired for the day, R. Sai Kishore received the best news of his cricketing career so far when he was selected as a net bowler for the Indian team for the limited-over tour to Sri Lanka next month. The Tamil Nadu left-arm spinner is one among the five net bowlers that will travel to the island nation later this month. “I was in deep sleep when Ruturaj Gaikwad (CSK teammate) called me and told me about the news,” said Sai Kishore to The Hindu . “It feels like a just reward for the work I have done in domestic cricket in the last few years.” In the last domestic season, Sai Kishore picked up eight wickets in eight matches in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament and three in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Bowling with control The tall spinner bowled with immense control and kept things tight for TN in both formats. On what he expects from the tour, the 24-year-old said, “Over the last two years being with Chennai Super Kings and international players has helped me a lot. “So I am sure I will come back as a better cricketer from this tour.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/waking-up-to-a-delightful-news/article34793911.ece
12 June 2021||Chennai,||‘I am striving to make my top-spinner more potent’||The Indian team-management’s interest in Varun Chakravarthy, ahead of the ICC World Twenty20 championship, is reflected in the spinner being picked for India so soon after failing the mandatory fitness test for the shorter version series against England. The 29-year-old has been included in the team to tour Sri Lanka for the ODI and Twenty20 series in July. The Indian think tank is keen on giving him a feel of international cricket ahead of the World Twenty20. On his part, Varun has been working hard on his fitness with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) trainers with the specific aim of clearing the parameters set by the BCCI. He told The Hindu in an exclusive chat on Friday, “I am confident of clearing the fitness tests. Playing for India in the World Twenty20 is a much-cherished dream for me. I consider myself a leg-spinner though the media calls me a mystery spinner. The leg-spinner is my stock ball and I have the googly and the flipper. I am striving to make my top-spinner more potent.” Asked how he manages to retain his composure while bowling in high pressure situations of the IPL, he replied, “I simply focus on the process. I can control things till the ball leaves my hand. If the process is right, I don’t bother even if I go for runs.” He is looking forward to the Sri Lanka tour. “I have interacted with Shikhar Dhawan and looking forward to playing under him.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-am-striving-to-make-my-top-spinner-more-potent/article34793914.ece

12 June 2021||DHAKA,||Shakib throws an on-field tantrum||Star Bangladesh cricketer Shakib Al Hasan had a shocking on-field meltdown during a domestic T20 match here on Friday, kicking stumps and arguing with umpires in a display of appalling behaviour for which he later apologised calling it "human error". Shakib's anger got the better of him during his team Mohammedan Sporting's game against Abahani Limited. The Dhaka Premier League encounter was eventually won by Sporting via the Duckworth-Lewis method. Shakib's apology notwithstanding, kicking the stumps is as good as a Level 3 offence and could lead to a one-match suspension for the former Bangladesh skipper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shakib-throws-an-on-field-tantrum/article34793800.ece

Kazarashvili was appointed in February 2019 after months of deliberation with his contract originally till the end of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The postponement of the Games meant it was extended, like most foreign coaches, by a year. The decision to terminate his services was taken following a recommendation from the Wrestling Federation of India, SAI said in a statement. The World qualifiers last month were the last chance for Greco-Roman wrestlers to make it to the Olympics, but none of the six Indians managed to do so. Gurpreet was the lone bronze medallist. Disappointing outings This followed disappointing outings at the Asian Olympic qualifiers and the Asian Championships in April, India returning with just two bronzes from the former event.

12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Fighting the good fight||An isolated elderly patient with the Minamata disease lying on a hospital bed with ventilator support, is the opening scene of Minamata Mandala (2020). A sprawling six-hour-long documentary by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Kazuo Hara, it is both a humane story and a deeply political film, that exposes the Japanese government’s incompetence in handling the epidemic and painstakingly captures the decades-long legal and medical battle of the residents of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan. Having filmed the documentary across a span of 15 years, Hara says the idea originated in his mind sometime during the early ‘90s when the momentum around Minamata died down. The epidemic had forced an exodus among residents of Minamata to other cities in search of jobs. He came across one such: a fisherman, who moved to Osaka where they were discussing the impact the disease had on his life. There was anger among people and agitations led by Civil Action Groups, one of the representatives being a university professor, also an acquaintance of Hara. He suggested that the filmmaker make a documentary on Minamata; Hara says he postponed agreeing to it for a year, for he felt the subject was not his territory. Connecting over a video call from his residence at Shinjuku, Japan, Hara, joined by a translator, says, “Noriaki Tsuchimoto’s documentary had a profound impact on me and he was already following up on the case. I even tried meeting him, but they wouldn’t let me because he was in a hospital. I never had a chance to ask him, but in a way, I inherited what he started.” The filming for the documentary began in 2001 and roughly ended in 2015-16. Split into three parts with two intervals, Hara takes a matter-of-fact approach to the 372-minute documentary, bringing out a series of first-person interviews with patients, medical researchers and academics who were involved in the study, and the plaintiffs. Though its runtime may seem laboriously endless, the larger point of the documentary was to give the audience a taste of the long road it takes for justice and hence, the film’s runtime, though justifiable, seemed like it was intended to honour the memories of the people featured. Hara has not just invested a stupendous amount of time, but has also sacrificed 15 years of his life to realise this documentary. While admitting that he has changed as a person over the years, Hara says it has been a journey of self-discovery going as far back as the time he made The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On (1987), one of his most famous works, to draw a parallel to his older self. The protagonist of that film was a determined individual who took on the government single-handedly. “I found it intriguing to express stories of oppression from the point of view of a strong individual who opposes the establishment. In contrast to this, was the normal people leading their daily lives. Rather than filming the stories of normal people and their everyday lives and struggles, I was egged on by an individual’s fight and my first four films were all about that,” he says.“I realise now it is not about an individual but about the fighting spirit of the everyday people.” Minamata Mandala was screened at the recently-concluded International Film Festival Rotterdam 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/fighting-the-good-fight/article34793969.ece
12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Food on the plate, and on my mind||It was our godchild’s birthday, and she celebrated it by ordering in. Since it was a special day, she decided that she had to start with a gala breakfast. It came from a restaurant called AMA’s Kitchen, known for its breakfast fare. She asked for a plate of fluffy pancakes. And the picture she sent us was so enticing that I put it on top of my must-have list. AMA’s Kitchen, she said, had come to her mind because we had, just a few days before that, ordered our lunch from there. We had seen this little café in Majnu-ka-Tilla some years ago when we had gone to this north Delhi food hub for a Korean meal. We thought of going to AMA’s for dessert and coffee, but it had shut for the day, so that was a dream that remained unfulfilled. AMA’s, I realise, is a great favourite of the young, who now know more about food than their grizzled parents. And the pizza and salad that we ordered from there explains just why it is so popular. The café is in New Camp Majnu-ka-Tilla, or New Aruna Nagar, as it is now known. The menu is a foodie’s delight, but it is especially known for its breakfast fare, including the old Manali breakfast (Rs. 200) which consists of a potato patty, scrambled eggs with cheese, coriander-mint chutney, multigrain bread, and tea or coffee. The American breakfast has eggs, pancakes, bacon, chicken sausages, maple syrup, whipped cream, tea or coffee (Rs. 240). But we were looking forward to a pizza-laden meal. So we asked for the RGB pizza (Rs. 245) with sundried tomatoes, spinach and olive and the Ultimate Meat Lovers Pizza (Rs. 315), with chicken, bacon, and pepperoni. Since I believe in a balanced meal, I ordered a Greek salad (Rs. 180) as well. I started with the salad, which was delightful. It had chopped green peppers, tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce leaves and crumbled feta cheese, in a light dressing of olive oil. The veggies were crunchy and fresh, and set the mood for the pizza meal. Surprisingly, the pizzas weren’t too heavy, possibly because the base was thin and crisp. I liked the meaty pizza, with its juicy pepperoni and chicken, but the vegetarian pizza was so delicious that I went back for seconds. The bits of crispy spinach, olive and sundried tomatoes gave it a sharp and tangy taste that I thoroughly enjoyed. AMA’s is known for its desserts (apple pie with vanilla ice cream, Rs. 180; mud pie and fudge brownie, both with vanilla ice cream, Rs. 160, and if you are lucky, you can get some banoffee pie). I have decided that my next meal from there will consist of Thamel’s bacon pineapple sandwich (Rs. 265) and pancakes with maple syrup, whipped cream and fruit. The pancake is fluffy and light, soufflé like, I hear, and the cream and maple syrup add to the enjoyment. Then I shall exchange notes with the goddaughter. Nothing quite like planning ahead.

But when he set foot in the film industry as a composer, there was little guidance. “Mentorship is important. It is a checkpoint to validate if you are going towards the right treasure,” says the musician. The Tamil film composer is looking forward to that and acquiring some new skills during his stint at the BAFTA Breakthrough Initiative. “I believe this [the programme] is more than just about enhancing core skill sets. For a successful career, it is also important to develop a few ancillary skillsets. This programme is customised based on the requirements of every honouree. So, the experience I have will be different from other honourees. I hope to find a new sound and genre, and open up a plethora of opportunities.” Most of these opportunities are coming to Murthy post his impressive work in 2019 Tamil film KD Engira Karuppudurai , directed by Madhumitha. “I was the first person to whom she [Madhmitha] narrated the storyline. I insisted that I would be part of it, whether she likes it or not,” he laughs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/karthikeya-murthy-music-composer/article34793970.ece
12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||The spy who has won over the country||Manoj Bajpayee is shooting for a new project atop a hill in Uttarakhand. The internet connection is inconsistent. “I miss the personal touch,” he says, slightly vexed that all interactions have gone online since the pandemic. But even on a patchy Zoom call, his excitement is apparent. The second season of The Family Man , in which he reprises the role of Srikant Tiwari, the middle-aged spy dealing with middle-class problems and midlife crisis, released on June 4. And there has been a torrent of feedback. “It is quite overwhelming,” he says. “Though the first season was well received, it took time for people to watch the series and for it to spread through word of mouth. The second one just took off from the first hour of its release. People are binge-watching it; hundreds of people I know are watching it for the second or even third time.” The anticipation, after all, was enormous. Season one had ended on a cliffhanger. But there was the question of whether the second season would match or surpass the storytelling of the first. The reviews have been largely positive. There’s been no dearth of Twitter memes and theories. Even some of the cameo roles have garnered a following (Google ‘Chellam Sir Family Man memes’). Most recently, the banter between Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, about Bajpayee’s new drama, Ray (releasing June 25 on Netflix), caught everyone’s attention. “Every day, there is a lot of love pouring in through social media, personal messages. It’s quite unprecedented for me,” says the actor, 52, adding, “This kind of success, one cannot expect.” There have been controversies too, sinceThe Family Man 2trailer dropped. The show narrates the story of a rebellious army of Tamils in Sri Lanka closely resembling the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). And a few political leaders from Tamil Nadu have called for its  ban, accusing the makers of negatively portraying the Tamil Eelam. “The objections started before the show started streaming,” Bajpayee says. “But the apprehensions slowly started getting answered once it released. So many people from Tamil Nadu are loving the show. So, that takes care of the other negative voices. Let the product talk for itself.” The National Award-winning actor believes the writers and directors — Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK (known as Raj and DK), Suman Kumar and Suparn S Verma — have created “a show that is sensitive to the emotions of people in this country”. In an interview with The Hindu Weekend , he talks about his character, the pan-Indianness of the show, collaborating with South Indian actors, and more. Edited excerpts: Was there any pressure going into the second season?  We were already shooting in Chennai for season two when the first started streaming. The script was ready, and all the major portions of the schedule was done. So the reception of season one didn’t impact season two. In your career, you haven’t stayed with any other role as much as you have with Srikant Tiwari. Does that make him one of your favourite characters? A character always leaves a residue in the actor’s mind regardless of how well you move on from it. I give all of myself to each and every character I do. So, it’s hard to pick a favourite. For a film, you shoot for 45-50 days and you are out of it. With The Family Man , if you include the days of shooting and preparation, it is over 150 to 200 days. When the next season starts, you have to relive the character. That’s tiring and tedious to do. You need the ability to return to the character after being a part of other projects. It’s a different ballgame. Were there any apprehensions before signingThe Family Man ?    I got offers for a few other series on OTT platforms, but I didn’t want to be a part of them. I wanted to do something where I could make a difference as an actor. When Raj and DK narrated the synopsis, I was sold on the idea of an intelligence guy with the problems of a middle-class person. I can see bits of Srikant Tiwari in the people around me. He is kind of like RK Laxman’s Common Man. He is a part of the play and also a witness to the play. You have starred in a few comedies. But your most acclaimed roles have been ones with darker shades. Do you have a preference for the latter?  Not really. No matter how dark my characters are — even if they are gangsters or policemen or an intelligence guy — I like to make them relatable. I draw examples from the lives of regular people. Each and every person who watches my films or shows should feel that these are their stories. That’s my endeavour when I prepare for a role. The Family Mandeals with volatile topics — Kashmir in the first season, Sri Lankan Tamils in the second. When you enter such politics-heavy projects, are you more careful than usual?  You go by the character or the story that you are given. Your job is to go with conviction and give your 200% to your role. But every actor or creative person should have an understanding of the politics in their country. The writers of The Family Man are well-read. All the characters in the show are heroes in their own stories. We humanise them. We are not here to take sides. We put forth arguments from both sides and let people decide for themselves. There are quite a few Tamil-speaking actors in the show.  I have done two commercial films in Tamil [ Samar and Anjaan ], and my experience with my co-stars and directors has been amazing. It’s the same when you are working with fantastic talents like Priyamani and Samantha Akkineni [who play Tiwari’s wife and a Sri Lankan Tamil respectively in season two]. You are observing their work ethics and their methods. It was such an eye-opener for me. I have admired Priyamani from season one. This time, I was amazed how Samantha ferociously went into preparing for the project, be it the dialogues or the martial arts training. How are the developments in OTT impacting the mainstream film space?  Filmmakers who entered the industry after the 90s were open to experimenting, but couldn’t because of the limitations in the commercial space. But now, because of OTTs, they are translating their vision on to the screen. And, most importantly, they are being received well by audiences. Another project I am doing also has a pan-India feel. The Family Man 2is streaming now on Amazon Prime Video.

12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Who’s in your head?||You should never listen to what they say. At least, that’s what they say. To clarify, if you were to listen to what they say, then you’d not be listening to what they say. Clear now? You’ve heard them say, for example, that wide foreheads signify great memories. Keep your hair on! They also say wide foreheads signify balding genes. Not to split hairs, but they say that great memories are not worth losing hair over because the next generations will just Google, and let their great memories go redundant. And to bring it all to a head, they even say appearances are deceptive. Which means that those who appear to have wide foreheads may not really have wide foreheads. Clearer now? After a lifetime of listening to what they say, you will discover there are bunches of Theys who say deliberately contradictory things. As soon as you’re following one, the others say something diametrically opposite. They are all convinced they are right and they are wrong. That leaves us, as they say, with no options at all. You definitely should not be listening to whether they say that lizard squeaks herald weddings or deaths, whether to turn (or vote) left or right; whether lengths of skirts are in the eyes of the beholder or not. You should really be listening only to yourself. Now here is where it turns hairy. I say categorically that you shouldn’t care a toss about what they say. But since for you, I am one of They, if you listen to me, you could say that you shouldn’t listen to me. Then I’d say that you’re part of the They I’m advising against being listened to, in the first place. So you should really not be listening to you either. And you don’t. This is the final truth. They are so much in your head that you now listen to what they say because you think it is what you think. What you say is exactly what they say, after all. And what I say is exactly what they say, as well. It’s just that your They and my They are different. And they say you and I should be, too. Are we really?

12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Into the open: struggles of the female athlete||In 2019, Utkarsha Pawar, 22, from Pune, began journalling. On its last page, she wrote down her goal: to be selected in the cricket Women’s Under-23 Challenger Trophy. Every day, as she filled her diary, it was a reminder that all her thoughts and actions were fine-tuned towards that. “I achieved it, and ticked it off,” she says, adding that writing has helped in visualisation, an exercise by sportspersons to sharpen focus and better performance. It also helped her process her grandfather’s death last year. While the practice is beneficial for men and women athletes, Pawar finds that it’s her women athlete friends who journal more. “I also have gym training as part of the journal, so it helps me keep track of how I perform and lift [weights] during my periods,” she says. Added layers of pressure There are two parts to building mental health in athletes: Performance enhancement on field and well-being (tackling stress and disorders) off field, says Divya Jain, a sports psychologist from Fortis Healthcare. While journalling and visualisation are practised by both men and women, off field stressors may differ. Soniya Dabir, Pawar’s coach, singles out the word ‘pressure’ to describe a sportsperson’s life: the need to perform better or at least at par with a previous time; the juggling of time between sport and study; the stress of endorsements. Women have added layers of pressure — the doubts about earning a living from sport, where women play for even shorter durations than men; the decision to have a child, etc. The nuances of women’s sport While we will never know the depth of Naomi Osaka’s mental health condition — she does not owe us a detailed explanation, much like she wouldn’t her history of a physical injury — she has opened up a conversation around mental health in sport. On Clubhouse discussions, players have talked about the responses to her decision to take a break, opening the field for more nuanced discussions. Take just the issue of what to wear at sporting events. Karan Singh, who runs the Indian Track Foundation, set up three years ago, has four female athletes (handpicked from across interiors of Jharkhand) in his elite team of 10 trainees. Earlier this year, the girls got Adidas gear, which gave them access to sports bras and shorts worn at the international level in track and field events. “These clothes are shorter and more snug than what Aakancha [Kerketta, 16] is comfortable wearing,” he says of his ward. So he left it up to her, but she realised the difference it was making to her performance and decided to go with them. Singh, who is aiming for the 2028 Olympic Games and beyond normalises conversations with the help of his wife, who talks menstruation and body changes with the girls, made easier since they live together in one house in Ooty. About mental safety Just like a physical injury, a mental one too needs more than just first aid. A sports psychologist at Jamshedpur, talks of a young woman who came to him two years after she had been raped in her early teens, by fellow senior male players. “She came with anxiety, and after three or four sessions on a phone consultation, she revealed she had been raped,” he says. But a girl doesn’t have to be sexually abused to feel insecure. And it’s not just about putting up a CCTV camera, says Gayatri Vartak Madkekar, a sports psychologist. “An athlete travelling alone must feel safe. There are overt ideas of safety, but there is also the mental angle,” says Madkekar, adding that having a woman mentor, someone who has gone through a particular experience, will help young players. There is also the question of ‘what if not sport?’. While women in cities may have career options and choices they are free to exercise, those in villages might not. Arundhati (name changed to protect identity), 22, who (since 2009) has trained with Yuwa, an organisation for girls’ empowerment through football, says girls in rural Jharkhand generally get married by 15 or 16. Sports therefore also offers an escape route and she says she “feels free on the football field”. Fighting the odds Tripti Behera, 19, from New Delhi, talks about patriarchy and capitalism when it comes to earnings, even in seemingly egalitarian big-city settings. “I play for the Delhi Women’s League. The men get prize money; we don’t. Also, they get put up at five-star hotels, and we’ll get a two-star hotel.” Arundhati remembers her first national camp. “In the evening, the coaches would ask us to sing or dance, and I am shy, so I wouldn’t want to come to the front. They would force me to, and say, ‘You girl from a backward community — learn to sing or dance’.” On field too, she felt bullied. These challenges that go beyond just concentrating on the game chip away at their self-belief.  Media matters What appears in the press also has a bearing on the mind. Sprinter Dutee Chand says reporters will pit her against Hima Das in sensational headlines, and will take a quote out of context. Despite all the media coverage, a BBC survey last year, 50% of those surveyed in India (10,181 across 14 states) could not name even one sportswoman. Up to 42% felt that women’s sports were not as ‘entertaining’ as men’s. Supporting women in sports will bolster mental health, but this will need institutions, individuals, and society to come together. As Behera says, “I want to be known as a footballer; not a woman football player.”  With inputs from Saraswathy Nagarajan and Uthra Ganesan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/into-the-open-struggles-of-the-female-athlete/article34793625.ece
12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Taking sex seriously||In 1985, Saagar was in the news for many reasons. It was director Ramesh Sippy’s first romance after Shakti (1982), Shaan (1980) and Sholay (1975). It was also Dimple Kapadia’s comeback film, opposite her Bobby co-star, Rishi Kapoor. It also happened to be the movie with an allegedly inadvertent topless scene. The story goes something like this. Rishi Kapoor’s character, Ravi, sees Mona (Kapadia) for the first time as she comes out of the sea. Not quite covered in foam, Mona wraps a towel around herself, which slips for a second. ‘The towel slipping was an accident’, ‘We didn’t realise the cameras were rolling’ — these were the reasons trotted out at the time, still not explaining how the frame made it beyond the cutting floor. Fast forward to 35 years later, post #metoo and with intimacy coordinators now on film sets, how would this have played out? Know your rights “I probably would have done the exact same thing visually, but in a way that Dimple ma’am would have felt safe,” says Aastha Khanna, India’s first certified intimacy coordinator, who ventured into the space last lockdown. “An important part of intimacy is for performers to know their rights. If there was an accident on set which was shot, it should be deleted. However, if the director and actor feel the shot works aesthetically, they can take a decision to keep the scene,” she explains. Earlier this week, when actor Michaela Coel ( I May Destroy You ) dedicated her BAFTA to intimacy coordinator, Ita O’Brien, it highlighted this new breed of on-set professionals. The second season of American drama The Deuce was the first show to have an intimacy coordinator, Alicia Rodis. There also is Elizabeth Talbot for Bridgerton and  Amanda Blumenthal (Euphoria).  The deep dive Khanna, 26, says she learnt about intimacy coordinators when she was researching a workshop on intimacy for a film that she was an AD on (yet to be announced). When she could not find an intimacy coordinator in India she wrote to the Intimacy Professionals Association (IPA), a global agency founded by Blumenthal. “When they said they had never trained anyone from the South Asian community, I thought I could give it a shot,” says Khanna who applied for the intensive 20-week training programme that cost around Rs. 4 lakh. “We were taught to look at intimacy coordination through different lenses as well as basics like how to navigate a film set, how to read a contract, the different protocols and processes,” says the artiste. The course called for a deep dive into gender, sexuality and diversity, says Khanna. While she cannot talk about the shows she has worked on (still in production), Khanna reveals, “I have worked with a few studios, with Netflix on a couple of shows and Dharmatic on a feature and a show. I am looking forward to working with Amazon Prime.” Choreographing moves Internationally, parallels are drawn between an intimacy coordinator and an action director. “They do that because the pay is the same and so is the concept. An action director ensures the physical safety of the artist, while an intimacy coordinator looks out for the physical and mental safety.” The money, however, is not great. “We are working on it. I have founded a collective of intimacy professionals in India. We are launching a website that is going to have guidelines and workshops,” says Khanna, who likes to compare her role to that of a choreographer.

12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Inside Clubhouse India||I first heard about Clubhouse back in January. A friend sent me an invite and I reluctantly opened an account, annoyed at being tasked with learning how to operate yet another social media platform. Then I ignored it. At least until the second wave hit and we were all back to being at home indefinitely. I logged on thinking it was going to be like last year’s Houseparty fad; safe to say, I am now hooked and I have no concept of sleep any more. What is Clubhouse? Think of it like a podcast in real time or a live radio show. Some describe it as a group of friends chatting or even having a “kitty party”. Whereas others call it a place to have dialogue and discourse. People now have the opportunity to speak to some of the best minds in their fields — internationally, rooms with names like Dr Anthony Fauci and Virgil Abloh have seen some of the biggest engagement. Closer home, people like Sonam Kapoor and Kusha Kapila now have a direct line with their fans. Since there are no text messages, direct messaging, or commenting on the app, the audio-only format limits opportunities for trolling. Something that Twitter and Instagram still don’t know how to deal with. For me, it started out as some fun, frivolous conversations about dating and “shooting your shot” (basically the Clubhouse version of telling someone you find them attractive). But soon I was tuning into more “serious” rooms. I am now listening in on conversations about the caste politics in India, the #MeToo movement, and crypto-currency.  Local connect  Clubhouse’s trajectory in India has been slightly different. The American market had a head start, which means they are now monetising rooms — artists are hosting paid gigs, people are charging fees for exclusive closed rooms, and the like. Indian Clubhouse isn’t there yet, but it is close. The main difference I’ve noticed is that in the West, there are many rooms with certain people talking and others listening. The Indian audiences want to speak and contribute more. If I am hosting a room and the hand raising feature is off, I end up getting messages on my Instagram to invite people so they can chime in. India being a very linguistically diverse country has also ensured that regional languages have found a life of their own on Clubhouse. In fact, the rooms hosted by some Malayali folks — with the most diverse topics (think ‘Can a parotta be a parotta if it looks like a chapathi ?’) — have seen up to 8,000 people at one point, the maximum number allowed in a room by Clubhouse. Is it a polarising app? Absolutely! Especially since it is now open to Android users, and numbers have risen. Earlier a 500-person room was something to be proud of. Now 5,000 are not enough for some. There is a lot of discussion about “influencers” on Clubhouse. People are annoyed that already popular digital stars are bringing their clout and disrupting a space that the early adopters worked hard to build. Yet, every other day there is a discussion about influencers, and each of these rooms draws large numbers, elicits several reaction rooms, and creates many Twitter and Reddit threads. There is also a very active political subculture on Clubhouse, with a clear distinction between the Left and Right leaning groups. The word “echo-chamber” is often used because these heated rooms aren’t really having a discourse. I have been “warned” about not following certain people and entering certain rooms because they don’t necessarily align with my political ideologies, and I am supposedly at risk of getting cornered.  Making it your own  My favourite rooms have been where my extreme privilege has been checked, and I have learnt a lot. A popular club, ‘The Dark Room’, has hosted incredible rooms on topics ranging from fat-phobia to caste-based discrimination. Making these spaces inclusive has been one of the reasons I find Clubhouse to be more democratic than other social media platforms. Some of the other rooms I enjoy attending are the music rooms, including ones dedicated to antakshari! There are also some great artistes that are now Clubhouse celebrities, such as Anirudh Deshmukh and Markand Soni. Clubhouse has become a great forum for the LGBTQIA+ community. Queer people have found their own table, since a seat wasn’t made available at the existing platforms for them. The conversations range from fun to educational, and the beauty of the app is that you get to shuttle between both. Clubhouse is still very new in India. Questions like how to monetise it, what is the future of the app, are being asked. Nobody really has an answer, but what we know is that people are either on it or are trying to score an invite.

12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Sonic identity:||A couple of weeks ago, McDonald’s launched the BTS meal, driven by the K-Pop superstars’ latest hit ‘Butter’. The meal is available in 50 countries, including India, along with BTS merchandise such as T-shirts and hoodies. This is not the first time that the fast food chain has cashed in on a music celebrity meal; in 2020, they signed up American rapper Travis Scott. Over the last few years, international brands have been placing emphasis on the sonic identity that defines them, and rightly so. Similar to visual branding, here the idea is that a sound triggers brand recall. Think Netflix’s simple, two-beat ‘Ta dum’, or McDonald’s five-note ‘Ba da ba ba ba’ signature. At a time when the way we live, shop and pay continues to change (voice shopping, for instance, via Amazon Echo or Google Home), sound adds a new dimension to a brand’s identity. In India, sonic branding is slowly taking root. As recently as last year, bands such as Indian Ocean have revisited the jingle for brands such as Dhara Cooking Oil to put a new spin on its music and to bring the brand into the spotlight again. “Sonic branding is a signature for your brand through the facet of sound,” explains Ajit Varma, CEO, BrandMusiq, one of the pioneers of it in India, which has scored the MOGO® (musical logo) for companies such as HDFC bank, Vistara, Raymond and Myntra.

To clarify, if you were to listen to what they say, then you’d not be listening to what they say. Clear now? You’ve heard them say, for example, that wide foreheads signify great memories. Keep your hair on! They also say wide foreheads signify balding genes. Not to split hairs, but they say that great memories are not worth losing hair over because the next generations will just Google, and let their great memories go redundant. And to bring it all to a head, they even say appearances are deceptive. Which means that those who appear to have wide foreheads may not really have wide foreheads. Clearer now? After a lifetime of listening to what they say, you will discover there are bunches of Theys who say deliberately contradictory things. As soon as you’re following one, the others say something diametrically opposite. They are all convinced they are right and they are wrong. That leaves us, as they say, with no options at all. You definitely should not be listening to whether they say that lizard squeaks herald weddings or deaths, whether to turn (or vote) left or right; whether lengths of skirts are in the eyes of the beholder or not. You should really be listening only to yourself. Now here is where it turns hairy. I say categorically that you shouldn’t care a toss about what they say. But since for you, I am one of They, if you listen to me, you could say that you shouldn’t listen to me. Then I’d say that you’re part of the They I’m advising against being listened to, in the first place. So you should really not be listening to you either. And you don’t. This is the final truth. They are so much in your head that you now listen to what they say because you think it is what you think. What you say is exactly what they say, after all.

A choreographer also liaises with different departments to ensure the right costume and make-up is used.” In a dance rehearsal, she says, the performer is not in costume, and similarly, no one is taking their clothes off in an intimacy rehearsal. “It is a dry run to figure out positions. Just as a choreographer understands the strengths of the performer, an intimacy coordinator should know what the actors are comfortable with and design the scene around that,” says Khanna. Unlike a choreographer, however, an intimacy coordinator usually does not design an intimate scene. “If they want to show heterosexual oral sex, it would be written from the perspective of where the lens and camera are going to be. It will not be from the perspective of what my feet or hands are doing or how I am lying down. That is when I come in and have a conversation with the director to create a storyboard,” says Khanna, adding, “I do not always choreograph the scene but I do need to know what the choreography will be so that I can liaise with the different departments to make sure that the safety gear and costumes are correct.

12 June 2021||June 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Into the open: struggles of the female athlete||In 2019, Utkarsha Pawar, 22, from Pune, began journalling. On its last page, she wrote down her goal: to be selected in the cricket Women’s Under-23 Challenger Trophy. Every day, as she filled her diary, it was a reminder that all her thoughts and actions were fine-tuned towards that. “I achieved it, and ticked it off,” she says, adding that writing has helped in visualisation, an exercise by sportspersons to sharpen focus and better performance. It also helped her process her grandfather’s death last year. While the practice is beneficial for men and women athletes, Pawar finds that it’s her women athlete friends who journal more. “I also have gym training as part of the journal, so it helps me keep track of how I perform and lift [weights] during my periods,” she says. Added layers of pressure There are two parts to building mental health in athletes: performance enhancement on field and well-being (tackling stress and disorders) off field, says Divya Jain, a sports psychologist from Fortis Healthcare. While journalling and visualisation are practised by both men and women, off field stressors may differ. Soniya Dabir, Pawar’s coach, singles out the word ‘pressure’ to describe a sportsperson’s life: the need to perform better or at least at par with a previous time; the juggling of time between sport and study; the stress of endorsements. Women have added layers of pressure — the doubts about earning a living from sport, where women play for even shorter durations than men; the decision to have a child, etc. The nuances of women’s sport While we will never know the depth of Naomi Osaka’s mental health condition — she does not owe us a detailed explanation, much like she wouldn’t her history of a physical injury — she has opened up a conversation around mental health in sport. On Clubhouse discussions, players have talked about the responses to her decision to take a break, opening the field for more nuanced discussions. Take just the issue of what to wear at sporting events. Karan Singh, who runs the Indian Track Foundation, set up three years ago, has four female athletes (handpicked from across interiors of Jharkhand) in his elite team of 10 trainees. Earlier this year, the girls got Adidas gear, which gave them access to sports bras and shorts worn at the international level in track and field events. “These clothes are shorter and more snug than what Aakancha [Kerketta, 16] is comfortable wearing,” he says of his ward. So he left it up to her, but she realised the difference it was making to her performance and decided to go with them. Singh, who is aiming for the 2028 Olympic Games and beyond, normalises conversations with the help of his wife, who talks menstruation and body changes with the girls, made easier since they live together in one house in Ooty. About mental safety Just like a physical injury, a mental one too needs more than just first aid. A sports psychologist at Jamshedpur, talks of a young woman who came to him two years after she had been raped in her early teens, by fellow senior male players. “She came with anxiety, and after three or four sessions on a phone consultation, she revealed she had been raped,” he says. But a girl doesn’t have to be sexually abused to feel insecure. And it’s not just about putting up a CCTV camera, says Gayatri Vartak Madkekar, a sports psychologist. “An athlete travelling alone must feel safe. There are overt ideas of safety, but there is also the mental angle,” says Madkekar, adding that having a woman mentor, someone who has gone through a particular experience, will help young players. There is also the question of ‘what if not sport?’. While women in cities may have career options and choices they are free to exercise, those in villages might not. Arundhati (name changed to protect identity), 22, who (since 2009) has trained with Yuwa, an organisation for girls’ empowerment through football, says girls in rural Jharkhand generally get married by 15 or 16. Sports, therefore, also offers an escape route and she says she “feels free on the football field”. Fighting the odds Tripta Behera, 19, from New Delhi, talks about patriarchy and capitalism when it comes to earnings, even in seemingly egalitarian big-city settings. “I play for the Delhi Women’s League. The men get prize money; we don’t. Also, they get put up at five-star hotels, and we’ll get a two-star hotel.” Arundhati remembers her first national camp. “In the evening, the coaches would ask us to sing or dance, and I am shy, so I wouldn’t want to come to the front. They would force me to, and say, ‘You girl from a backward community — learn to sing or dance’.” On field too, she felt bullied. These challenges that go beyond just concentrating on the game chip away at their self-belief.  Media matters What appears in the press also has a bearing on the mind. Sprinter Dutee Chand says reporters will pit her against Hima Das in sensational headlines, and will take a quote out of context. Despite all the media coverage, a BBC survey last year, 50% of those surveyed in India (10,181 across 14 states) could not name even one sportswoman. Up to 42% felt that women’s sports were not as ‘entertaining’ as men’s. Supporting women in sports will bolster their mental health, but this will need institutions, individuals, and society to come together. As Behera says, “I want to be known as a footballer; not a woman football player.”  With inputs from Saraswathy Nagarajan and Uthra Ganesan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/into-the-open-struggles-of-the-female-athlete/article34794283.ece
12 June 2021||New Delhi,||Out of 77,112 people tested in the Capital, 238 found positive||Delhi reported 238 new COVID-19 cases and 24 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative cases to 14,30,671 and death toll to 24,772, said a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Friday. Out of the total cases, 14,01,977 people have recovered and there are 3,922 active cases. A total of 77,112 tests were conducted while the test positivity rate was 0.31%. This means less than one person out of 100 people taking COVID-19 tests are positive for the virus. The TPR was as high as 36% on April 22 and has been coming down since then. Meanwhile, AAP leader Atishi said Delhi has vaccinated 30% of its population and 13,94,000 people have received both doses of vaccine. “Now that the Delhi government has received vaccines, 263 government centres are operating at 100 locations where the 18-44 age group is getting vaccinated,” she said. Vaccine stock “We have 25 days’ stock of Covishield for those above 45. As far as the 18-44 years age group is concerned, Delhi has received a total of 10,34,910 doses of the vaccine, out of which we have 1,40,000 doses available,” she added.  After Central government capped the price private hospitals can charge for a dose of Covishield at Rs. 780, Aakash Healthcare on Friday said they have stopped their drive-through vaccination, where a dose of Covishield was given at Rs. 1,600. “Owing to new vaccination pricing, running it has become non-viable,” the hospital said in a statement.  As far as the 18-44 years age group is concerned, Delhi has received a total of 10,34,910 doses of the vaccine  Atishi AAP leader||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/out-of-77112-people-tested-in-the-capital-238-found-positive/article34793994.ece
12 June 2021||Guwahati,||Assam Congress slams CM’s ‘population’ remark||The Assam unit of the Congress has slammed Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for asking a minority community to adopt population control measures. Marking the completion of a month of the BJP-led government on Thursday, he stated the population of the minorities needed to be in check to prevent encroachment and pressure on land resources. Congress leader Bobbeeta Sharma said on Friday, “He said that if the population explosion continues, the Kamakhya Temple [Guwahati] land will one day be encroached upon. This is unbecoming of the Chief Minister who is expected to be well-versed in demographic facts of a State he represents”. The Assam Pradesh Congress Committee cited the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) released in December 2020, which said the total fertility rate (TFR) declined across most Indian States in the last five years. “The total fertility rate is defined as the average number of children that would be born to a woman by the time she ends childbearing. A TFR of 2.1 is known as the replacement rate. The fertility rate of less than 2.1 implies that the total population will be less than the existing population which is also called the negative growth rate,” the party said in a statement. “Now, the same survey said the fertility rate of women in Assam declined from 2.2 in 2015-16 to 1.9 in 2020-21, which means the future population of Assam will only be less than the current population. Hence there is no question of an increase in population, as the data of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare show,” the party said. ‘Misleading remark’ In the context of the NFHS survey, the Chief Minister’s remark on “population explosion” in Assam was misinformed and misleading, Ms. Sharma said. “But if he is referring to the population explosion that may happen in future due to immigration of people from Bangladesh and Pakistan because of the implementation of the CAA, then his concern is perhaps valid,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-congress-slams-cms-population-remark/article34794291.ece
12 June 2021||Chandigarh,||Punjab police seize huge cache of foreign-made pistols||The Punjab police on Friday said they have seized a huge cache of foreign-made pistols and arrested a weapons smuggler, allegedly linked with Pakistan-based terrorist outfits and anti-India pro-Khalistani elements based in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta said the weapons were meant for carrying out terror activities in various parts of India. He said Jagjit Singh (25), a resident of Batala, was arrested from near Kathunangal in Amritsar on Thursday night by a team of Punjab Internal Security Wing. “The team recovered from him two nylon bags containing 48 pistols of different foreign makes and bores, along with magazines and ammunition. The cache included 19 pistols of 9 mm [Zigana-Made in Turkey], 37 magazines and 45 rounds; 9 pistols of .30 bore (Made in China) and 22 magazines; 19 pistols of .30 bore (Star mark), 38 magazines and 148 rounds; and 1 pistol of 9 mm (Baretta-Italian) and two magazines.”  ‘Orders from gangster’ The DGP said preliminary investigation showed that Jagjit had been directed by former gangster-criminal Darmanjot Singh alias Darmanjot Kahlon, to collect and conceal the weapons’ consignment. He had been in touch with Darmanjot, at present based in the U.S., during his stay in Dubai from 2017 to December 2020. Darmanjot had reportedly tasked Jagjit to wait for further instructions for the delivery of the pistols, said the DGP, adding that open-ended warrants for Darmanjot, a proclaimed offender in the State, had been obtained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-police-seize-huge-cache-of-foreign-made-pistols/article34794293.ece
12 June 2021||Guwahati,||Bru refugee rehabilitation in Tripura hits green panel hurdle||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has sought replies from the Forest Department and a district administration in Tripura on a complaint that Bru refugees from adjoining Mizoram were being resettled in a forest. On June 9, the Kolkata-based eastern zonal Bench of the NGT directed the Principal Secretary of Tripura’s Forest Department, the District Magistrate of North Tripura district and other officials to submit a report on the rehabilitation plan by July 14. The order was issued on the basis of a complaint by Dhanishwar Debnath who cited an e-tender floated by the Tripura government on November 4, 2020, seeking “certain constructions within a forest area” in North Tripura district. The complainant, who resides in the area, said the construction for resettling the Brus would be in a 250-hectare green belt. He pointed out that this would be in violation of Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act of 1980. “In our opinion, matter requires consideration,” the Bench of Judicial Member B. Amit Sthalekar and Expert Member Saibal Dasgupta said, allowing the complainant to implead the State’s Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Head of Forest Force. More than 40,000 Brus — also called Reangs — have been living in the Tripura relief camps since 1997 after escaping ethnic violence in Mizoram. About 7,000 refugees returned to Mizoram after nine phases of repatriation till November 30, 2019. The rest stayed put citing security reasons. The repatriation stalemate ended with the signing of the quadripartite agreement on in January 16, 2020, among representatives of Brus, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Tripura and Mizoram governments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bru-refugee-rehabilitation-in-tripura-hits-green-panel-hurdle/article34794297.ece
12 June 2021||New Delhi,||Nod to cut trees for hospital pending with Minister for 30 months||The permission to cut or transplant trees for the Union government’s plan to construct a 100-bed hospital in Najafgarh has been pending with the Delhi Environment Minister’s office for almost two-and-a-half years, according to a status report accessed by The Hindu . The Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has written a letter to Lt. Governor Anil Baijal to speed up the process and the letter has also been submitted to the Minister’s office through the Chief Secretary’s office earlier this month, a senior Delhi government official said. “Multiple reminders on this matter from the Central government have also been submitted to the Environment Minister’s office, but there is no decision yet,” the official said. Catering to 13 lakh In May 2018, the Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had cleared the construction of the hospital and said it will cater to 13.65 lakh people. The hospital was supposed to be operational by May 2020. Later in 2018, the officials had recommended the cutting of trees and as per a status report of the Delhi government, the file for the project was submitted to the Environment Minister on December 18, 2018. The Minister has neither rejected nor approved it. On April 16, Union Health Minister in a letter to the Lt. Governor directed to “expedite the forest clearance pending before Govt. of NCT of Delhi” for construction of the hospital. Mr. Vardhan said he had written twice to the Chief Minister. A total of 57 trees have to be cut or transplanted for the project, as per officials. In April, during the peak of COVID-19 infection, people were running from one hospital to another to find hospital beds and on many days, the total vacant beds were only about 5-6%. Hurdles galore As per rules, an applicant can go ahead and cut the trees if the government does not reply within 60 days. But officials said most government projects do not go ahead without a permission, so as to avoid problems in the future. “The tree officer shall give his decision within sixty days from the date of receipt of the application. If the officer fails to communicate his permission on request within the period specified under sub-section (3), the permission referred to in section 8 shall be deemed to have been granted,” the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, states about permission for cutting of trees. The report showed that permission to cut trees for about 12 projects are pending before the Environment Minister’s office and many of them are Central government projects. When contacted, a Delhi government spokesperson refused to comment.  Multiple reminders on this matter from the Central government have also been submitted to the Environment Minister’s office, but there is no decision yet A senior Delhi govt. official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nod-to-cut-trees-for-hospital-pending-with-minister-for-30-months/article34793990.ece

The court was informed by the Central government’s counsel that the government is seized of the issue and will take a decision on the same. Noting the statement made by the Centre’s counsel, Justice Amit Bansal said no further orders are required and disposed of the woman’s petition. Advocate Vasudha Zutshi, representing the woman, said the petitioner is in advanced stage of pregnancy and desires to get vaccinated on priority basis. She sought direction to the government to issue a fresh notification to include pregnant women in the vaccination drive on priority basis. NTAGI recommendations Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma and Central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia said National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) has issued a notification on May 28 in which various recommendations were made including that all pregnant women visiting antenatal care may be informed about the risks and benefits associated with the COVID-19 vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, available in the country. Based on the information provided a pregnant woman may be offered the available COVID-19 vaccine at the nearest centre and the vaccine can be given anytime during the pregnancy, the NTAGI recommendations said, adding that all lactating women are eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines anytime after delivery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/pregnant-woman-moves-hc-for-jab-inclusion/article34793982.ece
12 June 2021||Noida,||Officials told to complete rehabilitation of villagers by June 30||Rehabilitation of villagers whose land has been acquired for the first phase of the Noida International Airport is targeted to be completed by June 30, according to government officials involved in the project. A total of 3,003 families are to be rehabilitated and resettled in Jewar Bangar, a township being developed for villagers whose land has been acquired, and so far, 600 have been moved there, the officials said. “Monetary compensation has been paid to the families whose land has been acquired by the Uttar Pradesh government for the Greenfield airport under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Rehabilitation Act, 2013,” said the project’s nodal officer Shailendra Bhatia. “On Wednesday, Meerut Divisional Commissioner Surendra Singh visited the six villages whose land has been acquired. The commissioner then instructed the officials to expedite the rehabilitation work and complete it by June 30,” Mr. Bhatia added. However, according to people privy to the airport development project, some villagers are delaying their relocation due to financial constraints in building houses on the developed land provided to them. “This delay may stretch the target of completing the rehabilitation by a fortnight or so,” they said. Mr. Bhatia, who is also the officer on special duty for the local Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority, said villagers have been told to raise their grievances with the government officials and assured of their problems being resolved. “The villagers whose land has been acquired have been given developed land plots with proper drainage, sewage systems, streets and street lights at Jewar Bangar. They have been given double the amount of their property as per evaluation to ease their relocation,” he said. The Noida International Airport is being developed by Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), a special purpose vehicle floated by the Zurich International Airport AG, the selected concessionaire for the Rs. 29,560 crore greenfield project in Jewar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/officials-told-to-complete-rehabilitation-of-villagers-by-june-30/article34793988.ece

12 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi Congress protests against rising fuel prices, says govts. reaping profit||The Delhi Congress on Friday protested at fuel stations across the Capital against the frequent hike in petrol and diesel prices. The Congress said the government has been burdening people, who are already under tremendous pressure due to the pandemic, with unbearable expenses. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar, who was joined by AICC general secretary K.C.Venugopal and AICC in-charge of Delhi Shakti Sinh Gohil, staged a demonstration at a petrol pump at Delhi Gate, where they shouted slogans against the BJP government at the Centre and the AAP government in Delhi. Mr. Kumar said that a major chunk of the enhanced cost of petrol and diesel goes as excise duty and VAT (Value Added Tax) to the Central and State governments, and if taxes are reduced, petrol and diesel could be sold at cheaper rates in Delhi. “For the last seven years, since the Modi government took charge at the Centre and the Kejriwal government in Delhi, people have been subjected to exploitation without providing any relief to them. Both these governments are reaping thousands of crores in taxes from the sales of petrol and diesel,” Mr. Kumar said. Mr. Kumar added that the unchecked rise in the prices of fuel has boosted the prices of all essential commodities as a terrible side effect, and people, without jobs and any source of livelihood, find it extremely difficult to keep themselves alive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-congress-protests-against-rising-fuel-prices-says-govts-reaping-profit/article34793984.ece

It seems like the BJP-led Centre has no other work but to divert the focus of people and attack the State governments that are actually doing some work,” the AAP leader said.  “The only common factor between oxygen management, vaccines, ration and COVID management is BJP’s opposition and deliberate inaction. When the Chief Minister implored why ration cannot be delivered to households while pizza can, several BJP leaders pounced on the CM and began calling him corrupt. What is wrong if the CM, who is an IIT graduate, promotes doorstep delivery of ration?” he said. ‘Work as Team India’ Meanwhile, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal reiterated that instead of abusing and fighting with State governments, the Centre should work with them. He tagged a media report according to which Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad blamed the Kejriwal government for allegedly failing to provide ration and oxygen to the people. In response, Mr. Kejriwal said the country will progress when 130 crore people, all the State governments and the Centre work together as ‘Team India’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/centre-must-cooperate-with-state-govts-sisodia/article34793989.ece
