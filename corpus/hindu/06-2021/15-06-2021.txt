15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||G7 accommodates Indian stand on need for Internet curbs||Internet freedoms are subject to national security, said government sources, claiming that India’s tough negotiations on the joint communique issued by G7 and Guest Countries at the session on Open Societies had ensured that the original language criticising “Internet shutdowns” was amended to include New Delhi’s concerns. The explanation came after the ‘G7 and Guest Countries: 2021 Open Societies Statement’ referred to “politically motivated Internet shutdowns”, which indirectly addresses Internet blackouts in various parts of the world including India. Kashmir has experienced Internet and mobile telephony shutdown since Article 370 was amended on August 5, 2019. Similar communication shutdowns were witnessed in Delhi and Assam during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act during 2019-2020 and the farmer’s protest last January. Communication shutdowns were also witnessed in other parts of the world, including Hong Kong where a protest against Chinese security laws intensified during 2019. The G7 statement also took note of the developments in military-ruled Myanmar as well as in larger economies. “We are at a critical juncture, facing threats to freedom and democracy from rising authoritarianism, electoral interference, corruption, economic coercion, manipulation of information, including disinformation, online harms and cyber attacks, politically motivated Internet shutdowns, human rights violations and abuses, terrorism and violent extremism,” declared the statement, referring to the problems facing the democratic world. The assertion in the statement appears to touch upon several issues that are sensitive in nature as they are often subjected to public debate in India. Sources indicated that the mention of the topics in the statement took place in the backdrop of a sustained exchange of opinions between G7 and Indian teams. Public safety The statement went on to say that the G7 and guest countries would “promote respect for internationally accepted norms that drive inclusivity and protect digital civic-space, including through capacity building, and ensure that the design and application of new technologies reflect our shared values, respect human rights and international law, promote diversity and embed principles of public safety”. Government sources said that “politically motivated Internet shutdowns” clarified that national security and public order concerns are an exception to the need for Internet freedoms. According to the sources, during his visit to London in early May, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar fielded questions about the government’s actions against protesters and the clampdown in Jammu and Kashmir after August 5, 2019. The sources said Mr. Jaishankar “made it clear” that law and order concerns were important and public safety had to be prioritised when regulating the flow of information. He also fielded questions about the Internet shutdown for months in Jammuand Kashmir, as well as during the Republic Day protests by farmers in Delhi this year. Mr. Jaishankar attended the meetings virtually as he was under quarantine in London. The G7 Foreign Ministers-level statement issued earlier in May, however, also referred to “Internet shutdowns” as a subject that the organisation would counter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/g7-accommodates-indian-stand-on-need-for-internet-curbs/article34817323.ece
15 June 2021||KOCHI,||Hospitals in Ernakulam to reopen facilities for non-COVID patients||Hospitals in Ernakulam district, both in government and private sectors, will gradually open up to more non-COVID patients in the next few weeks. In the past three weeks, the number of hospitalised COVID patients has fallen from 3,081 on May 23 to 1,581 on June 14. During the same time-frame, the number of ICU admissions fell from 542 to 348. The Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kalamassery, which had suspended all non-COVID services at the end of April, is likely to restart non-COVID departments by June 25, according to a release issued by the district administration last week. Since non-COVID treatment facilities are limited in the district, the MCH will be opened up on priority when cases fall further, said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. It is likely to begin with outpatient departments first, and services will gradually be extended. Some ICU beds will be retained at the hospital for COVID patients. Since a new treatment centre with oxygen beds has started functioning at the Samudrika Hall on Willingdon Island, efforts are on to reduce COVID admissions at the Fort Kochi Taluk Hospital and return to regular non-COVID treatment facilities at the hospital. Beds at community health centres are being equipped with oxygen supply for emergencies and for people who arrive with post-COVID issues, Dr. Mathews said. The bulk of resources in government and private sectors has been geared towards managing the COVID caseload in the district for nearly two months now. The Ernakulam General Hospital, which is handling both COVID and non-COVID cases, has seen an increasing number of non-COVID patients recently, a doctor at the hospital said. The hospital has a 100-bed COVID facility in a separate super-specialty block. Elective procedures Non-COVID in-patient treatments at private hospitals continue to remain low, since people seem to be afraid to return for elective procedures, said Dr. T.V. Ravi, president, IMA Kochi chapter. Emergency non-COVID surgeries are still on, and hospitals are still retaining 50% of their beds for COVID treatment, he said. Dr. Joseph Benaven, secretary, Kerala Private Hospitals’ Association, agreed that while COVID cases were on the decline, the non-COVID patient load had simultaneously been low. But facilities are freeing up, and some hospitals are in a comfortable position to gradually open up for elective procedures now, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hospitals-in-ernakulam-to-reopen-facilities-for-non-covid-patients/article34817541.ece
15 June 2021||MANGALURU,||Red alert in coastal districts||The government has issued a red alert in the three coastal districts till June 16 and has advised Deputy Commissioners concerned to take all precautionary measures to face any eventuality due to heavy rain. According to the alert, heavy (more than 64.5 mm) to very heavy rainfall (115.6 mm to 204.4 mm) is likely to lash Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada districts. The forecast is valid till 8.30 a.m. on June 16. Extremely heavy rainfall (above 204.5 mm) is likely over isolated places during this period. Meanwhile, heavy rain accompanied by gusty winds lashed the coastal districts on Monday claiming a life. There were reports of tree fall in several places. Reports reaching here said that Madhava Acharya (55), who was cutting down branches of a tree that had fallen on his house at Ulepady Purusharakatte near Kinnigoli, was electrocuted when he came in contact with a live electricity wire. The tree along with an electricity pole had fallen on his house and he was trying to clear them. A tree fell at Sediyapu near Puttur on Puttur-Uppinangady Road in the forenoon disrupting traffic movement for some time. It was cleared later. A large tree was uprooted and fell on Someshwara Main Road near the Adka Railway Crossing on the outskirts of the city. As a result, seven electricity poles also fell in the area disrupting power supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/red-alert-in-coastal-districts/article34817424.ece
15 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||State to revise lockdown strategy||Kerala will change the lockdown strategy after June 16, when the current phase of restrictions end, so that rather than a total lockdown across the State, restrictions at various levels may be imposed regionally, depending on the intensity of disease transmission in that locality. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Monday that while there was a reduction in test positivity rate (TPR) across the State by 10% and in new cases by 20% in the past one week, disaggregated data would show a totally different picture at the local body level. In 14 local bodies, the TPR was above 35%, in 37 local bodies it was between 28-35%, while in 127 local bodies, the TPR was between 21-28%. Hence, decentralised COVID containment strategies would be devised, depending on the level of disease transmission in each local body. The government was also thinking about launching a new campaign to create awareness on the importance of isolating oneself to prevent disease transmission. Mr. Vijayan said, according to public health experts, the highly transmissible Delta virus variant was likely to remain in circulation in the State for a long time. Herd immunity for COVID-19 may not be a reality at all or even if it were so, the process could take years. Caution urged This variant had been found to create breakthrough infections in those who were vaccinated too. Hence, unless people remained vigilant and maintained the COVID protocol, disease transmission could again go up, resulting in a third wave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-to-revise-lockdown-strategy/article34817502.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. report flags ‘lapses’ in Nagaland bat study||More than a year after a probe into a filovirus study of bats in Nagaland by the Bengaluru-based National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), the government has concluded that there had been “concerning lapses” in the conduct and protocols followed for the study, even as an inter-department row continues over where the bat samples should be stored.  The Hindu had first reported in February 2020 on the enquiry being initiated into whether adequate permissions had been sought for the study that had listed two scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology as “co-authors”, and was partially funded by the U.S. Department of Defense through its Defence Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). In 2020, a committee convened by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which consisted of officials from the Ministries of External Affairs, Defence, Home Affairs, Health, Environment, Law, Departments of Science & Technology, Development of the North Eastern Region, and others met to “to streamline processes and avoid such lapses in the future,” a report by the Ministry of Health said. Both the foreign-funding of the study, which cost an estimated Rs. 1.9 crore, as well as concerns over the storage of the bat samples collected came up for scrutiny. No Wuhan link The findings of the report became significant given the debate over the origins of COVID-19 worldwide, and handling of bat samples at the Wuhan Institute laboratory. However, scientific experts and officials that The Hindu spoke to made it clear that the Nagaland bat study on filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) was in no way related to the coronavirus (SARS) studies at Wuhan. When contacted, NCBS Director Satyajit Mayor said he had no knowledge of the Health Ministry’s report’s conclusions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-report-flags-lapses-in-nagaland-bat-study/article34817325.ece
15 June 2021||New Delhi,||LJP implodes with 5 of 6 MPs edging out Chirag||Less than a year after the death of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) founder Ram Vilas Paswan, his party is on the verge of a split, with five of its six Lok Sabha members replacing party president Chirag Paswan with his uncle, Pashupati Nath Paras, as the leader of the parliamentary party. The revolt coincides with a widely expected Union Cabinet reshuffle. For months, Mr. Paswan had pinned hopes of filling the vacancy that arose on the death of his father. The rebellion clearly shows that Mr. Paras, too, nurses the same hope. Mr. Paras has been supported by Mr. Paswan’s cousin Prince Raj (Samastipur MP), Mehboob Ali Kaiser (Khagaria), Veena Devi (Vaishali) and Chandan Singh (Nawada). All five MPs met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Sunday evening, and submitted a memorandum electing Mr. Paras as their parliamentary party leader. Fails to meet uncle Mr. Paswan is said to have learnt of the revolt late on Sunday. On Monday morning, he rushed to meet his uncle. He was stopped at the gate for nearly 25 minutes and when he finally managed to enter his uncle’s residence, he was told that Mr. Paras was not at home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ljp-implodes-with-5-of-6-mps-edging-out-chirag/article34817327.ece
15 June 2021||Bengaluru,||Partial unlock: With no public transport, commuters struggle||As the city began limping back to normality after the State government partially lifted the lockdown in most parts of Karnataka from Monday, commuters had a difficult time getting to places without the availability of public transport. According to the orders of the government, only autorickshaws and taxis are allowed to operate. The Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is operating around 320 buses for those who carrying out essential services and chartered services. At Majestic on Monday, migrant workers and others were seen waiting for buses, but only those who had valid ID cards were allowed to board the essential services buses. Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. is also not operating Namma Metro train services, as per government orders. Citizens have questioned the government’s decision. Arun Prasad, a resident of Wilson Garden, said, “On Monday, I wanted to travel from Wilson Garden to Kandaya Bhavan and stopped a BMTC bus. The conductor told me that only those doing essential services were allowed to board and asked me to show an ID card. I did not have one as I am not a government official and do not do any essential service work. But I showed him documents to prove I had work. Neither I nor a courier delivery person was allowed in.” He said it was unfortunate that only autorickshaws and taxis were allowed to ply, while city buses, used most by commuters, especially the poor, were not given the green signal.  With the relaxations, traffic made a big comeback. Traffic jams were seen at major junctions as the traffic police struggled to handle the situation. Hundreds of vehicles coming from the neighbouring districts were seen stuck in long queues at the entry and exit points of the city. Traffic jams were reported at Freedom Park, Seshadripuram, Malleswaram, Town Hall, Richmond Road, Kempe Gowda Road, and in and around Majestic. As many as 154 vehicles, including 139 bikes, were seized for violating the rules and 12 cases were booked under the Disaster Management Act against shops and commercial establishments. The government has allowed people to purchase essential commodities between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. People thronged K.R. Market and Avenue Road to buy groceries. “It was very difficult to manage the situation after 2 p.m. as hundreds of vehicles were still plying on the road and the commuters were giving excuses,” a police officer said. Street vendors are optimistic the increased business hours would help them find more customers. Giridhara, a street vendor in Yelahanka, said, “People like us suffered a lot during the lockdown. We earn on a daily basis to meet the household expenses. We are hoping the extended hours will help us find more customers.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/partial-unlock-with-no-public-transport-commuters-struggle/article34817358.ece
15 June 2021||AHMEDABAD,||‘AAP will contest all seats in Gujarat poll’||Delhi Chief Minister and convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said his party will contest all seats in the Gujarat Assembly election next year. Mr. Kejriwal said AAP would provide a “real alternative” to the people of Gujarat while visiting a temple in Ahmedabad. He inducted popular TV anchor Isudan Gadhavi into the party. “AAP will contest each and every seat in the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections. AAP is a credible alternative to the BJP and the Congress. Gujarat will change soon,” he said. “In the past one year during the pandemic, Gujarat has been treated like an orphan. Today, the youth are unemployed, farmers are committing suicide and children are struggling to get admission in schools and colleges. Even businessmen and traders are scared,” he said at the Vallabh Sadan temple. The AAP leader slammed both the ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress for the ‘plight’ of the State and said the two parties were playing a fixed match to trick the voters. “Gujarat is suffering because of the friendly alliance between them. The BJP has been in power in the State for the last 27 years. I heard people saying that the Congress is in the pocket of the BJP. Both parties are the same here as whenever the BJP is in trouble, the Congress provides help.” ‘Credible alternative’ He said AAP would prove to be a real and credible alternative to the ruling BJP in Gujarat as its performance in Delhi is a testimony. “The people of Gujarat want to know why the electricity costs are so high here when it’s free in Delhi. If government-run schools and hospitals are top-class in Delhi, why are they non-functional in Gujarat? The time has come to change Gujarat.” Mr. Kejriwal had last visited Surat in February when his party emerged as the main Opposition after the civic body elections. AAP had made inroads into Gujarat politics by winning 27 seats in the 120-member Surat Municipal Corporation. The party has been working across the State, preparing for the Assembly polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/aap-will-contest-all-seats-in-gujarat-poll/article34817760.ece
15 June 2021||NAGERCOIL,||Mandaikadu Bhagavathi Amman Temple fire accident due to human error: Minister||The fire that broke out in Sri Bhagavathi Amman Temple in Mandaikadu on June 2 was due to human error and not a sabotage, Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments P.K. Sekar Babu said on Monday. Mr. Sekar Babu inspected the renovation of the damaged roof of the 400-year-old temple and the ‘prasannam’ being done in the temple to ascertain remedial measures to be taken as per ‘ahama’ rules. Later, he told journalists that he had formed a committee, headed by the Kanniyakumari Collector, to probe the fire accident. The interim report submitted by the panel after questioning eight persons revealed human error as the reason behind the fire accident and no sabotage was established. Steps had been taken to avert such incidents by installing modern firefighting equipment in the shrine. People, who had failed to prevent the fire accident, would be taken to task after the panel submitted its final report. The HR and CE Department had allotted Rs. 85 lakh – Rs. 50 lakh for renovating the roof and Rs. 35 lakh for installing firefighting equipment and carrying out renovation work in the inner precinct. “If more funds are needed to carry out the renovation work, we will ensure availability of funds to the satisfaction of the devotees and as per the ‘prasannam’ being conducted on Monday and Tuesday,” Mr. Babu said. The Minister said vacant posts of Joint Commissioners, HR and CE, would be filled up with right people to ensure the best possible maintenance of temples. He also informed that all 30 temple elephants in Tamil Nadu would undergo proper medical examination at regular intervals and a committee, led by the Joint Commissioner, would be formed in every district to take care of the animals. Minister for Information Technology T. Mano Thangaraj, MLAs J.G. Prince and M.R. Gandhi, Commissioner of HR&CE J. Kumaragurubaran, Collector M. Aravind and Superintendent of Police V.

15 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||HC reinstates Ashok Gajapathi Raju as the chairman of MANSAS Trust||The High Court of Andhra Pradesh on Monday struck down G.O. Ms. Nos 72 and 74, through which Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju was appointed as the hereditary trustee/chairperson of Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimhaswamy Vari Devasthanam at Simhachalam and the MANSAS (Maharaja Alak Narayan Society of Arts & Science) Trust respectively last year, and ordered that P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju be reinstated as chairman of both the trusts. Mr. Ashok said in his petitions that the established practice in the Simhachalam Devasthanam had been for the “eldest male lineal descendant” of the Pusapati Gajapathi family of the princely State of Vizianagaram to be the hereditary trustee and it was in vogue for more than three centuries and continued even after the temple came under the purview of the Madras Endowment Act of 1951 and subsequently Acts 17 of 1966 and 30 of 1987 of Andhra Pradesh. He asserted that Ms. Sanchaita had no legal claim to be claimed as a “founder family member” as per Sec.17 of Act 30, 1987 leave alone being appointed as the hereditary trustee when members of the family belonging to the previous generation were there. Mr. Ashok said in his petition that the government’s jurisdiction on the MANSAS Trust was very limited as it was a public charitable trust and its functioning was guided by the trust deed executed by the settlor. He also cited certain provisions of the Hindu Succession Act and various judgments as lending credence to his arguments. Welcomed Addressing a media conference inVizianagaram, Mr. Ashok asked the State government to respect Indian Constitution, existing Acts, rules and regulations of the Trusts. He welcomed the Andhra Pradesh High Court’s directive over removal of Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju as chairperson of MANSAS Trust and Simhachalam Temple Trust Board. Mr. Ashok said an irreversible damage was done to the temples and educational institutions in the last 14 months. “The court’s verdict in favour of us proved that there is respect for Indian Constitution and existing laws,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ashok-gajapathi-raju-gets-back-simhachalam-temple-post/article34817254.ece

15 June 2021||KANNUR,||Vessel operations from Azhikkal by June-end||Ahamed Devarkovil, Minister for Ports, said here on Monday that any move to shift to Mangaluru port the transport of goods to Lakshadweep from Kerala would be resisted and a mass agitation would be organised. Speaking to the media after reviewing the work of the Azhikkal port on Monday, he said that the people of Lakshadweep had always maintained very close relations with Kannur and Kozhikode. All the goods to Lakshadweep were transported from Beypore and Kochi ports. For education and health needs, they were dependent on the State. But in the wake of new political developments in the island, the issue was discussed in the Assembly. Both the government and the Opposition had decided to stand with the people of Lakshadweep. “Any effort to shift the transport of goods from Kerala to Mangaluru will be strongly resisted by organising a mass agitation,” he said.  Port infrastructure Earlier, he said the infrastructure in all ports in the State would be developed. “We have already discussed the issue with five companies. They are ready to start the operations in Azhikkal and Beypore ports. There is an effort to bring cargo ships to Azhikkal port by the end of this month,” he said. Mr. Devarkovil said there were a few practical problems in Azhikkal port. In order to address them, a meeting had been held with officials concerned and other stakeholders. By this month-end, vessels would start operating from the Azhikkal port, he said. Mr. Devarkovil said that discussions had been started with the panchayat authorities in Azhikkal to establish a sand purification plant. Though sand collection was done at various points, only Ponnani had a sand purification plant at present, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vessel-operations-from-azhikkal-by-june-end/article34817542.ece
15 June 2021||KALABURAGI,||Police resort to lathi-charge as seeds shortage causes overcrowding of farmers in Ballari||Farmers who arrived in Ballari on Monday for purchasing chilli seeds for sowing were lathi-charged and dispersed. As per information available, hundreds of farmers thronged the city for purchasing chilli seeds produced by Syngenta and the scarcity of the seeds caused overcrowding. A video clip of police personnel dispersing a mob went viral later in the day. It was learnt that trouble began after the distributor who was assigned to sell seeds declared closure for the day though a large number of farmers were still standing in queue to purchase seeds. However, the district authorities denied that the police resorted to any lathi-charge. “There was no lathi-charge, as there was no need for it. The police simply raised their lathis to disperse the mob when the situation started going out of control,” Deputy Director of Horticulture S.P. Bhogi told mediapersons. The farmers, however, said that the State government has failed to ensure adequate supply of chilli seeds in Ballari and condemned the police for beating them up. Ballari is one of the districts that is facing a severe shortage of chilli seeds for sowing. There have been several complaints of chilli seeds being hoarded to create artificial shortage and to sell them at inflated rates in the black market. Taking the complaints seriously, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa had, in a recent review meeting in Ballari, directed the vigilance squad to conduct raids on illegal hoarders and ensure proper supply of seeds. To address the chilli seeds shortage, the Horticulture Department has arranged for the sale of Syngenta 5531 variety at its office and a distributor has been asked to sell 100 grams to each farmer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-resort-to-lathi-charge-as-seeds-shortage-causes-overcrowding-of-farmers-in-ballari/article34817422.ece

15 June 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan govt. to set up Vedic Education Board||The Congress government in Rajasthan will set up a Vedic Education and Sanskar Board to revive the knowledge of ancient Sanskrit scriptures and connect the learnings of the Vedas with science and yoga. The board is likely to be set up in the coming four to five months. Minister of State for Sanskrit Education Subhash Garg said here on Monday that a committee appointed to define the aims, objectives and functioning of the board had submitted its report to the State government. Based on the panel’s recommendations, the board will adopt education modules revolving around Vedic knowledge. The ruling Congress had promised the establishment of the Vedic Education and Sanskar Board as well as steps to promote Sanskrit language and education in its manifesto for the 2018 State Assembly election. CM’s announcement Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had announced in January this year that the work for setting up the board would be expedited to encourage the students to carry out research on the Vedas and enable them to assimilate the country’s “glorious traditions”. He had pointed out that Ayurveda and Sanskrit universities had also been established in the State during the tenure of the Congress government earlier. The committee has reportedly studied several models of Vedic teaching being followed in other States and recommended a curriculum for schools, which would include subjects such as science, mathematics, Sanskrit, yoga and meditation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rajasthan-govt-to-set-up-vedic-education-board/article34817761.ece
15 June 2021||Bengaluru,||Rs. 1 lakh relief for each affected BPL family||The State government on Monday announced a compensation of Rs. 1 lakh each to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families that have lost adult members to COVID-19. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa told reporters that the government was aware that many families have been going through trying times following the death of earning members. “In light of many such cases coming to the notice of the government, we have decided to compensate the families that have lost an adult member to the pandemic. Each family is eligible for Rs.1 lakh,” he said. Claiming that Karnataka would be the first State to offer such a compensation, he said it would cost the exchequer between Rs. 250 crore and Rs. 300 crore while bringing relief to about 30,000 people. When the Chief Minister was asked about the financial status of the State, he said the fact that the government had announced a compensation of Rs. 1 lakh to each family showed that the State’s finances were better now. The government had earlier announced packages for unorganised workers, farmers, and other sections hit by the lockdown.  On Monday, government also announced a relief of Rs. 5,000 each to about 384 registered tourist guides across the State who have been hit hard by the pandemic and the suspension of tourism activities. The announcement came from Tourism Minister C.P. Yogeshwar, who said that discussions were on to provide Rs. 3,000 COVID-19 relief to those employed in hotels. Stakeholders in the tourism industry, who met the Minister, urged the government to waive property tax, allow payment of excise licence fee in two instalments, and rebate in power tariff. The industry has also sought the lifting of restrictions on hotels and allowing them to function by June 21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-1-lakh-relief-for-each-bpl-family-hit-by-covid-19/article34817355.ece

15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Retail inflation soars to 6.3%, a 6-month high||Rising fuel and edible oil costs sent India’s wholesale prices inflation soaring to a record 12.94% in May, up from 10.5% in April, and nudged retail inflation to a six-month high of 6.3%, going past the central bank’s tolerance threshold of 6%. Consumers experienced an inflation of 11.58% for the ‘fuel and light’ category in May, with urban India bearing a bigger hit of 14.24% on the same account. Food inflation reheated to 5.1% from just 1.96% in April. Rating agency ICRA reckoned that core inflation (without factoring in food and fuel prices) also hit an 83-month high of 6.6%. Overall retail prices saw a sharper spurt in rural areas from 3.75% in April to 6.5% in May, while it was less pronounced in urban India at little over 6% from 4.7% in April. At the wholesale level, fuel and power inflation nearly quadrupled to 37.6% from the 9.75% recorded in March this year, and is significantly higher than the 20.94% mark attained in April. Manufactured products’ inflation rose to 10.83% from 9% in April. The ‘high rate of inflation is primarily due to low base effect and rise in prices of crude petroleum, mineral oils, and manufactured products’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/retail-inflation-soars-to-63-a-6-month-high/article34817328.ece

The protest, which was called by the all-party Save Lakshadweep Forum, was to demand the immediate recall of Mr. Patel and the “withdrawal of the unwieldy reforms being pushed by the Union Territory administration under his stewardship”. Hundreds of islanders and those in the mainland put up posters and protest pictures on various social media platforms to express their dismay at the “anti-people policies” that were announced by the administration. Muneer Manikfan, village (dweep) panchayat vice-chairperson at Minicoy, said in a video message that the protest was conducted to force the Union government to revoke the “unilateral, draconian, anti-people and anti-environment” draft legislation and orders that were issued by Mr. Patel. In view of the protests, the police took out a route march along the streets of Kavaratti, the capital, on Sunday night, which the islanders termed as an “intimidation tactic”. Skips Kochi Lok Sabha members Hibi Eden and T.N. Prathapan were planning to meet Mr. Patel, who was slated to land at the Cochin International Airport on Monday morning while in transit, to register their protest against his policies. But Mr. Patel skipped Kochi and took a special aircraft to the Agatti air strip in Lakshadweep. Resignations continue The spate of resignations from the BJP’s Lakshadweep unit continued on Monday, with Ibrahim Thithige, Saukath Kanbiloge and Mohammed Kaleelugothi, president, secretary and treasurer of the party’s Minicoy unit, quitting after finding it “futile to continue due to the unfortunate current circumstances on Minicoy island and Lakshadweep”. Meanwhile, the administration extended the lockdown till June 21, on Kavaratti, Kiltan, Bitra and Minicoy islands. Night curfew Shops and establishments selling essential commodities will be allowed to function between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. with permission from the designated officers.

15 June 2021||New Delhi,||Trying to rescue LJP: Pashupati Paras||Just hours after five of the six MPs of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla over replacing party president Chirag Paswan with his uncle, Pashupati Nath Paras, as the Leader of the Parliamentary Party, Mr. Paras said he had no complaints against his nephew. Speaking to mediapersons on Monday morning, Mr. Paras said he was only trying to rescue the party. In the same breath, he also praised Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, calling him ‘ vikas purush ’ , in a clear indication that the party would not follow Mr. Paswan’s line against the JD(U) chief. Mr. Paras, who earlier served as a Minister in Mr. Kumar’s Cabinet, made it clear that the six MPs would not join the JD (U). The rebel MPs had an hour-long meeting with another JD(U) leader Lallan Singh at party MP Veena Singh’s residence. What is particularly damaging for Mr. Paswan is that among the rebel MPs is his cousin, Prince Raj, who is said to be very close to him and whom he had anointed as the Bihar unit chief, replacing Mr. Paras. Mr. Raj is the son of LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan’s younger brother Ramchandra Paswan, who died in 2019. Ram Vilas Paswan never recovered from the shock of his brother’s death and in some way that accelerated the deterioration of his own health, leading to his death a year later. The Sunday evening events are the culmination of a nearly seven-month long discontent in the party against Mr. Paswan for his particularly twisted political stand. He launched a campaign targeting the JD(U) and Mr. Kumar without severing ties with the NDA. He continued to sing paeans about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The LJP won one Assembly seat, managed to garner nearly 6% of the vote share and cost the JD (U) nearly 35 to 40 seats. Within the party forum, many leaders, including Mr. Paras and Mehboob Ali Kaiser, had criticised Mr. Paswan. Mr. Paras had also made a public statement praising Mr. Kumar, but had to retract it under pressure from his nephew. Mr. Paras and other rebelling MPs have also accused Saurav Pandey, another close aide of Mr. Paswan, of excessive interference and arrogance. ‘Fallout of State poll’ Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Kaiser, observed, “The Sunday events are a fallout of the Bihar elections. We advised him not to go against Nitish Kumar. A leader has to listen to people, but Chirag was impervious to any of our suggestions.” The rebel group did not hold any grudge against Mr. Paswan, who should relent to work under Mr. Paras. “He can work a couple of years under Mr. Paras till he learns the ropes and is amenable to listening to sound advice,” Mr. Kaiser added. Mr. Paswan’s aides claimed that the entire rebellion was orchestrated by the JD(U). Recently at a virtual meeting of the NDA constituents, Mr. Paswan, had excused himself, citing ill-health. Sources said he was asked to do so by the BJP after the JD(U) made it clear that they would not tolerate his presence. The LJP rebellion is likely to strengthen the JD(U)’s parliamentary position. Out of the 40 MPs from the State, the JD(U) has 16 and the BJP 17. For now, Mr. Paswan has maintained a studied silence. “As of today, Chirag Paswan is the president of LJP,” Abdul Khaliq, secretary general of the LJP said. Mr. Paras too has not staked claim to control the party outside of Parliament. Mr. Paswan is hoping that he can placate the rebels by leaving the president’s post to his mother, Reena Paswan, though that would only bring in a temporary truce.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trying-to-rescue-ljp-pashupati-paras/article34817277.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indian labs widen net for a mutant form of Delta variant||An emerging form of the Delta variant that allows the coronavirus to “escape” antibodies, in recently approved treatment regimes, is appearing on the radar of Indian scientists. Five Indian labs have submitted data on this modified variant in May and June to GISAID, a global repository of coronavirus variants. Public Health England (PHE), a United Kingdom body, has also stated that of the 63 genomes in its repository as of June 7, six were from India. This does not, however, mean that only six instances of this form of the virus exist in India. Evidence of the mutant have been found in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka. Called AY1 or B.1.617.2.1, it is a variant of Delta (B.1.617.2), but with a mutation called K417N, which has previously been identified in the Beta variant — first identified in South Africa. This is an international Variant of Concern (VOC), marked by being highly infectious and significantly able to reduce the potency of vaccines. “It has all the mutations that make the Delta variant, along with an additional concerning one with the South African variant,” said Shahid Jameel, former adviser to the Indian SARS-CoV2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG). “It is indeed a matter of concern, and we should be sequencing more to identify how widely prevalent it is in India.” The Delta variant is now regarded as the most prevalent variant in India, comprising nearly 31% of the 21,000 community samples processed until late May. The ICMR-National Institute of Virology and the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, have conducted laboratory tests to determine the potency of Covishield and Covaxin against the new variant. While antibodies continued to be produced against the variant, they were fewer than against the strain used by the vaccine companies to prepare their vaccines. However, antibody levels are not the only markers of immunity. An additional concern with the K417N mutation, according to a database of the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), was that it was associated with resistance to a newly developed monoclonal antibody treatment drug, Casirivimab and Imdevimab, for treating those with moderate and severe disease, but at high risk. Marketed by Roche and Cipla in India, the drug was recently approved by India’s Central Drug Standards and Control Organisation. The price for each patient dose, a combined dose of 1200 mg (600 mg of Casirivimab and 600 mg of Imdevimab), will be Rs. 59,750 inclusive of all taxes, a statement said. Anurag Agrawal, Director, CSIR-IGIB, New Delhi, however, said as of now, the AYI was “just something to keep track of”. A report from PHE on June 11 said that of the 36 identified cases of the AY1 in the U.K., 27 occurred in those who had taken at least one dose of vaccine. There were no deaths reported so far among the 36 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indian-labs-widen-net-for-a-mutant-form-of-delta-variant/article34817289.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Choksi’s legal team releases videos||A U.K.-based law firm looking after the case of fugitive diamond trader Mehul Choksi on Monday released images and videos purportedly showing individuals, including Indian-origin men, involved in an elaborate operation to take Mr. Choksi from Antigua to Dominica on May 23. Justice Abroad, the law firm, has claimed that Mr. Choksi was kidnapped with the help of a woman acquaintance and men who gagged and tied him to a wheelchair and used at least one unmarked boat to transport him from Antigua to Dominica. Michael Polak of Justice Abroad said the intention behind the entire episode was to “whisk away” Mr. Choksi to India by shortening the legal process. “The evidence in this case shows that Mr. Choksi was kidnapped from Antigua, where he had outstanding cases before the Courts, and unlawfully renditioned to Dominica. We believe that the aim was for him to be whisked away to India, bypassing the proper legal processes in Antigua and Dominica,” said Mr. Polak in a statement. In documents and photographs seen by The Hindu , the legal team fighting the case in Dominica shows a few men who appeared to be of Indian origin on the deck of a boat that was allegedly used to transport Mr. Choksi from Antigua. Two videos shared by the legal team show an unnamed boat allegedly carrying Mr. Choksi. The boat was not carrying a flag at the time of its movement from Antigua’s Jolly Harbour North Finger to a rendezvous with another boat, which eventually took the fugitive diamond trader to Dominica. Mr. Choksi’s legal team claimed that he came to the beachfront villa in Antigua of his recent acquaintance Barbara Jarabik on May 23 and was soon overpowered by a group of men who “rushed out and beat him”. He was “gagged and tied to a wheelchair” at knifepoint and placed on the unmarked boat. This boat placed him on the Calliope of Arne , which took him to Dominica.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/choksis-legal-team-releases-videos/article34817294.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘May 28 order has no link with CAA’||The Union Home Ministry maintained in the Supreme Court on Monday that its May 28 order delegating power to Collectors in 13 districts across five States to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh has “no relation whatsoever” with the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019. The 2019 Act, better known as ‘CAA’, is under challenge before the Supreme Court. The law is accused of “fast-tracking” citizenship for non-Muslim persecuted minorities — Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian — from the three neighbours. The CAA is blamed of illegally granting citizenship on the basis of religion. Petitions in the Supreme Court have drawn parallels between the CAA and the May 28 notification, which facilitates non-Muslims from the three countries residing in 13 districts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Punjab to apply for citizenship. The Indian Union Muslim League, represented by advocate Haris Beeran, said the May 28 order was a deliberate ploy to implement the CAA’s “malafide designs”. The Ministry countered that the May order “merely delegates the power of [granting citizenship by registration and naturalisation] to the local authorities in particular cases”. “The Central government used its authority under Section 16 of the Citizenship Act… It is merely a process of decentralisation of decision-making aimed at speedy disposal of the citizenship applications of such foreigners… It has no relation whatsoever to the CAA,” the MHA affidavit said. But Mr. Beeran expressed his doubts, saying “if it has no relation to CAA, where does the May 28 notification draw authority from to specify the same communities for the same three countries for facilitating the citizenship process”. The government reasoned that the notification did not “provide for any relaxations to the foreigners and applies only to foreigners who have entered the country legally”. The applicants should possess valid documents like passports and Indian visa. “Any foreigner of any faith can apply for citizenship of India at any time,” the MHA affidavit said. The government, however, said the May 28 notification was only one among numerous such orders passed in the past to meet “administrative exigencies”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/may-28-order-has-no-link-with-caa/article34817267.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘China, India, Pak. expanding nuclear arsenal’||China is in the middle of a significant modernisation and expansion of its nuclear weapon inventory, and India and Pakistan also appear to be expanding their nuclear arsenals, according to Swedish think tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Year Book 2021 released on Monday. “The overall number of warheads in global military stockpiles now appears to be increasing, a worrisome sign that the declining trend that has characterised global nuclear arsenals since the end of the Cold War has stalled,” said Hans M. Kristensen, associate senior fellow with SIPRI’s Nuclear Disarmament, Arms Control and Non-proliferation Programme. According to the year book, India possessed an estimated 156 nuclear warheads at the start of 2021, compared with 150 at the start of last year, while Pakistan had 165 warheads, up from 160 in 2020. China’s nuclear arsenal consisted of 350 warheads, up from 320 at the start of 2020. The nine nuclear armed states — the U.S., Russia, the U.K., France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea — together possessed an estimated 13,080 nuclear weapons at the start of 2021. Russia and the U.S. together possessed over 90% of global nuclear weapons, SIPRI said. IISS report A report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), London, in May titled ‘Nuclear Deterrence and Stability in South Asia: Perceptions and Realities’ said that chance played an important ameliorative role in the India-Pakistan crisis of February 2019 and the two countries “risk stumbling into using their nuclear weapons through miscalculation or misinterpretation in a future crisis.” “India and Pakistan are seeking new technologies and capabilities that dangerously undermine each other’s defence under the nuclear threshold,” said the report. It said China’s evolving profile as a nuclear-weapons state was compounding India’s security challenges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-india-pak-expanding-nuclear-arsenal/article34817278.ece

15 June 2021||Kochi,||Vatican rejects nun’s plea on dismissal||The Superior General of the Fransiscan Clarist Congregation Sister Ann Joseph has conveyed to Sister Lucy Kalappura, formerly a member of the congregation, that the Vatican had rejected the latter’s appeal against her dismissal from the religious order. A letter from the headquarters of the Fransiscan Clarist Congregation near Aluva on June 12 from the Superior General said the appeal by Sr. Lucy against her dismissal was rejected by Apostolica Signatura and that the dismissal had been confirmed. The letter described Sr. Lucy’s issue as a ‘heart breaking’ one and said: “The almighty God untied the knot of our heart-breaking issue concerning Lucy Kalappura.” The letter went on to say: “Let us raise our hearts praising the Almighty for His unspeakable gift!” as it also thanked everyone for “whole hearted prayer, support.” Reasons for dismissal The Clarist congregation, a Catholic religious order based near Kochi, had cited several reasons for dismissing Sr. Lucy from the order in 2019. The reasons included her failure to explain adequately her violating the rules of the religious order and her not wearing her religious habit. She was also accused of obtaining a driver’s licence without permission from the superiors, of buying a car, and publishing a book of poetry. Protest against bishop Sr. Lucy shot into the limelight with her participation in a protest in Kochi in 2018 September in which priests, nuns, and religious personnel from the Catholic Church joined hands with reform-minded Church members and voluntary groups to demand the arrest of Bishop Franco Mulakkal of Jalandhar, who was accused of raping a Catholic nun. The protest was withdrawn after the bishop was arrested. Sr. Lucy was expelled from the congregation in August 2019 but the Mananthavady munsiff court had given her a reprieve in December of the same year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vatican-rejects-nuns-plea-on-dismissal/article34817256.ece

15 June 2021||New Delhi,||Probe Ayodhya land deal: Congress||The Congress on Monday sought a Supreme Court-monitored probe into allegations of irregularity in the purchase of land at Ayodhya by the Ram temple trust. Addressing a virtual press conference, Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala called the land purchase a “big scam” that used funds collected from devotees and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to answer whether those behind the land deals had his protection. “The Chief Justice and the Supreme Court must take cognisance of the matter and order a court-monitored probe into the charges,” Mr. Surjewala said. The top court should also get an audit done for all the donations and funds received and spent by the trust for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, he said. Since the trust was set up on the directions of the Supreme Court, the court should also carry out a probe on the assessment value of all land purchased by the trust from donations and make it public in the traditions of idealism of Lord Ram, Mr. Surjewala said. He, however, clarified that the construction work on the proposed Ram temple was going on in full swing and the Congress did not want the work to be stopped. “Shri Ram himself is justice, truth and religion/righteousness. Cheating in his name is unrighteousness,” tweeted former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi in Hindi with the hash tag #RamMandir scam. ‘Inflated price’ Mr. Surjewala alleged that the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust had purchased “12,080 square metres of land” at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh at an inflated price of Rs. 18.5 crore. On March 18, he claimed, the said land was purchased by the temple’s trust at Rs. 18.5 crore from Ravi Tiwari and Sultan Ansari but records of land deeds showed that the same plot was sold to them by Kusum Pathak for Rs. 2 crore. And that too on the same day barely five minutes before the transaction with the temple trust took place. The Congress spokesperson claimed that trust members and BJP leader Anil Mishra, and Hrishikesh Upadhyay, a former Mayor of Ayodhya, were signatories to the Rs. 18.5-crore land deal as per the land deeds. He asserted that the facts pointed to a “big scam” in funds collected from devotees and this amounted to committing a big sin “Will the Prime Minister answer if those sinners, who have traded the faith of Lord Ram’s devotees, have his protection,” he asked. “How could BJP leaders commit such a big malpractice in the name of Lord Ram whose words, values and ethical conduct are sworn as ideals. How much more land has been purchased in such a manner at throwaway rates out of funds received for the temple’s construction,” asked Mr. Surjewala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/probe-ayodhya-land-deal-congress/article34817280.ece

15 June 2021||HYDERABAD,||3rd wave of viral diseases often of less intensity: DME||Intensity of third wave of viral diseases are less since many people achieve immunity and take vaccines if available, said Telangana’s Director of Medical Education (DME) K Ramesh Reddy. Citing experience with other diseases, he said cases and severity of diseases would be less due to the two factors. The senior official also said that the second wave is usually severe than the first wave as herd immunity is not achieved. Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Dr Reddy and Director of Public Health G Srinivasa Rao spoke about the preparations for the third wave, number of people the State government aims to vaccinate by June-end, importance of maintaining precautions against COVID to avoid third wave, and other topics. The DME said the second wave of COVID got contained in three months, and estimated that it will come under further control within a week. Signs of the second wave were observed in the State from second week of March, hit its peak in April fourth week to May first week. The cases started to decline thereafter. Speaking about the third wave, the senior official said people can avert it by taking precautions against the infectious disease, and that it is not in the hands of the government or the Health department. He said more than the possibility of the third wave, preparations to manage it is the priority before the State government. “In 15 days, 100% of beds will have oxygen supply. Works related to oxygen generators are in advance stage,” Dr Reddy said. Since the possibility of more cases among children is widely discussed, the officials have placed orders for medicines, equipment such as ventilators, since procuring it when the demand is high will be difficult. It was estimated that the State government will be in full preparedness in another 15 days. Dr Srinivasa said that lockdown will be lifted some day and urged people to take precautions even after the restrictions are lifted. Youngsters who step out of home were requested to take precautions so that they will not contract and spread the virus among family members.  In 15 days, 100% of beds will have oxygen supply. Works related to oxygen generators are in advance stage.

15 June 2021||LUCKNOW,||Land bought in ‘transparent’ deal, says Ram Temple Trust||A day after it faced allegations of financial corruption worth several crores in the purchase of a piece of land in Ayodhya, the Trust set up to build the Ram Mandir said it had carried out the deal with great alacrity and transparency. Champat Rai, general secretary of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, said the 1.2-hectare land in Bagh Bijesi was purchased through full “transparency”. Issuing a clarification over the allegations, Mr. Rai said the current sellers of the land had executed contracts in their favour in 2011, 2017 and 2019. Since the plot was “found useful” by the Trust, the persons concerned were contacted, Mr. Rai said. The final due amount was fixed at Rs. 1,423 per square feet, which was much less than the market value of nearby land, he said. “After an agreement was reached over the rate, the persons concerned were required to complete their previous contracts, only then the land could be acquired by the Trust,” he said. As soon as the deed of land was completed in favour of them, the Trust with “great alacrity and transparency” signed the agreement and got it registered, Mr. Rai said in a detailed statement. He also said the land was purchased with the consent of major temples like Kaushalya Sadan. Mr. Rai added that from Day 1, the trust had been in favour of making all payments directly into the accounts through banks and the same was followed in this case too. He accused the parties who raised questions over the deals of creating a situation of “fear in society”. A day earlier, he had called the allegations politically motivated. Holding a separate press conferences on Sunday, former SP MLA from Ayodhya Pawan Pandey and AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh had alleged that the land, valued at Rs. 5.8 crore was purchased and registered by two local businessmen for Rs. 2 crore on March 18 at around 7:10 p.m. but within 10 minutes of the transaction, the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra purchased the land for an appreciated rate of Rs. 18.5 crore. The two leaders further alleged that both the land agreements, which took place just minutes apart, had common witnesses — Ayodhya Mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay and Trust member Anil Mishra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/land-bought-in-transparent-deal-says-ram-temple-trust/article34817270.ece
15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Journalist killed in U.P. ‘road accident’||A journalist in Pratapgarh district of Uttar Pradesh, who had written to the police on Saturday fearing a threat to his life from the liquor mafia, died in an alleged road accident on Sunday, the police said. Sulabh Srivastava, 42, worked as the district correspondent for news channel ABP News.  Additional Superintendent of Police (East) Surendra P. Dwivedi said Srivastava was returning to Pratapgarh from Lalganj between 10 p.m and 11 p.m. on Sunday after reporting on an incident when the accident took place near a brick kiln at the Katra crossing. Labourers working at the kiln found him lying injured on the road. He was taken to hospital where he was declared brought dead. The officer said prima facie it was found that he was travelling alone and the death happened after he hit a pole and a tubewell on the side of the road. The police, however, were “probing all other angles deeply”, he added. Application to ADG In an application submitted to Prayagraj ADGP Prem Prakash through WhatsApp, Srivastava had sought police protection, fearing a threat to his life from the liquor mafia which, he said, was unhappy with his coverage of the recent unearthing of illegal liquor factories and police raids in the district. “Last two days, whenever I went out of my house for some work, I felt I was being followed. Based on sources and public discussion, I feel that some liquor mafia who are unhappy over my news, can cause harm to me and my family,” he wrote.  Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav condemned the incident and demanded a high-level probe.  The Editors Guild of India said it was “shocked by the cavalier manner” in which the police were treating the “mysterious death” of the journalist. “The authorities paid no heed to his fears,” it said. The death comes at a time when the media is facing increasing pressures from the Central and State governments, who insist that they follow the official narrative regarding the administration’s handling of the pandemic, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/journalist-killed-in-up-road-accident/article34817272.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘SC misled about law and order in Bengal’||The Mamata Banerjee government on Monday named BJP members, while maintaining in the Supreme Court that “concocted stories” on social media spread the narrative of State complicity in the “post poll violence”. “It is untenable to categorise each and every act of violence following the declaration of elections results as ‘post poll violence’ while adopting a premise that such violence is ongoing in West Bengal to which the State machinery is turning a blind eye,” the State government said in its affidavit. The 425-page counter-affidavit detailed complaints and petitions concerning the post poll violence. It named the vice-president of the BJP’s South Kolkata unit and a member of the BJP legal cell. It said false allegations of “State complicity” were drawn on the basis of hearsay reports disseminated on social media by miscreants. The State said the apex court was misled about the law and order situation. The petitions “reek of political motivation”. The petitions have asked the court to form a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and to order immediate relief to internally displaced persons affected by the violence. “No person can be forced to stay away from his/her house, as it is their inherent right to live in their houses peacefully,” the State said. It said the petitions in the Supreme Court conveyed a “misleading narrative” while a five-judge Bench of the Calcutta High Court was already hearing a gamut of issues arising from the “alleged post poll violence”. The High Court had been passing effective orders in the case, the State noted. Three counter-affidavits were filed in the High Courts on the FIRs registered and arrests made.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-misled-about-law-and-order-in-bengal/article34817295.ece
15 June 2021||MYSURU,||Choultry construction: Panel gives clean chit to S.R. Mahesh||Former Minister and Janata Dal (S) MLA S.R. Mahesh has been given a clean chit by a panel of officials probing the charges of encroachment of rajakaluve or storm water drain by the choultry belonging to him at Dattagalli here. Regional Commissioner G.C. Prakash had last week constituted a panel of officials headed by Additional Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru Manjunathaswamy to conduct a survey and submit a report to him after former Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru Rohini Sindhuri alleged that the choultry was encroaching upon a rajakaluve. The report, copies of which were released by Mr Mahesh at a press conference on Monday, stated that the choultry had neither been built on the rajakaluve nor had encroached upon any of the portion of the rajakaluve. When it was measured, the choultry was found to have been constructed at a distance of 74, 72, and 73 metres away from the rajakaluve, the report said. Mr. Mahesh claimed he had parted with 6,000 sq feet of land for the construction of the Outer Ring Road near the choultry and had not claimed any compensation from the government for it. The report giving a clean chit to the former Minister had been forwarded to the Regional Commissioner by the Deputy Commissioner and a copy of the same had been made available to Mr. Mahesh. The JD(S) legislator asked whether Ms. Sindhuri tried to “take revenge” against him by accusing him of land encroachment for complaining to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa against the alleged negligence towards her duty and construction of a swimming pool in the Deputy Commissioner’s residence in alleged violation of heritage laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/choultry-construction-panel-gives-clean-chit-to-sr-mahesh/article34817365.ece
15 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala varsities in a fix over final-year exams||With the higher education prospects of a large number of students at stake, universities in the State are in a quandary over the conduct of final-year examinations. While some universities have chalked out tentative schedules to commence examinations in the offline mode on June 28, a final decision rests on various factors, including the COVID-19 case graph and the full-scale resumption of Kerala State Road Transport Corporation bus services. Higher Education Minister R. Bindu will convene a meeting of Vice Chancellors on Wednesday to assess the situation. The government is keeping a close watch on the unfolding pandemic situation to take a call on the examinations.  The universities, which had earlier planned to conduct examinations from Tuesday (June 15), were tasked with evolving alternative plans considering the vagaries of the pandemic. Barring A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University, no other university had endorsed the proposal to conduct online examinations. According to sources, their reluctance was due to the lack of preparedness for holding examinations in the online mode. While large sections of the student community have been able to access online classes through smartphones, only around 15% of students in government and aided arts and science colleges are estimated to own laptops, a study conducted last year had found. Prospect of malpractice “Students are likely to find it difficult to take online examinations on their smartphones, let alone finding scanning devices to upload their answer sheets. Moreover, online examinations cannot be used to gauge a student’s knowledge, considering the possibility for rampant malpractice,” an official said. Persisting with offline examinations is also fraught with various challenges. While universities are expected to identify examination centres outside their jurisdictions, the situation could lead to a clash of dates among universities. The situation could prompt universities to prepare staggered schedules. Each university would require at least 12 days to complete their examinations, considering that many courses at the undergraduate level has six subjects in the final year. Other options Other proposals, including setting multiple-choice questions and holding viva voce through videoconferencing, are also being actively considered. Nonetheless, the government hopes to publish the results of the final-year examinations by mid-August to enable students to pursue further studies. Many universities, including Central universities, are soon expected to commence admission for postgraduate courses.  Higher Education Minister R. Bindu will convene a meeting of Vice Chancellors on Wednesday to assess the situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-varsities-in-a-fix-over-final-year-exams/article34817504.ece
15 June 2021||Kochi,||For Onam, marigolds from a floating raft||A small fraction of the millions of marigold flowers used during the annual Onam season to make floral carpets and decorate homes will come from a floating raft farming experiment undertaken by an enterprising young farmer in the Vembanad backwaters in Alappuzha’s Thanneermukkom panchayat. Sujit Swami Nikarthil, who has been into farming for over a decade, said he had put up marigold plants on about 400 sq.ft. of floating raft set up on bamboo frames and held together by coir geotextile with a bed of degraded water hyacinth. He said the flowers from the one-cent raft would be harvested for the Onam season. Floating raft agriculture, with water hyacinth forming the bed, has been experimented with extensively. It was found, over the last five years, that amaranthus flourishes on the floating raft beds, said K.G. Padmakumar, veteran agricultural scientist and director, International Research and Training Centre for Below Sea Level Farming, Kuttanad. Floating raft farming had been taken up as a measure of improving adaptability and resilience in the background of climate change, said Dr. Padmakumar. He said experiments in the Alappuzha-Cherthala Canal near Kalavoor with amaranthus had been a great success. Another experiment had been taken up at Kanjippadom. These showed that crops like vegetable cowpea, chillies and tomatoes too were suited for the farming method. The crops should be of short duration so that they can be harvested in about 45 to 60 days, by which time the water hyacinth bed degrades completely. Mr. Swami said he had been preparing to plant sunflowers on another bed but had postponed the plans because of the rains and heavy winds that could affect the relatively tall sunflower plants. Dr. Padmakumar said floating raft agriculture with cage fish farming could be remunerative for people. The activities could be taken up even on part-time basis to generate additional income, he added. The Thanneermukkom panchayat has extended support to Mr. Swami. Vice president of the panchayat Praveen G. Panicker said the local body looked upon the novel idea as a means to get rid of water hyacinth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/for-onam-marigolds-from-a-floating-raft/article34817250.ece
15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Kerala to revise lockdown strategy||The Chief Minister said that people need not be too anxious about a third wave of COVID. He said while the State was preparing ahead to meet any health emergency that might arise out of a third wave, it should be remembered that a third wave of COVID cannot happen by itself.  A third wave could be a reality only if people let down their guard and relaxed on the COVID protocol. It was the collective responsibility of the State to ensure that another wave of COVID and another lockdown did not happen.  Mr. Vijayan said, henceforth, COVID death reporting would be a decentralised process as per the ICMR protocol, with treating physicians given the responsibility of declaring the cause of death as COVID or not. The reports would be compiled and released at the district level. As for the retrospective reporting of COVID deaths, he said the Health Department had been directed to clear the backlog of undeclared deaths by June 15, when the State would migrate to a new online, real-time COVID death reporting system. The Government has issued orders, approving the setting up of a web-based application for reporting the deaths due to or associated with COVID-19 in a decentralised manner at the district-level. From June 16, all deaths due to or associated with COVID-19 in the State will be entered within 24 hours of the death, in an online portal and all information transfer will be done electronically by hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-to-revise-lockdown-strategy/article34817503.ece

15 June 2021||KALPETTA,||Sr. Lucy terms Vatican order ‘mysterious’||Sister Lucy Kalappura, who was expelled from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation of the Syro-Malabar diocese, Mananthavady, has said that the rejection of her appeal by the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolica Signatura is mysterious. “I had submitted my third appeal to the Apostolica Signatura though an advocate in Vatican in March 2020 and contacted him many times. He said that trial procedure was yet to start at the tribunal because of the COVID-19 spread,” Sr. Lucy told The Hindu . “As per the letter from the Vatican, my appeal was produced before the Signatura in May 2020,” Sister Lucy said, adding that usually the tribunal would not take such a hasty decision, especially during a pandemic outbreak. “Hence, it is suspected that the letter from the Vatican is a fabricated one,” she said. Moreover, the postal stamp on the letter seemed to have been tampered with, she added. Sr. Lucy said the congregation seemed determined to oust her by any means. “The Superior General of the congregation asked me in a recent letter to leave the nunnery in a week on the basis of the letter from the Vatican. But I will not leave,” she said. Sr. Lucy had earlier petitioned the munsiff court at Mananthavady to stay the decision of the congregation. The court had granted temporary injunction to the expulsion till January 1, 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sr-lucy-terms-vatican-order-mysterious/article34817255.ece
15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Govt. report flags ‘lapses’ in Nagaland bat study||“We are not aware of lapses,” said Mr. Mayor, in written replies to The Hindu . “The [bat] samples we have collected are invaluable to research and understanding zoonotic pathogens,” he added, directing all further enquiries on the clearances and bat samples to the Ministry of Health. However, both the Ministry of Health report dated February 2021, as well as a series of communications between the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the Department of Atomic Energy, which oversaw the NCBS study in October-November 2020, referred to the issues. The Hindu has seen copies of these documents. “The research publication raised serious concerns as the samples were collected from humans and bats with intent to test for viral pathogens and resulting antibodies of highly infectious pathogens (risk group 4 viruses). The study didn’t have the requisite approval of ICMR. Moreover, the facility at NCBS was not equipped in terms of biosafety and biosecurity to undertake such testing,” states the Health Ministry report. “The inquiry committee (including Health Ministry and ICMR officials) visited NCBS, Bangalore as well as Nagaland to understand the work done, methodology followed, and places visited during the course of the study,” said the report, adding that they found “concerning lapses in the study protocols and procedures”. “All the lapses were discussed and appropriate actions were suggested,” it added. Safe storage issues Meanwhile, differences over the storage of the Nagaland bat samples between the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), and the Ministry of Health continue. The Health Ministry wants the samples of nucleic acid extract stored at the Bio Safety Level -4 (BSL-4) standard facility at the National Institute of Virology laboratory in Pune, rather than NCBS’s Bengaluru facilities, that are rated BSL-3 at present. While the DAE contends that the samples were “non-infectious” and had been checked for the presence of filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg), the Health Ministry contends that such samples must be handled in a laboratory equipped for “biosafety and biosecurity conditions” as otherwise they can pose a “significant public health hazard”. “The issue of bio-security comes under the Department of Biotechnology, and the ICMR has no business raising any concerns on a study done by the NCBS, which is an institution under the Department of Atomic Energy,” said noted virologist Gagandeep Kang. When asked, however, an official said that a 1987 Health Ministry order had designated ICMR Director General and the Health Secretary as the Chairpersons on the committee clearing all research involving foreign funding and foreign collaboration. According to the citation in the study, named “Filovirus-reactive antibodies in humans and bats in Northeast India imply zoonotic spillover”, that was published in 2019, the research was funded by U.S. Dept of Defense, U.S. Naval Biological Defense Research Directorate, and Indian Department of Atomic Energy, and credits researchers at Duke-NUS Singapore, U.S. Uniformed Services University as well as Shi Zhengli and Xinglou Yang from the Wuhan Institute for “writing- review and editing” the paper.(https://journals.plos.org/ plosntds/ article?id=10.1371/ journal.pntd.0007733)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-report-flags-lapses-in-nagaland-bat-study/article34817259.ece
15 June 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. must practise what it preaches, says Cong.||A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed freedom of thought and democracy in his virtual address to the G7 nations, Congress leaders on Monday took a dig at the government. Senior leader and former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, in a series of tweets, said, “PM Modi’s speech at the G7 Outreach meeting is inspiring as well as ironic. The Modi government should practise in India what it preaches to the world.”  On Sunday, Mr. Modi said India was a natural ally of the G7 countries in defending democracy, freedom of thought and liberty from a host of threats stemming from authoritarianism, terrorism, violent extremism and economic coercion. Former Union Law and Information Technology Minister Kapil Sibal tweeted: “G – 7. India signs off on joint statement: Reaffirms the values of ..... “freedom of expression ,both online and offline…” Sign statements abroad. Violate them at home. Freedoms devalued: Internet shutdowns, sedition targeting: journalists, students, academics etc.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-must-practise-what-it-preaches-says-cong/article34817273.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre lists food schemes for migrants labourers||The Centre on Monday informed the Supreme Court that the States and the Union Territories have purchased nearly 3.7 lakh tonnes of foodgrains at concessional rates from the Food Corporation of India this year to supply to migrants without ration cards and others outside the protective cover of the National Food Security Act (NFSA), debunking apprehensions raised in court that those without ration cards may be left to die amid a devastating pandemic. The Supreme Court had asked the Centre to explain “how food will reach migrant labourers without ration cards”. The Centre has placed on record details of its schemes to feed migrants, the poor and the badly affected in the public health crisis. Besides the purchase of grains by the States and the UTs under the Open Market Sales Scheme (OMSS) in 2021-22, the Centre said, NGOs and charitable organisations had purchased 421 tonnes of food commodities. “NGOs run kitchens for supply of cooked food to non-card migrants,” the Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor-General Aishwarya Bhati, said in written submissions in the court. However, the responsibility to distribute foodgrains lies with the States, it noted. “Union of India is committed to making sufficient foodgrains available to the States at highly subsidised prices under the above schemes, to tide over the difficulty of food security during the current crisis. However, the responsibility of identification and distribution to the beneficiaries lies with the States/UTs,” it submitted. The Centre also said it had written twice to the States/UTs — on May 20 and May 25 — advising them to “avail their requirements of foodgrains under the schemes and to provide foodgrains to those not covered under the National Food Security Act”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-lists-food-schemes-for-migrants-labourers/article34817297.ece

15 June 2021||Hyderabad,||35 lakh due for second shot of vaccine next month||Around 35 lakh people in Telangana are due for their second dose of COVID-19 vaccine in July. The first dose for others will be planned according to availability of vaccines, said Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao. Currently, only the second dose is being administered at Government COVID Vaccination Centres (GCVCs), and people above 18 years who come under high-risk groups category are administered the first dose by the State government. Others aged above 18 years and belonging to non-high-risk groups are relying on private CVCs for the first dose. Until June 13, a total of 64.69 lakh persons in the State had received their first dose and 15.10 lakh their second dose. Around 13.58 lakh persons belong to high-risk groups. According to the ‘Revised Guidelines for implementation of National COVID Vaccination Program’, the government of India will procure 75% of the vaccines being produced by the manufacturers in the country. The vaccines procured will continue to be provided free of cost to States and Union Territories. The guidelines also state that vaccine doses provided free of cost by government of India will be allocated to States or UTs based on criteria such as population, disease burden and the progress of vaccination. Currently, the positivity rate in Telangana is hovering around 1.40%. Asked if the allocation of doses will be low given the positivity rate, Dr Srinivasa Rao said no government informs any State that more vaccines will be allocated if positivity rate or cases are more. He said that the doses are allocated based on population and number of targeted beneficiaries. The senior official said that formulas for the allocation are dynamic to the situation. Earlier formula was based on high number of cases, but the cases are on decline in other States too. “We will receive first and second doses based on our population. There are around 1.75 crore people in the 18-44 age group, and 93 lakh people are above 45 years,” Dr Srinivasa Rao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/35-lakh-due-for-second-shot-of-vaccine-next-month/article34817364.ece

Justice Suresh Kumar Kait noted that “continued detention of respondent No.2 (Mr. Singh) in this FIR case is necessary not only to unearth the conspiracy hatched by him, but also to derive out/ trace the siphoned money which he has credited for his personal benefit”. The court said the “nature and gravity” of accusation against Mr. Singh was serious. “The grant of bail in a case involving cheating, criminal breach of interest by an agent of such a large magnitude of money, affecting a very large number of people would also have an adverse impact not only on the progress of the case but also on the trust of the criminal justice system that people repose,” it said. On the argument of Mr. Singh that other co-accused have been granted bail in this case, the court observed, “while granting or refusing bail, the role attributed to each accused has to be seen independently and reasoning for one may not be binding on the other”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-hc-quashes-bail-to-former-fortis-chief/article34817262.ece
15 June 2021||Mumbai,||BJP politicised Sushant’s death, say Congress, NCP||With investigating agencies making little headway in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case a year after the actor was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for pressurising the Central probe teams for political gains. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had taken over the probe from the Bihar police, which registered a case of abetment to suicide on a complaint from the Patna-based father of Sushant. A medical board formed by the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) to look into the case had “ruled out murder”. The NCP said the CBI probe into the case was politically motivated. “If Sushant Singh Rajput was murdered, who is his killer? The case was handed over to the CBI for political reasons and after a year, there has been no response from the investigating agency about whether the case has been solved,” said party leader and Minister Nawab Malik. He said the BJP politicised the death with an eye on the Bihar Assembly election, which was held in 2020, and hatched a conspiracy to defame the Maharashtra government. Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said it had been 310 days since the CBI started investigation and 250 days since the AIIMS panel ruled out murder. “When will the CBI declare final conclusion? Why the CBI has kept lid on it? The CBI is under immense pressure from its political bosses,” he said. Antilia case Mr. Sawant used the opportunity to slam the National Investigation Agency (NIA) over the Antilia bomb scare case. “Similarly after the Antilia plot was hatched by officers, including Sachin Vaze, who are all from the then Mumbai CP office, why is the NIA not able to nab the mastermind? Is protection being offered as part of some deal? Why is Param Bir Singh not being interrogated? Why the NIA asks for more time in court and does nothing?” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-politicised-sushants-death-say-congress-ncp/article34817264.ece

The civic body is working out Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to organise mass vaccination camps, and has identified venues for administering the jabs. A senior official said in the coming months, once the vaccine supply becomes regular, mass vaccination camps at fixed spots would be launched, wherein persons eligible for vaccination could walk-in for registration and get the jabs administered. A list of 45 to 50 venues, comprising of schools and community halls all over the city, have been finalised, and their location will be mapped and posted on the website. The civic official, sharing the finer details of the mass vaccination camp proposal to The Hindu, said each camp would have a minimum of five counters where all eligible persons from the age of 18 years could walk in, get registered, take a token and receive the vaccine. The list of venues would be put up on the online portal along with the number of vaccines in stock for one to two days. He said, “The civic body is planning to maintain a regular supply of both Covaxin and Covishield in each venue.” The proposal to move out the vaccination drive from UPHCs is mainly to safeguard the patients, particularly pregnant women, visiting these centres, and also to help residents easily identify venues by making the locations familiar to them. The civic official said the vaccines were currently administered to those above 45 years of age and those between 18 and 44 years, which includes food delivery executives, newspaper agents, courier delivery executives and transport workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-identifies-venues-for-local-mass-vaccination-camps/article34817411.ece

15 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil film industry appeals for a rollback of hike in TDS||The Tamil Nadu Film Active Producers Association appealed to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday to reduce the Tax Deduction At Sources (TDS) for cinematograph films from new rate of 10% to the previous rate of 2% citing the toll the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown has taken on the film industry. In his letter to the Finance Minister Ms. Sitharaman, T.G. Thiagarajan, Chairman, CII - Media & Entertainment (South) and treasurer, TFAPA, said that the revival of the industry from January 2021 after the lockdown imposed in 2020 until October was stopped as a second lockdown was imposed in April 2021 by State Governments across the country. “The sudden imposition of 10% Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) under section 194-J (Fees for professional or technical service) on professional royalty where such royalty is in the nature of consideration for sale, distribution or exhibition of cinematographic films has come a big shock to the entire industry,” he said. He estimated that at least Rs. 1,000 crore of investment has been locked in over 120 films in Tamil film industry alone. ‘Growing debt’ “The Producers are unable to pay the interest due on these investments to lenders and banks and many are going through very difficult times and severe losses,” he said. Mr. Thiagarajan cited a joint report by FICCI and global consultancy firm EY released on March 27, 2021, which said that the ‘film entertainment segment’ has declined by 40% to Rs. 7,200 crore in 2020 from Rs. 11,900 crore for 2019, a steep fall for the industry. “In 2021, it may decline further by another 25% and touch a level of around Rs. 5,000 crore turnover, which means, the industry would have declined by 60% in the last two years. Any drastic change like TDS at 10% shall lead to closure of the film industry, especially through theatrical business, which will impact lakhs of people associated with the film industry,” he said.  In 2021, it may decline further by another 25% and touch Rs. 5,000 cr. turnover||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-film-industry-appeals-for-a-rollback-of-hike-in-tds/article34817748.ece
15 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Krishna water likely to reach State border by tomorrow||The declining storage in the city’s reservoirs may soon get a boost. Krishna water is on its way to provide a much-needed fillip to the city’s major waterbodies. On Monday, Krishna water was released into the 152 km-long Kandaleru Poondi (KP) Canal that brings water to the State’s entry point at Uthukottai, in Tiruvallur district. About 500 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of water was discharged from the Kandaleru reservoir in Andhra Pradesh around 9.30 a.m. Officials of the Water Resources Department noted that Krishna water was likely to reach the State border of the KP Canal by June 16. It would have to travel another 25 km to reach the Poondi reservoir, where it would be stored and distributed to the city. “We expect the quantity of the water discharge to be increased steadily to enable a minimum of 500 cusecs to be realised at KP Canal’s entry point into the State. Andhra Pradesh authorities have assured that they would continue the supply for the next spell that will begin in July. The Kandaleru reservoir has a sufficient storage of 43,000 million cubic feet (mcft),” an official said. The department had recently requested the Andhra Pradesh government to resume discharge of Krishna water to step up the fast-depleting storage in the city’s reservoirs, particularly Poondi reservoir. On Monday, the combined storage of the five reservoirs was nearly 57% of their capacity of 11,757 mcft. It may be recalled that the city was provided with 8,158 mcft of Krishna water in 2020-21. “Water flowing into the Poondi reservoir till this month-end will be accounted for this water year. This will be one of the highest amounts of Krishna water received in recent years,” the official added. The department would also halt renovation of the vulnerable stretches of the KP Canal to facilitate the flow of water. At present, the city and merged areas are being supplied with nearly 845 million litres a day. With Metrowater mulling over a further increase in drinking water supply to cater to more merged areas, Krishna water is expected to help fulfil the growing demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/krishna-water-likely-to-reach-state-border-by-tomorrow/article34817412.ece
15 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Post-COVID complications aplenty, say doctors||As in the first wave of COVID-19, hospitals are seeing a steady flow of patients with post-COVID-19 complications. While the number of patients with complications is much higher, considering the exponential rise in cases in the second wave, many of them are returning to hospitals with psychological symptoms, lung-related complications, and stroke and cardiac arrest due to blood clots. The complications are aplenty, according to a number of doctors at government and private hospitals. While mucormycosis is one of the main complications seen by doctors, there are many other worrying trends. At the post-COVID clinic of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, doctors are receiving 30-40 patients a day, Dean E. Theranirajan said. “There are many with psychological issues. We see patients with insomnia, new onset diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, lung fibrosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, brain fog and depression. Some show symptoms of memory loss and poor concentration. There are patients mainly with neuro and cardiac complications.” There are a lot of patients with breathing issues, complications such as clot formations and generalised myalgia for an extended period, said Koushik Muthu Raja, associate professor and consultant, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Hospital. “We are finding pulmonary embolism in patients. Lung damage is persisting in patients who had moderate to severe COVID-19. Some continue to require oxygen support. We start active pulmonary rehabilitation at the hospital itself. This is basically a holistic approach in which a complete evaluation is done and patients are put on a battery of exercises, including those to train muscles and increase the expanding capacity of lungs, nutritional assessment, and relaxation techniques. We are slowly seeing an increase in the number of such patients,” he said. N. Sridhar, consultant intensivist and head of Critical Care, Kauvery Hospital, Chennai, said the hospital had patients returning with sudden pain and breathlessness, and CT scans found pneumothorax, collection of air between the chest wall and lungs. “We are seeing an increased tendency of developing blood clots and stroke in some young patients in the post-COVID period. Some have nerve weakness, and we are seeing an increased number of heart attacks. Patients also experience diarrhoea,” he said. Usually, the complications set in after two to four weeks of the onset of illness. Patients are being asked to come for periodic reviews for at least a month, said Aishwarya Vinoth, consultant, interventional pulmonologist, Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre. “We take CT scans of patients experiencing breathlessness. In such cases, we have found patients having gross pneumonic changes involving many areas of the lungs. This is taking a longer period to heal,” she noted. In this wave, many have been oxygen-dependent for long. Such patients are given lung exercises and advised weekly follow-ups. “Along with physical and mental rehabilitation, post-COVID-19 clinics are running pulmonary rehabilitation,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/post-covid-complications-aplenty-say-doctors/article34817739.ece
15 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Villivakkam tank will open for residents in two months||The rejuvenated Villivakkam tank, greenery, amusement facility and walkway in 25 acres of land will open for residents in two months. With the decline in the number of COVID-19 cases in the city, the Greater Chennai Corporation has resumed work on the rejuvenation of the tank. It is expected to get additional amusement facilities to attract children under private-public partnership. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi inspected the facility on Monday and directed officials to ensure free access for walkers in the 25 acre area even after handing over the facility to private operators with experience in maintenance of amusement parks. The entry fee for the amusement facilities for children is yet to be decided, officials said. Over 1 km of walkway has been developed in the residential area, which will be open for all. The project is expected to reduce inundation in areas such as SIDCO Nagar in Villivakkam. The area had severe water stagnation during the previous monsoon. After the increase in water storage capacity of the tank, the water from CMWSSB treatment plant will be stored in the tank. The tank has been desilted to 5 m, increasing the storage capacity. Work on amusement facilities are expected to be taken up shortly. Decision on allowing boating facility has not been taken, officials said. Water quality in the tank will be monitored under the Smart City Mission Project. The Corporation will increase greenery in the area after construction of a wall. The increase in the number of birds in the rejuvenated area will also be monitored by the civic body. Mr. Bedi also inspected drains to reduce water stagnation in Ambattur and Korattur. Construction of a drain has been completed on a stretch covering 1.2 km. Officials have started cleaning stagnant water in private lands in the area following instructions from the Corporation Commissioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/villivakkam-tank-will-open-for-residents-in-two-months/article34817417.ece
15 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Admissions to Class XI begin||Admissions to Class XI began in compliance with COVID-19 precautions at several government and government-aided schools across Tamil Nadu on Monday. Students, accompanied by their parents, visited the schools to get the admission forms for the 2021-22 academic year. With the Class X examinations cancelled, all students were promoted and the government earlier this month issued guidelines for them to seek admission. Minister for School Education Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi visited the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Ashok Nagar. “In 27 districts where some restrictions have been eased, admission has begun. In 11 other districts where all restrictions are still in place, we have instructed the Chief Educational Officers to wait for some more time before asking schools to begin admissions,” he said. He said a decision on the reopening of schools would be taken after assessing the situation following the relaxation of some curbs. “It will not be feasible to reopen schools and immediately call all students to the campus. There are safety concerns that need to be discussed before a decision is taken,” he said. “The School Education Department only has Kalvi TV now as the medium to reach a large number of students for classes. Connectivity issues prevail at many places but as far as possible, teachers are trying to reach out to students through WhatsApp,” he added. In Chennai, parents and students visited several government schools from 9 a.m. to collect the forms. “We had very strict physical distancing norms in place and did not allow many parents to stay on the campus beyond a time limit. Parents and students were told they could submit the forms either today [Monday] or later,” said the headmistress of a school. G. Shanmugavel, headmaster, Government Higher Secondary School, MGR Nagar, said, “Some students from smaller private schools have come looking for admission here. While a majority of our students have chosen to continue in our school, there are some students whose families have returned to their home towns because of the pandemic, and these students will join the government schools there,” he said. Schools are also expecting admission enquiries for Classes I, VI and IX. The School Education Department has textbooks ready for distribution to schools this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/admissions-to-class-xi-begin/article34817733.ece
15 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Madras HC to consider ban on keeping elephants in captivity||The Madras High Court on Monday said it would consider whether there should be a complete prohibition on elephants being kept as captive animals for various temple duties or as beasts of burden in the State. The court pointed out that it had already called for the response of the State government on the issue, and the matter would be decided after eliciting the reply. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said that in the interregnum, the State authorities should immediately look into the wellbeing of all captive elephants and file a report to the Animal Husbandry Secretary for initiating appropriate action, wherever necessary. The observations were made while disposing of a public interest litigation petition for feeding stray animals. During the hearing of the case, primarily focused on feeding stray dogs and cats during the lockdown, the judges insisted upon ensuring that even horses and captive elephants do not go hungry. A committee, comprising animal lovers, was constituted to collect money for feeding the animals and come up with suggestions on their long-term welfare. Representing the committee, advocate A. Yogeshwaran said that Governor Banwarilal Purohit had contributed Rs. 10 lakh [from his discretionary grant] for feeding the stray animals and that the State government too allotted Rs. 9.2 lakh from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. The committee also received donations to the tune of Rs. 60,962 from the general public. He said 2,500 kg of dog feed and 200 kg of cat feed was purchased for Rs. 2.2 lakh and distributed to various community feeders. Similarly, horse feed for Rs. 95,680 was also procured to feed the animals that were used for joy rides on the beaches in the city but could not be fed well by their owners because of the lockdown. The feed was provided to 104 horse owners in the city, he added. On the status of captive elephants, the lawyer said that absolutely no information was available though they all come under the control of the Forest Department. He recalled that a Government Order was issued in 2016 for constituting district-level captive elephant welfare committees, and that those committees could be asked to submit a report. Not wanting to do that in the present petition, the judges disposed of the case with an observation that they had already called for the State government’s response on the issue, and the matter would be decided while hearing that case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madras-hc-to-consider-ban-on-keeping-elephants-in-captivity/article34817736.ece

15 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fix uniform MRP for Aavin milk: dealers||Milk dealers have urged Aavin to fix uniform maximum retail prices (MRP) for milk sold across the State. In a statement, the Tamil Nadu Milk Dealers and Employees Welfare Association said the MRP of Aavin milk varied in the districts according to what was fixed by the respective cooperative unions. S.A. Ponnusamy, president of the Association, said this caused problems for dealers and retailers when new customers came in. “Private brands have uniform rates. Aavin, too, should follow this system if it wants to compete in the market,” he said. The difference in prices lead to a difference in commission to dealers. “The distribution channels also vary from place to place. This leads to a dealer getting between 1% and 5% commission. This should be made uniform so that the benefit can be passed on to the customers,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fix-uniform-mrp-for-aavin-milk-dealers/article34817414.ece

Tasmac shops will function by complying with the regulations.” The Chief Minister said the spread of COVID-19 was under control to some extent and warned that the restrictions would be brought back if the norms were violated. People should act accordingly, even without the police monitoring them, he said. “You [people] must conduct yourselves in such a way that enables us to put an end to the complete lockdown. Public transport has to operate soon. Schools and colleges have to be reopened. People’s cooperation is necessary for this,” he said. “I am only saying that the spread of COVID-19 is under control and not that we have put an end to it. People have to be extremely careful,” he said. Citing certain restrictions imposed in some districts, Mr. Stalin reiterated his appeal to the people to cooperate with the government to check the spread of the novel coronavirus that is causing COVID-19. As for traders’ requests to reopen shops, he said, “More than granting relaxation, public compliance with the guidelines to justify the easing is important.” Physical distancing norms should be followed and crowding at tea shops avoided, he said.

Among the charges were the uploading of nearly 4,000 negative samples as positive. Director of Public Health T.S. Selvavinayagam confirmed that the laboratory’s permission was restored as “issues were rectified”. In a release, Medall Diagnostics said the inspection team visited the premises and found the testing process satisfactory. It found the cause to be a clerical error and the ICMR database was updated with the corrected data. Medall has added a layer of supervision to avoid such errors while feeding test data into ICMR servers. Arjun Ananth, chief executive officer, Medall, said he was relieved to see the laboratory’s “testing process rigour and sanctity validated and there being nothing to prove the alleged nexus between Medall and any hospital”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/suspension-of-laboratorys-test-licence-revoked/article34817740.ece

15 June 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Forest Department to radio collar Baahubali||The Forest Department has decided to radio collar a wild elephant nicknamed ‘Baahubali’, which makes regular presence in forests and human habitations around Mettupalayam in Coimbatore district during the migration for several years. According to the Forest Department, the Chief Wildlife Warden has issued orders to radio collar the tusker, codenamed as ‘MP20T1’, for study purpose. A team has been formed to monitor the elephant round-the-clock to find when it comes to a suitable terrain where it could be darted and radio collared, said D. Venkatesh, District Forest Officer, Coimbatore Forest Division. According to the Department, radio collaring would help in studying the tempo-spatial patterns of the elephant - where the animal travels in the habitat, how far it comes out of the habitat, how far it raids agricultural fields and how far it migrates in a year. The data generated from the GPS-enabled collar will also help the Department in preparing the route of the elephant during migration, identifying obstacles in migratory path and understanding its behaviour during the musth period. The Department expects to prepare a complete route map of the elephant by monitoring it for a couple of years. Even after fixing the radio collar, which is given by the WWF-India, a dedicated team will monitor its movement, collect data and record them, said Mr. Venkatesh. According to I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Coimbatore Circle), Coimbatore Forest Division gets its elephant population mainly from the Nilgiri elephant reserve comprising Wayanad-Mudumalai Tiger Reserve-Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve-BRT Tiger Reserve and the Nilambur-Coimbatore elephant reserve comprising upper Nilgiris-Silent Valley–Nilambur- Mannarkad-Palakkad divisions. “Population exchange between these two regions takes place though Kallar elephant corridor and also through Gudalur area which connects MTR with Nilambur. MP20T1 is a regular user of Kallar corridor. We need to understand how the corridor is used by different elephants and MP20T1 as such is not a very regular crop raider,” he said. “Worldwide conflict is attributed more as an individual behaviour of the animal. Out of more than 50-plus male elephants which come to Coimbatore Forest Division, only 7 to 10 turned out to be crop raiders. Understanding individual behaviour will help us develop better management response mechanisms,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-department-to-radio-collar-baahubali/article34817754.ece
15 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||More trade, industrial units reopen in Coimbatore dt.||The district witnessed a flurry of activity on Monday following the State Government’s announcement on relaxation in the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Industrial activities resumed in most of the clusters in the district. Several micro and small-scale industries opened shutters on Monday. The orders were good though raw material prices were an area of concern. Industries need flow of funds to meet mandatory expenses such as wages, rent, and taxes. Hence, the units have resumed operations, said one of the small-scale foundry owner here. Automobile workshops, optical showrooms, hardware shops, supermarkets and grocery shops were open. However, physical distancing norm went for a toss at most outlets. All other shops remained shut. Electricians, plumbers, carpenters and self-employed craftsmen returned to work. Permission to open mechanic shops from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. would not provide any relief to the mechanics, said G. Anandan, general secretary, Kovai Mavatta Automatic Technicians Welfare Association. “Unless the spare parts shops reopen, it would be difficult for the mechanics to attend to repair works. The Government must also consider permitting them to open shops till 5 p.m.,” Mr. Anandan said. Vehicle checks Coimbatore City Police continued vehicle checks at 12 check posts along the borders of city limits and 30 checkpoints within the city. Deputy Commissioner of Police T. Jayachandran (Law and Order) said that autorickshaws and taxis were checked to ensure compliance with the new norms.

15 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Industries seek time to pay electricity charges||The industries here have appealed to the State government for relief in payment of electricity charges. The industries were shut on May 10 in view of the State-wide lockdown to control the spread of COVID-19. With the lockdown restrictions continuing in Coimbatore district, the units are unable to operate to full capacity. However, the units will have to pay the electricity consumption charges for April and May before June 15. This is not possible for the micro and cottage industries, said Coimbatore and Tiruppur Districts Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association. The Association president, C. Sivakumar, urged the State government to provide three months time, after the lifting of lockdown restrictions, for the micro units to pay the electricity charges. J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, said that while the State government had given June 15 as the deadline for payment of electricity charges across the State, the lockdown restrictions continued in 11 districts and the micro units had not resumed operations. It would not be possible for the units to pay the charges now.  ‘Implement HC order’ The Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, president C. Balasubramanian said in a press release that High Tension (HT) electricity consumers were badly affected because of the lockdown and closure of factories. The Madras High Court issued its order allowing levy of 20 % of the fixed charges as M D charges. Since last year, when the first wave of COVID-19 disrupted industrial operations, the HT consumers were asking the State government to implement the High Court order. If the order was implemented, the financial burden of the HT consumers would reduce to a considerable extent. Several other States, including Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Gujarat, had waived the MD charges for HT consumers. Tamil Nadu was one of the most important States with a high number of MSMEs. Hence this support was required during this most challenging times, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industries-seek-time-to-pay-electricity-charges/article34817456.ece

The workers and manufacturers had appealed to the district administration to give permission to reopen the units. “The workforce restriction has forced many of us to re-think starting factory operations,” said general secretary of the Indian Fireworks Manufacturers’ Association T. Kannan. Stating that the workers were trained in specific processes in the manufacturing of crackers, Mr. Kannan said with the restrictions on workforce numbers, the whole operation would suffer. “Only those who make one or two varieties of crackers can open and run successfully,” he said. Another leading manufacturer said, “Most of us do not have the working capital to start work, with uncertainty prevailing in the market. Neither have we received any orders nor advance payment from dealers.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-few-fireworks-units-resume-work-in-sivakasi/article34817730.ece

15 June 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Mechanised boats to resume fishing today||As the 61-day annual fishing ban ends on Monday midnight (June 14), mechanised boats in the district are expected to venture into the sea for fishing in the early hours of Tuesday. The annual ban began on April 15 to facilitate augmentation of marine wealth and all mechanised boats on the east coast were berthed in their bases. The much-awaited resumption of fishing will begin on Tuesday. Of the 420 mechanised fishing boats in the district, 130 vessels based at Tharuvaikulam near here are involved in multiday deep sea stay fishing, while all others operating from Thoothukudi fishing harbour and Vembar go for ‘daily fishing’ between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. However, officials have planned to allow ‘daily fishing’ being done by mechanised boats in turns to avoid crowding in the harbour, a base for 240 boats, in the wake of COVID-19 norms in force. In a meeting held at Thoothukudi Fishing Harbour on Monday in the presence of Deputy Superintendent of Police Ganesh and Assistant Directors of Fisheries Vijayaraghavan and Anto Princy Vyla, mechanised boat owners and workers have decided that 120 boats will be allowed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while the remaining 120 mechanised crafts will go for fishing on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. “This arrangement has been done to avoid heavy crowding in the fishing harbour, where physical distancing will be ensured while auctioning of fish. Boat owners, workers, auctioning agents and ice suppliers entering the fishing harbour should wear mask, clean their hands with sanitiser and follow all COVID-19 protocols. Body temperature of everyone entering the harbour will be screened,” said a Department of Fisheries official. “Only wholesale traders will be allowed to buy fish. Small traders and the public will not be allowed to enter the fishing harbour,” he said. The meeting has also decided that all of them should get vaccinated at the earliest. When the first day of vaccination started at the harbour on Monday, 50 persons were innoculated. To ensure scrupulous following of COVID-19 protocol and safety of the fishing harbor, watch towers have been erected on the premises.  Only wholesale traders will be allowed to buy fish and small traders and public will not be allowed to enter fishing harbour Official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mechanised-boats-to-resume-fishing-today/article34817530.ece
15 June 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Widening work on two highways begins||Widening of the Tiruchendur-Palayamkottai and Gopalasamudram-Kallidaikurichi stretch of road on an outlay of Rs. 637 crore began on Monday. Minister for Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Anita R. Radhakrishnan inaugurated the widening of the 72 km-long busy road, maintained by the Department of Highways, at Tiruchendur in the presence of Collector K. Senthil Raj. The work, initiated under Chennai-Kanniyakumari Industrial Corridor, would be completed within two years.  First phase Mr. Radhakrishnan told reporters that the 50-km stretch between Tiruchendur and Palayamkottai would be completed in the first phase on an outlay of Rs. 435 crore and the remaining 22 km-long road between Gopalasamudram and Kallidaikurichi during the second phase at a cost of Rs. 202 crore. The existing 7-metre wide road would be widened to 10 metre with a rail over bridge wherever it was required. The most important feature of the project would be straightening of the road, which had several turnings and sharp curves now, during the widening. The land-losers would be given sufficient compensation. Since the road passed through the ancient cultural site of Athichanallur, bypass would be provided so that the sites to be excavated in future would not get affected. “This project will ensure easy access between Tiruchendur and Papanasam and even Tenkasi to ensure hassle-free access between the holy towns. Since the Indian Space Research Organisation is all set to establish its rocket launch pad at Kulasekaranpattinam, this road will catalyse the industrial growth of this region,” Mr. Radhakrishnan said. Assistant Superintendent of Police Harsh Singh, Revenue Divisional Officer, Tiruchendur, Dhanapriya, Divisional Engineer, Department of Highways, P.

15 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Ministers and officials inspect water scheme||Officials and engineers of the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board, led by Minister for Municipal Administration, K.N.Nehru, began a two-day inspection and survey of the functioning of the Ramanathapuram Combined Drinking Water Supply Scheme (CWSS) with its source on the Cauvery river at Mutharasanallur on the outskirts of the city on Monday. The exercise was aimed at rectifying problems and streamlining water supply under the mega scheme which was executed at a cost of Rs. 616 crore during the DMK regime in 2006-11 and commissioned by the late Chief Minister M.Karunanidhi in June 2009. The scheme was executed following a severe drinking water shortage in Ramanathapuram district during 2008-2009. It caters to five municipalities, 11 town panchayats and 3,163 rural habitations in three districts of Pudukottai, Sivagangai and Ramanathapuram. Four collector wells have been established at the headworks of the scheme on the Cauvery Nagar in Tiruchi and water is being pumped for a total distance of 448 km to feed 119 ground-level sumps and 601 overhead water tanks and supplied to beneficiaries through 198-km-long distribution lines. However, over the years problems had cropped in the supply to tail-end areas due to road widening works, cracks and bursts in water pipelines and illegal connections. The inspection was taken up following a directive from Chief Minister M.K.Stalin to rectify the problems and streamline the supply. Following this, Mr.Nehru, accompanied by Transport Minister R.S.Raja Kannappan and TWAD Board Managing Director C.N.Maheswaran, began the inspection on Monday at the headworks. As many as 52 special teams comprising 152 TWAD Board assistant executive engineers, assistant engineers and groundwater experts have been constituted to carry out the inspections in Pudukottai, Sivagangai and Ramanathapuram districts on Monday and Tuesday. The teams would inspect and check the pumping of water to sumps and overhead tanks, water quality and the gaps in pumping Mr.Nehru said. The teams would check whether the scheme is functioning as per design and also interact with local residents. The TWAD Board Chief Engineer, Madurai Region, Manimohan, would present a detailed report, based on the inspections,at a review meeting to be held in Madurai on Tuesday. Based on the report, necessary action would be taken to ensure proper supply to beneificiaries under the scheme, Mr.Nehru said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ministers-officials-inspect-water-scheme/article34817534.ece

The shop owners enthusiastically welcomed their customers after performing special prayers for the prosperity of their business. At Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC) shops, people stood in line as early as 6 a.m. when the shutters opened, ready to purchase liquor. Officials of TASMAC noted that while shops within the city adhered to personal distancing and made purchases respectfully. "Situation at the shops on the borders, near Karur, near Thanjavur, etc., was difficult to handle as the people from those districts, where the shops did not open, rushed here," a senior official said. At tea shops, civic body officials had deputed officials to monitor the usage of plastic cups, they said. At salons, which had shut shop for a month, preparations to welcome customers were made by purchasing more disposable towels, gloves, and other necessary material. A series of guidelines have been given to the shop owners, including maintaining personal hygiene and regular disinfection. Although they have been following them over the last year, they said that their operational costs have been affected. Men and women rushed to the salons nearby to get haircuts and other treatments after a month-long break. Mr. Selvaraj, president, Tiruchi District Barbers' Association, said that while the footfall was low, they were expecting it to increase. "We have asked all our members to follow norms.

The elephant, which sustained an injury in the tail region a few years ago in a fight with another elephant, has been treated by the Forest Department since the wound was noticed. Kommu Omkaram, District Forest Officer, Gudalur Division, said the animal was given oral medication, including antibiotics stuffed into its favourite fruits, over the last few years. “There was some improvement, but the wound has gotten bigger as the elephant rubs it on hard surfaces, causing it to open up and fester,” he said. After the pictures of the elephant began circulating on social media, animal rights activists called on the Forest Department to adopt a more direct approach to treating the animal. K.K. Kaushal, Field Director of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) where the Theppakadu Elephant Camp is located, said veterinarians opined that the elephant would need to be captured and restrained for any treatment to be effective. “Once an animal spends any considerable amount of time in a kraal [a shelter], it is almost impossible to return it to the wild, so it will be made a captive elephant,” he said. Two kumkis (trained captive elephants) from Theppakadu are to be used in the operation, which will commence once the kraal is readied. If captured, ‘Silver Monstra’ will become the 29th captive elephant in the Theppakadu Elephant Camp.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gudalur-tusker-to-be-captured-taken-to-camp-for-treatment/article34817728.ece
15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Poor patronage for taxis, autorickshaws||With the State government allowing the public to travel in autorickshaws and taxis in 11 districts including Coimbatore district as part of the relaxations in COVID-19 lockdown from Monday, drivers of autos and taxis said the patronage was poor on the first day. “I did not get any trips since morning,” said a Coimbatore-based taxi driver and owner of a private call taxi agency. He said it was difficult to predict when the situation would improve for taxi drivers. “People are not stepping out of their houses,” the driver said. According to B. Mahesh, coordinator of South India Rental Vehicle Drivers and Owners Association, drivers attached to taxi aggregator mobile applications received only a handful of bookings on Monday, which were mostly for medical emergencies. Police personnel were deployed at several points in the city and the outskirts such as Gandhipuram, Singanallur, Saravanampatti and Vellakinar to check whether the passengers had done the e-registration process and were travelling for a valid reason, he said. “We see that those who go out to take a COVID-19 test generally prefer two-wheelers and not taxis,” Mr. Mahesh said. P.K. Sukumaran, president of Coimbatore District Association of All Auto Rickshaw Workers Union, said that around 15,000 autorickshaws across Coimbatore district started operating on Monday. However, not many customers opted for autos and the situation would likely improve in the coming weeks, he said. Sources in the Tiruppur City Police said on Monday that with the operation of autos and taxis being allowed, checking was intensified for e-registration across the city and spot fines were levied for those who did not carry out the e-registration process. In Erode, since only a few passengers opted for trains, a very few taxis and auto rickshaws were operated. Only after e-registration, people were allowed to board the vehicles. A total of 583 two-wheelers and 21 four-wheelers were seized for violations. In Salem, autos resumed operations though the numbers were minimal. The city police had set up check points at over 15 places. R. Vedharathinam, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Traffic) said strict checks were being conducted and cases registered for violating COVID-19 protocols.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poor-patronage-for-taxis-autorickshaws/article34817451.ece

Several industrialists and businessmen said that they are suffering as they remained closed for several months in the last one-and-a-half years now. “Our two units have worked only for four weeks in the last 18 months. We faced great losses and had to relieve most of our workers. If we don’t open immediately, we may be forced to close down completely,’’ said Basavaraj Patil, who runs two factories in Belagavi. Anneppa Belagundi, who supplies specific machine to hardware units, said that he suffered losses even though some of his clients were allowed to work under exemptions for essential sector units. Hemang Desai’s family has been into handlooms and power looms for over a century now. He said that the losses suffered in the last two years were more than the accumulated losses since inception. “We have reduced the job works given to weavers and workers by over 70%. We had to stop supply of raw material and asked them to work with existing material,’’ he said. Meanwhile, delegations of members of trade bodies met district in-charge Minister Govind Karjol and Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath with a demand to allow more and more businesses to open. “We want the government to relax restrictions on trade and business. We have suffered enough. We want the government to reconsider the restrictions and allow us to function as usual. We are okay with a few restrictions to keep the epidemic under control,” Panchakshari Chonnad said in a release. Mr. Karjol assured them of considering their demand favourably. Mr. Hiremath told them that an extension of lockdown was necessary as of the 10 taluks, five had case positivity rate of over 10%. However, “we will take a decision after discussion with the district in-charge Minister,” he said. The delegation included industrialists and businessmen Hemendra Porwal, Kiran Angadi, Rohit Kapadia, Sunil Nayak and Dilip Tilve and others.

KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi led a padayatra in Gokak, Haroorgeri and Raibag towns. He held a protest in front of a petrol pump in Gokak along with supporters. He held a padayatra protest along with other Congress members in Haroorgeri. He said that the government was directly responsible for the hike in prices of all commodities, as it had indiscriminately increased the taxes on petrol and diesel. This leads to higher transport charges for vehicles and increased production costs in industries that depend on petroleum fuels. This is causing great inconvenience to everyone, he said. ‘Anti-people’ Mr. Jarkiholi said that the BJP leaders had raised a big hue and cry when ever the UPA government increased petrol prices by a rupee. “However, now that they are in power, they have become blind to the problems of the people. They should admit that they have always been anti-people, even when they were in the Opposition. They raised these issues only for political purposes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protests-continue/article34817446.ece

15 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||62% elders say pandemic increased risk of abuse||As many as 62.1% of senior citizens feel that the pandemic has increased the risk of elderly abuse, according to the findings of a survey by HelpAge India. The report, The Silent Tormentor: COVID-19 and the Elderly , was released on Monday, and was based on a survey conducted across six cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Chennai. With a sample size of 3,526 senior citizens, the report pointed out that there was a deep sense of isolation and fear among them during the pandemic. The main abusers, according to the report, were the sons (43.8%) and the daughters-in-law (27.8%). As many as 14.2% said that their abusers were their daughters. Emotional (60.1%) was the main form of abuse, followed by financial (61.6%) and physical (58.6%). Calls to helpline Imtiaz Ahmed, Mission Head – Agecare, HelpAge India, in a press release said, “We received over 1,000 calls to our Elder Helpline relating to elder abuse, violence and disputes, in the second wave, up by 18% from the first. The helpline received almost 20,000 calls in total in the second wave, a 36% increase since the first, with calls about counselling increasing by 111 % and requests for income support by 54%. COVID-19 has become the primary abuser, affecting elders in the worst ways possible.” The findings pointed out that even though 58.6 % of the elderly had family members who worked or studied from home, 20.5% of senior citizens wanted someone to just be with them, and 35.7% wanted someone to just call them to talk, while 13.7 % felt trapped and frustrated. The report also pointed out that 20.8% of elders had lost either their family members or friends due to COVID-19. “When asked what could have been done better to save their lives, the majority [50.8%] said better medical infrastructure, 44.4% said availability of vaccines, and 38.7% said availability of medicines and injections on time,” the release pointed out. Many of them were worried about being hospitalised if they contracted the infection, while some said they had a fear of dying. The pandemic also pointed out that there was a distinct gap in the younger members of the family in understanding the needs of the elders, as 61.4% of elders said that ‘work from home/study’ affected their daily routine negatively, while 71.6% of the caregivers said it did not affect the elders’ routine. Elders dependent on their kin financially stated that the pandemic had impacted their income stream as many of the breadwinners had lost jobs or faced a pay cut. Meanwhile, in the formal old-age home settings, 50% of them said that they faced scarcity of funds. The survey also noted that 37 % of the homes did not have isolation rooms if any were affected. Many of the elderly also said that they had felt a loss of communication with a loved one and they find themselves waiting for a call more than ever before. This was also because visitors were not allowed to meet their parents and grandparents. Many of the old age homes not only had a tough time accessing the basic resources, but also reported a shortage of staff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/62-elders-say-pandemic-increased-risk-of-abuse/article34817399.ece
15 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Only 20% employees reported for work’||Non-availability of public transport and poor vaccination coverage resulted in only around 20% of employees in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Bengaluru turning up to work on the first day of resumption of business after the partial unlock kicked in on Monday. Although the Karnataka government had permitted factories and manufacturing units to operate with a 50% workforce, most units could only get 15% to 20% workers to the premises. Kassia President K.B. Arasappa told The Hindu , “Most employees could not reach work because they did not have their own conveyance. Some portion of the workers who came today were not vaccinated. They had to be sent back adhering to safety guidelines. Our member companies are trying to vaccinate their employees but they are not getting enough vaccine from the government. “We had requested the government to operate BMTC buses to industrial areas, including Bommasandra, Whitefield and Rajajinagar. We also asked the government to allow shops and establishments to function. If they all remain closed, from where will MSMEs buy raw materials? The industry can't operate without the support of the supply chain.” Perikal M. Sundar, President, FKCCI said the trade body has been trying to convince the government to allow traders to open their establishments as industry and trade are interdependent and interlinked. “The government opened the industry, but shops that sell electrical, electronics and other raw materials remain closed. We have met the Chief Secretary to apprise him of our concerns,'' said Mr. Sundar. Sajjan Raj Mehtra, trade activist, said the Karnataka government earned over Rs. 10,000 crore in revenue in March this year, but could get only Rs. 2,000 crore in May. “The government should open up all connected sectors. Only if traders sold cement, steel, plastic, iron, pipes, rubber, copper, aluminium and other raw materials, factories can produce something. Industries also require another set of traders to sell their finished goods to end-users. It's a chain and no single link can operate effectively,” he said. Karnataka has over 6.5 lakh MSME units directly employing over 2.8 lakh people. MSMEs in Mysuru, Belagavi and Hassan are yet to reopen operations. According to trade bodies, around 20% of workers are yet to return from their villages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/only-20-employees-reported-for-work/article34817374.ece
15 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vaccination of homeless not in shelters a challenge||As chances of getting vaccinated play hide and seek for many due to the fluctuating availability of vaccine stocks, for those without a roof over their heads, vaccination is a pipe dream. Surveys to ascertain the number of homeless persons in the city conducted in 2018 and 2019 had pegged the number at 5,200 and around 4,200 respectively. With less than 5% of homeless in shelters, it is a huge challenge for the authorities to vaccinate them. A majority of the homeless do not possess any sort of documents to establish either their identity or address. It was only recently that the Centre, taking cognizance of this issue, wrote to all States directing the governments to facilitate COVID-19 vaccination of residents of shelters for urban homeless persons, including those who do not possess any ID. The letter dated May 13, 2021, states that the homeless persons are one of the vulnerable sections of society and hence should be provided vaccine on priority. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have also been drawn up for the same. There are nine shelters for the homeless in the city, housing 204 persons currently. Over the past year, 24 persons staying in these shelters have tested positive for COVID-19, and two have succumbed to the virus. According to information provided by the BBMP, 44% of the of the 204 inmates in the nine shelters had already been vaccinated. BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Welfare) S.G. Raveendra said 82 had already been given the first dose of the vaccine, and eight had received both doses. “We are coordinating with the Department of Health and Family Welfare to ensure all the inmates are vaccinated,” he said. Narasimhappa T.V., member of the Supreme Court-appointed Independent Impartial Committee on urban homeless, pointed out the major challenge before the civic body is to vaccinate the homeless who are not in the shelters. “While the civic body has tested and vaccinated the inmates in shelters, there is no clarity on plan of action to cover the majority of the homeless who are still struggling on the streets,” he alleged. City-based activist working for urban homeless, S.S. Rajani, said there still were hundreds of homeless persons, including nomadic families, waste pickers, daily wage workers and employees of small eateries near City Market, Kalasipalya, Sangolli Rayanna Railway Station, RMC Yeshwanthpur and other areas. She pointed out that the SOPs drawn up by the Centre state that the District Task Force should be constituted to identify such persons with the assistance of departments (Minority Affairs, Social Justice, Social Welfare). “There has been no planned action or coordination with the non-governmental organisations working on the ground for urban homeless here,” she alleged. Impact India Consortium, an umbrella organisation of NGOs working for urban homeless, in association with Azim Premji Foundation, is working on “Namma Maney” project, under which IIC is collecting data on the homeless from 40 partner NGOs. The homeless will also be sent to the shelters, apart from helping them get some sort of government-recognised ID. “However, since the outbreak of the pandemic, the application process for various IDs is greatly delayed, as all efforts are focused on COVID-19 management,” said Ramachandrappa H.T., ‘Namma Maney’ project manager.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccination-of-homeless-not-in-shelters-a-challenge/article34817370.ece
15 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC quashes elections held to Karnataka Medical Council||The High Court of Karnataka has set aside the elections that were held to the Karnataka Medical Coucil (KMC), while declaring that the elections were vitiated owing to a fraud by the Returning Officer (RO), a Joint Registrar of Department of Cooperative Societies. The court also directed the Lokayukta to conduct disciplinary proceedings against D. Pandurang Garag, ̥the RO, on his lapses while observing that it would be futile to entrust enquiry to the State government, which had supported his submissions before the court. The HC had witnessed multiple litigations over the delay in elections and the manner of the conduct of polls since the past four years. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while allowing a petition by Gachinamani Naganatha, a 70-year-old medical practitioner from Kalaburagi. The petitioner had questioned the process of preparing the voters’ list. The elections were held this January 23 and the results were declared on January 25. The court said that the RO added 37,298 persons to the voters’ list that included deceased doctors and those who left the country after surrendering their registration, while noticing that the RO casually gave his explanation to the court that the list “may contain one or two dead persons and a few who have left the country.” “This is enough circumstance to hold the conduct of the RO was in perpetration of fraud,” the court observed, while pointing out that the RO did not publish list of voters on the website of KMC as per law but published it on a separate website. The court also said that the RO, despite directions from the court, did not elaborate on consideration of thousands of objections received for the voters’ list, but claimed that he had passed a common order on all objections after claiming that he had individually looked into all objections though his order does not reflect conduct of such exercise. ‘Illegal, high-handed’ From the contents of his affidavit, the court said that they are “enough to hold that action of the Returning Officer was illegal, high-handed and would resultantly get vitiated by fraud, as one acting contrary to the statute...” and directed the government and the KMC to conduct re-election within six months after duly preparing the voters’ list afresh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-quashes-elections-held-to-karnataka-medical-council/article34817395.ece

Close on the heels of dissidence in the party State unit again coming to fore with some of the leaders demanding leadership change, Mr. Singh had a few days ago announced in New Delhi that he would visit Karnataka to take stock of the developments. He will camp in Bengaluru from Wednesday to Friday. He will hold a meeting with Ministers soon after his arrival on Wednesday. According to sources, he will also hold consultations with some of the leaders, including Minister C.P. Yogeshwar, who has raised a banner of revolt against Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Before winding up his visit on Friday, Mr. Singh will participate in the State core committee meeting. He is expected to hold consultations with the core committee members on dissidence and groupism in the party marked by exchange of barbs in public by rival camps. Meanwhile, political activities in the party State unit have gained momentum, with the rival camps getting ready to plead their case before him. Several leaders from Mr. Yediyurappa’s camp held consultations on Monday as soon as the schedule of Mr. Singh’s visit was finalised. What has put them on alert is speculations about Arvind Bellad, MLA, meeting Mr. Singh in New Delhi. This has ruffled the feathers of the Yediyurappa camp which has taken exception to him meeting Mr. Singh in Delhi though he was scheduled to visit the State. It is learnt that party old-timers are planning to meet Mr. Singh to seek redressal of their grievances that include alleged interference in administration by the Chief Minister’s son B.Y. Vijayendra, while Mr. Yediyurappa’s camp is getting ready to counter this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/arun-singhs-troubleshooting-exercise-to-begin-tomorrow/article34817396.ece

On Monday, it stood at Rs. 99.63 per litre . The diesel price touched Rs. 92.52 per litre . A. Balaji Rao, president, Bangalore Petroleum Dealers’ Association, said that with consistent rise in fuel prices, in a day or two, the price will touch an all-time high by crossing Rs. 100. In the State, petrol prices have already crossed Rs. 100 in districts like Ballari, Shivamogga and Davangere. It was in mid-February that the petrol price crossed Rs. 90 per litre for the first time in the city. Within four months, the price increased almost by Rs. 10. Increasing fuel cost is impacting motorists who are using personal vehicles for daily commute in the city. Vinay Sarathy, president, United Food Delivery Partners’ Union, said, “If delivery boys earn around Rs. 500 per day, more than Rs. 200 goes towards fuel. With hardly Rs. 300, they have to meet other expenses .” Sharan R., who uses his personal vehicle to commute, said, “The government is burdening people who are already in distress. A lot of people depend on bikes and taxis to travel. I am spending Rs. 100 - 150 per day on petrol.” People are also venting their ire on social media by demanding both the Central and State governments cut down taxes imposed on fuel. On the other hand, petrol bunk owners say due to the lockdown, fuel purchase has drastically dropped up to 60% .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/in-bengaluru-petrol-price-inches-close-to-rs-100-mark-per-litre/article34817381.ece

It was said that this was against the guidelines of the Forest Department. Activists of Bajrang Dal had planned the programme to feed bananas to monkeys, assuming that the animals had no food as there had been no travellers on the stretch due to the lockdown. They had brought about 100 kg of bananas for feeding. Mr. Kateel, who was also travelling by road, stopped his vehicle and joined the Bajrang Dal activists to feed the monkeys. The photos of the BJP State president feeding fruits to the monkeys were circulated widely in Chikkamagaluru district. This has led to criticism from several people who cited the Forest Department’s guidelines restricting travellers from feeding monkeys. A senior officer of the Forest Department told The Hindu that there were strict guidelines against feeding monkeys. “Feeding fruits could disturb the food habits of monkeys. Such habits could lead to monkeys raiding farms and plantations. Besides, there are chances of transmission of diseases through feeding. Whoever violates guidelines is liable for penalty,” said the officer who wished not to be named.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kateel-feeds-monkeys-draws-criticism/article34817433.ece

15 June 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘Why fuel prices have not been brought under GST’||Congress workers and leaders continued to stage protests in front of petrol bunks in various districts of North Karnataka on the fourth day of their “100 Not Out” campaign against spiralling fuel prices on Monday. The former Minister and senior Congress leader R.V. Deshpande accompanied by various party leaders, including the former Chairman of Legislative Council Veeranna Mattikatti, MLA Prasad Abbayya and other office-bearers, took part in the protests in front of various petrol bunks in Dharwad and Hubballi on Monday. The protestors condemned the hike in fuel prices strongly and demanded immediate remedial measures to check the soaring prices. They said that high fuel prices will automatically lead to an increase in the prices of essential commodities. Addressing the protestors, Mr. Deshpande said that the impact of high fuel prices will be seen on every sector and the common people who were already affected a great deal by the pandemic will be further burdened. Fuel prices had seen a rise 65 times under Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government rule and the Union government had failed in providing relief to the people. He sought to know why Central Excise duty and sales tax were not being reduced and why fuel prices have not been brought under GST.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/why-fuel-prices-have-not-been-brought-under-gst/article34817437.ece

Congress leader and former Ministers Basavaraj Rayaraddi, Priyanka Kharge, MLA Ajay Singh, M.Y.Patil, former legislature B.R.Patil said that the increase in fuel prices was hurting the poor and salaried class, the farmers, who are suffering an unprecedented economic slowdown and unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

15 June 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘Modi’s unscientific taxation policy led to fuel price hike’||Comparing the fuel price control mechanism that was in place during the UPA under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with the current ‘chaotic’ situation under Narendra Modi, Congress leader and former Minister Basavaraj Rayaraddi said the skyrocketing prices of petroleum products were neither the result of crude oil price fluctuations in the international market nor the COVID-19 pandemic but the unscientific taxation policy of the Centre. “Crude oil price in the international market had fallen from $112 a barrel in 2014 to $62 a barrel now. The fuel prices in the domestic market were supposed to fall as a result. But, they are skyrocketing because of the Modi government’s unscientific taxation policy. Petroleum products are kept not under GST but under excise duty and VAT. The excise duty for a litre of petrol has risen from Rs. 9.48 a litre during the UPA regime to Rs. 32.90 a litre in the NDA regime. The excise duty for diesel has risen from Rs. 3.56 a litre to Rs. 31.81 a litre in the same period. The State VAT for a litre of petrol has risen from Rs. 18 in the Siddaramaiah government in the State to Rs. 26 in the B.S. Yediyurappa government. The exorbitant rise of taxes is the primary reason for the skyrocketing fuel prices in the domestic market despite a steep fall of crude oil prices in the international market. If the taxation is rationalised, the fuel prices would automatically come down. But the Modi government is not ready to do it as it had vested interests to serve,” Mr. Rayaraddi said at a press conference in Kalaburagi on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/modis-unscientific-taxation-policy-led-to-fuel-price-hike/article34817449.ece
15 June 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Waves swallow sea wall as Batpady faces threat again||Residents of Batpady to the South of Mangaluru on the Karnataka-Kerala border are again worried over being cut off from the main land as the raging waves of the Arabian Sea have been swallowing sand and boulder walls erected to prevent sea erosion. With these walls being erected spending crores of rupees of getting washed away, a portion of the rebuilt road has come under the threat of getting eroded again this monsoon too. The same stretch was completely damaged last monsoon, while residents had to wait till February this year when the road was temporarily restored. The Ports and Inland Waterways Department had then erected a sand wall on a stretch of more than one kilometre from Uchchila till Batpady end-point sourcing sand that came about from dredging Netravathi-Phalguni river mouth near the Mangaluru Old Port. “Then itself, I had told the authorities that all of these would get washed away once it starts raining and my words have become true today,” said Batpady Abdullah, a resident of the area. “The department has erected 10 horizontal groyens into the sea from Uchchila till Batpady, leaving a few 100 metres being covered till Kerala border. I asked them to construct three more groyens till the Kerala border for protecting the eroding beachfront, but in vain,” Mr. Abdullah said. When The Hindu visited Uchchila-Batpady on Monday, the beachfront covered by the groyens appeared to be safe to some extent following beach rejuvenation. However, a few stretches have again been eroded even as one house is in danger of being pulled away by the raging waves. Similarly, the entire stretch of the beach that does not have groyens and where the sand wall is erected, is getting severely eroded. The department had said that two off-shore reefs built about 300 m away from the beach inside the sea as well as the 10 groyens will help prevent further beach erosion. However, this has failed to prevent erosion. Looking at the dwindling sand wall near his residence, Usman, a resident, said that the temporary road too will be washed away in a day or two.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/waves-swallow-sea-wall-as-batpady-faces-threat-again/article34817440.ece
15 June 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Man with ‘magnetic power’ asked to undergo medical test in Udupi||The Udupi district administration on Monday asked 50-year-old Ramdas Shet to undergo a medical test as he had claimed that his body has developed “magnetic power” after he took vaccine against COVID-19. Earlier, a video clip showing some metal objects such as coins and spoons sticking and hanging onto his body went viral on social media. However, Professor and Head, Department of Chemistry, National Institute of Technology, Karnataka (NIT-K), Mangaluru, Arun M. Isloor ruled out any link between the vaccine and human magnetism. And, senior physician Hansraj Alva at Vinaya Hospital and Research Centre, Mangaluru, called it a mere “gimmick”. Mr. Shet said that he had seen videos of some people displaying “magnetic power” in their body after taking vaccine against COVID-19. Hence, he too tried it out of curiosity. He was not sure whether he had had “magnetic power” before getting the vaccine. Deputy Commissioner of Udupi G. Jagadeesha said in a statement that vaccine will not create “magnetic power” in the body. Mr. Shet, who took his first dose on April 28, was tested at the District Government Hospital in Udupi. Some metal objects got stuck to his forehead, stomach, hands and other parts of the body, he said and added that doctors are studying it. Prof. Isloor said that according to the available scientific literature, none of the recorded claims of so called “human magnets” are related to physics of magnetism. “Such cases have been reported from other parts of the globe before COVID-19. It is known as human magnetism. In addition to metal objects, some have claimed that they are able to attract glass, plastic, rubber, wood and other non-magnetic metals such as aluminium, copper and brass,” Prof. Isloor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/man-with-magnetic-power-asked-to-undergo-medical-test-in-udupi/article34817442.ece

Phaneendra, who heads the State Legal Services Authority’s Committee that provides legal services to disabled persons, has directed the Udupi-based Human Rights Protection Foundation to submit an action plan to resolve problems faced by endosulfan victims from Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada and Udupi districts in getting honorarium, treatment and other relief. Mr. Phaneendra passed the direction following his recent virtual meeting with member-secretaries of the District Legal Services Authority and Deputy Commissioners of the three districts and endosulfan activists, including Ravindranath Shanbhag, who is the president of the foundation. The meeting was convened by Mr. Phaneendra, a former High Court of Karnataka judge, following representations by endosulfan victims to the State Legal Services Authority. During the meeting, Mr. Shanbhag submitted that the State government has failed to give monthly stipend to victims suffering from cancer, epilepsy, asthma and endrocrine disruptions. These victims are included in the category of those with less than 25% disability but they are not given monthly stipend. Of the 8,600 victims from 450 villages in the three districts, 2,000 victims fall in the less than 25% disability category and many among them are undergoing treatment for central nervous system disorders resulting from exposure to endosulfan. These victims are poor and they desperately need the assistance of the government, he said. The State government was giving monthly stipend of Rs. 1,500 to victims with disability ranging between 25% and 60% and Rs. 3,000 to those whose disability was more than 60%. Mr. Shanbhag expressed the need for permanent care centres for victims. Mr. Shanbhag told The Hindu that he will submit a report in 15 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/action-plan-on-relief-for-endosulfan-victims-to-be-submitted-in-15-days/article34817444.ece

15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Unrestricted movement is risky: Experts||Although Karnataka is witnessing a decline in active cases and daily new cases of COVID-19, it is not yet time to celebrate. The influx of people into Bengaluru and crowding, with no system in place for checking those who are entering the city, is risky with the fear of a third wave still looming large, said experts. Karnataka has been maintaining an average test positivity rate (TPR) of around 7% for the past one week. From 9.23% last week, the State’s average (TPR) reduced to 6.68% in the last seven days prior to June 13. Returning in droves Last week, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced a gradual unlock process in 19 districts starting Monday. People, who had left Bengaluru soon after the lockdown was announced, are now returning in huge numbers. Experts said this is a matter of concern as the plummeting TPR is not yet an indication of tiding over the crisis. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said it is advisable to impose Section 144 in the city all through the day for another three months to prohibit people from moving around in groups. “Going by the unrestricted movement of people on the first day of unlocking, it will not be a surprise if the number of cases goes up again. If we do not follow precautions now, we will be inviting the third wave much earlier than expected,” he said. Suggesting random checks at all entry points and toll gates, Dr. Manjunath said, “People should carry negative RTPCR/RAT reports or vaccination reports.” V. Ravi, member of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said the onus is now on people to prevent an aggressive third wave. “We have been repeatedly warning against crowding, but people, on the first day of unlocking, have forgotten that the virus is still lurking around. If this continues, the imminent third wave will arrive much earlier,” he said. “Why cannot people behave more responsibly until everyone is vaccinated? I can understand they have been locked up for nearly two months but complacency at this point of time is risky and dangerous.”  Testing strategy Dr. Ravi, who is also the nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said there should be no change in the testing strategy at least till December. “We should continue testing a minimum of 1.30 lakh samples (70% RT-PCR) till December,” he added.  We have been repeatedly warning against crowding, but people, on the first day of unlocking, have forgotten that the virus is still lurking around. If this continues, the imminent third wave will arrive much earlier V.

15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Small clinics wary of opening||Though COVID-19 cases in Bengaluru appear to be on the wane, and the government has relaxed lockdown restrictions from Monday till June 21, general physicians, dentists, ophthalmologists, and paediatricians who had shut their clinics for over a month have said it may take a few weeks to return to normality. According to Sudarshan Sajjan, secretary of the Indian Dental Association-Bengaluru, concerns continue to persist over close contact with patients. “We have let individual practitioners take a call. Though most of the doctors are fully vaccinated, their families are not. Many have decided to wait till the city achieves significant vaccination cover; if not, at least till their families are vaccinated,” he said. Similar concerns persist among other medical practitioners as well, especially among those who are senior citizens, have co-morbidities, or who have elderly family members living with them. Consultation over phone Prakash C. Rao, a general physician with a clinic at Yeshwantpur for over 40 years, closed his practice during the second wave. “I am 68 years old, diabetic, and have an octogenarian mother at home. I now consult over the phone and online. I have no plans to open the clinic yet,” he said. Most general physicians have moved their practices online, which many patients also seem to prefer. “I have kept my clinic open all through the lockdown. But patients preferred to consult over the phone. Throughout May, we were extremely busy with hundreds of teleconsultation calls every day,” said Mahesh, who runs a clinic at Chandra Layout. However, the poorer sections of society not well versed with online consultations seem to be left high and dry. Sunita, who works as a domestic help, suffers from thyroid problems, but has not been able to get proper relief for the past one month. “I cannot afford to go to a big nursing home or hospital, nor do I want to go for fear of exposing myself to COVID-19,” she said. Many paediatric clinics in residential areas have also remained closed. “It was a struggle to get proper care for my three-year-old son when he developed a fever. Most of the clinics were closed, forcing us to go to a big hospital, despite fears of exposure to the virus,” said Vidya N., a resident of Malleswaram. Y.L. Rajashekar, president of the Karnataka Ophthalmic Society, said eye clinics would gradually start opening up over the next two weeks, taking all precautions to avoid contact. However, he said nearly 90 hospitals had run into severe losses owing to the closure during the second wave and were up for sale. C.V. Sreenivas, president of the association of Otolaryngologists, Bengaluru, said ENT doctors faced the most risk of contracting the infection, but had decided to open in the coming weeks. “Many will likely open up in the coming weeks. Based on how the unlocking pans out, the rest will also open up,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/small-clinics-wary-of-opening/article34817367.ece

Sudhakar has said. Speaking to The Hindu , Dr. Sudhakar questioned the appointment of Jayakara S.M., principal of AECS College of Dental Sciences, to the post. He said there was a need for the person to have high academic qualifications and integrity to hold the post. Dr. Sudhakar, who is pro-Chancellor of the university, said he will discuss with the Governor and Chancellor of universities about the appointment. “I wanted to discuss this matter with the Governor, however, he is probably not meeting people because of COVID-19. I want to apprise him about all the matter,” he said. Speaking at the valedictory function of the RGUHS silver jubilee celebrations, he said as long as he was the Minister, only a person with “good history would be worthy of becoming the V-C”. He also pointed out that it was normal practice to appoint only government officials or government doctors to this post. He said that such people, if appointed, would know the culture and how the government functions. Dr. Sudhakar said that the government had urged the Chancellor to appoint the Registrar of RGUHS, Medical Director of the Medical Education Department, or the senior most dean of government hospitals as the V-C. “I am not batting for one person or do not have my own candidate. I just want to ensure that the person who heads the university is worthy of the post,” he said. Following Dr. Sudhakar’s statements, several people pointed out that the Minister was questioning the authority of the Governor who had the prerogative to decide this appointment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/present-interim-rguhs-v-c-unfit-for-post-says-sudhakar/article34817391.ece

However, nowadays, he uses the bold brush strokes to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 3, 2021, Mr. Natesan, 53, suffered a huge personal loss when his 80-year-old mother Devaki lost her battle to COVID-19. For him, the tragedy is yet to sink in but it has made him work to raise awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ever since the death of his mother, Mr. Natesan has been creating COVID-19-themed graffiti in different parts of Alappuzha cautioning people against the disease and urging them to maintain physical distancing, wear face masks even after vaccination, and use hand sanitiser to save lives. “My aim is to create awareness of coronavirus through art,” Mr. Natesan says. He says a lot of people have still not taken the disease seriously and he wants to educate them on the importance of following precautionary measures and rules through art. “My mother was taken to the Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha, with chest pain in the last week of April. She was later diagnosed with a renal disease. She contracted COVID-19 while undergoing treatment for the kidney problem. I could not even give her a proper funeral. The pain of it will remain with me for the rest of my life. A lot of lives can be saved by creating awareness,” says Mr. Natesan, a resident of Mannanchery. He is painting images and writing messages on compound walls of houses by the roadside after seeking permission. “I am getting a good response from the public. As it is for a good cause, a lot of people are letting their walls be painted with graffiti. I even received a call from the Changanassery police to do awareness artwork on the wall of the police station,” the artist says. Dr. Sairu Philip, Professor and Head Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha says creating awareness is important in the fight against COVID-19. “The bedrock to win this battle is by ensuring community participation. The awareness regarding the basics to break the chain should reach every individual,” Dr. Philip says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/art-that-speaks-of-pain-and-need-to-be-careful/article34817895.ece

15 June 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Timber smuggled from CHR seized||Following inspections launched by the Vigilance squad of the Forest Department to identify illegally felled trees, officials of the Ayyappancoil range seized nearly six loads of timber from Vellilamkandam, near Kattappana, on Sunday evening which has been felled from the Cardamom Hill Reserve (CHR) area. The timber seized was of javawood (Chorakkali or Cholavenga) and Indian Copal (Vellapine). The search was held following a tip-off that timber was concealed at Vellilamkandam. The Forest Department rarely give permission to cut trees from the CHR which has tree species endemic to the Western Ghats. Permission is given only if a tree is naturally dead, diseased or poses a threat to human life or property. The status of the CHR is that of a reserved forest. Only an authorised official can give permission in writing for cutting a tree in the notified CHR area as per Section 4, 5 of the Preservation of Tree Act. Preliminary inquiry revealed that Communist Party of India (CPI) local leader and former president of the Kanchiyar grama panchayat was involved in transporting the timber and storing the load there. An official of the Forest Department said an inquiry had been launched to find whether more timber had been smuggled from the CHR area. Inspections on A team led by forest flying squad Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) A. Shanavaz will inspect all ranges in Kottayam and Idukki districts to check the instances of tree felling. The team already inspected Kumily and Ayyappancovil ranges. According to sources, large-scale tree felling was done, especially in the CHR area, after the Revenue Department issued the controversial order giving permission to farmers to cut trees other than sandalwood grown by them on their land. In Chinnakkanal alone, 143 trees were felled. Instances of tree felling were reported in the Adimali, Ponmudi, Ayyappancovil, Mankuva, Udumbanchola and Rajakkad areas. Applications verified Devikulam Subcollector S. Premkrishnan said that the Udumbanchola and Devikulam tahsildars were directed to submit the details of applications received for tree felling following the issue of the controversial order. The title deed of a cardamom estate at Chinnakanal, where 143 trees were felled, had been cancelled, he said. Farmer forum stand Meanwhile, CPI’s farmers’ wing the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) said the government should not have cancelled the order for tree felling issued on October 24. Kisan Sabha State vice president Mathew Varghese said that the order was issued in the interests of the farmers.

The remains, including bone fragments, burned wood, and ash were found on the beach. They were dumped in a place under the jurisdiction of the Distrit Tourism Promotion Council, which is in charge of maintaining the Payyambalam beach. Soon after the news broke, Mayor T.O. Mohan visited the place. He said a few bags of ashes were dumped on the beach. However, there was an effort to implicate the corporation in this issue, he said. “It seems the ashes and remains were dumped during late night hours. The staff at the crematorium have not dumped the remains in the beach area, and it is the work of anti-social elements, who are trying to create a problem here,” he said. Mr. Mohan said there was some motive behind blaming the corporation for an incident that had nothing to do with the civic body. He demanded that action be taken against such persons who slandered the corporation. A complaint has been lodged with the Chief Minister, the Minister for Local Self Government and the District Collector in this regard, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/remains-from-crematorium-dumped-on-beach/article34817556.ece

15 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Tourism fraternity upbeat over amphibious bus project||Members of the tourism fraternity have cheered the announcement in the recent State Budget of introducing amphibious buses in Kochi, Kollam, and Thalassery, hoping that the unique venture would re-ignite interest among guests in Kerala, whose tourism sector is neck-deep in crisis owing to the pandemic. Amphibious buses will bring in tourists who want to avoid roads and instead relish the State’s famed backwaters and picturesque waterfront. In Kochi, services can be operated from Marine Drive, which has ample space to build a berthing ramp, to heritage locales like Fort Kochi, where a ramp can be built near the ro-ro terminal, said S. Vijayakumar, Secretary, Ernakulam District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC). “It will also be a definite hit with high-end tourists of cruise ships that call at the Kochi International Cruise Terminal at dawn and leave at dusk. Many of these tourists who opt for heritage tour of the city can save considerable time if they opt for amphibious buses which can operate on both land and the backwaters and are hence called ‘duck buses’. They could even take guests all the way up to the international airport, in case they wanted to fly back to their country after a local tour,” he added. Having a low draft, the buses can operate through placid waters to Muziris, Kadamakudy, Poothotta, and even Vaikom. Circular tour routes too can be identified, so that they operate as a hop on-hop off service, which people can board from any point en route. The DTPC could well act as a facilitating agency, by fixing ticket fare and helping market the service. The government could incentivise the service or offer viability gap funding, so that firms which enjoy good credibility come forward to procure amphibious vessels and operate them. Vessels that operate on electricity or solar power will be an added attraction, Mr. Vijayakumar said. Back in 2018, the government had permitted the State Water Transport Department (SWTD) to procure and operate an amphibious bus. The venture did not materialise, since importing such a vessel would attract 300% customs duty. “The SWTD is even now keen to begin such a service, since studies were done on converting Volvo buses into amphibious ones. We also formed a committee comprising experts from the Motor Vehicles Department, Ports, and Irrigation Department to realise the project,” said SWTD Director Shaji V. Nair. “A bus, and for that matter most land vehicles, can be made amphibious by altering the wheel hub, providing it a water-proof hull and a propeller. The same engine [as that of a bus] can be used to rotate the propeller. The propeller position can be controlled by a toggle switch in order to switch over from water to land and vice versa,” said Sibi Mathai, who heads a firm that maintains the Volvo fleet of the KSRTC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tourism-fraternity-upbeat-over-amphibious-bus-project/article34817545.ece

Mohamed Riyas has said. The destination deserves to be promoted, for which the extensive damage caused by sea incursion will be rectified. Tour guides and other stakeholders in the sector will be vaccinated against COVID-19, to boost their confidence and that of guests, he said after visiting the severely damaged walkway and other amenities along south beach in Fort Kochi on Monday. “K.J. Maxi, Kochi MLA, submitted a memorandum citing the extensive damage in the area. I promised him that I would visit the place. A meeting of stakeholders will be convened shortly to assess the extent of damage,” Mr. Riyas said. It had been reported that IIT Madras had submitted a list of recommendations a month ago to the Tourism Department on restoring the beach and the walkway, including by building an innovative seawall. Better connectivity The Minister said steps were under way to invigorate tourism destinations in Ernakulam, especially so since substantial number of tourists arrive at the international airport. Steps will also be taken to improve connectivity to different locales to woo domestic tourists. Tourism sources said Mr. Riyas also issued directions to address issues facing Kadambrayar like inadequate parking space. PWD 4U app On PWD 4U, an app launched by the PWD to seek information from the public on ill-maintained roads and safety hazards, Mr. Riyas said it was launched since an earlier app was not functioning as expected. “A trial run is on. Information on 4,000 km of State highways is available on the app. People can also submit complaints about the rest of the 38,000 km roads too,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fort-kochi-will-get-back-its-lost-glory-says-riyas/article34817551.ece
15 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Excise gets tip-offs on illicit brewers from angry customers||Recently, Excise officials in the Kothamangalam Range seized 30 litres of illicitly brewed country liquor from a household at Malayankeezhu along the bypass. Soon, it emerged that the informer was a disgruntled customer who had to buy a litre of the brew from the accused for a princely sum of Rs. 2,000. Increasingly, clients, on turning sober, become guilt-ridden on being made to pay exorbitant price for the tipple. They blow the suppliers’ cover with a vengeance. The enforcement officials are not complaining. “Unlike in the past, illicit brewing is now largely home-centric and for personal consumption, making it harder to detect. The moment it is sold, we are alerted,” said Shaibu P.E., Excise Inspector, Kothamangalam Range, where 22 such cases were registered in May under the Abkari Act. It has also been noted that brewers never store and sell in the same Excise range, making the seizure of their larger stock tougher. With liquor outlets and bars remaining closed for over a month, there has been a steady rise in illicit brewing. While the production is largely in small quantities, sporadic instances of large-scale production, especially in rural areas with facilitating factors, have also been detected. Recently, 1,200 litres of ‘wash,’ used in brewing, were seized from North Paravur. “Illicit brewing is definitely on the rise. The isolated forest regions of Idukki and Thrissur districts abetting the eastern and northern borders of Ernakulam offer ideal conditions for clandestine brewing,” said T.A. Ashokkumar, Deputy Excise Commissioner, Ernakulam. Besides three control rooms, individual Excise offices have been asked to closely monitor such places within their jurisdictions. Excise officials in the largely tribal belt of Kuttampuzha have also noticed a rise in illicit brewing. “Earlier, there were fewer cases while the quantity involved was large, whereas now the cases have risen, and the quantity has dropped, mostly less than 50 litres. Since large-scale purchase of raw materials like jaggery would raise suspicions, brewers mostly rely on shops in the interiors,” said Ramesh P., Excise Inspector, Kuttampuzha Range.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/excise-gets-tip-offs-on-illicit-brewers-from-angry-customers/article34817549.ece

The Federation said the Centre’s support would be needed for the purpose as material dredged from the shipping channel in Kochi could be utilised for recreating the beach close to Chellanam. The Federation plans to submit a memorandum to the Union government, highlighting serious sea erosion in the segment. In Kochi, the port-related dredging activity is directly controlled by the Union government and a decision by the Centre would be required, said Federation State president Jackson Pollayil . According to the Federation, the major causes for sea erosion in Chellanam are sand mining in Andhakaranazhi in Alappuzha, and dredging for maintaining Kochi’s shipping channel. The Coastal Area Development Agency for Liberation (Cadal) under the Kerala Region Latin Catholic Council has also submitted a proposal to the State authorities to use dredged material from the shipping channel for beach recreation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fishers-to-seek-help-for-beach-nourishment/article34817547.ece

15 June 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Tapping the talent of amateur artists||Having anchored herself in the craft of pot artistry, Reshma Benny, an undergraduate student from Valakayam near Kanjirapally, continues to document her personal response to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. The back-to-back lockdowns and social distancing norms have turned the daily fabric of her life upside down. Lockdowns But the time and space afforded by these lockdowns has helped this young artist to connect with a broader community for a cause. Ms. Benny is now an active member of a collective, Kala4care, that uses the artistic skills of its members to benefit the special children. Proceeds The proceeds from the sale of all her artworks, along with that of her fellow artists, are routed to fund the research and development of technology that assists children with autism or cerebral palsy. To begin with, the collective funded the development Mozhi, an application meant for assisting people with hearing loss and other disabilities. The open-source application, developed in association with Punarjeeva Technology Solutions — a startup specialising in assistive technology and gamified physical and cognitive rehabilitation for specially abled children, helps convert speech to text and supports multiple languages. Says Robin Tommy, the community leader of Kala4Care, “the lockdown indeed spawned a boom of home crafts such as bottle artistry, planting designs or painting while a host of others took to vlogging. Our attempt is to combine these two aspects of art and communication for a social cause,” said Mr. Tommy, who heads the Rapid Labs project of the TCS. The collective currently has about 30 members, of which about five are artists while the remaining members have been tasked with managing the sales and creating awareness on special children through videos. “The collective is primarily based in Kanjirappally while people from other locations including Ernakulam and Irinjalakkuda are too associating with us. The members meet online once in every month to review the functioning and chart out the plan of actions,” added Mr. Tommy. Mozhi Following the successful roll-out of Mozhi, the group is now associating with a project to develop an intelligent alarm for the use of people having Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) — a neurodegenerative neuromuscular disease . Besides the funding of technology, the collective also organises online sessions for these special students and their parents in association with the Adarsh Charitable Trust. The sessions vary from technology, therapy, parenting and vocational training, among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tapping-the-talent-of-amateur-artists/article34817886.ece

Revenue and Local Self-Government Department officials are now active admins and members of rescue service groups in different instant social media messaging applications to quickly communicate urgent requirements and request field support in times of emergency. Revenue Department officials say the trained Community Rescue Volunteers and local body members are also part of such special purpose social media groups. They say that the team members are all equipped with basic rescue accessories to meet any emergency situation. Based on the revised disaster management plan, the list of public and private facilities to be converted into temporary relief camps during emergency situations is now ready with local bodies and the village authorities in the district. Though no families have been shifted to such locations so far, officials make it clear that some of those staying in vulnerable upland and coastal areas will be shifted to safer locations with the strengthening of monsoon. A challenge “One of the main tasks this time for rescue operators is to strictly comply with the COVID-19 protocol. As the entry of people into relief camps is now permitted only after COVID-19 screening, rescue teams will have bigger responsibilities,” says a Revenue Department officer from Kattippara, where a massive landslip claimed 14 lives in 2018. He also adds that all the district and sub-divisional control rooms have already been activated with 24x7 service to respond quickly to distress calls. Meanwhile, residents along the coastal areas of Vadakara and Kozhikode city have expressed concerns over the efficacy of the measures taken for their protection. According to them, the damaged seawalls are yet to be repaired in many locations. A fishermen organisation leader from Azhiyoor says the reconstruction work on a damaged seawall between Azhithala and Kuriyadi stretch near Vadakara is still incomplete owing to shortage of funds. It will affect the safety of around 100 houses in the area, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/action-plan-ready-as-villages-brace-for-rain-related-calamities/article34817851.ece
15 June 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Action against erring officials after report, says Saseendran||A section of officials of both the Revenue and Forest departments apparently colluded with each other to facilitate illegal tree-felling for timber merchants in the State, if the sequence of events and preliminary evidence are any indication. Sources said the officials very well knew about the dire consequences of executing the revenue orders that would eventually benefit the timber lobby instead of helping the cultivators, who had been granted patta land by the government. “The special investigation team constituted by the government to probe the illegal felling of trees will not only focus on the incident at Muttil South village in Wayanad but also the allegations of corrupt practices throughout the State,” a senior official said on Monday. Conflicting views Minister for Forests A.K. Saseendran said the previous LDF government had taken a final call when conflicting views arose against the revenue orders. “Even before the orders were issued, an all-party meeting was held so as to ease the difficulties faced by the farmers with title deeds. Also, a ministerial-level meeting was held to sort out the issue when cultivators were burdened with visiting forest offices,” he told The Hindu . Emphasising that the general view of the Forest Department was not to allow felling of trees, Mr. Saseendran said many officials had aired concerns and objected to the revenue orders. Replying to a question on taking action against erring officials, if any, the Minister said he would wait till the investigation team submitted its report. “The issue was brought to light because of the vigil of the Forest Department. Maybe the senior officials were unable to fully concentrate on detecting the malpractice during the elections. Similarly, the district administration was engaged with the COVID-19 crisis. Trees were illegally cut then,” Mr. Saseendran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/action-against-erring-officials-after-report-says-saseendran/article34817559.ece

15 June 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Reservoirs in Pathanamthitta to host fish farms||Commercial fishery is not an occupation one would normally associate with the people living on the high-ranges of Pathanamathitta. The sector, however, looks set to gain a foothold along the forest-fringe villages here, thanks to a novel community initiative. Starting from September, a group of 100 people from the Scheduled Tribe community in Seethathodu village will open aquaculture farms inside the sprawling reservoir of the Kakki dam in the Sabarimala forests. The initiative, being implemented by the Agency for Development of Aquaculture Kerala, will be expanded to other reservoirs in the district in a phased manner. According to officials, the project envisages commercial production of fish through cage farming system. As many as 100 cages, each having a length of six meters and a width of four meters, will be set up inside the reservoir. The hives will contain 3000 fish-lings each and the harvest will be held twice in a year. “The fish harvested from the dam will be sold through the stalls to be opened through the stalls to be opened by the Matsyafed under the brand name ‘Konni Fish’,” said KU Janeesh Kumar, Konni MLA. The Seethathodu panchayat and the Forest Department had been tasked to identify the beneficiaries of the project, who would be receiving a daily income of Rs. 400 and proceeds from the fish sales, he added. The Fisheries Department will provide the farmers technical guidance and the logistical support for transporting fish to the local market. As part of implementing the project, a meeting of the project monitoring committee comprising of Fisheries, Panchayat, Forest, KSEB, and Dam Safety sections was held here the other day. The committee, led by the MLA, also conducted a joint inspection of the reservoir to determine the locations for depositing the cages. Officials said the farms were expected to fetch around 125 tonnes of fish in the first phase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/reservoirs-in-pathanamthitta-to-host-fish-farms/article34817880.ece
15 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Corpn. yet to resolve building permits issue||Amendments to the Interim Development Order (IDO), which governs the awarding of building permits and all kinds of land use in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation area in the absence of a sanctioned master plan, could become difficult with the notification of the Kerala Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021 earlier this year. With the passing of a draft master plan too some way away, the issues faced regarding new constructions in some areas might not be resolved soon. The amendments were proposed last year considering the issues faced by quite a few city residents whose lands were wrongly marked as meant for public use or as paddy fields or included in specific zones, making it impossible for them to get building permit applications. In such cases, the file has to be forwarded to the Regional Town Planner's office for clearance. The amendments were meant to simplify this process and take such decisions at the Corporation itself. According to town planning officials, there is no specific clause in the new amendments which allows for an amendment to the IDO. Not specified “Earlier, the IDO was specifically mentioned in the act. The new amendments do not specify the same. In case an IDO has to be issued or amended, clarification has to be sought from the government. If it was passed last year in the Corporation council, it would have worked fine. Now, it might be difficult,”said a source. Last year, before the local body elections, the amendments to the IDO were presented in the council, but were not passed as the opposition demanded more clarity on it. With a new council taking charge after the elections, the issue of the IDO or the master plan is yet to become a point of discussion. On Tuesday, a meeting is set to be held in the city Corporation in which the town planning officials will familiarise the new members with the proposed draft master plan and issues concerning it. The Thiruvananthapuram draft master plan 2031, the previous version of the plan, was withdrawn in February 2014 following widespread public protests in the outer areas of the city, especially in Kattayikonam and Attipra, after people found their requests for building permits getting rejected, as some of these areas were marked as strategic zones in the master plan. Land use After its withdrawal, land use has been mainly governed by the IDO, based on which building permit applications were either granted or rejected. The work on a revised draft master plan began early in 2017, with the deadline getting extended every year. The draft was almost ready towards the end of 2020, but with the Corporation officials almost fully immersed in COVID-19-related work, the master plan was put on the back burner. The local body elections and the assembly elections in quick succession also prevented any action being taken on this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-yet-to-resolve-building-permits-issue/article34817892.ece
15 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Tree-felling puts govt. in a spot||The illegal felling of protected trees in vast numbers from deeded land threatened to put the LDF government in a spot on Monday. The scandal, which has its provenance in a controversial order passed by the previous LDF government, has political and legal ramifications for the current dispensation. Judicial inquiry Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan has demanded a judicial inquiry into the environmental crime. Mr. Satheesan said he would lead a UDF fact-finding delegation to South Muttil village in Wayanad on June 17, which reported the loss of almost 100 ancient rosewood trees to the forest mafia. He said the previous government had used farmers as a cover to allow the forest mafia to denude Kerala of its tree wealth. The Revenue Department had passed a dubious order in October last allowing farmers to harvest tress they had cultivated on assigned land. The forest mafia had used the ruling to persuade pandemic-hit farmers to sell them protected timber for a pittance. The suspects had political and official patronage. He said the controversial order had prompted several District Collectors, forest enforcers, and environmental activists to raise red flags and send cautionary reports to the administration. However, the government did not rescind the order till February. It kept the door open for timber rustlers to loot the State’s tree wealth. Political issue Earlier, the BJP had made forest theft a political issue to attack the LDF. Party State president K. Surendran persuaded the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to seek a report from the State government. He and Kummanam Rajasekharan visited Wayanad to spotlight the crime. The State government has to defend itself in the High Court against a plea for a CBI inquiry into the timber theft. The scandal also has brought into sharp focus the role of the Revenue and Forest Departments during the tenure of the previous LDF government. Apparently scrambling for answers, Communist Party of India (CPI) State secretary Kanam Rajendran reportedly conferred with former Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan and former Forest Minister K. Raju. A CPI person said the previous disposition had issued the order in the farmer interest. But vested interests had misinterpreted it to enable the racketeers, he said.

15 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Public being looted: Sudhakaran||Dubbing the Narendra Modi-led Central government a fascist dispensation, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president-designate K. Sudhakaran, MP, has accused both the Union and State governments of looting the country by hiking the prices of petroleum products. He was inaugurating a demonstration organised by United Democratic Front (UDF) Parliamentarians in front of the Raj Bhavan on Monday to protest against the price rise. ‘Pro-people stance’ The Congress leader blamed the governments for failing to adopt a ‘pro-people stance’ similar to the one taken by the then Manmohan Singh-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government when petrol price was regulated at Rs. 50 though crude oil traded at $132 a barrel. Now, the fuel price had crossed Rs. 100, despite crude oil price falling to $72 a barrel. Currently, the base prices of petrol and diesel were Rs. 34.19 a litre and Rs. 36.22 a litre respectively. However, the public had been paying thrice the amount in the open market. The Centre levied excise duties of Rs. 32.90 for diesel and Rs. 31.80 for petrol, much higher than the rates of Rs. 9.48 and Rs. 3.56 respectively that were levied during the UPA regime. Mr. Sudhakaran said there were inconsistencies in the Centre’s claim of expending the profits gained through the petroleum price hike for COVID-19 management. Taking potshots at the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, he said the United Democratic Front (UDF) government led by Oommen Chandy had foregone an amount of Rs. 619.17 crore that could have gone to the State exchequer by way of four tax hikes. Parliamentarians Kodikkunnil Suresh, K. Muraleedharan, Anto Antony, Benny Behanan, Rajmohan Unnithan, Adoor Prakash, Dean Kuriakose, Remya Haridas, E.T. Mohammed Basheer and M.P. Abdussamad Samadani, and DCC president Neyyattinkara Sanal were among those who participated in the agitation. The leaders also petitioned Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/public-being-looted-sudhakaran/article34817890.ece

15 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CM: order distorted to denude timber wealth||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said illegal felling of endangered trees in the State in vast numbers recently had resulted from the subversion of a government order intended to help farmers legally harvest timber they had grown on land tracts assigned to them for agriculture. In 2017, political parties of varied hues had agreed that the government should permit farmers to sell timber they had grown on their land. However, they should seek special permission before cutting endangered and valuable species such as rosewood, teak, and sandal. In October 2020, the government issued an order further elaborating the 2017 decision. However, some elements distorted the order to denude Kerala of its timber wealth. They used farmers as a cover for their timber theft. Such persons would face stringent prosecution. However, the government would protect farmers and preserve their interest. The government had impounded the bulk of the poached timber.  On IS defectors’ issue When pressed about the return of Islamic State defectors from Kerala currently in the custody of the Afghan government, Mr. Vijayan said the matter was the Central government’s purview.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cm-order-distorted-to-denude-timber-wealth/article34817569.ece

15 June 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘All PHCs in Chittoor will have 24x7 oxygen supply’||After the second wave of the pandemic, which brought to fore the lacuna in the healthcare system in the country, the district administration has decided to strengthen all the primary, community, area and district hospitals by ensuring a 24x7 oxygen supply. Deputy District Medical and Health Officer (Dy. DM&HO) P. Ravi Raju told The Hindu that after a study of the dynamics of COVID infections in the district, the importance of equipping the primary health centres(PHCs) with oxygen concentrators was strongly felt. “As a large number of rural patients depend on the PHCs, we are contemplating on giving top priority to provide oxygen concentrators to these units. Already, a good number of donors, including the Telugu NRIs from the U.S., have come forward with the essential equipment for many centres,” Mr. Ravi Raju said. The official said that while the graph of COVID infections in the first wave showed a steady rise and fall of cases, mainly in urban areas, the second wave was very sudden, severely hitting the rural side. “The availability of oxygen supply at the units would be effective in saving people’s lives in case of a third wave. Our aim is to prevent deaths by providing immediate care till the arrival of ambulances and shifting them to the COVID hospitals. The concentrators would also be of immense help in dealing with COVID cases among infants.” So far, donations had come from not only the NRIs, but also from the local industrial units and charitable trusts. “Rajampeta MP Mithun Reddy and Nagari MLA R.K. Roja took the lead in providing donations of key paraphernalia to the hospitals in the district. As the donations are now mostly limited to the COVID hospitals and urban health centres, we appeal to the donors to extend their gesture to all the 102 primary, 6 community health centres, and 6 area hospitals for the benefit of the rural sector as well,” Dr. Ravi Raju said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/all-phcs-in-chittoor-will-have-24x7-oxygen-supply/article34817930.ece

15 June 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Appireddy rewarded for his loyalty and patience||Finally, the tide has turned in favour of YSR Congress Party senior leader Lella Appireddy as the 54-year-old who holds the post of party’s State general secretary at present has been nominated as a Member of Legislative Council (MLC) in the Governor’s quota. Party insiders say Mr. Appireddy, who has been waiting in wings for the last two years since the YSRCP stormed into power, was finally rewarded for his ‘unflinching loyalty’ to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. “I owe my political career to Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. I thank him for putting trust in me. I will strive to bring back the party to power again in the next general elections,’’ said Mr. Appireddy. Hailing from an agricultural family at Ankireddypalem, Mr. Appireddy had seen it all during his long political innings, which can be described as a roller coaster ride. Political career A student leader and later trade union leader, Mr. Appireddy served as National Students Union of India district unit president during 1989-1994, during which he became close to many senior Congress leaders. Former Chief Ministers Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, N. Janardhana Reddy, Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy had patronised the then young leader, who quickly learned the ropes. Mr. Appireddy had shown his leadership skills in his student life, by becoming SPL of SKBM High School in Guntur and later a student leader in GHR and MCMR College (Reddy College). He had joined the Congress and quickly rose to leadership positions, becoming the president of NSUI and the District Youth Congress Unit. Mr. Appireddy was known for arranging massive crowds at short notice and enjoyed a support base of workers, auto-rickshaw drivers and construction workers. He had founded the Bajrang Jute Mill Trade Union and won in two successive elections of 2004 and 2009. He was instrumental in bringing several reforms such as hike in pay, compensation to the next of kin of the deceased workers, provision of Rs. 25,000 to girls as wedding expenses. He also received the Shramasakthi award in 2010. However, Mr. Appireddy had his fair share of setbacks. He lost as a YSRCP candidate in the 2014 Assembly elections and was crestfallen as the party denied him ticket in the 2019 elections, but he had remained loyal to Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy throughout. The period between 2014 and 2019 was tough as Mr. Appireddy became a target of political witch hunt by the then ruling government. The break came in August 2020, when he was made in-charge of party central office, a job Mr. Appireddy had performed well by coordinating the party’s preparation in the successive local body elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/appireddy-rewarded-for-his-loyalty-and-patience/article34817914.ece

Addressing the media here on Monday, Mr. Srinivasa Reddy said the power sector was bogged down by a massive debt of roughly Rs. 80,000 crore due to the misdeeds of the previous government.

The installation of power meters for agriculture pumpsets will not be detrimental to farmers’ interests. Rather, it will help obtain the accurate consumption data,” said the Minister. Orders have been issued to lay underground cables in the big YSR Jagananna Colonies while the lines would be overhead in the relatively small ones. Tenders would be called for once the DPRs are finalised, he said.  Mr. Srinivasa Reddy clarified that the government has no intention to reduce the salaries of electricity employees.

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, APUCF State convener Ch. Babu Rao said that the hike in taxes was the fallout of the dangerous urban reforms initiated by the Central government. The Central government was compelling the States to initiate the reforms. An increase in taxes in urban areas, privatisation of power sector, amendments to labour laws in the name of ease of doing business and such other conditions were thrust on the States, he said. The immediate burden on people due to the tax hike was Rs. 3,000 crore, and would be not less than Rs. 10,000 crore in phases, he said. Chief Minister Y.S.

It has failed in providing minimum support prices for various crops,” Mr. Veerraju told the media here on Monday.

Chandrababu Naidu, was recovered. The value of the 296 government lands recovered was estimated to be worth Rs. 4,776 crore,” the Minister said at a press conference here on Monday. The Minister wondered why the Left parties, which had accused former Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao of grabbing land belonging to the Visakhapatnam Public Library when the TDP was in power, were now silent on the issue. “I urge all Opposition parties like the Jana Sena Party, Bharatiya Janata Party and Lok Satta Party and the Left parties to come out with their stand on the issue,” the Minister said, adding that the defeat of the TDP in 2019 was also partly due to the “land-grabbing done by the former MLA and TDP leaders”. “I had brought the issue to the notice of then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu in my capacity as an MP and a representative of the TDP in Anakapalle. Mr. Naidu promised to take action but failed to do anything, which is why the people rejected the party in the last elections,” he said. On the claims made by TDP leader Palla Srinivasa Rao, the Tourism Minister said that it was an open secret that land-grabbers hold their properties on ‘benami names’ or in the names of their family members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/support-govt-to-recover-grabbed-land-minister/article34817939.ece

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, the TDP Parliamentary district president challenged Mr. Muttamsetti and other YSRCP MPs and MLAs to a debate, claiming that it would prove who was at fault. “I will quit politics if the YSRCP leaders can prove that I own 49 acres of land,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao said. He added that Rajya Sabha MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy should leave Visakhapatnam if the YSRCP leaders were unable to prove the allegations. “I disclosed my assets in my election affidavits in 2014 and 2019, and I have only a one-seventh share in my family property,” the former MLA said. “The Minister says that I have 49 acres in my name. If that is true, let him prove it. There will be at least 40,000 acres of land in Gajuwaka mandal. The officials might have seized someone else’s property and are saying that it is mine,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao said. The TDP leader said that he does not own even an inch of land in Kapu Jaggarajupeta but has land in Yadav Jaggarajupeta and Tunglam. “Our family has been in politics since 1979 with my father Palla Simhachalam contesting as an Independent. We used to sell part of the land before elections to meet expenses. The ‘jirayati’ (dry crop) land on my site is not encroached land as being claimed. The government is victimising me as I have not joined the YSRCP, and for launching a fast against the privatisation of VSP,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/allegations-baseless-says-former-mla/article34817938.ece

Cutting across party lines, many leaders congratulated former Union Minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju who had challenged the appointment of Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju as the chairperson of the trust that controls many educational institutions and around 14,800 acres of land worth more than Rs. 1 lakh crore. After the court’s verdict, there was a jubilant mood in Mr. Ashok’s house. TDP leaders and well wishers of Mr. Ashok’s family distributed sweets. They congratulated Mr. Ashok and his daughter Aditi Gajapathi Raju. TDP Vizianagaram Parliamentary Party president Kimidi Nagarjuna alleged that the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government had intruded into the MANSAS Trust’s affairs without following the bylaws of the trust. In a press note, Jana Sena Party leader Tyada Ramakrishna Rao asked the Jagan Mohan Reddy government not to harass Opposition party leaders. “The YSRCP government had created lot of troubles to Mr. Ashok Gajapathi Raju’s family by making Ms. Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju as the chairperson of the trust. Finally, the High Court came to the rescue of the law-abiding people,” he added.

15 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Lack of industrial oxygen hits SRDP works||Several of the city’s infrastructural works have reached an impasse owing to unavailability of oxygen cylinders, as restrictions have been imposed on the use of the precious gas. Keeping in view the huge demand for oxygen cylinders vis-à-vis their scarcity during COVID-19 second wave, the Central government had imposed restrictions on the production of industrial oxygen. Industries have been issued instructions to limit the production to medical oxygen till further notification, due to which all the projects involving welding works have come to a grinding halt. The projects include several components of the GHMC’s big-ticket Strategic Road Development Plan, under which flyovers, steel bridges and underpasses are planned at various locations of the city to facilitate signal free traffic flow. The stalled works include all except where the construction is still at the stage of laying foundations or raising pillars. Once the pillars are put in place, all other works such as installing the girders, and slabbing require welding, hence oxygen. Various structures at Shaikpet, Kothaguda, Botanical Garden, Shilpa Layout, L.B.Nagar, Bairamalguda, Nagole, and Bahadurpura are a few works which have been hit by the paucity of the gas. Though works for the steel bridges at VST and Nalgonda Crossroads have begun, they are still at foundation stage, and do not require welding job as yet. Supply of oxygen for infrastructural works has been stopped since second week of April when the second wave was at its peak. Since then, workers from other States, specialising in welding work have begun to leave the city, informed Engineering officials from GHMC. “Though the contractors asked us to write a recommendation letter to the Industries department seeking relaxation for public works, we have not agreed as human lives are more precious than the projects,” a senior official shared. Though it was initially expected that the restrictions on production of industrial oxygen would be relaxed from June 15, there has not been any clarity on the issue so far, he said.  Though contractors asked us to write to Industries depat. seeking relaxation for public works, we have not agreed as human lives are more precious.

15 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Eatala challenges KCR to order probe into each other’s properties||Former Health Minister Eatala Rajender, after formally joining the BJP on Monday, challenged Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to order an independent probe, either by a sitting judge or CBI, to enquire into their respective properties and questioned, if the latter is ready to “rub his nose to the ground” if allegations against him proved to be false. “Everyone knows how much money was spent during the recent MLC polls and the Nagarjunasagar byelection. At least Rs. 60 crore is being spent in Huzurabad. Where did you get this ill-gotten wealth? Telangana people will not fall prey to distribution of money or for any conspiracies, and will stand for democratic ideals,” he told a press conference at Delhi. Flanked by Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy, Dubbak MLA M. Raghunandan Rao and fellow leaders, who joined the party along with him, Mr. Rajender dared Mr. Rao to take action against him if he had taken even a single acre of assigned land as is being accused by the government. “You have the government machinery in your hands and have developed a vengeful attitude towards me, so I doubt if the officials would be impartial in their enquiry,” he said. ‘Crushing dissent’ Mr. Rajender accused Mr. Rao of “arrogant, trampling down on democratic rights, disregarding other opinions except his own and crushing any dissent.” “When Telangana was formed, an advisory panel of intellectuals was formed but it was never given its due and no appointments were given to the elders. We all expected a democratic Telangana when it was formed after years of struggle but he (Mr. Rao) murdered democracy and has no respect for parliamentary norms or institutions. He wants to function like a feudal lord,” he charged. Telangana was the only State in the country which had no Cabinet for three months after winning a majority in Assembly elections, he pointed and questioned the need to lure MLAs from Congress and Telugu Desam Party, thus making them irrelevant in the process only to “rule as he pleased so that no one can raise a voice,” he said. The former Minister claimed that after “many insults and humiliations,” he began to speak up for the unions, for more procurement centres, ration cards, etc., in the last two-and-a-half years. “I had land in the suburbs when I joined TRS 14 years ago and everyone knows that value grows in Hyderabad. Revenue Act comes under State, so there is no question of Centre trying to shield me,” he said, to another question. Mr. Rajender advised the Ministers speaking against him to introspect if they are “happy and are able to function independently.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/eatala-challenges-kcr-to-order-probe-into-each-others-properties/article34817816.ece
15 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Expired drug found at RIMS, probe ordered||Family members of an elderly patient admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Adilabad, have raised complaint about an expired medicine vial that they found beside the 65-year-old’s bed. The vial had expired in January this year, alleged the patient’s son, Kailash Sharma, who happened to check the date before it was administered. He added that he is unsure if expired medicines have been administered to his father earlier. The patient’s condition was stable on Monday. A complaint was lodged with the hospital’s superintendent, police, and Adilabad district collector. Staff of the hospital informed the administration that the expired vial was indeed found in the ward. An inquiry committee has been formed to probe the issue. Mr Sharma said that his father suffered from complications associated with high sugar levels and was admitted to RIMS on June 9. On June 13 night, an antibiotic vial was placed beside his bed. Upon checking, Mr Sharma found the expiry date was January 2021. He alleged that medicines past their expiry dates were placed beside the beds at least five more patients. “The staff threw the medicines out of the window. But I refused to give the vial meant for my father and demanded to meet the superintendent. I lodged a complaint with him. Thankfully, I checked the expiry date. What about attendants who cannot read,” he asked. It also raised questions about how long the expired medicine vials have been lying at the hospital and if they were administered to other patients earlier. Hospital superintendent Balram Banoth said, “An inquiry committee is looking into the issue. A drug inspector, too, is part of the committee to ensure impartial inquiry”. He added that no other medicine in the hospital had crossed the expiry date. Directions issued Senior officials of the Health department have directed other government hospitals to thoroughly check the expiry date of all medicines stocked with them, and discard or destroy the medicines past their expiry date. A software was put in place to send alerts three months before a medicine expires.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/expired-drug-found-at-rims-probe-ordered/article34817579.ece
15 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High-protein, low-fibre diet causing digestion issues in COVID patients||Consumption of more proteins and less fibre while battling COVID-19 can lead to constipation and discomforting complications such as anal fissures and bleeding, warn doctors who have come across a few such cases. Medical experts and nutritionists say less fibre leads to digestion issues and advise against relying on only one form of food. Instead, bringing about diversity in diet is a good idea. Assistant professor of urology at Osmania General Hospital, S. Anand said three to four patients who have recovered from COVID have consulted him for constipation and anal fissures. “They were post-COVID patients who relied on a low fibre, high protein diet for at least two meals during treatment. Their diet had less fibre. Protein from meat is completely absorbed by the body. So if someone has only protein and less fibre, it could lead to hard stools, causing painful defecation and fissures,” said Dr Anand. He suggests a balanced diet that includes enough fibre, along with adequate consumption of water. It was estimated that a few more patients might have suffered from constipation without serious complications, and relied on home remedies for relief. Dr Anand says there is a reason that vegetable salads are served at functions where people typically have rich food, since it contains fibre. Clinical pharmacologist G. Srinivas says certain steroids and antibiotics increase appetite. “When doctors prescribe more protein, they might not mean consumption of only protein. Other foods containing fibre, carbohydrates, antioxidants also have to be consumed,” he said. Head of Critical Care at Government Medical College at Nizamabad, Kiran Madhala says the most common side-effect of any drug are gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhoea and acidity. To counter acidity, doctors usually prescribe antacids. One has to be particular about when medicines are advised to be taken — whether on empty stomach or after food, he adds. National Institute of Nutrition director R. Hemalatha also agrees that a high-protein, low-fibre diet can cause constipation. Prolonged intake of high protein may result in digestion problems, renal stone formation and vascular abnormalities. “Dietary proteins provide amino acids for the synthesis of body proteins, including enzymes and hormones. As per our recently published Recommended Dietary Allowances, an adult requires 0.66 g protein/kg body weight/day; and on the higher side not more than 1g protein/kg/day is required for all functions in the body, including immune response, synthesis of new proteins and replacement of those that are broken down. High protein diets that provide more than 15% energy (calorie) from protein, is not routinely advocated,” Dr Hemalatha adds. Fibre-rich food So which foods are rich in fibre? Nutritionist Aparna Nemalikanti names green leafy vegetables, fruits, salads, sprouts and legumes. “The recommended fibre intake for an adult is 30 g/day, which can be obtained through wholegrain cereals or millets, pulses, beans, fruits and vegetable. Adequate fibre intake prevents constipation and also prevents cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, colon cancer and reduces the risk of hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia,” suggests Dr Hemalatha.   When doctors prescribe more protein, they might not mean consumption of only protein. Other foods containing carbohydrates, fibre and antioxidants also have to be consumed. G. Srinivas, Clinical pharmacologist||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/high-protein-low-fibre-diet-causing-digestion-issues-in-covid-patients/article34817573.ece

15 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Eatala boarded a sinking ship: Jagadish Reddy||Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leaders have observed that by joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) former minister Eatala Rajender has boarded a sinking ship in the State and similar is the fate of a few other leaders who followed him. “His (Mr. Rajender) joining the BJP clearly indicates that he has had a special agenda from the beginning as simply differences of opinion with the party (TRS) leadership won’t prompt any leader to switch loyalties. He must explain to people, particularly those of Huzurabad constituency, as to on which parameter the BJP was better than the TRS since the ruling party at the national-level has not brought in any welfare flagship measure compared to TRS,” Minister for Energy G. Jagadish Reddy said here on Monday. Addressing a press conference along with MLAs G. Kishore Kumar, B. Mallaiah Yadav, P. Shekhar Reddy, N. Bhaskar Rao and MP B. Lingaiah Yadav in the TRS Legislature Party office here he pointed out that there was no correlation between his words and deeds as he had been strongly criticising the BJP till a few days back. “By joining the BJP he has joined the heirs of Hitler,” Mr. Reddy said. Mr. Rajender’s eulogy of BJP now was like searching for ‘ghee’ in sponge (ghee) ridge gourd. If he had serious differences with the TRS leadership and problems within the party for long, as being claimed by him now, he would not have continued with the party for so long and enjoyed power, including as minister for over seven years, Mr. Jagadish Reddy said. ‘Won’t happen’ “Some of my opponents have been day-dreaming that I will meet the same fate as Mr. Rajender. I must tell such wishful thinkers that it won’t happen to me even in my dreams,” Mr. Jagadish Reddy said. The TRS leaders remarked that Mr. Rajender as well as the leaders who joined the BJP along with him would sink along with the ship (BJP) like other leaders who had left the party. “By leaving TRS Mr. Rajender has left the herd and went into the forest alone only to be a prey to hungry wild animals,” he observed. He would have continued in TRS till the inquiry against his (family’s) lands was over, if he was innocent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/eatala-boarded-a-sinking-ship-jagadish-reddy/article34817813.ece

The film producer’s counsel Durga Prasad gave this assurance to a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy. The bench was hearing a writ appeal filed by the vet’s father challenging a single judge order over release of the film. With the producer’s assurance that the film’s release was being deferred by two weeks, the bench closed the writ appeal. During the arguments on Monday, the producer’s counsel contended that the film was not directed by Ram Gopal Varma. He maintained that Disha film was directed by Anand Chandra. The producer only took the story content of the film from Mr. Varma, the lawyer told the court. The film was made with the titleAsha Encounter. A four-member committee of the Central Board of Film Certification initially examined the film following directions from the HC over a writ petition filed by the vet’s father. It referred the film to a large committee of the Board comprising nine members to issue certificate for release. The nine-member committee examined the movie and gave ‘A’ certificate to the film on this April 16, the producer’s lawyer informed the bench. Since a final call was yet to be taken on whether to release the film directly in theatres or through OTT platform, the film would not be released for the next two weeks. The matter was still under inquiry by the commission. A single judge passed an order over release of the film subject to some conditions. Questioning this order, the vet’s father filed a writ appeal. The bench took the assurance given by the film producer on record and closed the writ appeal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/asha-encounter-release-deferred-by-two-weeks/article34817821.ece

This was announced in a release on a virtual Hazard Identification and Risk Mitigation workshop, conducted recently, in which stakeholders from key organisations, including Union Ministry of Civil Aviation, DGCA, AAI, BCAS and NITI Aayog as well as senior officials from Vikarabad District Collectorate participated. Spearheaded by the Emerging Technologies Wing of State’s IT Department, the ‘Medicine from the Sky’ project, with which World Economic Forum, NITI Aayog, and HealthNet Global are associated, entails undertaking experimental Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone flights for delivery of vaccines using the identified airspace of Vikarabad. The workshop explored potential hazards and mitigation strategies during the upcoming trials. It discussed the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA). The CONOPS included detailed description of operations, various system checks, communication protocols, daily flight planning, roles and responsibilities of both crew and officials to ensure smooth conduct of the trials, a release said. The SORA methodology of Joint Authorities for Rule-making on Unmanned Systems was followed to quantify both the ground and air risk. A final Specific Assurance and Integrity Levels (SAIL) score of ‘II’ was calculated on combining the quantified risks and accounting for strategic and tactical mitigations. A SAIL score of ‘II’ on a scale of ‘VI’ indicates low risk, the release said. IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said the objective of Medicine from the Sky programme is to generate insights that can drive future adoption strategies and policy interventions for inclusion of drones in healthcare supply chain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trials-of-medicine-from-sky-likely-by-month-end/article34817572.ece

According to Police Commissioner V. C. Sajjanar, the accused — 36-year-old Palle Naresh Kumar from RC Puram — took cars on rent with false promises to the owners and car travel agencies that he would give double income on the car. “Naresh used to give rent for two or three months and later sell the vehicle for half price or mortgage the cars to others,” he said.

Soon, he befriended other accused, Badavath Raju Naik, Kalaumula Vikas, Golle Bharath Joshi alias Bharath, Bhanuri Election Reddy, Talla Narsimha Goud and convinced them to earn easy money by selling cars. They all agreed to Naresh’s plan and started selling cars. In order to sell the cars, they directly approached different car travel agencies in Hyderabad and some individuals and took around 272 cars from them with an oral agreement to pay the rent monthly, Mr. Sajjanar said. “Of 272 cars, 205 cars were forcefully taken back by the respective original owners of the cars. Out of the remaining 67 cars, one car was recovered by Tappachabutra Police and 50 cars were recovered by RC Puram Police and 13 cars are yet to be recovered,” the Commissioner said. Based on the complaint lodged by one of the victims, who gave 11 cars to Naresh and got cheated, police registered a case and arrested them. Mr. Sajjanar further cautioned the public to check the original documents thoroughly and confirm it through the RTA website, before buying pre-owned vehicles from unknown persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/gang-selling-rented-cars-busted/article34817805.ece

15 June 2021||LINGAMPALLY (SANGAREDDY DISTRICT),TELANGANA||Sangameshwara, Basaveshwara will change face of Sangareddy||Finance Minister T. Harish Rao said that Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao himself proposed both Sangameshwara and Basaveshwara lift irrigation schemes for Sangareddy district to provide irrigation to every nook and corner of the district. He said that the Godavari will be lifted from 70 metres height and Kaleshwaram to 665 metres at Mogudampally. “Erstwhile Medak district remained drought prone for several decades and the previous Congress or TDP governments failed to address the issue. Our Chief Minister, who visited every part of the district, designed these two projects to bring Kaleshwaram water to address the problems of farmers. The project will cover 230 villages spread in 11 mandals. The main canal will be 165 kilometres while distributories will be for about 830 kilometres,” said Mr. Harish Rao while addressing a public meeting held here on Monday after formally inaugurating survey works of Sangameshwara Lift Irrigation Scheme (SLIS). Council Pro-tem Speaker V. Bhoopal Reddy, Lok Sabha member B.B. Patil, MLAs Ch. Kranthi Kiran (Andol), T. Jayapraksh Reddy (Sangareddy), M. Manick Rao (Zaheerabad), MLC Fareeduddin, Z.P. Chairperson P. Manjusree, Collector M Hanumantha Rao and others were present on the occasion. “There was a saying and belief that Ganga water from Kashi will flow here at Sangameshwara temple tank at Jarasangam and people will sprinkle that water on their heads. We are bringing Godavari from Kaleshwaram and it will join Ganga here. This is being made possible by Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao,” said Mr Harish Rao adding that foundation for the project will be laid by the Chief Minister once the survey report is submitted, and accepted by the government. He said that though the survey agency was given 90 days to submit the report, he has requested the agency to complete it within 60 or 70 days so that works can commence at the earliest. He said that all the tanks, including Mahabubsagar in the district headquarters, will be filled with Godavari water. The programme was presided over by Mr. Kranthi Kiran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sangameshwara-basaveshwara-will-change-face-of-sangareddy/article34817818.ece
15 June 2021||M. Rajeevhyderabad,TELANGANA||State to raise Rs. 3,000 cr from borrowings||The State has decided to opt for enhanced open market borrowings through Reserve Bank of India to meet its immediate financial commitments on account of flagship scheme Rythu Bandhu as also implementation of the revised pay scales starting July. The government has decided to raise Rs. 3,000 crore more through RBI by way of auction of securities to be conducted on June 15. The State had so far raised Rs. 8,500 crore open market borrowings since the commencement of the current financial year of which Rs. 3,500 crore had been raised during the two auctions conducted on June 1 and 8. The State had already exceeded the projected Rs. 8,000 crore OMB it planned to raise during the first quarter as submitted to the RBI at the end of the previous fiscal. The next tranche of Rs. 3,000 crore would take the State’s OMB to Rs. 11,500 crore, Rs. 3,500 crore more than the amount that had been projected for the current quarter. Borrowings were necessitated by commitments like Rythu Bandhu scheme involving crediting of Rs. 5,000 an acre as investment subsidy into farmers’ accounts for more than two years now. From around 59 lakh initially, the number of farmers eligible under the scheme had increased to 63.25 lakh for the current ‘vaanakalam’ (kharif) entailing an expenditure of Rs. 7,508.78 crore covering 1.5 crore acres across the State. The State government had announced that crediting of amounts would start on June 15 and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was particular that the process be completed before June 25 covering all eligible farmers without fail. Coupled with the expenditure is the implementation of the revised pay scales orders for which had been issued a couple of days ago. The new pay scales with 30% fitment benefit will entail additional expenditure of around Rs. 1,000 crore every month on the State exchequer, according to senior officials. The total revenue collections during the first two months of the current fiscal VAT on petroleum products and Excise as well as GST was in excess of Rs. 8,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-to-raise-rs-3000-cr-from-borrowings/article34817811.ece
15 June 2021||SURYAPET,TELANGANA||‘KCR’s drive against spurious seed limited to statements’||Pradesh Congress Committee president and Member of Parliament from Nalgonda N. Uttam Kumar Reddy on Monday alleged that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s instructions for action against those selling spurious seed/fertilizer were only limited to statements. “While they said PD Act cases would be booked against violators, in Chintalapalem mandal, where spurious seed worth several crores was recovered, police are hesitant to summon ‘many elders’ who are allegedly involved,” he said. The Congress leader was participating in the Huzurnagar Municipal Council meet, where he demanded that the accused, irrespective of party affiliation, be arrested immediately. He said the Congress party would take up an agitation if the government remains lukewarm in its approach. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy also took objection to including the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) funds in the municipal agenda. He stuck to his protest he made in January 2021 that the District Collector was misusing his powers, in the name of ‘emergency’ and using up the municipal fund without the Council’s resolution. He said the body was independent and demanded transparency in management of all the accounts.  Police are hesitant to summon many elders who are allegedly involved. N.

15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Summer effect at Singhu: farmers start collecting milk from villages||With the summer at its peak, the availability of milk for consumption of protesting farmers has gone down. They have now resorted to collecting the dairy product from other villages. Why the shortage? Komaldeep Singh Cheema, a resident of Doaba, has been a part of the protest since the beginning. He said because of summers, the cattle are producing less milk and is leading to a limited supply from Haryana. As a result, Mr. Cheema and a few others from the district, have decided to collect milk for the consumption of farmers at the protest. “Those from Punjab don’t prefer packaged or powdered milk. Most of them fall sick if they consume it. This essentially has made us decide to take up this initiative,” he said. Mr. Komaldeep said announcements are being made in five villages since June 2, asking people to donate milk for the protesters. “Some people gave a litre while others gave 2. Some even donated litres, and some gave a bucket full of milk. In one of the five villages, people donated more than 450 litres,” he added. Milk collected over four days was kept in an ice-making unit for preservation. The group then started for Singhu border from Doaba on June 6. “We finally collected 750 litres, put it in a water tanker with lots of ice, and covered it with wet sacks,” he said. At the protest site, they drive across the lengthy stretch distributing milk to people and those running langar services. The kheer langar, which was running for months, stopped a while ago because of milk shortage and also the dishes being perishable. The group made two rounds from the villages to Singhu and is set to make its third round to the protest site. Mr. Komaldeep said that after she shared his initiative on social media, people from Canada and the UK have called him to extend help. Help pours in “A man called me from the UK and asked how we were transporting the milk. When I explained we were taking it in water tankers, he said he’ll send Rs. 1.5 lakh for a special tanker to be built for milk. Another person called from Canada and extended help for unlimited petrol for the journey,” Mr. Cheema said. Another initiative taken at the protest site is Kisan Express, a trolley fitted with seats for people to be transported from their lodging to the stage. The initiative was taken by Life Care Foundation, Kisan Aid, and Swach Kisan Morcha. “The reason Kisan Express has been started is to increase the number of people coming to the stage area. Because of heat and mostly the elderly staying here, it became important for them to have a vehicle for commute,” said Avtar Singh, who runs a makeshift hospital at the protest site. He added that the battery rickshaw was proving to be expensive and less efficient.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/summer-effect-at-singhu-farmers-start-collecting-milk-from-villages/article34817783.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Around 200 commuters fined daily for violating norms||In the past one week, since the resumption of metro services in the Capital, the daily average of the number of people fined for violation of COVID-19 norms stood at 203 while 158 people on an average were counselled per day to follow the protocol while travelling on the Delhi Metro network. Services on the network had remained suspended for nearly a month due to the raging second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following certain relaxations on curbs, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) resumed services from June 7. According to data provided by the DMRC to The Hindu , between June 7 and June 13, a total of 1,422 commuters were fined and 1,103 people counselled even as the Delhi Metro continued to operate at 50% capacity. The highest number of fines levied due to commuters not wearing masks was 288 on June 11, followed by 253 and 251 people on June 12 and June 10 respectively. On June 9, two days after the resumption of services, the number of people fined for being without masks stood at 224 while on June 7, at least 86 commuters were fined for the same. Random checks Flying squads deployed by the DMRC carry out random checks for violations and either levy fines or counsel the commuters, according to officials. The highest number of people counselled, on a single day in the past week, was 209 on June 12 followed by 189 passengers on June 11 and 170 passengers on June 9. June 7, the first day of resumption had seen 106 commuters being counselled by officials to follow COVID-19 protocol. Even though resumption of services was permitted last week by authorities, metro trains continue to run at half the capacity in a bid to contain the virus transmission. Due to the reduced capacity, only 25 passengers are permitted inside coaches at any given point, according to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation officials, while adding that standing passengers are not allowed inside coaches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/around-200-commuters-fined-daily-for-violating-norms/article34817770.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi govt.’s claim on ONORC misleading, Centre tells SC||The Central government maintained in the Supreme Court that the Delhi government’s claim to have launched ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ (ONORC) scheme was “misleading”. “The claim of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi regarding launch of One Nation One Ration Card [ONORC] plan in NCT of Delhi is misleading, as they claim to have implemented it only in circle 63 Seemapuri. Only a handful of transactions conducted in a single circle with about 42 electronic points of sale (ePOS) machines cannot be considered as implementation of ONORC,” the Centre submitted before the court. The Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, observed that the implementation of the ONORC would require national portability transactions to be rolled out formally in all the fair price shops of all the circles of Delhi in which more than 2,000 ePoS (electronic point of sale) machines had been supplied and were waiting for operation. “It is pertinent to appreciate that a very large number of inter-State migrants are present across Delhi, such as migrant workers, street dwellers, ragpickers, migratory labourers, construction workers, rickshaw pullers, auto/taxi drivers, and others, who do not have access to their National Food Security Act food grains,” the Centre said. None of these economically marginalised population, who were away from their native villages and towns, were able to access their quota of subsidised food commodities assured to them under the Food Security Act, it stated. “There is no full implementation of the ONORC and reporting of such transactions/distribution details of NFSA/PMGKAY food grains on the central portals/dashboards,” it noted. The onus of implementing the ONORC was on the States. While most States were implementing it, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and West Bengal have not yet integrated into the scheme. Their integration would depend on their “technical readiness” to implement the portability of ration cards, it pointed out. The Centre’s submissions came despite Delhi’s stand that it was implementing the ONORC scheme. Recently, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey had written to the Delhi government to resume the use of ePoS machines at ration shops. He said at least 10 lakh migrant workers, who had ration cards in their home States, would be able to access subsidised food grains in the Capital. Ration card portability under the ONORC scheme is dependent on ePoS machines, as they use Aadhaar-linked biometric authentication to verify the identity and entitlement of beneficiaries even if they are not registered at that particular shop. Delhi had suspended the use of ePoS in early 2018, after widespread complaints of poor network leading to authentication failures and exclusion of genuine beneficiaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-govts-claim-on-onorc-misleading-centre-tells-sc/article34817777.ece
15 June 2021||New Delhi,||AAP claims scam in Ram mandir land purchase||AAP leader Manish Sisodia and party MP Sanjay Singh on Monday alleged that there is a “big scam” in the land bought for Ram mandir by Ram Janmabhoomi Trust. “BJP had duped 115 crore followers of Hindutva within minutes under the name of Prabhu Shri Ram,” said Mr. Sisodia. He said that Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust bought 12,080 square meters of land worth Rs. 18.5 crore on March 18. “The land was bought from Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari in the presence of Anil Mishra and BJP Mayor of Ayodhya Rishikesh Upadhyaya, who are members of this trust. Many citizens donated money towards the establishment of Ram mandir, whether it was a farmer who took out some donation from their earnings or a labourer who used up his earnings to donate,” Mr. Sisodia said. “But Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari had bought the same land from Harish Pathak and Kusum Pathak five minutes before for Rs. 2 crore. In five minutes, Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari surprisingly sold it for Rs. 18.5 crore to the trust. In both these transactions, Anil Mishra and BJP Mayor of Ayodhya Rishikesh Upadhyay were witnesses,” he said. Defrauded 115 cr. people Mr. Sisodia claimed that Ram bhakts were of the belief that their hard-earned donations for Ram temple will be used in the creation of the temple, but they have all been disappointed with the “fraud BJP”. “Five people, within five minutes, defrauded 115 crore Hindus,” he added. “Can land price increase from Rs. 2 crore to Rs. 18.5 crore within a matter of 5 minutes? People donated money to be a part of the creation of a resplendent Ram temple, but BJP has just made a joke of their faith and their trust. This land scam is a clear show of corruption and it is a black day for all Prabhu Shri Ram followers,” the AAP leader said. Sanjay Singh claimed that BJP leaders have defended all those involved in the “scam”. “BJP leaders should now come to light and announce how much they have earned through this scam and it is crystal clear that BJP leader and Mayor of Ayodhya have a big role to play. Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust should give a full account of the money received through donations by people,” Mr. Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/aap-claims-scam-in-ram-mandir-land-purchase/article34817775.ece

The mission of both the programmes is a mapping of schoolchildren, Mr. Sisodia said. “Through the YYE programme, our children would be able to receive adequate guidance from a young generation that has been through a similar process.

However, the State government has been maintaining Nayagarh’s COVID-19 death-toll at 59, combining fatalities of both first and second waves,” Congress leader Nishinkant Mishra told a press conference. Mr. Mishra said Nayagarh’s actual deaths got exposed when the internal communication of inclusion of pandemic victims found its way to public domain.  Special audit sought “The government document says 117 persons died of COVID-19 between April 28 and June 10,” said the Congress leader. Demanding a special audit of all COVID-19 deaths in the State, the Congress said there was no harm in making the actual death figure public. Alleging that under-reporting of deaths was deliberate, Mr. Mishra said the government must own responsibility for mismanaging the pandemic as many people in rural areas were left to die without the robust healthcare system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/under-reporting-of-virus-deaths-in-odisha/article34817790.ece
15 June 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Badal not to appear before SIT tomorrow in Kotkapura case||Former Punjab Chief Minister and Shiromani Akali Dal patron Parkash Singh Badal will not be appearing before the Special Investigating Team (SIT), probing the 2015 Kotkapura police firing incident, due to health reason. Mr. Badal has been summoned by the SIT at a resthouse in Mohali on June 16. In a letter to the SIT chairman, Mr. Badal said that he was committed to fully cooperate with the law and that he had complete faith in the judiciary. He had, however, asked the SIT “to reschedule the date for his appearance for the investigations as he was not keeping good health and had been advised complete bed rest for ten days by doctors.” The former Chief Minister said that as soon as his health gets better he would be available to join the investigation as per law. Mr. Badal added that he was hopeful that “the newly set-up SIT, unlike the previous one, would respect the law of the land and conduct a fair investigation, withstanding political interference from the ruling dispensation.” In his two-page response to the summon from the SIT, Mr. Badal said that “the entire process of investigations already stands brazenly compromised through blatant and unapologetic political interference and it reeks too strongly of political vendetta to inspire any confidence about a fair process of law being followed.” The Akali Dal leader pointed out that the very need for the present SIT had “arisen out of the brazen politicisation of the case by the previous SIT.” In this regard, Mr. Badal came down heavily against one of the members of the previous SIT for his “openly political conduct” which had allegedly subverted the entire investigative process. SIT role questioned “With a callous and contemptuous disregard for all the established procedures and norms, this officer completely usurped and appropriated to himself the entire functioning and designated role of all the other members of the SIT, including it Chairman, and rendered them totally redundant and they were reportedly not even a part of the investigative process,” said Mr. Badal. Mr. Badal said that the findings of the previous SIT had been scripted jointly by half a dozen high profile members of the ruling party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/badal-not-to-appear-before-sit-tomorrow-in-kotkapura-case/article34817787.ece
15 June 2021||Chandigarh,||Punjab AAP protests ‘scam’ in scholarships for Dalit students||The Aam Aadmi Party workers and leaders on Monday staged a protest close to the official residence of Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh against alleged irregularities in the post-matric scholarship scheme for Dalit students. AAP’s Harpal Singh Cheema, the Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly led the protesters, who were prevented from reaching the CM’s residence. Mr. Cheema alleged that Congress government had squandered huge amount of money meant for scholarships of two lakh Dalit students, jeopardizing their future. “At the behest of the government, the police administration has violated our constitutional right to protest, but we will continue our struggle and the AAP workers would go on hunger strike on June 15 in front of the offices of Deputy Commissioners in all the districts across the State,” he said.  ‘Register case’ Mr. Cheema said AAP’s struggle would continue until a police case was registered against the wrongdoers under Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Senior AAP leader Manwinder Singh Giaspura said the investigation report submitted by senior IAS officer Kirpa Shankar Saroj on the alleged post-matric scholarship scam revealed that the scholarships were given to fake colleges. “As a result, genuine private colleges have not received funds and lakhs of Dalit students have been deprived of their right to education,” he said. Deputy Leader of Opposition Saravjit Kaur Manuke, said “while the government has embezzled the scholarship money of Dalit students, it has also discriminated in giving jobs to Dalit youth and promotions to employees.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/punjab-aap-protests-scam-in-scholarships-for-dalit-students/article34817789.ece

The orphans will get an ex gratia of Rs. 1 lakh each, followed by a financial assistance every month. Commission chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said here on Monday though the pandemic had affected all sections during the last one year, children in the rural areas had borne the brunt because of poverty and vulnerability. Coupled with the child labour, the pandemic had brought havoc to children. Ms. Beniwal said at a virtual event here that the community participation at the grassroots would help eradicate child labour and extend relief to the children affected by the pandemic. Banswara-based Vaagdhara group, which is working on the livelihood issues in the tribal areas, organised the event, attended by social activists and child rights volunteers. As part of the Chief Minister’s Corona Baal Kalyan Yojana, the children who lost their parents will get, besides the ex gratia, Rs. 2,500 a month till they attain 18 years of age.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/covid-child-rights-panel-to-identify-children-for-relief/article34817791.ece
15 June 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra govt. yet to compensate tribal artists for missing paintings||Tribal artists have been waiting for over three years for compensation from the Maharashtra government after its Tribal Development Department (TDD) allegedly lost their paintings worth Rs. 20.79 lakh displayed at an international exhibition in Malaysia in June 2018. The Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts had organised 16th World Indian Festival - 2018 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between June 9 and 17, 2018. The State’s TDD had displayed hand-made products and paintings from tribal artisans for which a number of officials from the department visited Malaysia along with artists. “On their return, the artists found that several of their paintings missing. Artist Swapna Pawar wrote to the department informing that her 17 paintings were missing. Similarly, paintings from tribal artists in Dahanu could not be found,” said Rajendra Maraskolhe, president, Organisation for Rights of Tribals, Nagpur. The cost of those paintings was Rs. 7.90 lakh. Similarly, Sachin Satvi of the Adivasi Yuva Seva Sangh from Dahanu in Palghar district too informed the State government that framed and unframed canvass paintings by tribal artisans worth Rs. 12,89,700 were missing. 2018 meeting A meeting was called in November 2018 as artists did neither receive payment nor the paintings. As per the minutes of the meeting, attended by senior officials from the TDD, it was decided to take action against two organisations — Agenda Suriya and Purvi Fashion — and to write to the Indian consulate in Malaysia to take action against SAG Logistics, responsible for movement of boxes. It was also decided to take a ‘positive decision’ on compensating artists who lost paintings worth lakhs. These artists were to also get priority for future exhibitions. “Not a single promise has been fulfilled in three years. The companies against whom action was to be taken were given their payment. Artists were not sent to exhibitions and they have received no compensation,” said Mr. Satvi. Mr. Maraskolhe said artists must get their money with 12% interest. “A criminal case needs to be filed against those guilty for this harassment,” he demanded. A reminder to take action as decided in the was sent to the TDD in May 2018. Ms. Pawar too had written to the department last month.  The Hindu tried to call TDD Minister K.C. Padvi which went unanswered. The department’s secretary, Anupkumar Yadav, did not respond till the time of writing the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-govt-yet-to-compensate-tribal-artists-for-missing-paintings/article34817875.ece

15 June 2021||Pune,||Maratha quota: Royals close ranks, warn MVA leaders of resentment||Influential Maratha community leaders and fellow royals, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati and Udayanaraje Bhosale, both direct descendants of Chhatrapati Shivaji, closed ranks over the Maratha reservation issue at a rare meeting in Pune on Monday. Both leaders, who are BJP MPs, warned the ruling Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leadership in Maharashtra of the simmering resentment among the Maratha youth, while adding that they would not be in a position to restrain the restive community in the event of “violent protests”. “Since the Supreme Court had scrapped the reservation last month by citing that the Maratha community did not fall in the ‘backward category’, there are only two ways forward: file a review petition and then a curative petition. But since the process of forming a committee again, which will submit its recommendations to the Governor who will refer the matter to the President and so on, is long and cumbersome, the State government must immediately try and extend Other Backward Class [OBC] benefits to the poorer sections of the Maratha community. The government can consider using supernumerary methods of providing jobs to the youth,” Mr. Chhatrapati said. While both royals exhorted every MLA and MP in Maharashtra to clarify their stance on the issue, Mr. Bhosale said the onus of resolving the issue was with the State government. Criticising both the State and Central leadership for not practising issue-based politics, Mr. Bhosale urged the State government to call a special session of the Assembly to debate the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maratha-quota-royals-warn-mva-leaders-of-resentment/article34817498.ece
15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||A year on, unanswered questions on Galwan clash||A year after the June 15, 2020 clash in the Galwan Valley, China’s official accounts of what led to the worst violence on the India-China border since 1967 still leave many questions unanswered, revealing few and selective details that appear aimed at conveying a carefully crafted message to the domestic audience. While Chinese officials have said repeatedly in recent months “the rights and wrongs are clear” of what led to the LAC tensions, Indian officials say Beijing is, in fact, yet to provide any clarity or credible explanation of its actions last year, starting with mobilising a large number of troops in April following annual military exercises and deploying them close to the LAC, not just in Galwan Valley. That mobilisation in April, coming at a time when India had to delay its own summer exercises because of the COVID-19 outbreak, is one of several key missing details in China’s official accounts so far. A reading of all of China’s public statements issued in the year since the Galwan clash underlines a two-fold approach in Beijing’s messaging: a focus only on the Galwan Valley with little to no mention of the other troubled spots on the LAC, where PLA transgressions led to multiple stand-offs, and since February this year, a more proactive propaganda effort aimed at emphasising the bravery of China’s troops in Galwan and portraying Beijing not as the aggressor, but as defending its sovereignty. Since this year, China has also firmly clamped down on any questioning of the official narrative. Earlier this month, Chinese authorities sentenced Qiu Ziming, one of at least half a dozen people who have been detained over comments on Galwan, to eight months in prison “for defaming martyrs”. Mr. Qiu had questioned why India had promptly recognised the loss of 20 Indian soldiers in Galwan Valley but China was yet to fully reveal casualties, with the first announcement of honours coming only eight months later. Sparse details In the past year, China has issued two detailed statements on the LAC, a “step-by-step account” from the Foreign Ministry on June 19, 2020 and accounts in February 2021 published in the official PLA Daily after the Chinese government revealed it had suffered casualties as it announced military honours for five soldiers, four of them recognised posthumously. The first Chinese account of tensions came in the Communist Party-run Global Times on May 18, which said Chinese troops had “bolstered border control measures and made necessary moves in response to India’s recent, illegal construction of defence facilities across the border into Chinese territory in the Galwan Valley region”. The June 19 statement from the Chinese government said “since April, the Indian border troops have unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities at the LAC in the Galwan Valley.” It referred to the early morning of May 6 as the start of more serious tensions, alleging the Indian troops had “crossed the LAC by night”. Indian officials said the reverse had happened: that Indian troops had since April been prevented from reaching Patrolling Point 14, which they go up to every summer, and that construction of facilities had taken place on India’s side of PP14. Satellite images later released suggested the June 15 clash had happened near PP14. Most Indian patrolling points lie short of the LAC on India’s side. Video release In February, the announcement of military honours for five soldiers was accompanied by the release of a video on Chinese state media from Galwan Valley. The video clips, which triggered an outpouring of anger in China, showed Indian soldiers crossing the river and Chinese troops holding their ground. The message was to show India as the aggressor, which is the widely prevailing view in China. Left unsaid was the context of the video, in which Indian troops were trying to push back Chinese troops who had come up to PP14. On June 11, in the lead up to the one-year anniversary of the clash, which also comes just two weeks before China is planning a major military parade to mark the centenary of the Communist Party on July 1, state broadcaster CCTV interviewed Qi Fabao, the regimental commander who was among the five honoured in February. Mr. Qi spoke at a military meeting, appearing with “the scar on his head clearly seen”, the Global Times reported. Chen Hongjun, one of the four soldiers who was named as being killed in the clash, will be among 29 people honoured with a medal on the July 1 anniversary. The continued focus on Galwan, while the still unresolved tensions in Depsang, Demchok, Gogra and Hot Springs, remain almost entirely ignored in the coverage, is one key element of the broader messaging effort, as acknowledging multiple stand-offs, as well as the fact that it is India and not China that is demanding a return to status quo in the slow-moving negotiations, would undermine the Chinese military’s central claim of not being the aggressor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/a-year-on-unanswered-questions-on-galwan-clash/article34817237.ece
15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||The reign of ‘Bibi’ is over, for now||Supporters call him ‘King Bibi of Israel’. Detractors deride his right-wing politics, polarising leadership and bellicose foreign policy. But Benjamin Netanyahu has been a domineering presence in Israel’s politics for more than three decades. On Sunday, his illustrious political career suffered a major setback when a coalition formed by his former protégés proved majority in the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, bringing an end to Mr. Netanyahu’s 12 years of consecutive rule. Arguably, no politician has managed to influence Israel’s domestic and foreign policies as much as Mr. Netanyahu has done in the new century. He ruled from the right, made alliances with a host of Jewish orthodox parties, took a harder line towards the Palestinians, expanded the Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories, repeatedly bombed Gaza, clashed with the Obama administration over the Iran deal, took Israel’s covert and overt operations to Iran and Syria, made peace with four Arab countries and clung on to power despite repeated failures to form a stable government since 2019. Even after the ‘change’ coalition was formed under the leadership of centrist politician Yair Lapid and right-wing leader Naftali Bennett, Mr. Netanyahu tried till the last moment to subvert government formation. And after it became certain that Mr. Bennett would be elected Prime Minister on Sunday, in the Knesset, he threatened to “topple the dangerous left-wing government”. The message is clear — Mr. Netanyahu is already plotting a comeback. Opposition to Oslo talks Born in Israel and brought up partly in the U.S., Mr. Netanyahu, like most Israelis, served in the military in the 1970s, along with his brother Yonatan Netanyahu. Yonatan was killed in 1976, at age 30, during an operation to rescue hostages held at Uganda’s Entebbe Airport. Mr. Netanyahu rose to fame in the 1980s when he was posted as Israel’s Ambassador to the UN. A fluent speaker in English with an East Coast accent, he was a regular presence in American TV shows during that time. After returning to Israel, he plunged into politics, in 1988, in the midst of the First Intifada by the Palestinians. Mr. Netanyahu built a political career by opposing the Oslo peace process in the early 1990s. In 1993, when he was 43, Mr. Netanyahu became the leader of Likud. He lambasted the Oslo Accords, attended right-wing rallies held to oppose the peace policies of Labor Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and continued to call Yasser Arafat a terrorist. When Rabin was assassinated in November 1995 by a Jewish extremist, many critics said Mr. Netanyahu’s hyperbole speeches at rallies where crowds chanted “death to Rabin” fuelled extremism and incitement. But it did not deter Mr. Netanyahu. In 1996, he became Israel’s youngest Prime Minister. Under his watch, the Oslo process slowed down. After losing power in 1999, he was in the wilderness briefly when Labour leader Ehud Barak revived the peace process. But the 2000 Camp David summit failed. Palestinian territories erupted into the Second Intifada. When Liku came back to power, Mr. Netanyahu played second fiddle to Ariel Sharon. But the party came into his hands when Sharon left Likud in 2005 to form Kadima. As Likud chief, he sat in the Opposition. It was during this period that Mr. Bennett joined the Netanyahu team. A U.S.-based entrepreneur, Mr. Bennett became Mr. Netanyahu’s Chief of Staff. Mr. Netanyahu came to power again in 2009. Twelve years later, the same Bennett would dislodge his former boss from power and take his job. In the past, Mr. Netanyahu had mastered the art of survival. But his repeated failure to form a stable government after four elections since 2019 appeared to have weakened the brand of Netanyahu. He is also facing corruption charges. Even the Gaza bombing, which many predicted would help him politically, appears to have backfired as his right-wing allies criticised the ceasefire with Hamas, calling it “a surrender”. Fragile coalition When his grip on Israeli politics finally started loosening up, his political rivals found an opportunity. Mr. Lapid stitched together a coalition of eight parties, from the right-wing Yamina of Mr. Bennett to the Arab Ra’am. This is the first time an Arab party is joining a ruling coalition in the history of Israel. In the Knesset, Mr. Netanyahu has made it clear that he will not give up. He has called the coming together of the diverse parties an “election fraud”. On the other side, the Lapid-Bennett coalition is visibly weak. When Mr. Lapid announced the coalition earlier this month, he had the support of 61 Members of the Knesset (MKs) out of 120. During the vote on June 13, the government got the backing of 60 MKs as against the Opposition’s 59 — one MK from Ra’am abstained. It would be an uphill task for Mr. Bennett to keep his bloc together, especially when sensitive issues such as Jerusalem and Jewish settlements come up. But to begin with, they did what seemed impossible till a few months ago — ousting Mr. Netanyahu from power. For Messrs. Lapid and Bennett, that itself is an achievement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/the-reign-of-bibi-is-over-for-now/article34817240.ece
15 June 2021||Washington,||Novavax announces efficacy of about 90% for its vaccine||U.S. vaccine manufacturer Novavax said its COVID-19 vaccine had shown an overall efficacy of 90.4% in trials in the U.S. and Mexico, potentially adding — in a few months — another vaccine to the world’s arsenal against the disease, which has killed close to 4 million people. Trials have already occurred in the U.K. and South Africa. The Maryland-based company, which tested its two dose ‘NVX-CoV2373’ vaccine on a population of just under 30,000 adults in the U.S. and Mexico, said the jabs provided 100% protection against moderate to severe disease and an overall efficacy of 90.4%. Of the 77 individuals out of 29,960 in the trial who contracted COVID-19, 14 received the actual vaccine, doses of which were spaced three weeks apart, while 63 had received placebos. Ten moderate to severe cases of the disease were observed, but all were confined to the placebo group, the company said. All 14 infections in the vaccinated group were mild. Preliminary data suggest that the vaccine is safe, according to a press release from Novavax. Novavax detected strains of the virus found first in the U.K.,U.S., Brazil, South Africa and India, according to data released by the company during a Monday morning conference call. Vaccine efficacy was 91% in “high-risk “populations (above 65 years of age, or under 65 years with comorbidities or frequent COVID-19 exposure) the company said. Novavax said it plans to apply for authorisations in the third quarter (July-September) and is on track to manufacture 100 million doses a month by the end of September, and 150 million doses a month by the end of 2021. The U.S. has more doses than it will need to vaccinate its entire population and as a result, much of the Novavax vaccine may be used in developing countries. That it can be stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius makes it easier to use in developing countries, where maintaining unbroken cold chains can be challenging. The vaccine works by eliciting an immune response to a prefusion spike protein built from Novavax’s recombinant nanoparticle technology and an adjuvant (a substance that increases immune response). The vaccine is likely to be authorised first in a country other than the U.S., its CEO Stanly Erck said, according to the New York Times . “Many of our first doses will go to... low- and middle-income countries, and that was the goal to begin with,” Mr. Erck told The Associated Press. Novavax has signed an agreement with international vaccine access coalition Gavi, to supply 1.1 billion to low-and middle-income countries. In India, the vaccine is slated to be produced in partnership with the Serum Institute of India (SII), under the name Covavax. Earlier in June, the Drugs Controller General of India had given permission to SII to go ahead with Phase 2/3 trials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/novavax-announces-efficacy-of-about-90-for-its-vaccine/article34817235.ece
15 June 2021||COLOMBO,||EU resolution puts spotlight on Sri Lanka’s rights situation||A recent resolution adopted by the European Parliament, urging the EU Commission to consider temporary withdrawal of the GSP+ status given to Sri Lanka, has put the spotlight back on Sri Lanka’s human rights situation, prompting Colombo to defend its “multifaceted progress” in its response.     Sri Lanka  regained the  GSP +, or the EU’s ‘Generalised Scheme of Preferences’ in 2017, on Colombo’s commitment to implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour conditions, protection of the environment and good governance. The status effectively removes import duties on goods from Sri Lanka entering the EU. The June 10 resolution, expressing “deep concern over Sri Lanka’s alarming path towards the recurrence of grave human rights violations”, makes specific reference to the use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, pointing to arrests of lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah and poet Ahnaf Jazeem, among others, who are in “arbitrary” detention for over a year. The resolution notes the “continuing discrimination” against and violence towards religious and ethnic minorities , while voicing “serious concern” about the 20th Amendment passed in 2020, and the “resulting decline in judiciary independence, the reduction of parliamentary control, and the excessive accumulation of power with the presidency”. Responding, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Ministry on Friday said it regrets the adoption of the resolution that, it observed, “contains factual inaccuracies, and does not take cognisance of the multifaceted progress made by Sri Lanka in reconciliation and development.” Rejecting claims that the PTA is used for arbitrary detentions, the Ministry said it was “revisiting provisions” of the Act to propose “necessary amendments”, drawing upon international best practices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eu-resolution-puts-spotlight-on-sri-lankas-rights-situation/article34817233.ece

In a communique after a three-day summit in England, G7 leaders slammed China over abuses against minorities in the Xinjiang region and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, while U.S. President Joe Biden called for Beijing to “start acting more responsibly in terms of international norms on human rights”. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. responded angrily on Monday. “The Group of Seven (G7) takes advantage of Xinjiang-related issues to engage in political manipulation and interfere in China’s internal affairs, which we firmly oppose,” an Embassy spokesman said in a statement. The statement accused the G7 of “lies, rumours and baseless accusations”. Activists say China has rounded up an estimated one million Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang into internment camps, which Beijing says is to eradicate extremism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-accuses-g7-of-political-manipulation/article34817232.ece
15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||The road from Galwan, a year later||On June 15 last year, the Line of Actual Control (LAC) witnessed its first deaths after 1975 when 20 Indian soldiers and at least four soldiers of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) died in a violent clash in Galwan in Ladakh. An Indian news report (https://bit.ly/3wmUefH) mentioned that around 50 Indian soldiers had been taken captive by the PLA during the clash and released in batches over three days. Although both countries have given gallantry awards to the fallen soldiers, details about the violent incident have not been officially made public so far. Political accountability This is in keeping with the broader approach of the Government where no official briefing or press conference about the situation in Ladakh has taken place in the last 13 months. The ministerial statements in Parliament were monologues with no questions allowed from other representatives of the people. The official excuse was operational security, but the actual reason was to avoid political embarrassment for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Four days after the Galwan clash, Mr. Modi addressed an all-party meet where he unequivocally stated, “ Na koi wahan hamari seema mein ghus aaya hai aur nahi koi ghusa hua hai, na hi hamari koi post kisi dusre ke kabze mein hain ” (No one has intruded and nor is anyone intruding, nor has any post been captured by someone).” A huge public outcry led to an official clarification by the Prime Minister’s Office which contained rhetoric that dodged the offending remarks (https://bit.ly/3vjqoaJ). The Government’s political strategy for dealing with the Ladakh border crisis has been based on dodging, denial and digression. An honest appraisal of the situation in Ladakh would be politically costly for a government led by a “strong” Prime Minister, as PLA soldiers remain in control of what was hitherto in Indian control. Despite the largely supportive news channels, the Government has not been able to convince the public about its version of events. In the recent ‘State of Nation’ poll conducted by C-Voter, 44.8% respondents said the Chinese encroachment in Ladakh was a failure of the Modi government, while only 37.3% said it was not (https://bit.ly/3gmiadA). The crisis in Ladakh erupted months after Mr. Modi had held his second informal summit with the Chinese President Xi Jinping (at Mamallapuram, Tamil Nadu) and weeks after he hosted the then United States President Donald Trump for a political event in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. For someone attributing his foreign policy prowess to the power of his persona and his personal chemistry with other world leaders, there could be no worse rebuttal of his claims than the timing of the Chinese incursions. In a government identified solely with the Prime Minister and dominated by his office — there is no record of the Cabinet Committee on Security being convened to discuss the Ladakh border situation — Mr. Modi is being held responsible in the public imagination for the setback. Military situation The current situation is not militarily precarious in Ladakh. With a continued deployment of 50,000-60,000 soldiers, the Indian Army has been able to hold the line to prevent any further ingress by the PLA. The Chinese presence on the Indian side of the LAC in Gogra, Hot Springs and Demchok gives the PLA some tactical advantage but the area which majorly jolts Indian military plans is the Chinese control of Depsang Plains. With “official sources” trying to palm it off as a legacy issue, despite evidence to the contrary from many retired military officers, the Indian Army has only weakened its negotiating position during the talks with the PLA. In any case, there has been no progress in talks after the disengagement at Pangong lake and Kailash range in February. Outside of Ladakh, the Indian Army remains in an alert mode all along the LAC to prevent any Chinese misadventure but the bigger change has been its reorientation of certain forces from Pakistan border towards the China border. The basis of this shift was articulated by the Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat when he recently said that China is a bigger security threat for India than Pakistan. The Ladakh crisis has also exposed India’s military weakness to tackle a collusive threat from China and Pakistan: to avoid such an eventuality, the Government opened backchannel talks with Pakistan which led to the reiteration of the ceasefire on the Line of Control. External rebalancing The Ladakh crisis has also led the Government to relook external partnerships, particularly with the United States. After his meeting with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar late last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted that they discussed the “India-China border situation”. The Indian side was silent about it but senior U.S. military officials have earlier spoken of the intelligence and logistics support provided to the Indian forces in Ladakh, while the Indian military has sought to learn from the American experience of implementing the Multi Domain Operations (MDO) doctrine to wage a war of the future against a technologically superior PLA. That China is “a larger neighbour, which has got a better force, better technology”, was acknowledged by General Rawat recently, to argue that India will “obviously prepare for a larger neighbour”. The military importance of the Quad remains moot, with India reportedly refusing to do joint naval patrolling with the U.S. in the South China Sea; the two treaty allies of the U.S., Japan and Australia, also refused. Moreover, India’s focus on its land borders and its limited resources for military modernisation in a period of economic decline impinge on its maritime ambitions in the Indo-Pacific. Balancing act Even as India has tried to talk tough with Beijing and shown greater interest in the Quad, its attempts to counter the burgeoning Chinese influence in the neighbourhood have faltered, exacerbated by the mishandling of the second wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic. With the widening power gap between New Delhi and Beijing, the challenge is as much economic as it is geopolitical. Despite the border crisis and the Indian restrictions on Chinese technology companies, China displaced the U.S. to be India’s biggest trade partner in 2020-21, up to nearly 13% of India’s total trade compared to 10.4% a year ago (https://bit.ly/3cFydRs). For the Modi government, it has been a difficult balancing act between its domestic rhetoric and external reality. Even though India has been dependent on China for medical equipment to fight the pandemic and asked for assured supplies, the Government has been reluctant to publicly acknowledge this dependence: it underplayed Mr. Xi’s  message to Mr. Modi offering support and assistance. It has asked Beijing to grant visas to Indian students and businesspersons but has refused medical aid or Chinese vaccines. Simultaneously, New Delhi has placed the border issue at the centre of the relationship with China, arguing that there can be no normalcy without restoration of status quo ante at the borders. Unappetising choices For the past few decades, Indian planners operated on the premise that their diplomats will be able to manage the Chinese problem without it developing into a full-blown military crisis. That belief has been laid to rest. Militarily, Chinese incursions in Ladakh have shown that the idea of deterrence has failed. A return to the status quo ante of April 2020 remains a mirage with the Chinese side refusing to engage meaningfully after February. New Delhi has learnt that it can no longer have simultaneous competition and cooperation with Beijing; the dramatic engagement that started with Rajiv Gandhi’s historic visit to China in 1988 is over. The bouquet of choices before the Modi government is not appetising. A new reset in bilateral ties, àla the early 1990s, is difficult because China is now in a different league, competing with the U.S. India will never be comfortable taking sides in a new Cold War between the U.S. and China, as it has always valued its strategic sovereignty. Beijing seems as keen as New Delhi to avoid a military conflict, though accidents such as Galwan can never be ruled out. That leaves India with the daunting task of living with this tense and uneasy calm with China for some time, a challenge brought to the fore by the Ladakh crisis. The events of the past one year have significantly altered India’s thinking towards China. The relationship is at the crossroads now. The choices made in New Delhi will have a significant impact on the future of global geopolitics.

15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||The ideas that Satyajit Ray couldn’t film||Satyajit Ray is universally admired for his cinematic creations. However, to understand his mind, it may be worthwhile to reflect on the literary ideas that he could not transform on celluloid. Some are well known — The Alien, A Passage to India and the Mahabharata . But there were many more which only the Ray aficionados are aware of. Fortunately, the essays and letters of Ray and his son Sandip; the biographies by Marie Seton ( Portrait of A Director , 1971) and Andrew Robinson ( Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye , 1989); Suresh Jindal’s My Adventures with Satyajit Ray — The Making of Shatranj Ke Khilari (2017), Nasreen Munni Kabir’s Conversations with Waheeda Rehman (2014); and articles by Bangladeshi photojournalist Amanul Haque and others throw some light on the subject. An idea about aliens Based on his own story and ideas, and encouraged by the famous author Arthur C. Clarke, Ray drafted the screenplay of his sci-fi film The Alien in 1967. Columbia Pictures agreed to produce it with Peter Sellers in an Indian role. Steve McQueen was contacted and even Robert Redford considered, and the Indian cast was almost finalised. Columbia even advanced some money for the project. However, there were many unexpected twists and turns, as recounted by Ray in “Ordeals of the Alien” ( The Statesman , October 4 and 5, 1980), and the project had to be abandoned. Ray wrote to Sellers: “Dear Peter, if you wanted a bigger part Why, you should have told me so right at the start. By declining at this juncture You have simply punctured The Alien balloon, Which I daresay would be grounded soon Causing a great deal of dismay To Satyajit Ray.” The project was revived later, but by then Steven Spielberg’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was released (1982), with ‘striking parallels’ noticed by Clarke and others. Ray held, as Robinson quotes, that E.T. “would not have been possible without my script of The Alien being available throughout America in mimeographed copies”. However, Spielberg commented, “Tell Satyajit I was a kid in high school when his script was circulating in Hollywood’. Despite advice, Ray did not pursue the matter further. His depiction, as communicated to Jindal, that the aliens were “benign by nature, small and acceptable to children, possessed of certain supernatural powers, not physical strength but other kinds of powers, particular types of vision, and that they take interest in earthly things” was indeed influential. The West’s image of India Ray met E.M. Forster at Cambridge in 1966 with the intention to film A Passage to India . Robinson quotes Ray, “… but he knew my name. He kept shaking his head much of the time which meant that he didn’t want the book to be filmed. That was the drone — no! — in words, gestures, looks, everything. He was adamant. And I felt there was no point in asking why.” Later, much after Forster’s death, Ray was approached in 1980 by the trustees at King’s College, but by then he had lost interest in the subject. David Lean’s version (1984), understandably, could not satisfy Ray — “… The whole thing is too picturesque… For me none of the characters come alive… Peggy Ashcroft’s performance notwithstanding…” In a famous essay “Under Western Eyes” ( Sight & Sound , Autumn 1982), Ray had touched upon the limitations of the West’s interest in India and how its views were often distorted and unreal, sometimes even with “grotesque stereotypes as Hurree Jamset Ram Singh…” He ended, “Slighted for so long, India will not yield up her secrets to the West so easily…” It is a pity that A Passage... could not be filmed by Ray. All on paper The Mahabharata fascinated Ray from his early childhood. From the late fifties he had been planning to film it. But in what language? “How to introduce even the main characters to a non-Indian audience?” At one time, he intended to cast Dilip Kumar, Toshiro Mifune and others. Ray was interested in the dice game part. More than the war, it was the exploration of personal relationships between the characters that appealed to him cinematically. In jest, he once told Jindal, “I gave up, because I couldn’t imagine Kirk Douglas playing Arjuna.” Waheeda Rehman, who acted in Ray’s Abhijan (1962), said that Ray had been keen to adapt R.K. Narayan’s The Guide and had contacted her for the female lead. As she observed, the approach and treatment of the film would have been entirely different under Ray’s direction. But then we would have missed the Bollywood blockbuster. There were many Bengali film ideas that Ray had nurtured at some point or the other, as detailed by Sandip Ray in Ananya Satyajit (1998)  and others. Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay’s Rajasimha (with Balraj Sahni) and Devi Chaudhurani (with Suchitra Sen), Saratchandra Chattopadhyay’s Mahesh , Bibhutibhusan Bandyopadhyay’s Drabamayeer Kashibash and Ichhamati , Manik Bandyopadhyay’s Padma Nadir Majhi, Mahasweta Devi’s Bichhan, Buddhadeva Bose’s Ekti Jiban , Prafulla Roy’s Ram Charitra , Shibram Chakraborty’s Debotar Jonmo , Banaphool’s Kichhukshan , Bangladeshi writer Shahed Ali’s Jibrailer Dana and Selina Hossain’s Hangor Nodi Grenade were thought of. For a variety of reasons, including non-availability of actors (Chunibala Devi and Suchitra Sen, for example), these ideas had to be abandoned at different stages. According to Sandip, his father moved on with his work, never regretting what could not be pursued. Ray was approached by Indira Gandhi to make a documentary on Jawaharlal Nehru for whom he had admiration. Besides, in a letter of June 1, 1978, Ray wrote to Jindal about the proposals he had been requested to consider “… (a) documentary on Rajasthani music for French TV… (b) a 3-part film for BBC (each 90 minutes long) on any subject or subjects of my choice… (c) a proposal from UNO to make a film on ‘the horrors & miseries of war’, for worldwide TV screening… (d) a revival of The Alien under a major U.S. company backing with an updated script and a new title…” UNICEF approached him for a film on child labour. Ray was also interested in the operatic form of Balmiki-Pratibha , and documentaries on notables like Radhanath Sikdar who first calculated the world’s highest mountain peak. None of these eventually took off for reasons not publicly known. Conscious of what’s happening all around, Ray was immersed in ideas. A storyteller, both in celluloid and print, he was always assessing the cinematic potential of literary sources that ignited his imagination. Now, on the occasion of Ray’s 100th birth anniversary celebrations, it is for the researchers to probe and delve into the available material in order to fathom why many of these ideas couldn’t get transported to the medium of cinema.

15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Unlocking war histories with a purpose||Saturday’s announcement by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on archiving, declassifying and compiling of war histories (https://bit.ly/3zroOqL) is a long overdue initiative that signals that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is at last willing to shed its shroud of confidentiality over happenings long gone by. Largely conforming to global practices, the policy has the potential to kick-start multiple initiatives within the MoD and the three services that will offer researchers, analysts and historians an easy lens into studying military operations in the post-Independence period. Interlinked challenges Drawing on my own experiences of nine years as a practitioner-historian who has struggled to put together two definitive historical and joint narratives of war and conflict in contemporary India, conversion of this policy into deliverables will be a tough and unglamorous grind. The four biggest challenges facing this initiative will be the fusion of political directives and strategic decision making with the operational and tactical happenings on ground; compilation and reconciling and analysis of events at multiple levels (headquarters, commands and field formations); putting together a team of dedicated researchers and historians with a mix of academics and practitioners with access to records and files; and lastly, putting together a concurrent oral history and digitisation of all archival compilations associated with this initiative. Decisions to go to war and wage conflict in democracies are largely political decisions and it is important that such decisions are fused into compilations of war histories. For example, one of the reasons why the Indian Army is reluctant to declassify the Henderson Brooks Report that considered operational failures during the 1962 war with China is because it is largely a scathing indictment of the Indian Army’s leadership without any accountability assigned to the political establishment led by Jawaharlal Nehru and Krishna Menon. On the other hand, several histories of the Vietnam War can now be considered credible and well-rounded because researchers have had access not only to operational accounts but also to archived discussions between the political architects of the conflict such as Presidents J.F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and Defence Secretary Robert S. McNamara. Similarly, General K. Sundarji and Ambassador J.N. Dixit have borne the brunt of much criticism by researchers examining India’s intervention in Sri Lanka from 1987-1990 because they expressed themselves in the open domain without fear. But it is only when researchers get access to records of discussions involving other generals, admirals and air marshals and even Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Minister of State for Defence Arun Singh and even political heavyweights in Tamil Nadu such as M.G. Ramachandran and M. Karunanidhi, that the cobwebs around Operation Pawan will be cleared. On ‘Brasstacks’ ‘Most military historians of contemporary India agree that Exercise Brasstacks (1986-87) heralded the transformation of Indian war fighting doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures in conventional war fighting, particularly in the plains and the desert. However, all of them, including this writer, have relied on oral recollections to put together a mosaic of what may have transpired in the confines of the Military Operations (MO) Directorate of the Army HQ and thereafter. Writing the official history of Exercise Brasstacks must be high on the list of the initial projects in this initiative as it will highlight the fusion of decisions taken at multiple headquarters right down to the regiment and squadron level. The right approach needed Notwithstanding the effort taken to put together official histories of the 1965 and 1971 wars, these are considered as safe histories that only scratch the surface of strategic decision making, operational analyses, leadership and lessons for the future. The reason for this is the absence of robust multi-disciplinary teams that are required to put together each such history and the desire to bring out non-controversial documents. While highlighting controversies and failures must not be an obsession with such initiatives, it is only a robust academic-cum-practitioner flavour accompanied by good and contemporary writing that will lend weight to such histories. Unlike the Ministry of External Affairs which has stolen a march over other ministries in declassifying files, the three service headquarters and MoD have been rather slow in initiating this. Not only is it difficult to trace files from eras gone, it is highly possible that in the absence of digital conversion, several priceless discussions have been destroyed in the periodic discarding of files. But even if such files are available, who will spend long hours trying to identify elements that remain historically relevant? Digitisation and creation of oral histories will form a critical component of this transformation. Both are either unfolding at a snail’s pace or are absent in our existing official repositories of history at the service headquarters or war colleges. A software major must be roped- in for this and an outreach must be made to individual historians, think tanks and global repositories to share their oral history collections on contemporary Indian military history. The first chapter Considering the timeline of 25 years, a suggested list of declassifications to trigger this transformative initiative are the Nathu La skirmish of 1967, ‘The Lightning Campaign’ in the Eastern Theatre during the 1971 War, Operation Meghdoot (Siachen), Exercise Brasstacks and its subsidiary operations, and Operation Falcon (Sumdorong Chu). Lest the initiative be accused of only showcasing successes, Operation Pawan (Indian Peace Keeping Force; picture ) too needs to be officially written about, albeit with due sensitivity. One of the hallmarks of a leading power/emerging power/power of consequence and a leading military is the ability to take criticism, tackle institutional reluctance to expose faultlines and push forward with reform with the big picture in mind. History does not offer a blueprint for the future, but it is certainly instructive in building on successes and not repeating the follies of the past. That proposition must be the bedrock on which this initiative takes off.

15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||A policy difficult to defend||The Union government recently reversed the liberalised vaccination strategy. States no longer have to bear the responsibility of procuring vaccines; the Centre will procure them on behalf of the States as the single purchaser. While this move has been applauded, some doubt that a few things will change under the new regime. One area of objection has been that the private sector’s share of total vaccines remains unchanged at 25%. Problematic decision As some experts have rightly pointed out, the private sector’s share of total manufactured vaccines is out of sync with its share of total vaccination centres, which are far fewer than the government’s, thus entailing a demand-supply mismatch between government and private centres and concomitant inequities. Although capacity to vaccinate is a more important metric to consider than just the relative share of vaccination centres, it is unlikely to be a redeeming factor. However, the policy looks problematic even if the number and the share of private vaccination centres increases substantially to accommodate their share of total vaccines. Writ large, a 25% share for private vaccination entails an implicit assumption that 25% of the population is willing and able to pay for a commodity for which social benefits exceed private benefit. This is indicative of our mistaken assumption of an inflated ‘middle class’. The fact is that the affluent form only a small fraction of the uppermost 25% of our population based on income. Markets tend to under-produce commodities having significant positive externalities. Preventive services like vaccines generate a lower private demand than curative services. Subsidising or incentivising users and penalising non-users of preventive services are two ways of promoting consumption of such services. Even assuming reasonably higher levels of wealth, education, and COVID-19 awareness in the uppermost 25% of the population, significant demand generation concerns would remain, which may lag behind desirable levels. Not to mention that this section is also likely to have better access to free vaccines provided by the government, creating a ‘crowding out’ effect for the poorer sections. Of course, we assume here that India doesn’t have a large surplus of vaccines. We also need to consider the age structure and its possible implications. A large chunk of self-payers are likely to be younger, productive individuals, who are at lesser risk of severe disease and mortality than the elderly. It’s intriguing as to what motivates this 25% share for private players. Is the government driven by herd immunity considerations, which project that between 60% and 80% of the population needs to be imperatively immunised? It is crucial to realise that vaccinating the poorer and marginalised sections, even if it is free of charge, is much more challenging than vaccinating the easily accessible better-off sections. The resultant disparities along geographic and socioeconomic lines would not be consistent with the notion of herd immunity. All this points to the need to increase the government’s share of total vaccines. It is unfair to demonise private hospitals in this situation, especially since service charges have now been capped. The benefits, if any, of differential pricing are likely to accrue mainly to vaccine manufacturers. But vaccine production is also a costly process, and the government’s track record of investing in domestic COVID-19 vaccine production has been anything but phenomenal. The result of this is that money spent out-of-pocket is feeding vaccine production in India, which is an inequitable and regressive way of doing things. Better engagement with private sector Traditionally, India’s approach to dealing with the private sector has been ‘all or none’ of sorts. On accusations of extortionate pricing by private players, the government hasn’t hesitated to impose often unreasonable and unfavourable pricing restrictions. On the contrary, successive governments have frequently been criticised for adopting an unduly favourable attitude towards the private sector in healthcare. It’s time we moved beyond this. Greater reach, innovative processes, and efficiency are some of the strengths of the private sector. Any engagement with this sector needs to sufficiently exploit such strengths as part of a strategic purchasing framework. But this will require the government to engage with smaller players too, not just big private hospitals. This will be replete with challenges, including the need for strong regulatory and information systems. More decentralised but accountable regulation might be called for. However, it is possible to envision a favourable risk-benefit trade-off with such engagement. The pandemic is the right time to attain the appropriate public-private policy mix. Dr. Soham D.

15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Preserving India’s archives||The National Archives is the primary repository of documents on India’s past. The last time it was in the news was in 2016 when digital copies of files relating to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose were made publicly accessible. The imminent demolition of its annexe by the Government of India has brought the institution to public attention once again. A petition by leading Indian and foreign scholars is in circulation demanding that the government show greater openness in the proposed demolition of the National Archives annexe and the safe storage of its contents since “several centuries of India’s history lie in the documents that make up the National Archives of India”. The petition said: “The archival records include 4.5 million files, 25,000 rare manuscripts, more than 100,000 maps, treaties, 280,000 premodern documents and several thousand private papers... The loss or damage of a single object or archival record would be an irrevocable loss.” The annexe also houses the cartography section and 1,50,000 oriental records in Persian, Arabic and Urdu. The birch bark and clay coated Gilgit Manuscripts in the National Archives are, according to UNESCO, “the oldest surviving manuscripts in India”. These include “canonical and non-canonical Buddhist works that throw light on the evolution of Sanskrit, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Mongolian, Manchu and Tibetan religion-philosophical literature”. Poor shape The National Archives is in poor shape. A series of articles published inThe New York Timesin March 2012 by the historian Dinyar Patel laid bare the parlous state of the National Archives. He noted, among other things, that “letters penned by Mohandas K. Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar, Gopalkrishna Gokhale, and other eminent Indian nationalists have suffered from exposure to humid weather, staff negligence and mishandling, and improper preservation methods.” Things have improved since then, but not enough. Writing inThe Telegraph Online,of May 30, 2021, Sana Aziz, Assistant Professor of History at Aligarh Muslim University, pointed to lack of expertise to manage acquisitions which has led to “the locking up of some of the rare documents in Persian, Urdu, Arabic, Sanskrit, Prakrit, Tamil, Malayalam, and Modi(records from Maharashtra)”. Moving the collections in the National Archives annexe needs careful planning and execution. Few know this better than The British Library. Its guide from its Preservation Advisory Centre, titled ‘Moving Library and Archive Collections’, is succinct and comprehensive, covering every aspect of shifting an archive. A significant point it makes is that “the order in which the collection is to be moved and unpacked must be carefully considered and mapped. In the long term, it is cheaper to put items into their correct place straight away, rather than being rushed into a random storage arrangement.” Moving contents Those who are protesting the demolition of the annexe include scholars holding important positions in some of the best institutions. They have access to the finest archival expertise in the world. They are best placed to produce a detailed report on how to move the contents of the National Archive annexe and share it with the government giving names of institutions and experts willing to help. Not just the National Archives, but those of the States too are in poor shape. A case in point is the Goa archives, one of the oldest in the country. It contains material relevant not just to India but also to the rest of Asia, Europe, Africa and South America. While making their proposal, these scholars would do well to recommend an integrated national approach to archival management bringing together State archives too. The private sector could be brought in to construct a world-class building within the next two years as part of CSR and have the annexe collections shifted there. Such a project will do a lot of good for India’s image rather than all the protests from a “community of concerned”, which , incidentally, is all of us. Uday Balakrishnan teaches at IISc Bengaluru.

15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||An elite club||The G-7 summit, at Carbis Bay, sent out two very strong messages. The first was driven by the United States’s new President Joseph Biden and his vow that “America is back” to take the lead on global challenges. The G-7 commitment to donate one billion coronavirus vaccines to poorer countries and to invest $12 trillion in their combined pandemic recovery plan depends on U.S. commitments for a large part. The special communiqué on “Open Societies” for the G-7 outreach, and the invitation to “fellow democracies” India, Australia, South Korea and South Africa are also an extension of his stated commitment to convening a Democracy Summit this year. Even the slogan for the G-7, “Build Back Better”, was a White House term to declare America’s economy and jobs recovery plan. The second message was the consensus amongst the seven-member countries on countering China. The final G-7 communiqué holds no less than four direct references to China, each negative, including criticising Beijing for its rights record in Xinjiang and democratic freedoms in Hong Kong, its “non-market policies and practices...”, concerns over its actions in the China Seas, and a demand for a transparent investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 virus. Though the bonhomie among the G-7 leaders was palpable, the differences and contradictions in the grouping remain a challenge. Even two decades ago, questions were raised about whether the grouping (earlier, the G-8), could claim its mantle as the world’s “richest” countries, when emerging economies, China and India, are not included. On economic issues, the EU is a more representative unit than the individual European G-7 member countries. Finally, the premise of a group like the G-7, that of an exclusive club of the “haves” or “the best vs the rest”, seems anachronistic in a world that is much more interlinked now than in 1975, when the grouping first came about. India, a special guest to the G-7/G-8 since 2003, has also maintained its independent course, especially on political issues. It is significant that the G-7 outreach communiqués that included the guest countries, did not make the same references to China as the main document, and MEA officials clarified that Chinese aggression was not raised at the outreaches, which focused on the pandemic, climate change and democratic freedoms. India voiced concerns about some clauses in the joint communiqué on Open Societies which condemned “rising authoritarianism”, net shutdowns, manipulation of information, and rights violations — areas where the Modi government has often been criticised itself. Addressing the session on Open Societies, Mr. Modi said that India is a “natural ally” to the G-7. In the present, the Government will be expected to walk the talk on its commitments at the G-7 outreach, especially in the areas of information clampdowns, given that India had the largest number of Internet shutdowns in 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/an-elite-club/article34817214.ece
15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Numero Uno||Novak Djokovic has always maintained that ending his career with the most number of Grand Slam titles is one of his prime motivations to keep playing tennis. In the Roland-Garros final on Sunday, he took a giant stride in realising this dream with a sensational come-from-behind five-set victory over the fast-rising Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas for his 19th Major, pulling him within one title of his celebrated rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. It was the Serb’s second French Open trophy, making him only the third man in history (after Roy Emerson and Rod Laver) and first in the Open Era (post 1967) to win all four Slams at least twice. The rhythmic allure of the record aside, the sense of completeness and the feeling of sporting immortality it brings, even to a career as storied as Djokovic’s, is unparalleled. So will the 34-year-old’s semifinal victory over 13-time champion Nadal, the greatest of all clay-courters. That Djokovic had the tennis to challenge the Spaniard was never in doubt. What was astonishing was the way he bounced back from the shell-shocking in last year’s final and outwitted an in-form Nadal. For Djokovic to not fall off the emotional cliff and defeat Tsitsipas — a player 12 years younger — brought to light one of his constant themes — poise and resilience under relentless pressure. The triumph is yet another reminder that Djokovic is this era’s most complete player. Where Federer has tweaked his shot-making with a larger racquet-head and Nadal has displayed new levels of aggression, Djokovic has prioritised balance, footwork and timing. Currently, no one can perhaps hit as well as Djokovic, from both wings, with pace and spin, at varied angles, even when on defence. As Nadal and Tsitsipas found out over exactly four hours and 11 minutes each, a tennis court had never felt smaller. This has now kindled hopes of a ‘golden’ Grand Slam, a herculean feat of winning all four Majors and the Olympic gold in a single year. However, if there is one man who has dared to dream and succeeded, it is Djokovic. Unseeded Barbora Krejcikova perhaps took cue and became the Czech Republic’s first singles champion in Paris in 40 years, providing a storyline to latch on to after Naomi Osaka’s withdrawal because of mental health concerns and Serena Williams’ early exit. Nine months ago, Krejcikova was ranked outside the top-100 and had appeared in only three singles main draws at Slams. But with two doubles and three mixed doubles trophies, she was no stranger to success. Over the last fortnight, with her delightfully languid but polished game, she became the first woman since Mary Pierce in 2000 to sweep both singles and doubles at Roland-Garros.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/numero-uno/article34817215.ece

Pavate, has obviously upset the long-nurtured plans of the topplers who were getting ready to replace the shaky Akali Dal Ministry headed by Mr Badal by what could have only been an equally shaky and ramshackle coalition. No tears need to be shed over the exit of the Badal Government which, along with the Akali Dal itself, had been riven by faction and intrigue for months. Those who thought that the reunion of the faction headed by Mr. Gurnam Singh with the parent Dal under Sant Fateh Singh in November last would ensure stable government in the State would seem to have reckoned without the Akalis’ penchant for groupism and infighting. The present crisis which has sparked off some vague and unspecified charges of corruption against some of the Ministers by another Minister, Mr. Trilochan Singh Riasti, was but part of this factious struggle within the party, though his demand for a smaller and more compact Cabinet for so small a State was reasonable. Mr Badal’s reluctance to get rid of some of the Ministers on the eve of the Assembly session is also easily explained, as with the outgoing Ministers would also have gone some of the needed support in the Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/presidents-rule-for-punjab-from-an-editorial/article34817224.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Consumer inflation quickens to 6.3%||Retail inflation hit a six-month high of 6.3% in May, thanks to a persistent rise in fuel and edible oil prices, which also played a part in pushing wholesale prices to a record 12.94% inflation in the month, as per data released on Monday. Consumers experienced an inflation of 11.58% for the ‘fuel and light’ category in May, with urban India bearing a bigger hit of 14.24% on the same account. Food inflation reheated to 5.1% from just 1.96% in April. Overall retail prices, however, saw a sharper spurt in rural areas from 3.75% in April to 6.5% in May, while it was less pronounced in urban India at a little more than 6% from 4.7% in April, as per the National Statistical Office. At the wholesale level, fuel and power inflation nearly quadrupled to 37.6% from the 9.75% recorded in March this year, and is significantly higher than the 20.94% mark attained in April. Manufactured products’ inflation rose to 10.83% from 9% in April. The ‘high rate of inflation is primarily due to low base effect and rise in prices of crude petroleum, mineral oils, and manufactured products’, an official statement on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) said. WPI had contracted 3.37% in May 2020. ‘RBI will find it tricky’ Economists said the hardening inflation numbers would make it trickier for the Reserve Bank of India to balance the need to spur growth while keeping a lid on price rise, but they don’t expect a change from its ‘accommodative’ stance any time soon. The RBI had recently revised its inflation estimate for 2021-22 to 5.4%, while moderating growth hopes for 2021 to 9.5%. “Although it is still too early to believe that retail inflation will remain in excess of 6% on a sustained basis, given the high base of last year, we believe the rising wholesale inflation which is gradually finding a reflection in the retail inflation as well, is going to make things difficult for RBI,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings. Ratings agency ICRA said core retail inflation had hit an 83-month high of 6.6% and is expected to remain higher than 5% through the year. “The phased unlocking of the States may temper the CPI inflation to around 6% in June. We have raised our forecast for the FY2022 average CPI inflation to at least 5.4%,” said its chief economist Aditi Nayar. She, however, expects the RBI’s monetary policy committee to maintain ‘a high tolerance’ even if average retail inflation hovers between 5.5 and 6%, given the uncertainties regarding the growth outlook.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/consumer-inflation-quickens-to-63/article34817209.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Raters must give longer rope to developing world’||Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said there was a need for global rating agencies and bodies such as the IMF to be ‘compassionate’ towards developing countries and give them ‘a longer rope’ for economic revival. Mr. Goyal also asserted that India can not only vaccinate its 1.35 billion people but also produce enough for the rest of the world if supply restrictions are resolved. “All the 7 billion people in the world need to be vaccinated, as nobody’s safe till everybody’s safe,” he said. The Minister was speaking at the UN Trade Forum attended by the World Trade Organization Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala who called for slashing export curbs and expediting Intellectual Property waivers to boost universal vaccination. “First, we can’t recover without vaccines. Trade policy is vaccine policy and vaccine policy is trade policy,” she said. “I do hope that credit rating agencies and agencies like the IMF do not land up being unfairly harsh on the developing and less-developed countries,” said Mr. Goyal. “A little longer rope needs to be given, even with regard to earlier agreements or commitments, so that these countries have space to bring their economies back on track,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/raters-must-give-longer-rope-to-developing-world/article34817196.ece

15 June 2021||New Delhi,||Adani stocks tumble on reports of NSDL action||Shares of Adani Group companies witnessed a massive drubbing in morning trade on Monday, tumbling up to 25%, amid reports that the National Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL) had frozen certain foreign portfolio investor (FPI) accounts that have holding in some of these firms. Billionaire Gautam Adani’s group on Monday said it had written confirmation that accounts of three foreign funds, that were among its top shareholders, had not frozen and reports to the contrary were “blatantly erroneous and misleading”. Following the statement, shares of some group firms witnessed partial recovery from their early losses. Adani Enterprises closed 6.26% lower at Rs. 1,501.25 and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone tumbled 8.36% to Rs. 768.70 on the BSE. In morning trade, Adani Enterprises had tanked 24.99% to Rs. 1,201.10, while Adani Ports dived 18.75% to Rs. 681.50. Adani Green Energy dipped 4.13% to Rs. 1,175.95, Adani Total Gas fell 5% to Rs. 1,544.55, Adani Transmission declined 5% to Rs. 1,517.25 and Adani Power slumped 4.99% to Rs. 140.90. All these stocks hit their respective lower circuit limits during the trade.  ‘Albula, Cresta, APMS’ According to media reports, the NSDL had frozen the accounts of three foreign funds which together owned shares in four Adani Group firms. The accounts were frozen on or before May 31, the report added. Adani Enterprises, the conglomerate’s flagship company, as also Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Green Energy Ltd., Adani Transmission Ltd., Adani Power and Adani Total Gas Ltd., in identical filings to the stock exchanges, said the reports of NSDL freezing accounts of Albula Investment Fund, Cresta Fund and APMS Investment Fund, holding shares in the group firms, were “blatantly erroneous and done to deliberately mislead the investing community. “This is causing irreparable loss of economic value to the investors at large and reputation of the group,” it said. “We requested Registrar and Transfer Agent, with respect to the status of the Demat Account(s) of the aforesaid funds and have their written confirmation vide its e-mail dated 14th June, 2021, clarifying that the Demat Account(s), in which the aforesaid funds hold the shares of the company, are not frozen,” the firms said. Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking Ltd., said, “Initially, a news report on the Adani group triggered a weak start, however the benchmark gradually recovered as the day progressed, thanks to noticeable buying in select index majors. The clarification by the company further comforted the market and helped the index to close flat.” The Sensex fell 538.45 points to 51,936.31 but later recovered to close 76.77 points higher at 52,551.53.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/adani-stocks-tumble-on-reports-of-nsdl-action/article34817202.ece
15 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cement offtake drops 25% in April-June: ICRA||The second wave of COVID-19 has adversely impacted the domestic cement sales in the April-June quarter, reducing 25% on a quarter-on-quarter basis but pent-up demand is expected to push up volumes starting in the July-September quarter, as per a report. In April, when the second wave was on the rise, domestic production was down 35% month-on-month in April and 4% lower in comparison with the pre-pandemic April 2019, said ratings agency ICRA. Unlike last year, rural areas have also been impacted in the second wave. “The recovery in the rural regions is expected to be gradual,” it said. However, it added that pent-up demand is likely to drive offtake once lockdowns are relaxed. ICRA AVP and sector head Anupama Reddy said cement firms have raised prices by an average of 5% in April from a year earlier, spurred by the rise in input costs, primarily power & fuel and freight expenses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cement-offtake-drops-25-in-april-june-icra/article34817204.ece

15 June 2021||Brasilia,||Neymar headlines Brazil’s easy win||Star forward Neymar netted a penalty and created a second as hosts Brazil eased to a 3-0 victory over a coronavirus-depleted Venezuela on Sunday in the opening match of the 2021 Copa America. Centre-back Marquinhos opened the scoring midway through the first half and Gabriel sealed the win a minute from time. Makeshift side Played in front of an empty Mane Garrincha stadium in Brasilia due to COVID-19 restrictions, Brazil made light of the continent’s minnows, who arrived with a makeshift side missing at least eight players who were ruled out after testing positive for coronavirus the day before. Venezuela called up 15 emergency replacements but could still only name seven out of a possible 12 substitutes due to a lack of available players. The game went ahead and, predictably, reigning champion Brazil was well on top. Venezuela produced little going forward but Jose Martinez did have the Brazil defence back-pedalling with a dangerous burst before winning a corner that came to nothing. Brazil took the lead on 23 minutes when Richarlison flicked on a Neymar corner that deflected into Marquinhos’s path inside the six-yard box, allowing the centre-back to bundle home. Richarlison had a goal ruled out for offside while Neymar incredibly fired wide from 12 yards out. It was more of the same after the break as substitute Alex Sandro from distance and Richarlison with a header both shot over the bar. Neymar somehow failed to turn home a cross-cum-shot from Gabriel Jesus from three yards out but on 64 minutes he doubled the lead from the penalty spot. Yohan Cumana clumsily brought down Danilo in the box and Neymar sent Graterol the wrong way from 12 yards. The hosts took their foot off the gas but Neymar kept probing and was denied a second by Graterol following a mazy run and shot from inside the box. Neymar then created the third, rounding Graterol before crossing for Gabriel to chest home from barely a yard out. In Cuiaba, a surprising choreographed move gave Colombia a 1-0 win against Ecuador in its first match. Edwin Cardona scored the winner at the Arena Pantanal in the 42nd minute of a tense game on Sunday. The decisive moment started when midfielder Cardona took a free kick close to the edge of the Ecuadorian penalty box. Instead of shooting, he exchanged three short passes with Juan Guillermo Cuadrado, who moved the ball forward to where Miguel Borja was waiting. Right-footed shot Borja headed the ball back to Cardona, who had run toward goalkeeper Pedro Ortiz and who scored with a right-foot shot as the Ecuadorian defenders watched on. The move had to be validated by video review.  The results: Brazil 3 (Marquinhos 23, Neymar 64-pen, Gabriel Barbosa 89) bt Venezuela 0; Colombia 1 (Cardona 42) bt Ecuador 0.    By The Numbers   7 - The number of chances created by Neymar against Venezuela  7 - The number of Brazilian players who finished the first half with their average position being in the rival half||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/neymar-headlines-brazils-easy-win/article34817353.ece
15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Rahane advised us on how to bat in Tests’||Much has changed in women’s cricket since Harmanpreet Kaur played her last Test, way back in 2014. Her own masterpiece, 171 not out off 115 balls in the World Cup semifinal against Australia in England three years later, would play a big role in transforming the women’s game in India. Over the next few days though, Harmanpreet and her teammates’ focus would be on the red ball, as India gets ready to take on England in the one-off Test at Bristol, starting on Wednesday. Her last, and second, Test, against South Africa at Mysuru, was also India’s last. The visitors would go into the Test match without much practice. “But as players we need to adapt,” the India vice-captain said at a virtual press conference on Monday. Harmanpreet and other batters got some very useful tips on how to bat in Tests from Ajinkya Rahane, the man who knows a thing or two about playing long innings. . “We got a chance to speak to Rahane, who has a lot of experience in Tests,” she said. “He told us about how to bat and what should be our approach in long-form cricket. He told us how to divide an innings into five-minute periods.” Different conditions She said the team was trying to make the best out of the short time got for preparing for the Test match. “The wickets here are totally different from those in India,” she said. “The ball swings here and we have been practising for that at the nets.” Harmanpreet said the team was expecting a lot from the bowling spearhead Jhulan Goswami, who had a lot of success in the previous Tests she played in England. “Jhulan has always been someone who leads (from the front) when we are in the field,” she said. “She is special for us and always gives breakthroughs whenever we need...I hope she will be fantastic in this match also.” Though only few of India’s women cricketers have had the experience of playing with the red ball, Harmanrpeet expressed hopes for the future. “It is a totally different scenario when you play red-ball cricket. As a player it is important to get used to conditions. We don’t get any domestic games with the red ball but (I hope) in the upcoming seasons we will get more red-ball cricket, which will be very good for us.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahane-advised-us-on-how-to-bat-in-tests/article34817302.ece
15 June 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Controversy mars Anand’s celebrity games||Viswanathan Anand’s simultaneous online chess games against celebrities on Sunday night raised more than Rs. 10 lakh. Less than 24 hours later, the event, conducted by chess.com for COVID-19 relief, was being talked about for all the wrong reasons. One of the players, it turned out, had resorted to “unfair practices” during his game against the five-time World champion. Surprise win Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of stockbroker firm Zerodha, had sprung a surprise; he was the only one among the nine celebrities to defeat Anand. Actor Aamir Khan, cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal and singer Arijit Singh had all lost. Kamath is now facing allegations of cheating — that is, using the aid of a computer during his game against Anand. Chess.com has closed his account, for “violating the fair play policy”. Kamath has admitted as much on Twitter. “I had help from the people analyzing the game, computers and the graciousness of Anand sir himself to treat the game as a learning experience. This was for fun and charity. In hindsight, it was quite silly as I didn’t realise all the confusion that can get caused due to this. Apologies...” Anand was understandably upset by the whole episode. He tweeted: “Yesterday was a celebrity simul for people to raise money. It was a fun experience upholding the ethics of the game. I just played the position on the board and expected the same from everyone.” Interestingly, Anand would not have lost if he had not chosen to concede. Kamath had only a few seconds left on the clock, but Anand, the great champion and gentleman that he is, resigned, rather than wait for his opponent to lose on time. Unethical Aruna Anand, his wife and manager, said what happened was unethical and against the spirit of the game and the cause. “Mr. Kamath spoke to Anand over phone this morning,” Aruna told The Hindu . “Anand told him ‘Whatever you do, you please do in your personal capacity, and don’t involve my name’. Anand also texted he cannot deny what an algorithm finds out.” She said Anand’s name should not have been dragged into Kamath’s tweet and used as an excuse. “I think Mr. Kamath now needs to set the moral compass right,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/controversy-mars-anands-celebrity-games/article34817300.ece

Paul scored 37 points and Booker finished with 34 points and 11 rebounds as the Suns beat the Nuggets 125-118 to capture the Western Conference second round series 4-0.

15 June 2021||KOCHI,||‘Chopra model’ could have been tried for others||As javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra gets ready for his next meet, Sweden’s Karlstad GP, back home Shivpal Singh must be really desperate for meets. Shivpal, like Chopra, has qualified for the Tokyo Olympics but the Athletics Federation of India’s plans to send him and others to Turkey and more recently to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan for competitions have failed. Visa restrictions and 14-day quarantine have often been given out as hurdles for athletes’ travel abroad. That brings us to the big question: Why didn’t the AFI try the ‘Chopra model’ to send Shivpal and others abroad at this crucial stage with the Olympics just 40 days away. Chopra, the country’s brightest hope for a medal in Tokyo, flew to Portugal via France on June 6 and won a meet in Lisbon four days later. “We tried since ages to get a camp or get to Europe for competitions for our top throwers but it’s very difficult because of strict restrictions of other countries. But there is also no support from AFI or SAI. And the fact that Neeraj was able to leave is based on contacts of JSW (which is supporting him),” said German Uwe Hohn, the national javelin throw coach, in a chat with The Hindu on Monday. “Few athletes had one competition in 2020, for others last competition was in 2019 so they need to catch some competition. It’s part of training and eight to 10 competitions should be okay.” Some Indian shooters, swimmers, wrestlers and boxers are either training or taking part in events abroad. So one can imagine the frustration of athletes like Shivpal, Annu Rani (19th and well placed on the Road to Tokyo women’s javelin rankings), long jumper M. Sreeshankar (qualified), shotputter Tajinderpal Singh Toor and the 4x400m men’s and women’s relay runners who are in the danger zone in the rankings. They are all desperate for competitions. “Athletes realise that there’s no support from anyone... so it’s also very difficult to stay motivated,” said Hohn a former world record holder. “Probably only Neeraj will have the advantage of international competitions (before Tokyo).” AFI president Adille Sumariwalla and SAI director-general Sandip Pradhan did not respond to calls or messages sent for their version.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chopra-model-could-have-been-tried-for-others/article34817312.ece
15 June 2021||Copenhagen,||‘Will play for Eriksen’||Christian Eriksen had a simple message for his Denmark teammates when he spoke to them from the hospital for the first time following his collapse at the European Championship. “He told us to look forward, and to look forward to the game on Thursday,” Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg said Monday. “That meant a lot. ... It gave me a form of energy.” Hojbjerg along with goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and forward Martin Braithwaite spoke to the media. “It gives you the feeling that it’s OK to move forward,” Hojbjerg said. “We really want to play on Thursday, to play for Christian.” Braithwaite fought back tears when asked about that moment. “I tried doing the only thing I could to help him at that moment,” Braithwaite said. Schmeichel, who is close friends with Eriksen and his family, said he had been able to visit the midfielder in the hospital as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/will-play-for-eriksen/article34817314.ece
15 June 2021||DOHA,||India starts favourite despite Afghanistan’s fighting ability||Sunil Chhetri will look to add to his tally and enter the all-time top-10 goal-scorers’ list as a buoyant India meets Afghanistan in the joint 2022 World Cup and 2023 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers here on Tuesday. While India needs just a draw to secure a place in the third round of Asian Cup Qualifiers after Oman defeated Afghanistan 2-1 on Friday, a hat-trick for Chhetri will see him equal Pele in terms of numbers of goals scored in international arena. Chhetri is also just one goal off entering the all-time top-10 list of scorers. India ended its winless streak in international football when the captain struck a brace against Bangladesh in its previous outing.  India is already out of contention to progress further in the World Cup Qualifying campaign, and is now looking to secure a berth in 2023 Asian Cup. India will enter the game as clear favourite despite Afghanistan’s ability to fight it out. High on confidence Igor Stimac’s men will be high on confidence after dominating Bangladesh. The Indians enjoyed nearly 75% possession while completing more than 600 passes. India will need Chhetri and Manvir Singh to fire upfront, with Brandon Fernandes marshalling the midfield and keeping the supply chain flowing. Stimac dismissed apprehensions that India may play for a draw. “I need to say that I don’t know any coach or any team who would come out playing for a draw,” Stimac said at the pre-match press conference. “Even that might seem to be a situation when you are facing much better sides. Then, you need to drop and defend for your life and wait for one, two or three chances to counter-attack like against Qatar. But, we are not going out to play for a draw. Rather, we will go out to win it. That’s what we are aiming to do. We need to start doing it from the kick off. I know and am very confident that all our boys are ready and fit. They need to enjoy the game.” Stimac added: “The result against Bangladesh makes us confident. Afghanistan is a better side than Bangladesh, and it will not be easy.” Match starts at 7.30 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-starts-favourite-despite-afghanistans-fighting-ability/article34817339.ece
15 June 2021||LONDON,||Farah to make last-gasp attempt to qualify||Two-time Olympic 10,000m champion Mo Farah will make a last-gasp attempt to qualify for the Tokyo Games at the British athletics championships in Manchester on June 25. The British runner, 38, is yet to hit the qualifying standard for the distance after a failed attempt earlier this month in Birmingham, where he was hampered by an ankle injury. He needs to beat a time of 27m, 28s to stand a chance of defending his crown at the Olympics. Farah clocked 27:50.64 at the British 10,000m championships on June 5 to finish eighth in his first race over that distance since quitting the track to focus on the marathon in 2017. The Manchester race, with the championships doubling up as Olympic trials, will be his last chance to reach Tokyo, with the deadline on June 27. Farah won the 5,000m-10,000m double at the 2012 London Olympics and repeated the feat four years later in the Rio de Janeiro Games.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/farah-to-make-last-gasp-attempt-to-qualify/article34817333.ece

15 June 2021||Paris,||French icons||Novak Djokovic has set his sights on the Golden Slam — all four Majors and the Olympic title — insisting: “Everything is possible”. The World No. 1 captured a second French Open and 19th Slam with a 6-7(6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 win over Greece’s Stefanos Tsitsipas on Sunday. Milestones It made him the first man in the Open era, and only the third in history, to claim all four Grand Slam titles on multiple occasions. Now he has targeted being the third man to complete a calendar Grand Slam after Don Budge in 1937 and Rod Laver in 1962 and 1969. On top of that, he also wants the Olympic gold medal to complete the Golden Slam. “Everything is possible. Definitely in my case I can say that what I’ve been through in my career, in my life, this journey has been terrific so far,” said Djokovic. “I’ve achieved some things that a lot of people thought would be not possible for me to achieve. So everything is possible, and I did put myself in a good position to go for the Golden Slam,” he said. The Golden Slam has never been achieved by a man while, in the women’s game, only Steffi Graf in 1988 has swept all four Majors and the Olympic gold in the same year. In Graf’s case, Olympic gold came in Seoul. For Djokovic, the opportunity will come in Tokyo later this summer. “Obviously his goal and our goal is to win the Olympics and then win the Grand Slam. That would be the absolutely top of this year,” said Djokovic’s longtime coach Marian Vajda. “His priority is Wimbledon, Olympics and US Open. I think that says all,” Vajda said. Djokovic is already halfway to a calendar Slam having secured a record ninth Australian Open in February. Been there, but... However, Djokovic has been at this juncture before, winning in Australia and Paris in 2016 but coming up short at the Rio Olympics, Wimbledon and the US Open later in the year. “I was in this position in 2016 as well. It ended up in a third-round loss in Wimbledon,” said Djokovic recalling his shock exit to Sam Querrey at the All England Club five years ago. Djokovic now has nine Australian Opens, five Wimbledons, three US Opens and two French Opens. He has also collected 36 Masters, a Davis Cup and has spent more time at World No. 1 than any other player. Guardian Angel corner But for two sets on Sunday, he was thoroughly outplayed by 22-year-old Tsitsipas before the Greek’s challenge fell apart. Djokovic left the court after the first two sets to compose himself just as he had done in his come-from-behind wins over Lorenzo Musetti and 13-time champion Rafael Nadal. “My guardian angels are there. I have my special corner. It’s a secret. I can’t reveal the secret. It’s been working for me pretty well,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/french-icons/article34817308.ece

15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Speciality of Ramayana||Of the two Itihasas, namely the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the former is special, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse. While the Mahabharata contains the Bhagavad Gita and the Vishnu Sahasranama, yet, the Gita and the Sahasranama are a small part of the Mahabharata. The latter is mostly about the fight between the Kauravas and the Pandavas. Of the more than one lakh verses, the Gita and the Vishnu Sahasranama take up only a few hundred verses. That is why Vyasa wrote a follow up, called Hari Vamsa, where he speaks about the greatness of Hari. Although the Mahabharata and Hari Vamsa are considered to be separate works, Hari Vamsa is actually like an addendum to the Mahabharata. In the case of the Ramayana, the entire work talks about Rama. It is called Adi kavya, for it was the earliest of all kavyas in Sanskrit. Dandin wrote the rules for writing kavyas. But it was the Ramayana which provided material for all those rules. So the work of how to write kavyas was based on the pattern provided by the Ramayana. Before the Ramayana, we did have the Vedas, but the Samhita portion of the Vedas was entirely about how to perform yagas. The Upanishads were about Brahman. There was no story told. So, Valmiki’s Ramayana was a pioneering work. Valmiki saw a hunter kill a krauncha bird, and saw the distress of its pair. He cursed the hunter. But what was surprising was that the curse came out in a metre! This was not due to a conscious attempt by Valmiki. It just happened that way. His curse had come out as a verse, with four padas, with each pada having eight syllables. While the Vedas also have chandas, the difference is that they are Vaideeka chandas, and Valmiki’s is laukeeka chandas. Vedic chandas have tonal variations, which chandas in kavyas do not have.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/speciality-of-ramayana/article34817287.ece

15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Who’s in your head?||You should never listen to what they say. At least, that’s what they say. To clarify, if you were to listen to what they say, then you’d not be listening to what they say. Clear now? You’ve heard them say, for example, that wide foreheads signify great memories. Keep your hair on! They also say wide foreheads signify balding genes. Not to split hairs, but they say that great memories are not worth losing hair over because the next generations will just Google, and let their great memories go redundant. And to bring it all to a head, they even say appearances are deceptive. Which means that those who appear to have wide foreheads may not really have wide foreheads. Clearer now? After a lifetime of listening to what they say, you will discover there are bunches of Theys who say deliberately contradictory things. As soon as you’re following one, the others say something diametrically opposite. They are all convinced they are right and they are wrong. That leaves us, as they say, with no options at all. You definitely should not be listening to whether they say that lizard squeaks herald weddings or deaths, whether to turn (or vote) left or right; whether lengths of skirts are in the eyes of the beholder or not. You should really be listening only to yourself. Now here is where it turns hairy. I say categorically that you shouldn’t care a toss about what they say. But since for you, I am one of They, if you listen to me, you could say that you shouldn’t listen to me. Then I’d say that you’re part of the They I’m advising against being listened to, in the first place. So you should really not be listening to you either. And you don’t. This is the final truth. They are so much in your head that you now listen to what they say because you think it is what you think. What you say is exactly what they say, after all. And what I say is exactly what they say, as well. It’s just that your They and my They are different. And they say you and I should be, too. Are we really?

15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Inside Clubhouse India||I first heard about Clubhouse back in January. A friend sent me an invite and I reluctantly opened an account, annoyed at being tasked with learning how to operate yet another social media platform. Then I ignored it. At least until the second wave hit and we were all back to being at home indefinitely. I logged on thinking it was going to be like last year’s Houseparty fad; safe to say, I am now hooked and I have no concept of sleep any more. What is Clubhouse? Think of it like a podcast in real time or a live radio show. Some describe it as a group of friends chatting or even having a “kitty party”. Whereas others call it a place to have dialogue and discourse. People now have the opportunity to speak to some of the best minds in their fields — internationally, rooms with names like Dr Anthony Fauci and Virgil Abloh have seen some of the biggest engagement. Closer home, people like Sonam Kapoor and Kusha Kapila now have a direct line with their fans. Since there are no text messages, direct messaging, or commenting on the app, the audio-only format limits opportunities for trolling. Something that Twitter and Instagram still don’t know how to deal with. For me, it started out as some fun, frivolous conversations about dating and “shooting your shot” (basically the Clubhouse version of telling someone you find them attractive). But soon I was tuning into more “serious” rooms. I am now listening in on conversations about the caste politics in India, the #MeToo movement, and crypto-currency.  Local connect  Clubhouse’s trajectory in India has been slightly different. The American market had a head start, which means they are now monetising rooms — artists are hosting paid gigs, people are charging fees for exclusive closed rooms, and the like. Indian Clubhouse isn’t there yet, but it is close. The main difference I’ve noticed is that in the West, there are many rooms with certain people talking and others listening. The Indian audiences want to speak and contribute more. If I am hosting a room and the hand raising feature is off, I end up getting messages on my Instagram to invite people so they can chime in. India being a very linguistically diverse country has also ensured that regional languages have found a life of their own on Clubhouse. In fact, the rooms hosted by some Malayali folks — with the most diverse topics (think ‘Can a parotta be a parotta if it looks like a chapathi ?’) — have seen up to 8,000 people at one point, the maximum number allowed in a room by Clubhouse. Is it a polarising app? Absolutely! Especially since it is now open to Android users, and numbers have risen. Earlier a 500-person room was something to be proud of. Now 5,000 are not enough for some. There is a lot of discussion about “influencers” on Clubhouse. People are annoyed that already popular digital stars are bringing their clout and disrupting a space that the early adopters worked hard to build. Yet, every other day there is a discussion about influencers, and each of these rooms draws large numbers, elicits several reaction rooms, and creates many Twitter and Reddit threads. There is also a very active political subculture on Clubhouse, with a clear distinction between the Left and Right leaning groups. The word “echo-chamber” is often used because these heated rooms aren’t really having a discourse. I have been “warned” about not following certain people and entering certain rooms because they don’t necessarily align with my political ideologies, and I am supposedly at risk of getting cornered.  Making it your own  My favourite rooms have been where my extreme privilege has been checked, and I have learnt a lot. A popular club, ‘The Dark Room’, has hosted incredible rooms on topics ranging from fat-phobia to caste-based discrimination. Making these spaces inclusive has been one of the reasons I find Clubhouse to be more democratic than other social media platforms. Some of the other rooms I enjoy attending are the music rooms, including ones dedicated to antakshari! There are also some great artistes that are now Clubhouse celebrities, such as Anirudh Deshmukh and Markand Soni. Clubhouse has become a great forum for the LGBTQIA+ community. Queer people have found their own table, since a seat wasn’t made available at the existing platforms for them. The conversations range from fun to educational, and the beauty of the app is that you get to shuttle between both. Clubhouse is still very new in India. Questions like how to monetise it, what is the future of the app, are being asked. Nobody really has an answer, but what we know is that people are either on it or are trying to score an invite. DM me on Instagram (@arjunmadan), I may have a few spare invites.

15 June 2021||New Delhi,||‘No major change in percentage of Delhiites with antibodies’||There is “no significant” change in the percentage of people, who have developed antibodies against COVID-19, as per the sixth serological survey, compared to the previous such survey, according to an official privy to the development. Submitted to govt. The result of the sixth serological survey, which was done in April, has been submitted to the Delhi government last week. But the survey was stopped in April due to the surge in COVID-19 cases and could not reach the planned target of samples. Around 13,000 blood samples from 141 wards were collected against a target of 28,000 samples from all 272 wards in the city, officials said. The result of the sixth sero survey is yet to be made public by the Delhi government. “We cannot compare this result with the previous survey as we have covered only 141 wards this time compared to all 272 wards last time. At best, we can compare the wards from where we have collected data this time with last time. Also, the government is yet to accept the report of the results of the survey,” an official said. “There is no significant change in the seroprevelance this time as compared to last time,” a second official said, but did not disclose whether it is less or more than the last survey. As per the fifth survey done in January, 56.13% of over 28,000 people, whose blood samples were collected from across the city, were found to have developed antibodies against COVID-19. 131 new cases The downward trend in COVID-19 cases continued in the national capital with 131 new cases being reported in the past 24 hours, taking the total cases to 14,31,270, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Monday. Also, 16 deaths were reported and the total number of deaths stood at 24,839. A total of 59,556 tests were done in a day, the bulletin said. Of the total cases, 14,03,205 people have recovered and there are 3,226 active cases. The test positivity rate was 0.22%, which means that less than one person out of 400 people taking COVID-19 tests are now positive for the virus. Vaccine stock With less than a day’s stock of Covishield left for the 18-44 age group, AAP leader Atishi on Monday said that the Delhi government will shut down half of the centres administering the vaccine for the age group from Tuesday. “From tomorrow, more than half of the centres where Covishield was being given as the first dose, will close down. It is our appeal to the Central government, that the youth of Delhi want to get vaccinated and for this, the pending vaccines should be made available to Delhi,” the AAP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/no-major-change-in-percentage-of-delhiites-with-antibodies/article34817489.ece
15 June 2021||June 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Why do we acquire foot deformities||During consultations, patients show no interest in knowing as to how they could have saved themselves from foot pain miseries only if they had consulted a qualified podiatrist on the occurrence of very first pain symptoms. The solution is doing few exercises at home with some precautions.  Experience Is Believing  One can acquire Foot, Ankle, Knee, Hip, Lower Back and Neck deformities due to wrong postures. For example, standing long time on one foot or leaning on one side leads to hip deformity. Dropping one shoulder or swinging one hand while walking shall give shoulders and neck deformities. Sitting on a working table with bow at backbone and deform vertebra resulting in middle back pain. Sitting inclined between the backrest and seat edge leads to low back pain.
