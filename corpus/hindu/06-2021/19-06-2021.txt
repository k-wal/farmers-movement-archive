19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC refuses to intervene in HC ruling on student activists’ bail||The Supreme Court on Friday did not intervene in the Delhi High Court decision granting bail to student activists Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Asif Iqbal Tanha, but said the High Court’s order of June 15 would neither be treated as a precedent in any proceedings nor be relied on by the parties. “It is clarified that the release of the respondents [student activists] on bail is not being interfered at this stage... The impugned judgment shall not be treated as a precedent and may not be relied upon by any of the parties in any of the proceedings,” a Bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian recorded. The three students were granted bail by the High Court after a year’s incarceration in Tihar Jail. They were accused of offences under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with the northeast Delhi riots, which broke out after the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) turned violent last year. The High Court accused the police of blurring the line between “terrorist act” under the UAPA and the students’ right to protest against a law. “The entire UAPA was turned on its head along with the Constitution…,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta objected in the Supreme Court on Friday during the appeal hearing. “The issue is important. It has pan-India ramifications. There are many questions involved here… We want to decide it for the good of the entire country,” Justice Gupta observed orally, issuing formal notice to the three students on the appeal. Mr. Mehta argued that 53 people died and 700 were injured in the riots. “The right to protest does not mean the right to kill and hurl bombs,” he submitted. If the protests were held on the “perceived belief” that the CAA was against a particular community, then “the lady who assassinated a former Prime Minister” also did it on the belief that injustice was done to a particular community, he stated. Pushing for a stay of the judgment, he said the three students “may remain out” but the judgment may be used by others booked under the UAPA to get bail. A hearing on the limited question of bail for the students was used by the High Court to discuss an entire law. “A 100-page judgment [by the High Court] in a bail application discussing all the laws, that is what is troubling..,” Justice Gupta observed. Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, also for the government, said the High Court imputed ambiguity to Section 15 of the UAPA, which defines a “terrorist act”. Justice Gupta said, “We understand the way the Act has been interpreted [by the High Courtre] requires to be examined”. Mr. Mehta said, “The HC says eventually the riots were controlled, so it does not come under UAPA…. Now someone puts a bomb somewhere and it is defused by the police, is the intensity of the case lessened? If I kill somebody, should I be booked only under Section 302 IPC [murder] and not UAPA even if my act comes under the definition of a ‘terrorist act’.”  D||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-refuses-to-intervene-in-hc-ruling-on-student-activists-bail/article34854680.ece
19 June 2021||Srinagar,||Buzz over Centre’s possible meeting with J&K parties||Jammu and Kashmir is witnessing heightened political activity as the Centre mulls inviting all political parties from the Union Territory to New Delhi in the last week of June to start a political engagement, which is likely to pave the way for the restoration of statehood. Several constituents of the Gupkar alliance, an amalgam of five political parties fighting for the pre-August 5, 2019, position of J&K, met in Srinagar on Friday to “discuss the future course”, sources said. As J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and top police officials met Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Friday, sources said the Centre is likely to invite the parties on June 24 or after that. J&K was split into two Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh 22 months ago. ‘No invitation yet’ “We have no information about any initiative. We have not got any formal invitation yet. Let them make it public. We have never blocked the way forward,” Gupkar alliance spokesman M.Y. Tarigami told The Hindu . Mr. Tarigami said J&K needed initiatives because the confidence was “completely shattered here”. “I urge the democratic Government of India that enough is enough. Let there be initiatives to restore confidence in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh,” he said. The Gupkar alliance spokesman said the onus of proving sincerity lay with those who “hampered the normalisation” and with the leadership of the country. “We have a set agenda that we agreed upon on August 4, 2019. We are for special constitutional position of J&K and against bifurcation of J&K. We are committed to it. However, this does not mean we will not talk. We will see that legitimate rights of people of J&K are restored,” he added. Sources said both the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), key constituents of the Gupkar alliance, are weighing their options in case a political process is announced by the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/buzz-over-centres-possible-meeting-with-jk-parties/article34854669.ece
19 June 2021||New Delhi,||Twitter grilled by MPs over violation of new IT rules||Twitter was at the receiving end of prolonged questioning by members of the Standing Committee on Information and Technology, headed by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, on non-compliance with the new IT rules, usage of the ‘manipulated media’ tag and fact-checking. According to sources, senior manager of public policy Shagufta Kamran and Twitter India legal counsel Ayushi Kapoor were present at the meeting. The committee members unanimously were critical about Twitter dragging its feet on complying with the new IT rules. Twitter officials claimed that they abided by their policy. The members, sources said, told Twitter that the law of the land is supreme. According to sources, members of the panel also asked Twitter why it should not be fined as it has been found “violating” the rules of the country. Recently, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had served one last notice to Twitter, asking it to immediately comply with the new IT rules and warned that failure to adhere to the norms would lead to the platform losing exemption from liability under the IT Act. “Twitter representatives remained non-committal about the timeline by when they will be able to comply fully with the rules. We have also asked for a written reply to a set of questions,” one of the members said. BJP MPs also questioned Twitter on its “fact-checking” policy, pointing out that BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra was promptly given the “manipulated media” tag, while such alacrity was not shown in the Ghaziabad case. An FIR has been filed against Twitter in Ghaziabad for provoking communal sentiments after an elderly Muslim man alleged that he was assaulted on June 5. The U.P. police has ruled out the communal angle. The BJP accused Twitter of showing bias, alleging that their fact-checkers are more inclined to blame BJP instead of fighting fake news. Sources said Twitter officials informed the panel that the fact checking is done by a third party and not by Twitter itself. Following the meeting, a Twitter spokesperson in a statement said, “We appreciate the opportunity to share our views before the Standing Committee on Information Technology. Twitter stands prepared to work with the Committee on the important work of safeguarding citizens' rights online in line with our principles of transparency, freedom of expression, and privacy. We will also continue working alongside the Indian Government as part of our shared commitment to serve and protect the public conversation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/twitter-grilled-by-mps-over-violation-of-new-it-rules/article34854671.ece
19 June 2021||LUCKNOW,||Tigress rescued from defunct U.P. factory||A tigress living in an abandoned rubber factory in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly district at least since December 2019 was rescued after an 18-day tracking operation, officials said on Friday. She was released in the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve at night. The tigress was first found in the dilapidated factory, around 6 km from Bareilly, in November-December 2019, Mayukh Chatterjee, head of Human-Wildlife Conflict Mitigation, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), told The Hindu . The operation was carried out by a team of the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department, along with the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve and the WTI. Sushant Soma, wildlife biologist, WTI, said, “The tigress is a fully mature adult as judged by the yellowing of her canines, roughly aged around five-seven years. For her age, she seems a little less developed at just 115 kg with a relatively small stature (body length is 140 cm) and pug size.” Spread over 1,200 hectares, the synthetic rubber chemical factory shut down three decades ago, leading to dense growth of vegetation on the compound. As a result, there was ample prey available, including black buck, wild pigs and rhesus macaques. The abandoned factory unit is a dense labyrinth of vegetation intermixed with massive broken down sheds, oil tanks and tunnels, said Mr. Chatterjee. The tigress was tranquillised after it was spotted in an old oil tank and an earthmover was used to tear the tank open, he said. Chief Conservator of Forests, Bareilly zone, Lalit Verma said it was a tricky operation because the tigress was confined in the oil tank. “We were hoping it would come out due to hunger, but it did not,” he said. Mr. Verma said the animal was first spotted in March 2020. “Normally, in such time the animals moves elsewhere but it was continuously being spotted that too late night or in early hours ,” he said. A tracking operation was started then but due to the pandemic, the officials had to stop their efforts. This is the second tiger to be rescued from the factory in the last three years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tigress-rescued-from-defunct-up-factory/article34854667.ece

Stalin called on Congress leader and United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi at her residence in New Delhi on Friday morning. Book presented Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi was present. Mr. Stalin, who was accompanied by his wife Durga, presented a book to Ms. Gandhi.

19 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Non-COVID treatment to resume in all hospitals: CM||Non-COVID-19 care will resume in all hospitals, including medical college hospitals, and the Health Department has been directed to take necessary steps to facilitate this, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. Talking to mediapersons here on Friday, he said with many hospitals and tertiary care centres converted to exclusive COVID hospitals, non-COVID patients had undergone much hardships. The government was aware of this and non-COVID care would now be opened up in phases, Mr. Vijayan, said. Medical students The government was taking steps to help medical students -- postgraduate students and house surgeons -- resume their studies. It was important that these students completed their medical studies so that as qualified doctors, their services could be utilised. He said that though the State had relaxed restrictions, it should not be assumed that the second wave was over or that COVID had ended. The unlock was possible because of the reduction in disease transmission, which was a result of the vigil and caution exercised by people. If people start to behave like everything is normal and resume get-togethers and gatherings, disease transmission would go up again, he said. The circulation of highly transmissible Delta variant is rampant in the State and hence people should continue to take all precautions, including double masking. Even small gatherings and crowds on the street could lead to a surge in transmission. Third wave threat The possibility of a third wave, the emergence of a virus variant more transmissible than the Delta variant and international travel increasing the possibility of disease transmission should not be discounted, Mr. Vijayan, said. He said the government was preparing the health system to meet a possible third wave, with the worst case scenario in mind. Isolation wards, oxygen beds and ICU wards are being added and paediatric facilities have been strengthened. The vaccination process would be speeded up as more vaccines were made available by the Centre. The State had covered 40% of its population with a single dose of vaccine. He said that some lacunae in the COVID vaccination certificates issued by the State for those going abroad had been pointed out and that would be rectified soon. The vaccination of the differently abled, senior citizens and illiterate persons will be facilitated by deploying volunteers to visit their homes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/non-covid-treatment-to-resume-in-all-hospitals-cm/article34854896.ece
19 June 2021||belagavi,||BSY to meet Maharashtra Water Resources Minister today||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is scheduled to meet Maharashtra Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil in Bengaluru on Saturday, to discuss ways to reduce flood damage in the Krishna basin villages. To prepare for this, a meeting of senior officers was held in Bengaluru on Friday. Rakesh Singh, Additional Chief Secretary, Irrigation, and others discussed various issues faced by the Krishna basin districts like Belagavi, Bagalkot, Vijayapura, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, and Bidar. Mr. Singh spoke to M.G. Hiremath, Deputy Commissioner, Belagavi, and asked him to be ready to take over the management of reservoirs in case of floods. It is believed that Maharashtra releasing water suddenly and releasing more water than expected has led to floods in the Krishna and its tributaries in north Karnataka. Saturday’s meeting is expected to address several of these issues. One of the solutions that is likely to come up is the long pending `water for water’ agreement expected to be signed between Maharashtra and Karnataka. Maharashtra demand Maharashtra has been demanding that Karnataka allot 4 tmcft of water in exchange for water to be released into the Krishna in the summer months. All these years, Karnataka has been paying for the water released from Maharahstra. Maharashtra has sought laying of a 20-km pipleline to Jat from the Tubachi-Babaleshwar lift irrigation scheme in Vijayapura district. Karnataka engineers had told Ramesh Jarkiholi, former Irrigation Minister, to insist on a monthly quota and basin-wise allocation of the 4 tmcft of water. They had also warned against Maharashtra counting monsoon releases as part of the agreed quantum of water. “We have been insisting on differentiating voluntary release of water from reservoirs and automatic release due to natural causes or to avoid floods,” said a senior engineer from the Irrigation Department. He said Mr. Yediyurappa is likely to stick to this point in Saturday’s meeting. Belagavi-based Central committee for Kannada organisations has submitted a memorandum to the CM asking him to safeguard the interest of the state at all costs. Mr. Patil left for Bengaluru from his hometown of Kolhapur on Friday evening. He was earlier scheduled to board a flight from Belagavi. Karnataka irrigation officers were waiting for him in Sambra airport. The Minister’s plans were changed at the last minute, an officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bsy-to-meet-maharashtra-water-resources-minister-today/article34854821.ece
19 June 2021||Kolkata,||State unveils evaluation criteria for Class X, Class XII Board exams||The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education on Friday announced the criteria for evaluation of Class X and Class XII board examinations, which were suspended on account the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the State Boards said that evaluation will be based on the student’s performance during the previous examinations and the results will be declared by July. Kalyanmoy Ganguly, president of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, said that for Class X (Madhyamik Pariksha) students, the evaluation will be on 50:50 basis with equal emphasis given to the Class IX annual exam marks and internal formative assessment carried out for Class X by respective schools. For the higher secondary examination, assessment will also include how the students performed in practicals and projects submitted for respective subjects. “The evaluation will be on 40:60 ratio (2019 Madhyamik results with four highest scoring paper marks and class XI annual exams marks),” Mahua Das, president of West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Examination said. She added that along with the marks in the two examination the Council will, for science/arts stream students, add the marks in practical/projects obtained by them in Class XII. The announcement was made on Friday at a joint press conference where representatives of both of the boards were present. Officials of both the boards said if a student is not satisfied with the marks obtained as per the assessment procedure announced he or she can write the examination when the situation improves and when written examinations can be held. “In case of a student opting to write the examination, the marks obtained in the written examination will be final,” the authorities said. About 12 lakh students were scheduled to appear for the Class X examination and 8.5 lakh students for the Class XII examination. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on June 7 had announced that the State board examinations would not be held this year. She had set up an expert committee to suggest the evaluation criteria for the students.

19 June 2021||BENGALURU,||Arun Singh’s visit ends; Vishwanath at it again||While BJP national general secretary and Karnataka in charge Arun Singh completed his three-day troubleshooting exercise on Friday, dissidence in the party did not appear to end if exchange of barbs between the rival camps is any indication. In a reference to public spats embarrassing the party, Mr. Singh said the party would initiate disciplinary action against some who are issuing statements against the leadership. “Efforts will also be made to convince some others to desist from publicly expressing their views,” he said, before leaving for New Delhi. In fact, Mr. Singh had begun his three-day visit by asking party legislators and leaders to desist from issuing any statements in public against the party or the government. After the meeting of the party State core committee, Revenue Minister R. Ashok too said that disciplinary action would be initiated against leaders irrespective of their status if they issue any statements either against the party or the government. But A.H. Vishwanath, MLC, who had sought leadership change in public and levelled allegations of political interference and corruption against B.Y. Vijayendra, the Chief Minister’s son, on Thursday, chose to ignore the diktat and aired his views at a press conference on Friday. His outbursts continued even after the party State unit sought action against him. In an obvious reference to this, Mr. Singh said such statements were being issued only by a few leaders. Meanwhile, Mr. Ashok said the leadership change issue had not figured at the core committee meeting that was attended by Mr. Singh. “There is no question of changing Mr. Yediyurappa,” he said. Mr. Singh too had stated this before he arrived in the State by making it clear that there was no question of leadership change. Some party insiders observe that his statement is in line with the party high command’s stand that issues like leadership change should not be taken up when the State is reeling under COVID-19. “In fact, Mr. Singh was not here to take a call on leadership change. But his visit was mainly aimed at removing indiscipline and dissidence that has been affecting the party and the government’s image,” another senior leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/arun-singh-ends-visit-vishwanath-at-it-again/article34854721.ece

Mr. Birla, who completed two years in office, not only defended the construction of a new Parliament in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic but also argued in favour of increasing the number of members in the Lok Sabha to ensure that one member doesn’t have to represent an electorate size of 15-16 lakh people.

Talking about demands for a virtual session of Parliament by Opposition leaders, Mr. Birla said, “They may have written but when Lok Sabha proceedings were going on during COVID period, none said on the floor of the House that Parliament should function virtually or that Rule 266 needs to change. To change the rules, we need the approval of the House.” “As far as parliamentary meetings are concerned, while framing the rules, it was decided to keep the proceedings secret as members rise above party lines while debating issues,” the Speaker added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-demand-for-virtual-session-says-ls-speaker/article34854720.ece

19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC judge withdraws from W.B. violence case||Justice Indira Banerjee on Friday withdrew from hearing a petition filed by the families of two BJP activists killed allegedly in the post poll violence in West Bengal. Justice Banerjee was heading a Vacation Bench, which also comprised Justice M.R. Shah. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta asked whether the case could be placed before another Bench for hearing on Tuesday. “The Registry will decide,” Justice Shah said. The case was heard by another Vacation Bench of Justices Vineet Saran and B.R. Gavai in May, in the first half of the summer holidays. It had then come up routinely before Justice Banerjee’s Bench. On May 25, the State government informed the Justice Saran Bench that FIRs had been registered and several arrests made in connection with the incidents. That Bench asked the State to file an affidavit. A joint petition was filed by Biswajit Sarkar and Swarnalata Adhikari. Mr. Biswajit is the brother of deceased Abhijit Sarkar and Ms. Swarnalata, the widow of Haran Adhikari. They have alleged “total inaction” and even “subversion” of the investigation on the part of the West Bengal administration and the police. “The murders happened on the same day the Assembly election results were declared. The police stood by idly... The investigation into the crimes needs to be transferred to the CBI or SIT and requires court-monitoring,” senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, for the relatives, had submitted. The petition alleged that there was “indiscriminate” killing of innocent people in West Bengal following the election results by the “vengeful” ruling party in the State. The State countered in the affidavit that these false allegations of State complicity were drawn on the basis of hearsay reports disseminated on social media by miscreants. The top court was misled about the law and order situation in West Bengal and the petitions “reek of political motivation”, it stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-judge-withdraws-from-wb-violence-case/article34854593.ece
19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sale of illegal HTBt cotton seeds doubles||The illegal cultivation of herbicide-tolerant (HT) Bt cotton has seen a huge jump this year, with seed manufacturers claiming that the sale of illegal seed packets has more than doubled from 30 lakh last year to 75 lakh this year. Industry lobbies have written to the Agriculture Ministry, demanding that action be taken to stop such sales and punish offenders, noting that cultivation of the genetically modified cotton variant has serious environmental and economic consequences. However, a senior official at the Ministry said it was up to the State governments to enforce the policy. This comes even as activists from the Shetkari Sangathan have stepped up the reach of their civil disobedience movement to demand the legalisation of HTBt cotton by encouraging farmers to plant the seeds in violation of government regulations. Bt cotton is the only transgenic crop that has been approved by the Centre for commercial cultivation in India. It has been genetically modified to produce an insecticide to combat the cotton bollworm, a common pest. The HTBt cotton variant adds another layer of modification, making the plant resistant to the herbicide glyphosate, but has not been approved by regulators. Fears include glyphosate having a carcinogenic effect, as well as the unchecked spread of herbicide resistance to nearby plants through pollination, creating a variety of superweeds. “This year there is a big increase in such illegal cultivation especially in Maharashtra from 30 lakh packets last year to about 75 lakh packets this year,” said a recent letter from the Federation of Seed Industry of India executive director Shivendra Bajaj to Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal. “To make matters worse, the illegal seeds are sold using the brand name of prominent companies ... Farmers are at risk with such illegal cotton seed sale as there is no accountability of the quality of seed, it pollutes the environment, the industry is losing legitimate seed sale and the government also loses revenue in terms of tax collection,” he added, noting that HTBt seeds are often produced in Gujarat and then moved to Maharashtra. “It will not only decimate small cotton seed companies but also threatens the entire legal cotton seed market in India,” National Seed Association of India president Prabhakar Rao said on Friday. “Regulators are only limiting their checking to licensed dealers and seed companies while this illegal activity of HT seed sales is carried mostly by unorganised and fly by night operators. The focus must be shifted to catching them and taking exemplary and strong punitive action.” Deputy Seeds Commissioner Dilip Srivastava admitted that such complaints had become widespread. “Centre has made the policy to ban this variant. But it is the State governments that must take action. We are issuing advisories from time to time,” he told The Hindu . Another official said following Central advisories to all cotton-growing States, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Telangana have seized HTBt stock and taken punitive action against the culprits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sale-of-illegal-htbt-cotton-seeds-doubles/article34854603.ece
19 June 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Third wave may hit by October’||A third wave of COVID-19 infections is likely to hit India by October, and although it will be better controlled than the latest outbreak, the pandemic will remain a public health threat for at least another year, according to a Reuters poll of medical experts. The June 3-17 snap survey of 40 experts from around the world showed that a significant pickup in vaccinations will likely provide some cover to a fresh outbreak. Of those who ventured a prediction, over 85% of respondents, or 21 of 24, said the next wave will hit by October, including three who forecast it as early as August, and 12 in September. The remaining three said the third wave would occur between November and February. But over 70% of experts, or 24 of 34, said any new outbreak would be better controlled compared with the current one, which has been far more devastating — with shortage of vaccines, medicines, oxygen and hospital beds — than the smaller first surge in infections last year. “It will be more controlled, as cases will be much less because more vaccinations would have been rolled out and there would be some degree of natural immunity from the second-wave,” said Dr. Randeep Guleria, director at All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).  When asked if children and those under 18 years would be most at risk, nearly two-thirds of experts, or 26 of 40, said yes. But 14 experts said children were not at risk. Earlier this week, a senior Union Health Ministry official said children were vulnerable and susceptible to infections but that analysis has shown a less severe health impact.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/third-wave-may-hit-by-october/article34854621.ece
19 June 2021||New Delhi,||‘Nobody objected to building new Parliament when it was proposed’||As Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla completes two years in office, he speaks about the importance of letting all elected representatives have a voice in Parliament and says that none of the opposition MPs contested the need for a new building during meetings with him. Edited excerpts   As you complete two years, what would you say have been your achievements and the challenges you have faced?   Running the House at a time when COVID infections were fairly high was certainly a challenge. After a lot of brainstorming on how to run the House, Rajya Sabha Chairman and I agreed to have staggered timings for both the Houses and make seating arrangements for members of one House to sit in both the Houses. What’s heartening is that even during this session, members participated the same way as they would during a normal session, with 167 members taking part. The next big challenge for me, as a second term MP, was to take along all the political parties as well as the very experienced members. I must say that everyone cooperated with me and we didn’t face any disruption in the first session of my term. I also started some new practices that came out of my experience when I was a first time member. I made it a point to encourage and allow all MPs to raise Zero hour notices, where most don’t get the opportunity... On a single day, as many as 161 members spoke during Zero Hour. And in the first session of the current Lok Sabha, I think more than 400 MPs have spoken on the floor of the House. Several Opposition members wrote letters to ask why Parliament, as well as Parliamentary panels, can’t meet virtually when the Prime Minister can conduct meetings with Chief Ministers virtually? They may have written but when Lok Sabha proceedings were going on during the COVID-19 period, none said on the floor of the House that Parliament should function virtually or that Rule 266 needs to change. To change the rules, we need the approval of the House since they were framed with the House’s approval. I don’t think anyone wanted Lok Sabha proceedings virtually. As far as parliamentary meetings are concerned, while framing the rules, it was decided to keep the proceedings secret because members rise above party lines while debating issues. It’s a forum where members can enforce accountability and officials are expected to speak their mind freely. I don’t remember anyone asking for the rules to be changed while the House was in session. Several members have asked for the restoration of the Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) especially during the pandemic... Members have raised this issue in the House, and it’s for the government to take a view. What was the need for a new Parliament and why was the decision to continue construction in the midst of the second wave of COVID-19 taken, despite criticism? The current Parliament House is a revered building for us, as it figured prominently in our fight for Independence. For the needs of that time, this building was appropriate too. But as the work of the Parliament expanded, the number of members increased, the outer shape of the building saw little alteration, but inside ad hoc changes to adapt to new needs took place, making it vulnerable ... For a long time there was talk of building a new Parliament that was appropriate to the times. The Rajya Sabha chairperson and I had mentioned in both Houses that there should be a new building, looking at future scenarios. No one dissented when I raised this issue within the general purposes committee where leaders of all political parties in Parliament are represented. I have no comments on what is being said outside of that meeting, but inside nobody differed on the need for a new Parliament building. The cost of the project is Rs. 970 crore and not Rs. 20,000 crore as is being said. Nobody in the government has said that the cost of the project will come in the way of any spending on COVID-19 management. Is the Opposition saying that all infrastructural activity in the country should cease due to COVID-19? Much of it was continued. And the point is that not a single objection was raised at the appropriate forum over which I was presiding. The proposed new Parliament has a seating capacity of 1,000 people for Lok Sabha. Former president Pranab Mukherjee had suggested raising the number of MPs because constituencies were too large and unwieldy. What is your view? I agree with Pranab Babu. Constituencies currently have population running into lakhs, 16-17 lakhs in some cases. The government and appropriate authorities may consider increasing the number of MPs, as a single person representing so many people is very difficult. One of the reasons I made it a point that as many MPs as possible should raise Zero Hour notices was because MPs are elected by such large electorates. The Trinamool Congress asked for disqualification of two of its MPs [Sunil Mondal and Sisir Adhikari] for anti-party activities. What is happening to that request? They have written to me with their complaints. I have said that the complaint be taken on board as per the form required, I shall ask the two named for their version and later refer it to the Privileges Committee which will then hear the matter. Any time line by when this will be over? Well, the anti-defection law doesn’t specify a timeline in dealing with such complaints. All I can say is that the process will be carried out in the most transparent way.  But the recognition of the breakaway Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) as a group in the Lok Sabha was done almost overnight?  The LJP passed a resolution, the chief whip came along with the other four MPs and met me. Even then, I checked the signatures on the letter in person with all of them. No letter came challenging it, Chirag Paswan wrote two days after that.  Will you be asking for vaccination certificates from MPs for attending future sessions of Parliament?  We have only respectfully requested MPs to get vaccinated. As per our record, 425 MPs are vaccinated, some members suffered from COVID-19 recently and their vaccination is on hold. And we have not received any information from about 40-odd MPs. We are not making vaccination mandatory but want all MPs to be vaccinated as and when protocols suit.  I don’t think anyone wanted Lok Sabha proceedings virtually||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nobody-objected-to-building-new-parliament-when-it-was-proposed/article34854601.ece
19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Taking COVID-19 tests to rural India||The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has tied up with the Tata MD, a subsidiary of the Tata Group, to develop mobile testing laboratories to increase COVID-19 testing capacity in rural India. The initiative will utilise CSIR’s network of close to 40 labs across India and help increase India’s testing capacity in smaller locations in the country. “CSIR and Tata MD will jointly develop the testing capacity and the RT-PCR CRISPR test will be done using the Tata MD CHECK SARS-CoV-2 test kits that are powered by FELUDA technology from CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB),” a statement from the Science Ministry said on Friday. Simpler test The CSIR- IGIB had developed a coronavirus detection test that employed a gene-editing technology, called CRISPR. A paper-strip based test that needs to be analysed in a laboratory, FELUDA’s promise is that it is a relatively simpler test to execute, using which results can be known faster than in a traditional RT-PCR based test. “Apart from vaccination, rapid testing and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons have emerged as the best strategy in combating COVID-19. This initiative in partnership with Tata MD, to deploy the RT-PCR CRISPR test across multiple CSIR labs spread across the country is an important step. This will augment the national capacity to test for COVID and detect it locally” Shekhar Mande, Director-General, CSIR, said in a statement. For expanding reach, Tata MD is also deploying a proprietary 3-room design mobile testing lab that can conduct end-to-end, on-site COVID-19 testing to increase the testing capacity. “By partnering with CSIR’s network of labs and deploying fully equipped mobile laboratories, we are confident that we can quickly augment testing capacity using faster and scalable methods. This will significantly enhance the ability of State and district administrations to ensure wider availability and easier access to testing on an ongoing basis,” said Girish Krishnamurthy, CEO and MD of Tata Medical and Diagnostics. The FELUDA technology has already been licensed to the Tata Group by CSIR in 2020. The test was employed — it isn’t clear how many — during the concluded Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. So far 13 CSIR labs have been engaged in carrying out RT-PCR testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first CSIR lab to deploy the test was the CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP), Dehradun, Uttarakhand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/taking-covid-19-tests-to-rural-india/article34854616.ece
19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Repression has not silenced voices of struggle’||Jawaharlal Nehru University student and Pinjra Tod activist Natasha Narwal , who was released from Tihar Jail on Thursday after more than a year of incarceration in a case pertaining to the northeast Delhi riots, says seeing the struggle of other inmates without support systems has humbled her and strengthened the commitment to ensure that injustice does not go unchallenged.  You have been in jail for more than a year. How does it feel to finally breathe free? It feels good but still unreal. The joy of seeing our friends and loved ones is tinged with the pain of knowing that so many people continue to be unjustly incarcerated. Our minds also keep going back to the many other inmates and the children we spent so much time with who still remain behind bars. Yet, we were exhilarated to look at the open night sky. Your release from jail was also not without some last-minute hiccups and alleged attempts by Delhi Police to further delay it. Your comments. We had prepared ourselves for spending a long time inside, given how one has seen acts like UAPA keeping people inside for a long time and making bail very difficult, so despite the delays this is still unexpected. We are grateful for the Delhi High Court judgment which has been a big step forward for us. How has one year in jail changed you as a person and an activist? This past year in jail has brought many lessons that will remain with us for a long time. The love and support that people gave us — both inside and from outside — has been deeply inspiring. At the same time seeing the struggle of other inmates who do not have any strong support systems outside or even proper legal counsel has humbled one and strengthened the commitment to ensure that such violence and injustice is not allowed to go unchallenged. We have also learnt to value our freedom, and freedom in society ever more dearly. You lost your father to COVID a month ago. Could not even meet him one last time. Your thoughts. While being wrongfully incarcerated in jail under UAPA was unjust, I saw it as a part of activism. It was still a part of life with consequences that I was ready to face. Losing my father on the other hand was more of a traumatic incident. The limited access to conversation (only daily 5 min calls) and information made it only worse as I had to control the anxiety, nervousness and helplessness. But at the same time I couldn’t help but empathise with the other prisoners who had to go through the same or worse situation than me. The injustices that is being continuously done in this whole institution of prison and judicial system reflected back to me. What are your views on a perception of some that we are living in an undeclared emergency and the freedom of speech has never been under threat like it is now. The rise in state repression is striking. Yet despite the increase in repression, it has not been able to silence voices of struggle which have in fact been gaining in strength from the anti-CAA-NRC-NPR movement, to the farmer’s agitation and the way people have spoken out against the mismanagement during the pandemic. Such repression is only exposing the fragility of the ruling regime and its anti-people character. Is the current regime any different from earlier regimes in protecting the right to freedom of speech and protest? How? ...this regime is trying to change the very fabric of our society, fanning hatred and pushing people into desperation. Our country and society have seen exceptionally bad times in the past some years; be it with regards to unemployment, caste and communal atrocities, attack on workers’ rights... . These conditions are giving rise to a deep discontent and dissent which this regime is seeking to crush by ever greater repression.

19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||COVID-19 numbers down but cannot lower guard: Paul||India is showing a steady decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases but this decline should not be taken for granted, said Member, (Health) of the NITI Aayog V.K. Paul on Friday. Speaking at a press conference, Dr Paul added that the virus is mutating and “we can’t lower our guards”. “Studies have also shown that children have equal susceptibility as adults so we have to be ready to ensure that we are in a position to cater to them in case numbers rise again,” he added. Dr. Paul explained that a World Health Organization and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (WHO-AIIMS) survey shows seropositivity in persons below and above 18 years of age is almost similar. “`In persons above 18, the seropositivity rate is 67% and 59% in persons below 18. In urban areas, it is 78% in persons below 18 and 79% in above 18, while in rural areas, the seropositivity rate is 56% in persons below 18 years of age and 63% in persons above 18. The information shows that the children are getting infected,” he said. On vaccination, Dr. Paul said there are studies that prove that it reduced the chances of hospitalisation by 75-80% even after contracting COVID-19. “It also reduced the risk of ICU admission and brings it down to 6% in vaccinated persons and oxygen requirement comes down to 8%. The study was done among health care workers, who are a high-risk group,” he said. Decline in daily cases The Ministry said India has registered almost an 85% decline in daily new cases since the highest reported peak on May 7. About 78.6% decline has been recorded in total active cases since the peak reported on May 10, the Ministry added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-numbers-down-but-cannot-lower-guard-paul/article34854614.ece

The petition also sought directions to the government to prevent or stop the burial of bodies near the river. A bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Yadav and Justice Prakash Padia said the petitioner “has not done much research work” in respect of rites and customs which are prevalent among various communities living along the bank of river Ganga.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-role-for-state-in-last-rites-says-allahabad-high-court/article34854618.ece
19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Join fight against pandemic: Vardhan||The government worked round the clock to stop COVID-19 last year and was successful in decreasing the active caseload to the minimum, said Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan on Friday. However, with the arrival of vaccines early this year and things returning to normality, people gradually invited laxity in their adherence to the simple code of pandemic-appropriate behaviour, he added. While the virus mutated and evolved itself, people let their guard down. All this compounded in the spike in cases snowballing into the second wave, he said. Distributing masks to all employees of the Health Ministry, he noted that that now many parts of the country were gradually moving towards unlock from the second wave, but “we cannot afford the laxity and any further increase in cases again”. Masks were the simplest, most powerful weapon against all variants of the virus, he said. He appealed to everyone, including employers, social organisations, his colleagues in other Ministries and political leaders in office to ensure that all their employees were safe from COVID-19. “We should ensure that all of them have adequate masks, that they are properly worn, and inform them, if necessary, about the importance of COVID-19-appropriate behaviour. We should encourage them to get vaccinated as well,” he stated. India, he said, had started the largest vaccination drive in the world and was now geared up to universalise it, throwing it open free of cost to every adult citizen above 18 years of age. He appealed to every Indian to get vaccinated and join the ‘Jan Andolan’ against the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/join-fight-against-pandemic-vardhan/article34854624.ece
19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC declines to put off PG medical exam||The Supreme Court on Friday declined to pass a sweeping order to postpone the final exams of the postgraduate medical courses in universities across the country. A Bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and M.R. Shah was hearing pleas by PG medical students, who said preparing for the exams amid COVID-19 duty was difficult. They sought more time to study for the exams. The court said it could not possibly be asked to pass a general order to postpone the exams, for which dates have not been announced yet. The Bench said the National Medical Commission would keep in mind the COVID-19 situation and doctors working round the clock. Universities had not been made parties to the case, it noted. “How do we pass a general order when hundreds of universities are involved” it asked. Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for the students, said his clients would be made to choose between their COVID-19 duty and time off to study for the exams. He submitted this was something doctors should not be compelled to do during these dire times of public health. The court should intervene on behalf of the doctors to ensure that they were given “reasonable time” to prepare for the exams. On June 11, the court refused a plea by these students to waive the exams. The Bench said the court had, however, intervened on behalf of the students wherever possible. On June 11, the court, in a different case, ordered the postponement of the AIIMS’ Post Graduate Entrance Test-INICET exams, scheduled for June 16, by a month after taking into consideration fatigue within the medical community after battling a particularly devastating second wave of the pandemic. In that case, a group of doctors had similarly moved the Supreme Court challenging a notification that announced the exam in June in “utter disregard” of an assurance from the Prime Minister’s Office to postpone PG exams by four months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-declines-to-put-off-pg-medical-exam/article34854596.ece
19 June 2021||CHENNAI,||‘Exploring real-world issues will shape students into leaders’||As part of its Career Counselling 2021 series, held in association with The Hindu Group, the Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science (HITS) hosted a webinar on ‘Why sustainability must be a part of management education’. Dr. David Easow, Deputy Director, International Affairs, HITS, said teaching real-world problems and finding solutions for them shape students into better leaders and make for a sustainable business world. “We all care for our environment and may not be fully aware of the situation in and around us, and thereby not know how to solve it. We must focus on sustainability and the skills to create a better future and should be able to tackle global challenges,” he added. Dr. Miniya Chatterjee, CEO, Sustain Labs, had a question for the audience. What did sustainability mean when it was first coined 200 years ago? They were referring to food, she said, adding, “The meaning of sustainability has changed and moved away from academics. It’s difficult to find universities pushing research on sustainability. The greatest need is for sustainable policies and businesses need education to be backing them. The good news is that there are a few institutions moving in the right direction.” Dr. Manav Subodh, Co-founder 1M1B, and Global Ambassador SCET, University of California, Berkeley, struck a cautionary note. “Sustainability is the buzzword today but tread with care,” he said. Green jobs and green entrepreneurship were something students needed to know about. “We need a world that cares for all. Each one of us should engage and ask ourselves what we are doing and bringing to the table?” he suggested. At the end, the panellists fielded questions from the audience.

19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC requests Calcutta HC to defer hearing in Narada sting case||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear on June 22 appeals filed by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Law Minister Moloy Ghatak against the Calcutta High Court’s refusal to immediately consider their affidavits countering allegations about their role on the day of arrest of four Trinamool Congress leaders by the CBI in the Narada sting tape case. A Vacation Bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian requested the High Court to defer its scheduled hearing of the Narada case on June 21. Vacation Benches in the Supreme Court assemble on Tuesdays and Fridays. The top court urged the High Court to hold over the hearing to June 23. Senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Vikas Singh, for the Law Minister and the West Bengal government, said the affidavits were “essential” to the case. It provides the truth on the events of May 17, the day of the arrest, they said. “If the Supreme Court hearing is kept on Tuesday, the High Court hearing should be deferred,” the senior advocate submitted. “We will keep the hearing on Tuesday. Meantime, we hope the High Court will defer the hearing fixed on Monday to Wednesday,” the Bench noted. A five-judge Bench of the Calcutta High Court is hearing the Narada case. On June 9, the court said it would consider the affidavits later on. Mr. Dwivedi countered the CBI’s claims that Mr. Ghatak was present in the courtroom with a mob when the four TMC leaders were produced after their arrest. The senior advocate said the Minister was in an official meeting at the time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-requests-calcutta-hc-to-defer-hearing-in-narada-sting-case/article34854587.ece
19 June 2021||Kolkata,||TMC seeks transfer of Mamata’s plea on Nandigram poll result||The Trinamool Congress on Friday alleged that the judge assigned to hear the election petition filed by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on the Nandigram poll results had links with the BJP, and sought the shifting of the matter to a different Bench. In a letter addressed to the office of Acting Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court Rajesh Bindal, counsel for Ms. Banerjee asked for the “reassignment of the election petition so as to avoid any prejudice and presumption of prejudice against my client”. Several Trinamool Congress leaders, including party spokesperson Derek O’ Brien, tweeted photographs alleging that Justice Kausik Chanda shared stage with the State BJP president. They also took to social media sharing a list of cases where Justice Chanda appeared as a lawyer representing the BJP. “Justice Kaushik Chanda is seen sharing a stage with BJP’s @DilipGhoshBJP. Unsurprisingly, he’s also the judge who has been assigned to hear the #Nandigram case. As the Indian judiciary system gets murkier day by day, will there be any justice in this case? Only time will tell,” the Trinamool Congress tweeted from its official handle. Responding to the allegations, the BJP’s State unit said the Trinamool Congress was trying to interfere in the judicial process by creating pressure on the judiciary. Advocate and Rajya Sabha member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said judges took oath under the Constitution, and which parties they represented as lawyers was completely immaterial. Earlier in the day, Ms. Banerjee’s petition challenging the election of the BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari from Nandigram was mentioned before the Bench of Justice Chanda.

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Buzz over Centre’s outreach to J&K parties||J&K was split into two Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh 22 months ago.  ‘No invitation yet’ “We have no information about any initiative. We have not got any formal invitation yet. Let them make it public. We have never blocked the way forward,” Gupkar alliance spokesman M.Y. Tarigami told The Hindu. Mr. Tarigami said J&K needed initiatives because the confidence was “completely shattered here”. “I urge the democratic Government of India that enough is enough. Let there be initiatives to restore confidence in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh,” he said. The Gupkar alliance spokesman said the onus of proving sincerity lay with those who “hampered the normalisation” and with the leadership of the country. “We have a set agenda that we agreed upon on August 4, 2019. We are for special constitutional position of J&K and against bifurcation of J&K. We are committed to it. However, this does not mean we will not talk. We will see that legitimate rights of people of J&K are restored,” he added. Sources said both the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), key constituents of the Gupkar alliance, are weighing their options in case a political process is announced by the Centre. The PDP is likely to hold a meeting of its leaders to “take stock of the situation and decide whether to attend it or not”. Sources said the constituents of the Gupkar alliance lack consensus on what terms to engage with Delhi and how to bridge the mistrust, sources said. NC president Dr. Farooq Abdullah, who was summoned and his property was attached by the Enforcement Directorate in a case, has also dropped broad hints at engaging Delhi. Sources said Dr. Abdullah, also president of the Gupkar alliance, is likely to call a meeting of the constituents of the amalgam in coming days. The Centre ended J&K’s special constitutional position on August 5, 2019. It was followed by a major crackdown and jailing of the mainstream leaders political parties, including Dr. Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/buzz-over-centres-outreach-to-jk-parties/article34854583.ece

The BJP members accused Twitter of showing bias against the saffron party, alleging that their fact checkers are more inclined to blame BJP instead of fighting fake news. Sources said that Twitter officials informed the panel that the fact checking is done by a third party and not by Twitter itself. Following the meeting, a Twitter spokesperson in a statement said, “We appreciate the opportunity to share our views before the Standing Committee on Information Technology.

Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, also for the government, said the High Court imputed ambiguity to Section 15 of the UAPA, which defines a “terrorist act”. Justice Gupta said, “We understand the way the Act has been interpreted [by the High Court] requires to be examined”. Mr. Mehta said, “The HC says eventually the riots were controlled, so it does not come under UAPA…. Now someone puts a bomb somewhere and it is defused by the police, is the intensity of the case lessened? If I kill somebody, should I be booked only under Section 302 IPC [murder] and not UAPA even if my act comes under the definition of a ‘terrorist act’.” The law officer was questioning the High Court’s remarks that the provisions of the UAPA are being casually used by the government when charges under conventional penal laws such as the IPC would very well do. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the students, said “I think the Solicitor General has a lot to say, we too have a lot to say.... In the meantime, let us not treat it [High Court judgment] as a precedent”. The court posted the government appeal for detailed hearing on the week commencing from July 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-refuses-to-intervene-on-bail-for-activists/article34854589.ece
19 June 2021||New Delhi,||Panel formed for talks on theatre commands||A high-level committee consisting of representatives from the services and the Ministries concerned has been formed for wider consultations on the creation of integrated triservice theatre commands, defence officials said. The panel includes the Vice-Chiefs of the three services, the Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee, and representatives from Ministries such as Home Affairs, Finance and Law. The decision was taken at a meeting last week after several issues were brought out which concern other Ministries, a defence official said. The committee will examine all issues and find a way forward before a formal note on their creation is sent to the Cabinet Committee on Security. The official said the move was necessitated due to some aspects like bringing in paramilitary forces, which are under the Home Ministry, under the purview of the theatre commands and financial implications that may arise in the process of integration. The creation of theatre commands is now a given with directives at the highest level, the issue is about fine-tuning the proposals and forming a consensus on how they should be, another defence official explained. The mandate of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) includes bringing about jointness among the three services, including through the establishment of joint/theatre commands. The country’s first CDS Gen. Bipin Rawat had constituted teams headed by the Vice-Chiefs of three services to study and submit recommendations on the formation of various commands. He recently stated that the study reports on the two proposed commands — air defence and maritime theatre — are being discussed and would be rolled out by August. However, with differences still to be resolved, there could be some delay. The proposed Air Defence Command plans to integrate all air assets of the armed forces, while the Maritime Theatre Command plans to bring in all assets of Navy, Coast Guard as well as coastal formations of Army and Air Force under one umbrella. On land, the Army’s Northern Command and Western Command would be converted into two to five theatre commands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-formed-for-talks-on-theatre-commands/article34854598.ece
19 June 2021||New Delhi,||Chennithala meets Rahul amid Cong. churn||The meeting of former Leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Assembly, Ramesh Chennithala, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday revived talks of a possible organisational reshuffle in the party. Mr. Chennithala, who had shot off a letter to party president Sonia Gandhi to express his disappointment over the manner in which he was dropped from the LoP’s post, is expected to be made an All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary. Officially, though, the Kerala leader told reporters that he had come to discuss the reasons for Congress’ loss in the recent Assembly elections. Intense factionalism The party is also faced with desertions and intense factionalism in States as diverse as Assam, Punjab and Rajasthan. Barely days after Uttar Pradesh Congress leader Jitin Prasada quit to join the BJP, a four-time Assam lawmaker, Rupjyoti Kurmi, is expected to do the same after resigning from the party as a legislator. While the departure of Mr. Kurmi — a young leader from the tea garden community — hasn’t grabbed headlines, his loss will hurt the Congress’ prospects in Upper Assam, especially among the tea tribes that traditionally voted for the party but have now moved to the BJP. There is still no clarity on who will head the Congress in Assam (the current Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ripun Bora has resigned ) but there is speculation about more desertions in the Assam unit. In Punjab, where the factional fights between Chief Minister Capt. (Retd) Amarinder Singh and cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu have played out under full media glare, there is now a new political realignment within the party. The Chief Minister met his arch-rival and Rajya Sabha member, Partap Singh Bajwa, for a private dinner on Thursday evening. Sources told The Hindu the Chief Minister wanted to reach out to Mr Bajwa so that together they could check Mr. Sidhu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chennithala-meets-rahul-amid-cong-churn/article34854608.ece

19 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||YouTuber Madan nabbed in Dharmapuri||The Cyber Crime wing of the Central Crime Branch has arrested YouTuber Madan Manikkam, who is facing several complaints for hosting obscene conversations with minors and women while live-streaming gaming videos. The police apprehended him in Dharmapuri on Friday. He pleaded with them not to arrest him, saying over 30% of his followers were children and women, and he had committed the offence without realising this, sources said. He was brought to the city, and would be remanded in judicial custody after interrogation. Efforts are on to interrogate others who took part in his chats. A manhunt was launched after he went missing as complaints emerged, and many on social media demanded his arrest. After P.K. Abishek Rabi, of Vadapalani, registered a complaint, the city police filed a case under the provisions of the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code against Madan and his wife, Krithika, both natives of Salem. Madan, an engineering graduate, had incurred huge losses while running an eatery at Ambattur. In 2019, he launched a channel to teach tricks to play video games like PUBG. The games were live-streamed on his channel. Even after the government banned PUBG, he used a virtual private network (VPN) to access the game, and continued to live-stream the videos on his channel, which had over 8 lakh subscribers. The police arrested Krithika, the channel’s administrator, on Wednesday, after confirming that the anonymous woman with whom Madan often conversed with in an obscene manner was his wife.

19 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Steel firm cheats SBI of Rs. 391 cr.||The directors of a steel trading company, who were already booked for fraud by the CBI, allegedly used the same method again to defraud the State Bank of India (SBI) of Rs. 391.30 crore. In a complaint filed with the CBI’s Economic Offences Branch here, the SBI’s Stressed Assets Management Branch accused P.S. Krishnamurthy Steels Pvt. Ltd., Chennai, and its directors P.S. Krishnamurthy and P.K. Vadivambal of defrauding the bank after taking a loan and forging documents to divert the funds. The bank said the account of an associate company of the accused persons, Thangam Steels Ltd., was declared a fraud and a case was registered by the CBI last year. “The directors of both companies are one and the same and the modus operandi is similar,” Stressed Assets Management Branch Deputy General Manager Ravichandran said in his complaint. The allegation is that the company, which is trading in iron and steel, was sanctioned fund-based and non-fund-based limits of Rs. 240 crore under a consortium by the SBI and the State Bank of Mysore. The account turned irregular on November 30, 2012, with the non-servicing of interest and the development of Letter of Credits. A few months later, it became a non-performing asset with an outstanding due of Rs. 222.98 crore. The bank said the fraud took place at the SBI Overseas Branch from where the accused persons “illegally diverted the funds, manipulated the books of accounts with an objective to defraud the bank and to gain unlawfully at the cost of the bank’s funds”. A forensic audit ordered by the bank revealed that the company and its directors cheated the bank of Rs. 391.30 crore in public money by resorting to activities that constituted punishable offences. Though the role of public servants was not detected, the bank requested the CBI to examine the involvement of unknown persons and public servants. However, the bank said lapses were found in respect of follow-up of advance and taking cognisance of early warning signals. The officials concerned were called for explanation, it said. Besides the accused company and its directors, the CBI booked unknown persons and public servants on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and falsification of accounts. The agency also invoked provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, with regard to criminal misconduct by a public servant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/steel-firm-cheats-sbi-of-rs-391-cr/article34854799.ece
19 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin opposes Yediyurappa’s stand on Mekedatu project||Strongly opposing the statement of his Karnataka counterpart over the proposal to construct a dam across the Cauvery at Mekedatu, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday urged the Centre not to approve the plan. Mr. Stalin strongly advocated that Karnataka should drop the proposal as it went against the Supreme Court judgment. Terming the reported statement of Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa that the dam would be constructed soon after the Centre accorded its approval as “arbitrary,” Mr. Stalin condemned it. The Chief Minister recalled having opposed this proposal of a dam across the Cauvery during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Thursday. “The statement by Mr. Yediyurappa in such a situation is not only unfavourable for the good relations between the two States but also an attempt to deceive the farmers of Tamil Nadu,” he said. Tamil Nadu had been opposing the proposal for any dam across the Cauvery contending that such a proposal was against the Supreme Court judgment and would reduce the quantum of Cauvery water for the State. In March 2015, Tamil Nadu Assembly adopted a unanimous resolution against Karnataka’s proposal and handed over a copy of the resolution to the Prime Minister. Mr. Stalin pointed out that there was litigation pending against the proposal and referred to continuous objections registered against it before the Cauvery Water Management Authority. The Cauvery is the lifeline for lakhs of acres of farmlands in Tamil Nadu, especially the delta region, which was known as the “Rice Bowl” of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-opposes-yediyurappas-stand-on-mekedatu-project/article34854795.ece

19 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||City hospital performs complex brain surgery on four-year-old||Doctors at Gleneagles Global Health City (GGHC) hospital have performed a complex surgery on a four-year-old girl to remove a tumour from the brainstem. According to a press release from the hospital, since March last year, the child had been unable to walk and could not talk clearly. She had eye deviation too. In January 2021, she underwent a surgery at another hospital to remove the accumulation of fluid in her brain. However, her condition continued to deteriorate. In March, the girl was brought to GGHC, where the doctors diagnosed that she had a 6 cm by 4 cm tumour in a critical area, occupying and compressing the entire brainstem. The hospital said the child’s parents were counselled about the complex nature of the procedure, the post-operative ventilator support and the prolonged stay at the intensive care unit. Nigel Symss, senior consultant neurosurgeon and clinical lead, neurosurgery, GGHC, said the girl was nearly confined to her bed, and her parents were fatigued from the multiple surgeries she had already gone through. “The biggest challenge was the size and the location of the tumour, considering the age and medical history of the girl. The execution would not have been possible without a multi-disciplinary approach,” he said. Dinesh Nayak, director of neurosciences, GGHC, said all the latest technology was deployed for successful outcome of the surgery. Anaesthesia, a challenge Ramanan, clinical lead, neuro-anaesthesia and neurocritical care, said anaesthesia for children for brain surgeries was challenging. “It required meticulous calculations of drug doses and special equipment called intraoperative neuromonitoring,” he added. Karnan, head, pediatric ICU, GGHC, said the child had a smooth post-operative recovery and could be discharged on the sixth day after surgery. Appreciating the team for the achievement, Alok Khullar, CEO, GGHC, Chennai, said the assessment of risks and the execution of the procedure needed a highly skilled neurosciences team, equipment and protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-hospital-performs-complex-brain-surgery-on-four-year-old/article34854780.ece

At 24.4% (single dose) it is significantly higher than Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru. As far as both doses are concerned, though Chennai has vaccinated only 7.5% of the population, it remains ahead of these cities. The data, till June 17, looks at the actual number of people vaccinated against the total population for the cities, thereby analysing the percentage of the population covered hitherto. At 80,00,000 people, Chennai is the least populous, while Mumbai has over 2,00,00,000 people, and Delhi, over 3,00,00,000. Bengaluru has over 1,20,00,000 people and Hyderabad just over 1,00,00,000. Even in dose-wise coverage among the eligible population (18-plus age group), Chennai is at a high 35.1% of the population for one dose, and 10.8% for both doses. The other metros bring up the tail again. While all cities have better vaccination rates for the 45-59 age group, Chennai leads at 57.8%. Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi says, “The reason for improving coverage is the continuous focus of the government on Chennai, which used to be a hotspot and the biggest source of COVID-19 infections, and particularly with reference to apportioning doses. The GCC has systematically paid attention to the daily vaccination schedule, SoPs and personal follow-up by officials to make sure doses are well-distributed.”  Even in dose-wise coverage among the eligible population, Chennai is at a high 35.1% of the population for one dose||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-tops-in-percentage-of-population-vaccinated/article34854813.ece
19 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Panel will lay strong base for NEET exemption: Minister||The Tamil Nadu government has taken measures to build a “strong base” for seeking exemption of the State from the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and to prevent a repeat of rejection by the President of two Bills passed in the Assembly during the AIADMK government, Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian said on Friday. “The government has established a committee, headed by Justice A.K. Rajan (retired), to study the impact of NEET, keeping the M. Anandakrishnan committee — which was constituted in 2006 and recommended the cancellation of entrance examinations for professional courses — as a model. We want to do this systematically. The first step was constituting the committee. Its report will serve as a strong base so that there will be legal protection in future,” he told reporters. He was replying to Deputy Leader of the Opposition O. Panneerselvam’s recent statement on NEET. Further steps would be taken once the committee submits its report, he said. The committee, formed to build a strong case against NEET, had been given a month to submit is report. It had already conducted four meetings, he said. Mr. Subramanian said the AIADMK government failed to speak for Tamil Nadu students or make a strong representation when the President rejected the two Bills, which the Ministry of Home Affairs returned thereafter. “It was during the AIADMK regime that the NEET was introduced in the State. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said that conducting coaching classes for the NEET at government schools had created confusion among students. The classes are nothing new as they were introduced by the AIADMK government last year,” he added. As of now, NEET was in force. “In this situation, students need to prepare for it. However, the government’s decision is to get exemption,” he said. ‘No hiding of deaths’ As for reports about the under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths, he said, “There is no need for the government and the Health Department to hide deaths due to COVID-19.” He said he had visited 28 districts so far, and during field-visits and discussions, he emphasised that no deaths be hidden. The government was taking measures to prepare for the third wave of the contagion. “When we took over, the daily oxygen requirement was 230 metric tonnes. However, when the daily cases rose to 36,000, the requirement increased to 450 metric tonnes. Now, we have an oxygen stock of 900 metric tonnes,” he said.  The Minister said 70,000 oxygen beds were ready, while paediatric wards with 50-100 beds were being established in all districts. Six to seven beds with ventilators were being set up for newborns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/panel-will-lay-strong-base-for-neet-exemption-minister/article34854803.ece
19 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||UGC website now has a portal for vacancies||The University Grants Commission (UGC) has created an academic job portal on its website for universities to upload vacancies. According to UGC Secretary Rajnish Jain, the portal will enable universities to post job vacancies, and the eligible candidates to find jobs. A similar attempt was made in 2012 but nothing came of it, say teachers’ associations. Teachers and former Vice-Chancellors welcomed it, but they point out that it could at best serve only as a guideline as the UGC has not been able to implement it even at Central universities. Former Anna University Vice-Chancellor E. Balagurusamy said the UGC had the authority to maintain quality in higher education. “They may request the higher education institutions to upload faculty details... It may also include vacant positions. There is nothing wrong and it is not against any State rights. The Commission cannot interfere in the day-to-day administration,” he said. M.K. Surappa, who recently demitted office as Anna University Vice-Chancellor, said only vacancies that had been advertised for by the universities could be uploaded. “When a post is advertised for against a vacancy, it can be uploaded on the portal. We have 600 vacancies at Anna University. How can we upload all of them without the approval of the State government?” he wondered. One of the reasons for Anna University’s poor ranking in the latest QS World University Rankings was the unfilled faculty positions, he said. Former Madras University Vice-Chancellor P. Duraisamy said, “The UGC circular is a guideline for wider circulation and attracting the best talents in the country. It may be mandatory for Central universities but not for State universities.” College teachers speculated that it could undermine the State’s rights. The Association of University Teachers (AUT) welcomed the initiative. “AUT urges the UGC to ensure proper implementation of reservation in teaching positions in these educational institutions,” general secretary M.S. Bala Murugan said. So far, 54,692 candidates with NET; 14,114 candidates with NET-JRF; 15,257 candidates with SET; and 26,788 candidates with Ph.D. have registered. On the same page, the column for the latest jobs posted says, “No latest posted jobs!!!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ugc-website-now-has-a-portal-for-vacancies/article34854809.ece
19 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Dr. Mohan in Nature’s list of milestones advisers||Nature , a multidisciplinary science journal, has brought out a special supplement to commemorate the discovery of insulin 100 years ago.  Nature Milestones in Diabetes highlights the main discoveries in diabetes since 1921 when insulin was first discovered and administered to a group of patients in Canada. The dramatic discovery led to the scientists being awarded the Nobel Prize the very next year. The journal editors have collated articles over the century of significant developments and provided it in a concise form. Each article is less than a page long but filled with interesting information. To come up with the compilation, the editors had sought help from eminent clinicians and researchers from across the world to provide information of what they believed were milestones in the discovery of insulin till date. Among the advisers of the edition is V. Mohan, founder of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation. “I was very privileged to represent India on this distinguished panel of international scientists who helped bring out this document. I believe it is a treasure,” Dr. Mohan said. The journal begins with the journey of Frederick Banting and Charles Best, whose experiments resulted in the development of insulin to treat Type 1 Diabetes in 1921. Dr. Mohan said the scientists started their experiment on May 16 and by July 31 announced their discovery. Dr. Mohan has been listed as one of the milestones adviser from India in the collector’s edition. The editors of Nature sought his guidance and asked him to provide a list of 20 articles on the milestone achievements in the history of identifying and treating diabetes. “Today, they released the book. And I found that I was the only Indian chosen,” Dr. Mohan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dr-mohan-in-natures-list-of-milestones-advisers/article34854791.ece

Two lions have died of COVID-19 at the zoo this month. The zoo administration had sent the samples of 11 lions housed in the park for testing for SARS CoV-2 to the ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal. Initially, the samples of nine lions returned positive for SARS CoV-2 and the animals have been under active treatment since then. The zoo authorities requested the institute to share the results of genome sequencing of the SARS CoV-2 virus that had infected the lions, a press release from the zoo administration read. In this context, the ICAR-NIHSAD director has now informed the zoo that the genome sequencing of four samples showed that all four sequences belonged to the Pangolin lineage, B.1.617.2, and were delta variants, as per the WHO nomenclature.  The zoo authorities said a team of veterinarians was working day and night to treat the infected animals and to keep other animals free from the infection. Through the day, the veterinarians don PPE suits and work to treat the lions, they said. Treating the lions is not easy, and the veterinarians and the animal keepers have forgotten their families and are spending all their time at the zoo, keeping the lions and other animals safe and alive, said a zoo official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delta-variants-found-in-four-samples-from-lions/article34854814.ece

The 72-year-old was arrested at Chittaranjan Park in Delhi by the Crime Branch CID, on charges of sexually abusing girls at a school founded by him. He was brought to Chennai and lodged in the Chengalpattu sub-jail after being produced before a court on Thursday. At noon on Friday, he complained of ill health and was found to have a low blood pressure. He recently underwent an angiogram. He was tested by the medical staff at the prison and subsequently shifted to the Government General Hospital, Chengalpattu. On doctors’ advice, he was shifted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. Meanwhile, the CB-CID sealed a room he had used on the school premises. Further inquiries are on with two women who allegedly abetted him. A co-accused in a case filed against Siva Shankar Baba under the POCSO Act has approached the Madras High Court, seeking anticipatory bail. The petitioner is an English teacher at a residential school where girls had reportedly been subjected to sexual abuse. Justice M. Dhandapani on Friday directed a government counsel to get instructions on the case by June 24. In her petition, the teacher said she was the mother of an 11-year-old girl, and there was no basis for the charge that she abetted the accused in the crime. Stating that she was ready to cooperate with the investigation, the petitioner urged the court to protect her from being arrested and remanded in judicial custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/siva-shankar-baba-admitted-to-hospital/article34854785.ece

Mr. Alagiri said instead of serving the people, the government was selling banks to private entities. He said due to this move, over 26,000 employees of the IOB and 33,000 employees of the Central Bank of India would be affected. “If the IOB is privatised, poor people, common citizens, and farmers in Tamil Nadu will be affected badly. Citizens and political parties must come together to protest against this dictatorial government,” Mr. Alagiri added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drop-plan-to-privatise-iob-cong-urges-centre/article34854790.ece

Doctors said the baby girl was born four weeks before the expected date of delivery to a 23-year-old woman, who had tested positive for COVID-19 a week prior to delivery and remained symptom-free at the time of delivery. The baby’s birth weight was 2.4 kg and was admitted in a government hospital in Andhra Pradesh. The baby developed fever and breathlessness after a week and was referred to a private hospital in Nellore. She tested positive for COVID-19 and was referred to the KKCTH. The CT scan was suggestive of pneumonia. Her inflammatory markers were high. N. Chandrakumar, head of the Department of Neonatology, KKCTH, said the baby was treated with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. “She required ventilator support for three weeks before successful extubation to lesser modes of respiratory support. Despite no requirement for oxygen support, she continued to remain breathless and could not be fed orally,” he said. A CT scan showed pulmonary fibrosis with residual ground glass opacities, suggestive of post-COVID infection-related lung fibrosis. The baby had features of brain involvement in the MRI scan that could be related to COVID-19 and her eyes developed retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The ROP was severe enough to require laser treatment, he said. The baby had been weaned off the ventilator and would be discharged soon, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/newborn-with-covid-19-lung-scarring-treated-in-city/article34854793.ece
19 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘COVID-19 shows need for devolution’||The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the need for devolution of powers, not just at the State-level but also at the district and panchayat levels, said Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, Minister for Finance and Human Resource Development, on Friday. Addressing an online panel discussion on “Federalism versus nationalism — challenges for State autonomy”, organised by the Dravidian Professionals Forum, he said not a single decision taken at the national level for the pandemic, except regarding the procurement of vaccination and certain drugs, could have worked across the country. Stressing the necessity for adopting different strategies even within the State, he highlighted the example of how different approaches were deployed even within Madurai district to tackle the pandemic. He said the pandemic had exposed the limitations of the nationalistic decision-making model and indubitably established the values of devolution of powers. “There is no debate left. If we do not figure out a way to devolve powers, then we have a dismal future ahead of us,” he said. A.S. Panneerselvan, Readers’ Editor, The Hindu , said that while India’s Partition was used as a convenient tool to centralise more powers, another excuse would have been discovered, if Partition had not happened, to implement centralisation. He said that while many traced the centralisation tendency to the Government of India (GoI) Act of 1935, he said it was evident right from the GoI Act of 1858. He highlighted how all the damages done during the Emergency were undone through subsequent amendments by the Janata government in 1977, except for the restoration of education to the State list. He stressed on the need for India to revisit the recommendations of the Rajamannar Committee report on Centre-State relations. Louise Tillin, director, King’s India Institute, United Kingdom, said it was necessary to interrogate the assumption that there must necessarily be a tension between nationalism and federalism. She said it was important in the context of India to look at the vulnerabilities faced by federalism when a single party with a majority comes to power at the Centre. Rajan Kurai Krishnan, associate professor, School of Culture and Creative Expressions, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University, Delhi, said that in India, the expression of the people’s will through electoral democracy happened at the State level. DMK MP T.K.S. Elangovan said there was a need to re-look and amend Schedule Seven of the Constitution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-shows-need-for-devolution/article34854792.ece

In a statement, he said it would be difficult to trace the origin of these Chinese apps and as they did not have any assets, the recovering of money from them was a daunting task. If this activity is not stopped, it would result in people ending their lives, he said. ‘Take action’ The State government and the police should quickly step in to take action against these Chinese apps, Dr. Ramadoss said. He urged the State government to create awareness and caution the people against the usage of these apps and also take strict action against those involved in the scam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-ban-chinese-apps-scamming-people/article34854801.ece

Pointing out that the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had come out with a scheme of earmarking 20 marks for internal assessment, with the remaining 80 marks to be calculated on the basis of the students’ performance in tests and examinations, Mr. Panneerselvam said the State government’s decision to declare “all pass” the students of Class X without mentioning any grades or marks on their marksheets had caused confusion among students and parents. The students were concerned whether the State government’s move might come in their way of finding jobs. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin should hold discussions with everyone concerned and come out with a formula.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fix-formula-for-class-x-marks-ops/article34854788.ece

Since Tasmac shops were closed in 11 districts in the State, smuggling liquor bottles from Karnataka into Tamil Nadu through Bargur and Talavadi has been on the rise in the past one month. Liquor bottles purchased from Karnataka have been transported illegally in vehicles and sold at exorbitant price in these districts. The police have been maintaining a tight vigil to check the transportation in border areas. On Thursday, the Kadambur police were on a vehicle check during which they intercepted three two-wheelers and found 193 liquor bottles in the possession of the five APWs. Inquiries revealed Parthiban, Sakthivel, Mayilsamy, Ramasamy and Suryaprakash had purchased the liquor from Jallipalayam in Karnataka and were planning to sell them in Tamil Nadu at higher price. The police seized their vehicles and arrested them. Kiruba Shankar, District Forest Officer, Sathyamangalam Division, asked Range Officer Bernard to dismiss them from service as they were appointed only on contract basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/five-anti-poaching-watchers-dismissed/article34855104.ece

Contract workers In an email sent to Collector H. Krishnanunni, AITUC district president S. Chinnasamy said there were over 10,000 contract workers working in local bodies and under various government departments in the district on daily wage basis. The minimum daily wage for the year 2021-22 was fixed by the district administration and was released in the District Gazette on October 15, 2020. But the wages were not implemented for the workers in the municipalities of Bhavani, Gobichettipalayam, Sathyamangalam and Puliyampatti. Also, workers at the Government Erode Medical College and Hospital at Perundurai and other hospitals were not given the daily wages as fixed by the administration. “Steps should be taken to ensure all the workers receive their minimum wages,” he urged.  Mr. Chinnasamy said the minimum wages for 2021-22 were yet to be fixed by the district administration and wanted steps taken at the earliest. Since most of them were frontline workers and were performing their duty to the fullest during the COVID-19 pandemic, minimum wages should be fixed at the earliest and implemented, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fix-daily-wages-for-temporary-workers/article34855106.ece

Banumathi’s husband Thangaraj and son Sabari died in an accident on the highway three years ago. The two-wheeler the two were riding was hit by a vehicle when they attempted to cross the road from Perodu to Chithode. On Friday, Banumathi and her daughter Kaviya inaugurated the tar-topped service road in the presence of Minister for Housing and Urban Development S. Muthusamy, Collector H. Krishnanunni, District Revenue Officer Murugesan and Erode RDO P. Premalatha. The service road was laid at a cost of Rs. 40 lakh. The service road was full of pits with gravel protruding at many places. Road users were demanding that the road be tar-topped for over 15 years now. Recently, the Minister inspected the road and discussed steps to re-lay it. Soon works began to re-lay the road measuring 930m length and 5.5m width. The Minister told mediapersons that 45 accidents had taken place on the Chithode stretch of NH and there was a long-pending demand for tar-topping. “Work was completed in four days with the help of volunteers,” Mr. Muthusamy said and added that the road from Perodu to Chithode would be closed permanently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/accident-victims-family-inaugurates-road/article34855107.ece

Sundaram has urged the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicines to establish a vaccination centre at Bhavanisagar for the benefit of the people. In a letter sent to the Deputy Director of Health Services, Erode District, he said there were 15 panchayats in Bhavanisagar Panchayat Union and vaccination was done only at the Primary Health Centres in Punjai Puliyampatti and Vinnappalli. Both these centres were located in Puliyampatti. The centre was very far and people faced difficulty in travelling to the place.

19 June 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Dedicated facility to be set up to redress traders’ grievances||Minister for Commercial Taxes and Registration P. Moorthy and Finance Minister P. T. R. P. Thiagarajan conducted a meeting with representatives of trade associations at the Collectorate here on Friday. Mr. Moorthy said that after a gap of 11 years, his department had conducted a meeting with the representatives of trade associations. A dedicated facility would be set up to redress the grievances of traders. The government would ensure that traders and entrepreneurs did not face any problems in conducting their businesses. Mr. Thiagarajan said that Rs. 9,000 crore had been earmarked from the State’s fund for providing COVID-19 financial assistance of Rs. 4,000 in two instalments to rice ration card holders. Around Rs. 1,200 crore had been allocated for facilitating free ride for women and transgenders in government buses. Increasing tax rates on petrol and diesel had a severe impact on poor families. The Union government had imposed around 48% indirect and direct taxes. However, it was not distributed proportionally between the State and Union governments, he added. Shopkeepers’ plea Meanwhile, shopkeepers in the city said that closure of textile showrooms and other shops during the complete lockdown had severely affected them. The government must permit them to function with fixed timings so that they could revive their businesses, they said. Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association secretary Ashraf Tayub said that there were around 4,000 textile shops in Madurai, including small and big large shops. Madurai, being the textile hub of South Tamil Nadu, the closure of shops for the past one-and-a-half months had severely impacted their businesses. G. Raja, Manager of Saravana Stores, said this was the peak season for textile shops as they record around 30% of their annual sales. Sales of school uniform materials and clothes for weddings formed a major portion of revenue for textile shops. But the lockdown had deprived everything,” he said. With no income, shopkeepers were struggling to pay electricity charges, rent and staff salary. If the shops were not permitted to open for long, soon many would be forced to down shutters for good, said Mr. Tayub. “Hence, the government must permit the functioning of textile shops for a limited time period with compliance to COVID-19 safety precautions,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dedicated-facility-to-be-set-up-to-redress-traders-grievances/article34854931.ece

The Minister said the elephant had an ailment in her left eye last year. For the past year, the professor providing treatment to the elephant was unable to continue it owing to the pandemic. “In the last year, the Finance Minister [as an MLA] also raised this issue in the Assembly. He strictly monitored the health of the elephant during the whole time,” said Mr. Babu. A doctor, Ramani, is providing treatment to the elephant. He works in Theni. Steps will be taken to ensure that he is transferred to Madurai, the Minister added. Mr. Babu said works were under way to restore the Veera Vasantharayar Mandapam, which was destroyed in a fire in 2018. “Once the restoration is completed, a kumbhabishekam will be performed for the temple,” he said. It was during former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi’s regime that a proposal for establishing rope cars for temples on hillocks was announced. But it was not implemented fully during the subsequent AIADMK regime. “All such works that were stalled will be completed by the present government,” he said. Collector S. Aneesh Sekar, Madurai Corporation Commissioner K.P. Karthikeyan and temple thakkar Karumuttu T.

19 June 2021||P. Sudhakar,TAMIL NADU||Feasibility study on linking two major dams to be taken up soon||A proposal to link Papanasam and Manimuthar dams to take the surplus waters of Papanasam dam to Manimuthar Dam will fructify if the feasibility study to be conducted shortly supports it and permission is granted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority as the project has to be implemented inside Kalakkad -Mundanthurai Tiger Sanctuary. If the plan fructifies, excess water from Manimuthar dam will be taken to Vadakku Pachaiyar and Kodumudiyar dams near Kalakkad and Valliyoor respectively to irrigate the dry regions of Radhapuram region. Linking of Tamirabharani – Karumaeniyar – Nambiyar rivers by digging a 73-km-long flood carrier channel to take 2,765 million cubic feet of the 13,758 million cubic feet surplus water, now going waste into the Gulf of Mannaar, has reached the final phase. Once this ambitious project is completed, it will benefit the dry regions of Nanguneri, Thisaiyanvilai and Sattankulam. Since more than 11,000 mcft water is going waste, the AIADMK government had announced towards the fag end of its tenure that a 73-km-long channel will be dug from Seevalaperi on the bank of the Tamirabharani to take the surplus waters up to Vilathikulam in Thoothukudi district via Uppaathu Odai, Malattaaru, Kallaaru and Vaipaar. Now, the proposal for taking the surplus waters of Papanasam dam (143 feet with 5,500 mcft) to the Manimuthar dam (118 feet with 5,511 mcft) has been given a new lease of life. CM gives nod Assembly Speaker and Radhapuram MLA M. Appavu said, “Since it is under contemplation for the past several years, I reminded Collector V. Vishnu about this proposal at the function to release water from Papanasam dam on June 1 for ‘kar’ paddy cultivation. He expressed his willingness to hire a team like technocrats of IIT Madras for conducting a feasibility study. When I mooted this idea to the Chief Minister, he instructed the Public Works Department’s Water Resources Organisation to initiate the feasibility study,” Mr. Appavu said. Taking surplus water of the Papanasam dam, which is situated 264 feet above mean sea level, to Manimuthar dam is possible as it is located at 109 feet above MSL though both the reservoirs are situated seven km apart. “From Manimuthar dam, the surplus waters can be taken up to Aalanthuraiyar in the Western Ghats beyond Panagudi via Vadakku Pachaiyar and Kodumudiyar dams. So, this project will immensely benefit Nanguneri and Radhapuram areas, both rain-shadow regions. On the completion of Tamirabharani – Karumaeniyar – Nambiyar link and these four dams, every part of Tirunelveli district will become highly productive,” Mr. Appavu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/feasibility-study-on-linking-two-major-dams-to-be-taken-up-soon/article34855240.ece

19 June 2021||TIRUCHENDUR,TAMIL NADU||Three more Yatri Nivas planned for Tiruchendur||Three more Yatri Nivas have been planned for Tiruchendur, said District Monitoring Officer and Managing Director of Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation G. Prakash. He visited Tiruchendur on Thursday to inspect the construction of a Yatri Nivas being built for devotees, execution of underground drainage work and the work on Chennai – Kanniyakumari Industrial Corridor passing through Tiruchendur. He said that the Yatri Nivas would be completed within six months while plans were being drawn to construct three more of such facilities – one each on the approach roads to the temple town from Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli and Kanniyakumari. These facilities would come up on lands belonging to the Subramaniyaswami Temple. After parking their vehicles, devotees could board special buses to be operated to the temple from these points. This would reduce traffic congestion in the town. UGD scheme Of the 10,000 residences in Tiruchendur, 5,000 were situated in the areas where underground drainage scheme was being implemented and 250 houses had been given the underground drainage connection in the first phase. After the remaining 4,750 houses were given the connection within the next four months, the scheme would be extended to cover the hitherto left out 5,000 houses so as to cover the entire town. He saidthat 15 acres of the 85-acre garbage yard of Tiruchendur town panchayat would be converted into a pond to collect 40 lakh litres of sewage getting generated in the underground drainage scheme after treating the water properly so that the treated water could be used for raising trees under ‘Miyawaki’ planting method. Moreover, rainwater could be harvested in this pond during monsoon to improve the groundwater table, he said. Besides recycling the liquid waste, the town panchayat should implement credible solid waste management system in Tiruchendur as it receives a huge number of devotees. TWAD Board officials had been entrusted with the assignment of designing a dependable scheme to meet the drinking water needs of Tiruchendur till 2070, Mr. Prakash said. Collector K.

19 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Gandhi Market to be reopened on Sunday||The Gandhi Market in the city is set to reopen for trade from Sunday night. Official sources said wholesale trade is permitted as of now and a decision on allowing retail trade would be taken based on instructions from the government. The market was closed in May this year after the State government enforced an intense lockdown. Although the district administration had asked the traders to shift the retail traders to the G. Corner Railway grounds in April after the government banned retail sale in major wholesale markets in the State in the wake of the second wave of COVID 19, the traders were reluctant to move out. Subsequently, the traders were shifted and allowed to operate from the roadsides on the West Boulevard Road with wholesale traders being allowed to function through the night and retailers in the mornings. The temporary arrangement had caused much congestion on the arterial road in the city. Following the relaxation of the lockdown restrictions recently, the traders have been pressing for reopening of the market claiming they were facing various problems in functioning from temporary places without necessary infrastructure. On Thursday, a group of traders’ representatives, including Ve.Govindarajalu, president, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peramaippu and M. K. Kamalakannan, president, Gandhi Market Vyabarigal Munnetra Sangam, made a representation to Collector S.Sivarasu seeking the reopening of the market from Sunday. Though there was no official communication from the district or civic authorities, traders representatives said they had been allowed to function at the market from Sunday night. When contacted, Mr.Sivarasu pointed out that wholesale trade is already allowed in the Koyambedu market. “Wholesale trade will be allowed during night hours with some restrictions. However, a decision on allowing retail trade at the market will be taken based on the government notification (on the lockdown regulations) expected on Saturday,” Mr.Sivarasu told The Hindu . Meanwhile, the health authorities who had been conducting a series of camps to vaccinate the traders conducted another camp on Thursday when a large number of traders queued up to get the vaccine shots. Mr.Kamalakannan said the traders would follow safety protocols. “We will sell only to buyers wearing face masks. Similarly, they should also adhere to personal distancing. We also request the general public not to visit the market for purchasing vegetables in small quantities, which they can easily get from shops in their neighbourhood,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gandhi-market-to-be-reopened-on-sunday/article34855286.ece

19 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Parents seek recommendation from MPs for admission to Kendriya Vidyalayas||Members of Parliament are understood to be flooded with requests from parents for recommendation for admission of their wards in Kendriya Vidyalayas. A Lok Sabha MP can recommend 10 cases in own constituency. In case there is no KV in the constituency, the MP can recommend cases for admission in KVs in contiguous constituencies. There are three Kendriya Vidyalayas in Tiruchi district, and one each in Perambalur, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts in the central region. Parents rue that the MPs are not doing enough to start new KVs in the region. According to representatives of Parent-Teacher Associations, coordinated efforts of MPs and the State government are required to start KVs under civil sector. The district administrations need to take initiative. The utility of the Centre’s announcement to start 500 new KVs across the country during the 12th Plan Period (2012-2017) was not derived by the district administrations, said A. Devarajan, advisor, Kendriya Vidyalaya Parents Association. The Kendriya Vidyalay Sangathan had expressed readiness to consider proposals for opening new KVs sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India, State governments and Union Territories Administration if the requisite extent of land — minimum of five acres (10 acres desirable) — is provided free of cost by the sponsoring authority. For State-sponsored KVs under civil sector, the Sangathan had specified that the proposals must come from the State government instead of Collectors. Sponsoring authority must provide suitable and sufficient rent-free temporary accommodation to run the classes — 15 rooms roughly of the size of 7 m x 7 m to accommodate at least 40 students per section. A few years ago, there was some forward movement for starting a KV in Pudukottai district in the wake of former MP S. Kumar voicing the need for a KV in Parliament.Land was identified at Machuvadi for construction of permanent building. However, the proposal has been in limbo. The district administrations or the sponsoring entities are also required to provide KVs with temporary buildings for conducting classes till a permanent building is constructed. Initially, classes will be started from I to V with single section. The temporary building must have rooms for Principal,, staff, library, office and accommodation for other miscellaneous activities and for sequential growth for the next three to four years. This approach was adopted while establishing KV in Perambalur and at Golden Rock in Tiruchi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/parents-seek-recommendation-from-mps-for-admission-to-kendriya-vidyalayas/article34855288.ece
19 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Panchayat passes resolution against hydrocarbon exploration||The Pudukudi village panchayat in Andimadam taluk, Ariyalur district, has passed a resolution opposing any move to explore hydrocarbons, not just in the village but in the entire district. The resolution was adopted and signed by panchayat president J. Rajendran at a meeting on Thursday. The special resolution was passed in the wake of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited recently seeking environmental clearance for drilling exploratory wells at 15 places in the State, including 10 in Ariyalur district. “The resolution against the exploration of hydrocarbons expresses the collective sentiments of the farmers and the people of Pudukudi, as any move to carry out the project will adversely affect the livelihood of farmers,” said P. Boopathy of Pudukudi. The resolution said agriculture was taken up at various places, including Tirumanur, T. Palur, Andimadam, Sendurai and Jayamkondam, in the district. Hence, it urged the State government to exert pressure on the Centre to prevent the exploration of hydrocarbons in the district. Members of the public and farmers in the district have been consistently opposing any move to explore hydrocarbons for the past five years, it said. Demanding that the move to explore hydrocarbons be withdrawn, the resolution urged the Chief Minister and the State government to include the district in the Protected Special Agricultural Zone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/panchayat-passes-resolution-against-hydrocarbon-exploration/article34854800.ece
19 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Rare stenting surgery saves girl’s life||A four-year-old girl hailing from Tenkasi underwent a rare stenting procedure at the Kauvery Heart City, here in Tiruchi. She was detected with an atrioventricular septal defect with pulmonary atresia and underwent palliative surgeries. The condition meant that there were large holes between the top and bottom two chambers of the heart and heart valves as well as of a connection between the heart and the lung. Work done through the palliative surgeries failed as the child continued to grow. At 4-years-old, she needed a complete repair where the holes in her heart are closed, the valves are repaired, and continuity established between the heart and the lungs. In addition, the previous surgery needed to be undone in order to normalize blood circulation. However, three months post-operation, the girl suffered from severe headaches and swelling of the eyes. An echocardiogram showed obstruction of the SVC (Superior Vena cava), the upper body vein which had been reattached to the heart. For this, an SVC stenting was required. The patient's financial condition meant that the cost of the stent and the procedure were prohibitive. Once again kind donors agreed to cover the cost of the stent and the Kauvery Heart City administration agreed to reduce the procedure cost. Led by Mani Ram Krishna, Paediatric Cardiologist, the surgery was successful and the child recovered well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rare-stenting-surgery-saves-girls-life/article34855271.ece

Doctors at the triage ward also benefit from the system as they can keep track of vacant beds, patient discharges, and other important vitals. S. Maruthudurai, Medical Superintendent, TMCH, said that the CMIS was devised to tackle the problem of handling information on bed vacancies in COVID-19 wards. "Earlier, at the triage ward, the medical officer would have to contact doctors on each ward to check the details of bed vacancies before they transferred a patient. Now, with the CMIS, the doctors just have to call the helpdesk who will tell them the availability," he said. A team of 50 final-year MBBS students of the Thanjavur Medical College led by S. Ragini and S. Naveenashri work round- the -clock in four shifts to maintain real time information on the system. Explaining it, Ms. Ragini said that 10 squads, consisting of two medical students monitor each ward. As beds become vacant, patients are transferred to various wards, put on oxygen support, etc., real-time updates are made to the system.  Dean, G.

19 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Corporatisation decision upsets defence civilian staff||Flaying the Central Government’s decision to split the Ordnance Factory Board into seven Corporations, mainstream federations of defence civilian employees on Thursday decided to hold black flag demonstration and burn effigy of the document on corporatisation on July 19 (Saturday). The All India Defence Employees' Federation, Indian National Defence Workers' Federation and Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdor Sangh will take further decisions on Sunday on carrying out indefinite strike and fighting back in all ways, a press release said. The Government's decision to corporatise and split ordnance factories will reduce the capacity of a unified conglomorate to produce everything under one roof, and have serious impact on the national security and defence preparedness of the country, C. Srikumar, General Secretary of All India Defence Employees Federation, said. The entire workforce of ordnance factories rejects the decision that was against the past written agreements and assurances of successive governments over the last two decades. The AITUC and CITU have also condemned the Centre's decision to corporatise OFB.  “The decision will have a serious implication on the security, defence preparedness and self reliance of the country," Amarjeet Kaur, AITUC General Secretary, said. "In this case, it is not merely privatisation; it is going to be privatisation with domination of foreign corproates through multi-pronged route. The entire working class movement will resolutely stand by the struggling defence workers against privatisation through corporatisation route," CITU General Secretary Tapan Sen said. The Modi Government has taken an "arbitrary decision" to corporatise ordnance factories by taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, by reneging on assurances given by the Centre in the past that it will not do so, D. Raja, General Secretary, CPI, said. "The CPI would extend its support to the employees of the ordnance factories in their struggle," Mr. Raja said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporatisation-decision-upsets-defence-civilian-staff/article34855274.ece

Since the TWAD Board has sunk more than 200 infiltration wells in the river for supplying drinking water to urban and rural civic bodies of Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi and Virudhunagar districts, extra efforts are being taken to save the river from being polluted. Several tonnes of clothes being discarded by the devotees in the river at Papanasam are being periodically removed. Local bodies have been instructed not to drain the domestic and industrial sewage into the river and asked to create proper effluent treatment mechanism in the land without polluting the groundwater. In Tirunelveli, underground drainage projects are being implemented in phases to take the liquid waste, which is still flowing into the river, to the treatment plant at Ramaiyanpatti. Early completion of the ongoing second and third phases of the underground drainage work is being stressed to save the river. When the omni buses, vans and autorickshaws were washed in the river, those who polluted the river faced instant action from the official machinery. In a couple of instances, cases were registered against them after formal complaints were received against them. Now, this menace has started cropping up again as vehicles including ambulances, which are used to carry bodies and COVID-19 positive patients, are being washed in the river. Corporation officials assured that they would conduct random check along the Tamirabharani and take action against those who wash the vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/river-getting-polluted-as-vehicles-are-washed/article34855236.ece

19 June 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Police launch probe into whereabouts of missing infant||The Palladam police are investigating the whereabouts of a newborn girl who was claimed to be dead by her mother after she absconded from a hospital following delivery. According to Health Department sources, the 36-year-old woman from JKJ Colony in Palladam was admitted to Palladam Government Hospital on June 12, where she gave birth to a girl child. Due to excessive bleeding and other complications, the mother and child were referred to Tiruppur Government Medical College Hospital in the evening and were taken by ‘108’ ambulance. However, shortly after being admitted, the woman allegedly absconded from the hospital along with the child, the sources said. The hospital authorities asked a nurse from the Palladam primary health centre to check the status of the mother and child. When the nurse visited the woman at her residence, she claimed that her daughter was dead and the family members had buried the body, according to the sources. Police sources said that the nurse reported the incident to the Palladam police on June 12. However, no written complaint was submitted and no case was registered as on Friday, nearly a week after the incident.

19 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Record high petrol price hits vehicle owners||Vehicle owners, a majority of whom have tightened their budgets due to financial distress caused by the pandemic, are unhappy with the consistent rise in fuel prices. As on Friday, outlets started selling petrol for Rs. 100.17 per litre from Rs. 99.89 on June 17. With lockdown rules easing but in the absence of bus and metro services, people have been relying on personal vehicles to report to work. Ashish K. from Bengaluru, who uses his car daily to commute to work, said: “Our salaries have been cut and inflation is on the rise. Increase in fuel price has hit us hard. Two years ago, I spent around Rs. 4,000 on fuel a month, now it is as high as Rs. 5,000-Rs. 6,000.” People in the delivery sector, especially those who have signed up on food delivery platforms, are looking at a further drop in daily earnings. “We spend long hours on the road moving from one location to another. Due to the increased fuel price, our earnings have dropped significantly. I get Rs. 20 per delivery. If I earn Rs. 500 per day, Rs. 200 goes towards petrol. It’s not enough to meet my expenses,” said Sreenivas, food delivery agent. Last week, the Congress launched a ‘100 Not Out’ campaign across Karnataka to protest against the rising price of fuel. Congress leader and MLA from Byatarayanapura Krishna Byre Gowda criticised the government for adding to the burden of citizens. “These are tragic times, and the Central government has cut taxes on the super-rich, levying more on common people by increasing prices of essential commodities like diesel and petrol. Prices are not high not because of international crude oil prices, but because of the astronomical taxes being levied,” said Mr. Byre Gowda. He added that the Congress will intensify its agitation. In districts such as Ballari and Shivamogga, petrol touched Rs. 100 last week. A. Balaji Rao, president of Bangalore Petroleum Dealers’ Association, said due to lockdown, fuel consumption in the city has dropped to 60%. “Petrol pump owners get Rs. 3.12 as commission per litre of petrol and Rs. 2.16 for diesel. During lockdown, the number of vehicles on the road was less. Due to drop in the sale, we had a tough time as our operational expenses remained the same.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/record-high-petrol-price-hits-vehicle-owners/article34854744.ece
19 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mucormycosis fatality rate beats that of COVID-19||The mortality rate from mucormycosis or black fungus, a post-COVID complication, is higher than the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of COVID-19 in Karnataka. While the State’s average CFR of COVID-19 is 1.2%, the mortality rate from mucormycosis has touched 7.8%. Till June 17, it had claimed 225 lives of the total 2,856 persons infected. While 2,316 infected persons are undergoing treatment, 191 have been cured and 124 are reported to have left hospitals against medical advice, as per Health Department data. According to the data, Bengaluru Urban has 959 infected persons, the highest in the State. Of these, 825 are under treatment and 49 have recovered. As many as 72 persons have succumbed to the infection while 13 have left hospitals against medical advice here. A rare but serious fungal infection, mucormycosis often manifests in the skin and also affects the lungs and brain. Although it is rarely seen in non-COVID immunocompromised people, it is now mainly seen as a post-COVID-19 complication among those who have uncontrolled diabetes and are immunocompromised following steroid treatment. K. Bhujang Shetty, chairman of Narayana Nethralaya and member of the State’s expert committee on mucormycosis, said there was no need to panic as the root cause of the condition was uncontrolled diabetes, either pre-existing or drug/steroid-induced. “As the infection requires a multi-speciality treatment, involving ENT, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons and general physicians, we have been referring cases to the designated hospitals.” Sujatha B.L. Rathod, director of the State-run Minto Eye Hospital, said that of the 325 treated at the designated Bowring and Lady Curzon and Victoria Hospitals till June 15, 45 had suffered vision loss. Pointing out that Minto Hospital had seen 190 COVID-19 mucormycosis cases since May 11, Dr. Rathod said many patients were getting discharged from private hospitals after surgery and getting readmitted in government hospitals mainly because of the shortage of the expensive drugs needed. Against advice Although mucormycosis is a notifiable disease now, 124 patients have left hospitals against medical advice. Chikkanarasa Reddy, professor of Paediatrics at Bowring and Lady Curzon Medical College and Research Institute, said this is mainly because patients get scared when doctors tell them that their infection has spread to the eyes and that they will suffer vision loss. “We have seen many patients, especially from rural areas, who prefer to live with the infection rather than have their eye removed,” he said. Two children — a 14-year-old girl from Ballari and a 11-year-old boy from Challakere in Chitradurga district — infected with post-COVID mucormycosis had been admitted for treatment at Bowring Hospital and are now doing well. However, both have lost vision in one eye.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mucormycosis-fatality-rate-beats-that-of-covid-19/article34854751.ece
19 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||RWAs conduct community camps to get more citizens inoculated||After working with the civic body to contain the spread of COVID-19 during the peak of the second wave and setting up COVID care centres, Residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) are channelling their resources to get more citizens vaccinated. Many have organised mass vaccination camps or have tied up with private healthcare service providers. Changemakers of Kanakapura Road, a consortium of over 80 RWAs on Kanakapura Road, has vaccinated nearly 7,000 residents from 80 apartments between Sarakki Junction (Outer Ring Road) and NICE Road. The consortium hopes to cover at least 15,000 residents by the end of the month, said Gautam Kamat, treasurer. Renukaprasad G.S. from the Shanthinagar RWA said the association had already held around four camps for the residents in the community. While two camps were held in an apartment, the RWA had booked a one-hour slot at the Primary Health Centre in the locality where residents could get the shot. It was only recently that the Bangalore Apartments’ Federation (BAF), an association of over 950 apartment complexes in the city, launched the #Vax4All campaign. It partnered with Manipal Hospitals, Fortis Healthcare, Narayana Health, and Apollo Hospitals to facilitate community-level vaccination camps covering 10.98 lakh citizens, including residents and staff working there. “Around 450-500 RWAs have nearly completed vaccinating residents. There are a few pending, mostly smaller apartments that were not able to organise camps,”said BAF general secretary Vikram Rai. BAF is trying to organise community camps, where at least 500 vaccinations can be administered a day. Vishnu Gattupalli, also from BAF, said that a vaccination camp was organised at KTPO in Mahadevapura recently. “There was a demand for 2,000 vaccinations; but at the end of the day, 750 vaccinations were administered. With more demand for shots and private healthcare service providers not keen on holding smaller camps, community camps may be the way to go forward,” he said. Many RWAs are also organising vaccine shots for domestic help, drivers, housekeeping staff, and other service personnel. “We are collecting data on helpers, drivers and other service personnel and their family members for the free vaccination drive. We estimate that we will need to cover at least another 4,000 people in this category,” said Mr. Kamat from Changemakers of Kanakapura Road. BAF has also started holding camps for service personnel in various apartments and has tied up with ACT Grants, United Way Bengaluru, Sattva Consulting and Clinikk to provide free vaccines. Over the past three days, BAF’s joint secretary Vidya Goggi said around 1,300 service personnel from 12 apartments had been vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rwas-conduct-community-camps-to-get-more-citizens-inoculated/article34854743.ece
19 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Faced with shortage of drugs, hospitals ration doses||The State government is grappling with a severe shortage of drugs to treat the fungal infection mucormycosis even as cases are on the rise. Doctors, too, have admitted to rationing doses. On Friday, Karnataka State Medical Supplies Corporation Ltd. allotted 2,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B and 2,000 vials of Lipid Complex Amphotericin-B. But that is not enough to meet the daily demand. Multiple doctors told The Hindu that each patient requires five to seven vials of the drug a day. At five vials per person, the allotment is less than half the demand. Preferred drug Of the two drugs, Liposomal Amphotericin-B is the preferred one as the other drug is said to be nephrotoxic and cannot be administered to diabetics and senior citizens. “Most patients who are developing the fungal infection are diabetics and cannot be administered Lipid Complex Amphotericin-B. So the effective availability of the needed drug is much less than what is shown,” said a health official from a district neighbouring Bengaluru. Though private hospitals have been allowed to procure the drug independently in the domestic market, they are unable to do so as most supplies have been taken by the government. The Union government has also barred its commercial import. H.S. Prasanna, president of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said Liposomal Amphotericin-B is being “extremely rationed”. “No private hospital can guarantee patients the full dose of the drug for treatment. Some hospitals are also refusing admission,” he said. He added that some were trying to manage with a less effective alternative drug. Turning to govt. hospitals Patients with black fungus who have had surgeries at private hospitals are turning to government facilities seeking Liposomal Amphotericin-B. At present, there are 169 patients at Bowring Hospital and 177 at Victoria Hospital. Nearly half have had surgeries in private hospitals but sought hospitalisation in the government institutes in the hope that the drug would be available there. However, the drug is being rationed even there, said sources. The government is pinning its hopes on additional allotment from the Centre. The Union Department of Chemicals and Fertilizers on Thursday said that while the domestic production of Liposomal Amphotericin-B had shot up to 3.76 lakh vials for June, 5.33 lakh imported vials had come to the country, which would be distributed across all the States. The PHANA has demanded that the Centre allow them to commercially import the drug from abroad. “I have vendors from Germany, Dubai, and Singapore who are ready to supply the drug commercially. Either the government must import these supplies itself or allow us to do so. There is no room for red tape in a crisis like this,” Dr. Prasanna said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/faced-with-shortage-of-drugs-hospitals-ration-doses/article34854756.ece
19 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||MLC’s allegations are baseless, says govt.||The State government termed as “baseless and untrue” allegations made by disgruntled BJP MLC A.H. Vishwanath that tenders for over Rs. 20,000 crore have been called for execution of Upper Bhadra canal and Cauvery projects without approvals from the Finance Department. A proposal has been submitted to the Centre seeking to declare Upper Bhandra canal as a national project.The project would be implemented at a cost of Rs. 21,473 crore and the Centre would reimburse Rs. 16,125.4 crore with a condition that the execution of the project should be completed by 2023–24. Therefore, the allegation made by the MLC that the project had not been cleared by the Finance Department was wrong and baseless, Water Resources Department Secretary Lakshman Rao Peshwe clarified in an official communication. The Upper Bhadra project was designed to irrigate 5,57,022 acres of dryland in Chitradurga, Davangere, Tumakuru, and parts of Chikkamagaluru districts, he said. The Central Water Commission (CWC) had approved the national project status for Upper Bhadra project and now the proposal was before the technical advisory committee for approval, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mlcs-allegations-are-baseless-says-govt/article34854769.ece

The court also directed the government to submit the decision taken to establish the Bengaluru Sold Waste Management Limited (BSWML) for undertaking the task of solid waste management, which is actually entrusted to the civic authority under the Sold Waste Management Rules, 2016. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the directions hearing of PIL petitions, through which the court is monitoring actions of BBMP in disposal of garbage. It was pointed to the Bench on behalf of the petitioners that the government has appointed BBMP’s Chief Commissioner as interim Chief Executive Officer for the BSWML and it would amount to conflict of interest as he would be the head of both the BBMP as well as the company, to which the responsibility of managing sold waste would be entrusted to.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/can-govt-entrust-swm-job-to-a-firm-hc/article34854737.ece

On Saturday, the State government is expected to announce more relaxations from June 21. Earlier this week, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had hinted at further relaxation. During the weekend curfew, shops selling food, groceries, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish and animal fodder, and also dairy and milk booths will be open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Standalone liquor shops are allowed to offer takeaways during the same period. Restaurants and eateries are allowed to offer takeaways and home delivery. Movement of trains and air travel is permitted. Movement of private vehicles and taxis to and from airports, railway stations and bus stops is allowed on furnishing valid travel documents. An official said that starting Monday, non-essential shops are likely to be allowed to open. But the modalities (time window, whether to allow them on all days or alternate days) will be decided on Saturday. Industry bodies and BBMP Bus Prayanikara Vedike have demanded resumption of public transport as industrial units have been allowed to function at 50% staff strength, and lack of public transport was a hurdle for commuters. “Opinion on whether to allow public transport is divided.

19 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Allot marks, not grades to II PU students: panel||The 12-member committee set up by the Department of Pre-University Education (DPUE) has suggested that II PU students who have been declared passed for the 2021-22 academic year should be awarded marks, not grades. The final call will be taken by the State government. The department had constituted the committee to take several key decisions, including suggesting a methodology to be applied for the promotion of II PU repeaters if exams are not conducted for them. Sources in the committee said an interim report was submitted on Friday. While the department is yet to take a call on promoting repeaters and private candidates, it has decided to promote all freshers and give them marks on the basis of their Class X and I PU scores. Explaining the decision, the source said: “Merely providing a grade will not help as degree colleges will have tight cut-offs,” a source in the committee said. Committee members were reportedly divided on the topic of passing repeaters and private candidates. The HC had directed the State government not to declare results of freshers till a decision was taken on this. On the other hand, the department decided to pass all candidates — repeaters, private candidates, and freshers — who will sit for the SSLC examination. While they will all pass, they will be given grades based on their performance, which will be based on an MCQ format. Candidates who score between 90-100 will get A plus, between 80-89, A grade, between 60-79, B grade, between 35-59, a C grade. Each subject will carry 40 marks and doubled. Internal assessment will be considered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/allot-marks-not-grades-to-ii-pu-students-panel/article34854722.ece

19 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘CM’s son entering temple during ban an eye-opener’||Observing that the matter of B.Y. Vijayendra, son of Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, entering a temple despite the ban imposed under lockdown rules should be an eye-opener for everyone, including political leaders, the High Court of Karnataka on Friday directed the State government to ensure no exception is made for anyone on entry into temples during the ban period. Besides, the court directed the State Executive Committee under the Disaster Management Act to come out with more stringent measures to take action against those who enter temples or allow entry in violation of the lockdown guidelines to be issued after the expiry of the existing guidelines on June 21. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the directions while hearing a PIL petition filed by the city-based Letzkit Foundation and Githa Misra, an intervener. The Bench also directed the government to issue immediate instructions to the temple authorities through the Muzrai Department to ensure that the ban on entry of the public is not violated without exception. The Bench noted that in his explanation to the notice, issued by the Mysuru Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Vijayendra had said that he had, as a vice-president of the State BJP, visited Nanjangud to take part in the party’s COVID-19 relief work. “He wanted to offer prayer outside Sri Srikanteshwara temple. He saw the temple was open and a puja was taking place. Thinking that he could have darshan, he entered the temple, had darshan and immediately rushed out.” The executive officer of the temple, in his explanation to the DC, said that no special darshan was arranged for Mr. Vijayendra. “Since he had reached in front of the temple during the morning puja, he was allowed to have darshan.” Wrong photos Meanwhile, the Bench expressed displeasure over the application filed on behalf of the intervener enclosing online media reports, which had published photos of Mr. Vijayendra performing religious rituals inside some other temple in 2018 and 2020 as representative pictures along with write-ups on Mr. Vijayendra’s May 18 entry into the Nanjangud temple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cms-son-entering-temple-despite-ban-an-eye-opener-hc/article34854749.ece

Schools are hoping to restart offline classes in a few months and such vaccination drives may result in fewer disruptions in the 2021-2022 academic year during the predicted third wave, said school principals and management members. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, Delhi Public Group of Schools, said around 5,000 people, including staff, parents and people belonging to the community around the school, were vaccinated in Delhi Public School (Bengaluru East) and Delhi Public School (Electronic City). “Similar drives will begin shortly in two other branches. We tied up with Manipal Hospitals for the camp and we will also facilitate the second dose,” he said. Shweta Sastri, managing director, Canadian International School, said the school had recently conducted a vaccination drive. Cost of jab While parents have to pay for their shot, a few schools are trying to bear the cost themselves. Greenwood High recently conducted a two-day vaccination drive for parents, staff, and dependent family members. “Students aged above 18 were also vaccinated. Over 500 people were vaccinated and the cost was borne by the school,” said Niru Agarwal, trustee, Greenwood High. Some like National Public School, Rajajinagar have not only invited family members to register but also immediate neighbours, domestic help and staff who work for families. Parents are thrilled that schools are taking the initiative. “We were unable to get appointments on the COWIN portal.

According to the information by Director of KIMS Ramalingappa Antaratani, a team of doctors from private hospitals too has joined hands with KIMS and with their assistance so far, surgeries had been conducted on 116 patients of mucormycosis and preparations were on to conduct surgeries on 40 more.

Of the 116 surgeries, 106 were related to the E&T Department of the hospital and 10 from the Ophthalmology Department. Another 40 patients are awaiting maxillofacial surgery. Out of the 170 black fungus patients who were treated at KIMS, eight have died due to related complications, Dr. Ramalingappa has said. He said that the government had arranged supply of requisite medicine for the treatment of black fungus. “As the E&T Department of the hospital has just 60 beds, arrangements have been made to utilise available beds in other departments of the hospital to ensure treatment to the patients.

19 June 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Another old well found in Mangaluru||The ongoing road widening work by Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) has led to the discovery of an old well, said to be more than a century old one, at Ratrakavi Govinda Pai Circle, which is popularly known as Navabharath Circle, in the heart of the city. The MSCL had recently restored another old well at Hampankatta in the central business district. Workers engaged in dismantling the structure to facilitate road widening and renovating the circle were surprised to find an opening in the middle of the structure recently. As they widened the opening, breaking the slab, the workers found water deep below. Some residents of the area said the well was used to quench the thirst of horses at the nearby horse cart stand. Mayor Premanand Shetty, quoting residents, said the then Mangalore Municipal Council got the well closed on the demand of the residents who said many people had committed suicide by jumping into it. The Mayor said the well would be restored by Sevanjali Charitable Trust, that has been entrusted with work on beautifying the circle by the corporation. He said, “The MSCL has taken up work on widening Dongarkery Road, Sharada Vidyalaya Road and is also laying a footpath near Rambhavan Hotel. Accordingly, the alignment of the circle will change. The circle will be marked and the trust will be asked to start the beautification work as per the terms and conditions imposed by the MCC,” he said. Sevanjali secretary G. Hanumanth Kamath said the trust would submit a detailed beautification plan for the circle after ascertaining the space available at the location. With the well emerging at the location, the trust would also include it in the plan. Work would start once the MCC gives clearance. In September last year, an old well was found while the MSCL took up junction improvement works at Hampankatta Circle. Another well was found near the bus shelter in Leewell in Bolar in September 2019, which has been restored by the Archaeological Department.  The circle will be marked and Sevanjali Charitable Trust will be asked to start the beautification work as per the terms and conditions imposed by the civic body Premanand Shetty,Mayor||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/another-old-well-found-in-mangaluru/article34854841.ece

19 June 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||A thriving paddy field in the middle of a concrete jungle||Amid growing urbanisation, paddy continues to be cultivated on a small patch of land in Ashoknagar area in the heart of the city for over three decades. And it is all thanks to the hard work of Francis Saldanha, a retired government employee and an urban farmer in the true sense. The 1.25-acre paddy field is perhaps the only one of its kind in the centre of the city now. Though the once-rich paddy fields in the city are giving way for mutli-storeyed buildings, housing sites and other projects, Mr. Saldanha continues to grow his food on his own on the land inherited by his family. “It gives me pleasure,” the 68-year-old Mr. Saldanha, a former employee of the Karnataka Government Insurance Department (KGID), told The Hindu . He grows one kharif crop and harvests 12 quintals of paddy out of it. “I get 68% of rice from the paddy harvested,” he said, adding that he sold the rice in excess among his relatives. Paddy farming is his childhood interest. He got the certified seeds from the Agriculture Department. The varieties cultivated, such as MO 4, Jyothi, and Jaya, varied depending on the supply from the department. “I have been adopting a direct sowing method without depending on mat nursery method,” the senior citizen, who still physically works on the field with other farm labourers, said. Normally, the sowing is done between June 25 and June 30 of every year and the crop is harvested in the first or second week of November. He is depending on well water and rainwater for the job. Not perturbed by the rapid urbanisation taking place in the surroundings, Mr. Saldanha said that when many were looking for good land to purchase, why would he think of selling it when he did not have any problems out of it. Not only his wife, who was a school teacher, family members and relatives too have encourage him, and his neighbours have no qualms about the paddy field next door. “They are all happy,” he said, adding that once the paddy harvest gets over he cultivates vegetables on the same land. Mr. Saldanha commenced sowing seeds on Thursday for this kharif season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-thriving-paddy-field-in-the-middle-of-a-concrete-jungle/article34854839.ece

In a memorandum submitted to the Chief Minister through the Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada, State general secretary of the sangha Ravikiran Punacha said that when farmers are yet to recover from loss suffered during the first lockdown, the second announced this year has hit them hard.

The prices of fertilizers have shot up, the KRRS said. The government is yet to pay farmers for procuring paddy, ragi and other produces at the procurement centres under the market intervention scheme. Many a sugar factory too owe farmers money for sugarcane they bought. Farmers yet to get lakhs of rupees dues under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bhima Yojana, it added. The KRRS said that the government should supply free seeds for sowing and sell fertilizers and pesticides at concessional rates. It should purchase coconut under the market intervention scheme by setting up procurement centres at the earliest. The government should declare a compensation of Rs. 10,000 to each family of farmers. The association said that the government should waive interest on crop loans and other farm-related loans for six months. The coastal package for paddy should be continued. The government should intensify COVID-19 sample test in rural areas to prevent the further spread of the infection among farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/krrs-urges-govt-to-study-crop-loss-due-to-lockdown/article34854825.ece

The assistant engineer of the Public Works Department (PWD), Peerumade division, said the works on the 18-km stretch were progressing at a slow pace now. The granite used to be brought from a crusher unit at Anakkara, near Kumily. When the unit was closed, the material was procured from units outside the district. However, supply fell short as protection walls had to be constructed at many places on the hilly stretch. “Only one-third of the manpower is being used for the work due to the shortage of material,” said Shijo, project manager. He added that works would have to be stopped in a week if the construction materials were not made available. The lockdown also impacted the works’ progress, he said. Chances of landslip It is feared that rain could trigger landslips if the protection walls are not built on time in areas where large-scale earthwork has been done. As per the agreement, the works have to be completed before April 2022. Meanwhile, the district administration has begun a survey to find the quantity of rocks blasted on the Gap Road stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway in Munnar. Site inspection A team of geologists will inspect the site and submit a report following complaints that huge rocks from the area were crushed and sold as granite to other customers, according to Devikulam Subcollector S. Prem Krishnan. As per rules, the blasted rocks can be used only for the road-widening works there. The Rs. 268.2-crore road-widening works on the 41-km Munnar-Bodimettu stretch were launched in 2017.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/material-shortage-hits-hill-highway-works/article34855258.ece

Road that were relaid by Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) three years ago as part of the Kochi metro project. A decision on this will be taken shortly, official sources said. The newly laid tiles, including tactile tiles that were laid on the footpaths to guide visually-challenged people, were dismantled at frequent intervals to declog drains as part of the pre-monsoon maintenance work in May this year and in 2020. “The issue was that there were limited number of manholes on the footpaths. They are not enough to clean the drains, and the tiled portion had to be dismantled,” corporation sources said. Officials of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the agency which executed metro construction and footpath renovation projects, said they had demonstrated to officials of the civic agency a method to lift footpath slabs, if need arose, and to place them back. Rebutting the argument, corporation officials said there was no option but to dismantle the tiles and carry out declogging. The PWD owns both roads and ought to rebuild the footpaths, since the corporation’s responsibility is only to declog them. KMRL will not do anything now since its defect liability period is over. In the meantime, KMRL has decided to dismantle tiles on the footpath on the Thykoodam-Pettah stretch which were laid over three years ago, to raise low-lying drains in the area. This was because the drains sank when the road was relaid, metro sources said.  There are limited number of manholes on the footpaths.

Yes, according to Rajesh K.R., an art teacher in Aluva and a record holder in pencil art. “They should first start with letters. Those above 10 years can practise pencil lead art. They can slowly try carving images once they are thorough with letters,” he says. Pencil carving tests an artist’s perseverance. It is a challenge, according to world-renowned Russian sculptor Salavat Fidai, who creates micro sculptures out of pencil lead. “Graphite is an interesting material. It is very fragile. Every time, I don’t know if I can finish my sculpture. I always test myself and look for the boundaries of human capabilities,” Fidai says in an Instagram chat. For Rajesh, it was the testing times of the lockdown, after the first wave of the pandemic hit the country, that took him to the world of pencil lead art. Inspired by those who created world records with the medium, Rajesh, who loves films, started to chip and chisel the names of national award winners in Malayalam cinema on pencil graphite. “I terribly failed and broke almost 55 pencils in the beginning. However, I persevered.” Rajesh finished sculpting names by the time the second wave of the pandemic hit the country. Now, he has a few records to his name for carving out the names of 16 Malayalam actors who won the National Film Award for Best Actor, on 16 different pencil leads. He wishes to present his work to Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA). Rajesh uses a spotlight when he works on pencil lead. Surgical knife is his main tool, besides pins, to carve out sculptures from lead. For him, it is like untying a thousand knots in the mind. “Graphite is a delicate medium. You cannot be hard with it. Be soft and handle it like you are taking care of a baby,” he says. A former resident of Edathala SOS Village, where children without parents find a home, Rajesh, a graduate in fine arts, now stays in a single-room rented house at Kalady.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/carving-records-on-pencil-lead-in-pandemic-times/article34854960.ece

The excavations are being spearheaded by PAMA Institute for the Advancement of Transdisciplinary Archaeological Sciences, a non-profit research organisation. The ASI has named K.P. Mohandas, head of its Thrissur Circle; Linto Alappat, head of Geology Department, Christ College, Irinjalakuda; Rajesh C.V. and Abhayan G., faculty, Department of Archaeology, Kerala University; Veenus Jain, head of History, Amity University; and Deepak P., faculty, Department of Computer Science, Queen’s University, Belfast, as co-directors of the project. The Pattanam excavations, launched in 2006-07, resumed in January 2020 after a five-year hiatus. Objective The main objective of the Muziris research project is to gather evidence and analyse ancient India’s trade and cultural transactions from the coast of Gujarat to Bengal and beyond. So far, excavations at Pattanam have unearthed relics of three dozen cultures linked to diverse geographies that extend from the Hepu site in southern China to Catalonia in Spain, from 5th century BCE to 5th century CE. They point towards a highly sophisticated culture flourishing in the Periyar delta, with its indigenous settlements dating back to 1,000 BCE. Crucial artefacts The excavations of the 10th season had unearthed important artefacts, including a seal ring with the image of Greek sphinx closely resembling the seal ring of Augustus Caesar — the first Roman Emperor — and a Greco-Roman head statuette. PAMA aims at transforming Pattanam village into a knowledge hub and a model world heritage site, with public participation, according to R.V.G. Menon and P.J. Cherian, chairman and director respectively of PAMA. Field research will commence at Pattanam and Mathilakam once the COVID-19 situation is under control. In the meantime, PAMA is planning a ward-based survey on both banks of the Periyar to document the material surface remains and to collect associated information from local communities. The project titled ‘Periyar River Valley: Mapping Materials and Memories’ aims to discern the role of Pattanam hinterland in the making of the Muziris port. PAMA has created a digital group of ward members of panchayats / municipalities on the banks of the Periyar for the exercise. The aim is to familiarise them with digital modes of investigation and help them develop a deeper understanding of the Periyar that flows from the Western Ghats to the Indian Ocean. Students and science enthusiasts can become part of the project by registering and paying online a fee of Rs. 200. Details are available on www.pama.org.in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/asi-to-be-partner-in-muziris-excavations/article34854913.ece

Babu, a toddy tapper from the scenically set Elamkunnzppuzha grama panchayat, where the backwaters meet paddy fields and verdant coconut groves to inspire a million postcards of Kochi’s natural beauty. But the scenic setting is a gloss over the grinding poverty and hardships brought in by the COVID-19 lockdown on people such as Babu, who makes a living by selling toddy tapped daily. He runs a family of five solely on his earnings after his three sons lost their jobs following the pandemic outbreak. He says the restrictions associated with COVID-19 have made life harder as there is no buyer for the nectar from palm trees, which used to be sold quite quickly during normal times. Thursday morning he was able to tap about three litres of toddy, which, he says, was sold for a little over Rs. 350. The money will also take care of his medicine supply, which costs about Rs. 50 a day. He has been using a walking stick for more than a year following his recovery from a cardiac problem. But physical disability is no bar on his enthusiasm. The last 40 days have seen virtually no work and no earnings. The free food kit supplied by the government has kept the hearth going, he says. However, it does not mean that he can take a little rest. The coconut trees being tapped for toddy have to be attended to daily so that they are ready as and when the lockdown eases. Toddy tapped during the lockdown has been put down the drain because there have been no buyers, he says. The coconut grove on RPS Chira at Elamkunnappuzha panchayat has more than 1,000 coconut trees, which used to be tapped by 16 tappers. But the number of tappers has come down to just four now. The 61-acre coconut grove now has just a few tappable trees as there are not enough hands to take care of the trees regularly, says Babu. But Babu keeps smiling. Even while describing his hardships, he does not complain. The pandemic has landed everyone in trouble, he says.  They say the restrictions have made life harder for them, as there is no buyer for the nectar from palm trees||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemic-leaves-toddy-tappers-in-low-spirits/article34854967.ece

The second phase extension to Kakkanad is awaiting the Union Cabinet’s sanction, and Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has cited this as the reason for not revealing the expected passenger patronage mentioned in the detailed project report (DPR). “This testing of the waters is crucial before a decision is taken to take the plunge for metro rail, a mass rapid transport system (MRTS) that is highly capital-intensive. The conventional metro rail costs around Rs. 250 crore per km and needs further investment for last-mile connectivity, which is yet to happen in Kochi. The State government, which will have to provide substantial funding and repay the loan from French development assistance agency AFD is currently not in a position to set apart funds for the Rs. 1,957-crore Kakkanad extension and subsequent extensions,” sources said. It is estimated that an entire fleet of 250 Volvo buses and allied infrastructure like modern bus stops can be established using the Rs. 250 crore that a kilometre of metro rail costs. These buses will in turn act as a feeder system for the existing metro. In addition, buses will considerably lessen the need for last-mile connectivity, since they can be diverted through newer routes where demand arises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/buses-to-test-waters-before-metros-plunge-on-new-routes/article34854954.ece

It was fully booked for the season in 2020 when COVID-19 brought everything to a standstill. If the initial shutdown was bad enough, the second one has been devastating for several islanders like him who rely heavily on tourism. Since the ecologically fragile delta islands thrive on the annual tourist influx, their economy has been shattered with the second wave that sent the State back into a lockdown. People’s predicament “I started this three years back with all my savings and bank loan. We lost the last two seasons due to the pandemic and now they are talking about another wave," says Mr. Ramesh, an expatriate. Many people in the island face the same predicament . “There are many homestays in the island as foreigners prefer that. Right now future looks very bleak and I have no idea how we will repay the loans,” he adds. Many of the islanders were looking forward to a better season from renewed activity when the restrictions following the first wave were lifted. “But when business started picking up the second wave came as a cold shower and the blow was heavier,” says Mini Suryakumar, panchayat president. Only option She adds tourism was the only option for the residents when climate change-related problems left farming more of a gamble. “Over the years, traditional industries such as coir vanished and farming too has become risky due to the tidal flooding.,” says Ms. Suryakumar. Munroe Thuruthu tourism was all set for a major leap with the announcement of an array of projects when the pandemic hit. The island was expected to offer more jobs to the residents with the completion of houseboat terminals and landing facilities. “The pandemic has rendered many of the islanders jobless,” says Joy, a country boat operator.

The department is also planning to discourage home care once the daily caseload in the district goes below 1,000. “Maximum patients will be shifted to domiciliary care centres of COVID First Line Treatment Centres. We will check protocol compliance among patients under home isolation, and if we find any risk factor, they will be shifted immediately,” the official said.  Despite strict enforcement, TRP remains high in some pockets, and the department has opted for a new strategy to counter this. “We are conducting daily meetings and reviews in local bodies to ensure compliance of revised guidelines. All vulnerable parts are being visited and small clinics have been instructed to test all fever cases,” said the official. At present, nine mobile units of the department are on field to conduct RT-PCR and antigen tests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tighter-vigil-among-plantation-workers/article34855260.ece

Rajappan, a differently abled man from Kaippuzhamuttu in Kottayam, who won global attention for his efforts to clean up Vembanad Lake, has lodged a police complaint against his sister for allegedly cheating him. In a complaint submitted to Kottayam District Police Chief D. Shilpa, Mr. Rajappan accused his sister Vilasini of withdrawing Rs. 5.08 lakh from a joint bank account at Kumarakom without his knowledge. The incident came to light when the complainant collected a statement of his financial transactions from the bank to process the receipt of a cash award from Taiwan. A First Information Report has been opened against Ms. Vilasini, her husband Kuttappan and their son Jayalal. Meanwhile, the complainant’s sister refuted the allegations and told media persons that she had withdrawn the money for purchasing land and constructing a house for her brother. The plan, however, failed to take off due to the pandemic-induced lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rajappan-files-cheating-plaint-against-sister/article34855263.ece

According to the police, the youth, a local resident, trespassed into the railway line even as Palaruvi Express was approaching the point. As the train stopped, he lay on the track under the train. Following an alert raised by local people, officials from the Kaduthuruthy police station reached the spot and they, along with railway police officials, eventually managed to bring him out. The person has been shifted to the Government Medical College Hospital in Kottayam for a medical examination. Following the incident, rail traffic along the route faced disruptions for about half an hour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rail-traffic-disrupted/article34855262.ece

During the process, the Public Works Department will clear encroachments from land which is being used to keep run-down vehicles and other junk materials. A Sub Collector and a few Revenue Divisional Officers have been entrusted with the task of completing it on time with the support of the police and other taluk-level revenue department officers. The sub divisional magistrates concerned will prepare a report ahead of removing the dumped vehicles to another spot to avoid any legal complications in the future. “The task will have to be completed in three months as per the orders from the Ministry of Public Works and the Collector. Vehicles which were temporarily kept along the road in connection with various cases will be shifted to another spot,” said a Revenue Department officer from Vadakara taluk. He said there were many such dumped vehicles involved in various accident cases. The swift action comes in the wake of a series of complaints that such unnoticed obstructions along narrow roads have been causing accidents. Some of the complainants had also brought it to the attention of Public Works Minister P.A. Mohammed Riyas for action. There were also complaints from environmental activists, who claimed that the damaged mechanical parts were causing environmental pollution. Following the latest directive, efforts are also on to identify the owners of some of the visibly fit vehicles which were found abandoned along the city and rural roads. The majority of such vehicles are motorbikes. According to Station House Officers from various city stations, tracing the owners of such vehicles using registration numbers alone will not be easy. But, it can be done within a couple of months after shifting the vehicles to other convenient spots, they say. With the intensified vigil against the misuse of public space, the private agencies engaged in the disposal of condemned vehicles will have to make use of their own yard for keeping such vehicles. Following the directive of the local police, many such agencies are now busy with clearing the temporarily occupied wayside space. Owners of wayside garages will also have to arrange their own space for repair works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unclaimed-vehicles-dumped-on-highways-to-be-removed/article34854943.ece
19 June 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Tree-felling case: Cong. seems unsure of strategy||The Congress leadership in the State is still searching for ways to politically take on the Left Democratic Front government in the illegal tree-felling controversy. Already, Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan and his predecessor Ramesh Chennithala have sought either a judicial inquiry in the case or an investigation under the supervision of the High Court. However, a section of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leaders are rooting for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A senior functionary of the Congress said the KPCC had not devised a common strategy to counter the government. They believe that a judicial inquiry would be time-consuming and be just confined to a report with recommendations. However, a probe by the Central agency would unravel the truth behind the issuance of two Revenue Department orders to fell trees on government-allotted lands. Conspiracy angle Besides, sources said, the CBI would be better equipped to handle the probe into the ‘conspiracy’ behind the revenue order on October 24, 2020, which was a continuation of its earlier order on March 11, 2020. The orders permitted the cutting of all trees, except sandalwood, when several laws stated that the rights of scheduled trees (teak, rosewood, ebony, and sandalwood) were vested with the government. Sources said Communist Party of India (CPI) leaders E. Chandrasekharan and K. Raju were Revenue and Forest Ministers respectively then. Only a CBI inquiry would expose the real culprits who plotted for the issuance of the orders so as to ‘help the timber lobby and to generate funds for the Assembly polls.’ The previous Left Democratic Front government had withdrawn the consent accorded to the CBI to operate in Kerala voluntarily after the Central agency decided to investigate corruption charges in the LIFE Mission, a housing project of the government. Now, Congress sources said, an intervention of the High Court was necessary to initiate a CBI probe. Already a petition had been filed in this regard. “The KPCC leadership would react at an appropriate time,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tree-felling-case-cong-seems-unsure-of-strategy/article34854914.ece
19 June 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Poet Ramesan Nair no more||S. Ramesan Nair, poet and lyricist, died here on Friday. He was 73. He was undergoing treatment at a private hospital here after he tested positive for COVID-19. He was a poet and lyricist who had to his credit several hit Malayalam film songs. His first album was was a devotional one. It came four years before he debuted in cinema in 1985 with Pathamudayam , from which the melody, Mangalam paadunna sangeetham.. ., gained attention. Many hits He followed it up with more hits like Vanasree mukham nokki… (Rangam), Poomukha vaathilkal… (Rakkuyilin Ragasadassil), Neeyen kinaavo… (Hello My Dear Wrong Number), Kunnathoru Kunniludichu... (Abhayam Thedi), Chandanam manakkkunna… (Achuvettante Veedu), Oru poo viriyunna… (Vicharana), Devasangeetham neeyalle…(Guru), O priye…(Aniyathi Pravu), Vibhavari raagam…(Rishyashringan), Mayilaayi parannu vaa.. (Mayilipeelikkavu), Oru kunju poovinte… (Chandranudikkunna Dikkil) and Manju pole… (Dost).  Mr. Ramesan Nair wrote some 650 songs for close to 150 films. His biggest legacy though is his devotional songs. His ardent ambition to become a lyricist led to the birth of arguably the greatest devotional album in Malayalam – Pushpanjali which had songs like Vadakkumnathanu suprabhatham…, Vighneswara janma nalikeram…, Ambadi thannilorunni…, Mookambike…, Neelamegham… and Koodum pinikale… Its composer P.K. Kesavan Namboodiri was his colleague at the Thrissur All India Radio station. “Pushpanjali would not have happened if Mr. Ramesan Nair was a little less ambitious,” Namboodiri had once told this writer. “He always wanted to be a lyricist and he had asked me on many occasions to compose some of his lines and make P. Jayachandran, a close friend of mine, sing them.” Pushpanjali was a huge hit. One of those impressed by the songs of Pushpanjali was K.J. Yesudas, who called up Namboodiri to record a devotional album for him. So the composer joined hands with Mr. Ramesan Nair once again. The result was the Vanamala . One song from the album stood out. Guruvayoorappante pavizhadharam muthum… is perhaps as good a devotional song as any in Malayalam ever. And you don’t have to be devotee of Lord Krishna to enjoy the song: it is sheer melody. The poet is survived by his wife, P. Rema, and son, Manu Ramesan, who is a music director.

19 June 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Easing of curbs is no solace to private bus operators||Long days of disrupted service during the lockdown period has affected the ‘fitness’ of many private buses in Kozhikode district. Despite the eased regulations, it may take several weeks before they resume normal service. There is heavy rush in workshops, which in turn are witnessing a shortage of labourers for the repair works. Replacement of components is putting a huge burden on the already ailing industry. Some bus operators are struggling to renew vehicle insurance. At least Rs. 70, 000 will be required for the renewal of annual insurance for a 48-seat bus. Many of them have demanded waiver of vehicle tax, which comes to around Rs. 1.2 lakh a year. “Only 750 out of the 1,260 private buses are in the field now, because of the increasing operational cost. The remaining bus owners have stopped services by submitting Form G to the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) in their attempt to save motor vehicle tax,” says M. Thulasidas, district general secretary, Kerala Bus Operators Association. He adds that owners of tourist buses have been hit the hardest. Mr. Thulasidas says that the post-lockdown directive of the State government to streamline private bus services using ‘odd and even number method’ would add to the bus operators’ hardship. Meanwhile, officials with the MVD say the State government will soon hold a discussion with the operators and find practical solutions to the complaints. A favourable announcement was likely by Friday evening, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/easing-of-curbs-is-no-solace-to-private-bus-operators/article34854946.ece

He questioned the wisdom of keeping places of worship shuttered while allowing buyers to swamp liquor outlets and bars. “The government should explain the rationale behind the decision.” Cinema halls and public libraries should allow patrons, he said. The mental distress caused by stay-at-home orders and loss of livelihood was unquantifiable. The government should urgently open parks, beaches, weekend holiday destinations, and walking circuits.

Test positivity rate continues to show a decline and on Friday was 10.22%.

Cumulative COVID-19 case fatality now stands at 11, 833 with the State adding 90 deaths, which occurred in the past two or three days, to the official list of COVID deaths on Friday.

Mr. Chennithala had signalled his resentment at “not being kept in the loop” about the high command’s decision to appoint V.D. Satheesan as Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader. Mr. Chennithala met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at the latter’s residence in New Delhi, triggering speculation that the party might accommodate him in the national leadership structure. Later, All India Congress Committee general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal met Mr. Chennithala at Kerala House. Mr. Chennithala told reporters in New Delhi that he would always abide by the high command’s decision. Generational change Mallikarjun Kharge, the party’s leader in the Rajya Sabha, ostensibly authored the generational change in the CLP after meeting Congress legislators and MPs. Mr. Chennithala reportedly had no inkling of the high command’s thinking. As a result, he felt blindsided by the high command’s decision, sources close to him said, adding Mr. Chennithala, who headed the ‘I’ group, had a clear majority in the CLP. Like the then Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran, Mr. Chennithala had awaited the high command’s decision. Mr. Chennithala felt the party had denied him a graceful exit. Moreover, some compatriots had attempted to create an impression via media that he was clinging on to the post. His camp said the reports had hurt Mr. Chennithala. Mr. Chennithala had also taken exception to the high command’s decision to appoint former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy as head of the election management committee. However, he had gone with the high command’s decision and worked with Mr. Chandy and Mr. Ramachandran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-moves-to-placate-disappointed-chennithala/article34854972.ece

With the Centre deciding to provide vaccines to States for administering to all categories of people above 18 years free of cost, issues of vaccine scarcity are expected to be laid to rest. The State government may resume spot registration for vaccination, alongside the prior registration and vaccination slot booking through the CoWin portal. The State had earlier decided to scrap the process of spot registration following large-scale overcrowding at inoculation sites amid vaccine shortage. “Vaccination is now accessed only by those who know how to handle a mobile or a laptop well and those who know when the booking sites open online. Because vaccination sites and doses available per session are limited, the free slots get over in just 10 minutes. People end up spending days just to get a slot and then too, they are forced to travel to the nearby panchayats or towns for getting the shots,” says G.S. Vijayakrishnan, president, Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association. Vaccination needs to be taken to rural areas and done in a decentralised and systematic manner to reduce the inequities in accessing vaccines and to ensure that the process is faster and easier for people, feels the KGMOA. Decentralising process In a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the KGMOA has suggested that vaccination facilities be made available in Corporations, municipalities and panchayats according to the population and infrastructure in each locality and that 80% of the vaccination slots be made available as spot registrations, while the rest could be made available for prior booking online. The KGMOA says a system be evolved so that beneficiaries in panchayats and municipalities are selected utilising the voters’ list or house numbers. If every local body could prepare a list at the micro level, vaccination sessions for as many people could be arranged at the primary health centre or even at the sub centre level. This will prevent overcrowding. Priority lists for vaccination could be prepared at the ward level. If done in a systematic manner, the process could be faster and transparent. In Corporation areas, mass vaccination sessions could be conducted in stadiums or auditoriums or mobile teams could be deployed through the National Health Mission to conduct sessions in apartments, etc., with the help of residents’ associations. The KGMOA suggests that the government supply vaccines to major private hospitals and those in the periphery so that people who could afford to pay could opt for private hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/spot-registration-for-vaccination-may-start/article34854969.ece

At the time, Mr. Vijayan led the Kerala Students Federation and Mr. Sudhakaran, the Kerala Students Union college unit. Mr. Vijayan prefaced his rather indignant riposte by stating that Mr. Sudhakaran left him no choice but to respond to the lie. “Sudhakaran might have hallucinated about assaulting me,” Mr. Vijayan said. He said Mr. Sudhakaran had referred to a class boycott by the KSF during their college days. The KSU had mustered its cadre to resist the KSF protest. Mr. Vijayan said he had completed his course. Hence, he was mindful not to get involved in a campus fracas. “I turned up to tell KSF leaders that I was boycotting the day’s exam. A KSU worker, Balan, had saved Mr. Sudhakaran from the wrath of KSF workers that day. He posed no threat to me,” he said. Mr. Vijayan then quoted Congress leaders P. Ramakrishnan and Mambaram Divakaran to accuse Mr. Sudhakaran of being an ardent practitioner of “the black art of assassination, extortion and kidnapping”. “A Congress worker had once come home to warn me that Mr. Sudhakaran planned to kidnap my children,” he said. “I am saddened that I was compelled to clarify,’’ he added. .” Mr. Sudhakaran said he would respond to Mr. Vijayan on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cm-lambasts-kpcc-chief-on-assault-charge/article34854973.ece

19 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||The tax game in fuel pricing||Increase in fuel prices is due to the high tax rate. Pricing of petroleum products is done in three stages and States come into the picture only in the third stage. In the first stage, the oil marketing companies buy crude oil in dollars from global market. In the second phase, the Central tax is added. Excise duty, special additional excise duty, and road and infrastructure cess are the Central tax components. The base price of petrol is only Rs. 34.19 and diesel Rs. 36.32 a litre.

19 June 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Karnataka HC begins hearing appeals by Amazon, Flipkart||A fresh round of legal battle began between e-commerce majors Flipkart and Amazon and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Friday as a Division Bench began hearing appeals against the June 11 single judge verdict, which had upheld the CCI’s decision to investigate whether the two companies have anti-competitive agreements with sellers contrary to the law. A Division Bench comprising Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Nataraj Rangaswamy adjourned further hearing on the appeals after partly hearing the arguments on the appeal filed by Flipkart Internet Pvt. Ltd. Too many people The Bench could not commence hearing in the morning session as some of the senior advocates representing the companies could not login to the videoconference hearing, as the number of participants exceeded the limit of 100 fixed for each court hall. A large number of advocates and others persons associated with the two companies apart from mediapersons and the advocates waiting for several other cases listed before the Bench had logged in together. The hearingcommenced at 2.30 p.m. after the court allowed participation of only the senior advocates and a few advocates assisting them. Later, Senior Advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Flipkart, argued that the CCI was wrong in invoking its jurisdiction under Section 3(4) of the Competition Act, 2002, as it applies only to anti-competitive agreements amongst enterprises or persons at different stages or levels of the “production chain,” and not applicable to Flipkart as it is not part of “production chain” as it has no agreements with manufacturers. ‘Electronic malls’ He contended that a seller selling his product exclusively with Flipkart cannot be treated as part of the production chain as it is for the seller to decide where he wants to sell products. A seller may wish to sell his products only at a particular mall or shop located in a particular city, etc., and e-commerce portals are nothing but “electronic malls,” Mr. Salve contended. The status of “assured sellers” or “preferred sellers” given to some sellers is due to commercial success of those sellers and will not impact as “assured” or “preferred” sellers sell a variety of products and don’t sell only one product, he argued. The Bench will continue hearing on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-hc-begins-hearing-appeals-by-amazon-flipkart/article34854632.ece

A statement in this regard was made by the SIT in its status report submitted in a sealed cover before a Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, during the hearing of PIL petitions questioning the legality of constitution of the SIT and seeking transfer of the probe to an independent agency. Earlier, senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing on behalf of the victim, said an application had been filed on behalf of the woman to be part of the PIL proceedings. Ms. Jaisingh also said that a separate petition filed by the woman seeking quashing of a complaint filed by Mr. Jarkiholi could be clubbed along with the PIL petitions while arguing that the SIT appeared to be preparing to file a “closure report” on investigation. However, Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi pointed out to the court that the SIT was seeking additional time from the jurisdictional court to submit a final report on the investigation of the criminal case registered based on the complaint lodged by the victim. Mr. Navadgi also pointed out to the Bench that the woman, who had written a letter to the Chief Justice complaining about the SIT in connection with a complaint lodged by Mr. Jarkiholi, had filed a separate petition before a judge by suppressing the fact that she had written to the Chief Justice. The Bench adjourned further hearing on the petitions while asking the advocate for the victim to submit an application for clubbing the petitions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cd-scam-probe-still-on-sit-tells-karnataka-hc/article34854631.ece

Mr. Anandaiah, who was here on Friday on his way to the Goddess Narayani Amma temple near Vellore in Tamil Nadu, told the media that with the government denying him assistance he had chosen individuals with “service minded outlook” for distributing the preparation in all the districts. Stating that it had come to his notice that several persons were using his photograph and making the herbal preparation without his consent, he said people experiencing side effects were victims of such a preparation. Though I had urged the government to look into such unauthorised deeds, there was no response, he alleged, and made it clear that he should not be blamed for such instances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/herbal-preparation-anandaiah-alleges-little-help-from-govt/article34855308.ece
19 June 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||CM releases job calendar for 2021-22||The government has unveiled a job calendar for the year 2021-22 with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy promising that the State government will fill 10,143 vacant posts, as promised in the election manifesto. The decision will help aspirants to plan their preparation and give their best to various competitive examinations. “I am happy to start yet another programme which will secure a future for our young men and women. This job calender will give an idea about the exact month and date of the job notifications. We will also ensure that the entire process is done in a transparent way without corruption or discrimination or the involvement of middlemen. The recruitment will be based on the marks obtained in the written test conducted by the government without any interview process,” said Mr. Jagan. Recalling the massive job creation done over two years ago, Mr. Jagan said that almost over one lakh jobs were created within four months of forming the government, and the government had filled 6.03 lakh jobs during the last two years, which included 1.22 lakh permanent jobs in the village and ward secretariats. He said the volunteer system was brought in to increase the sense of service among the unemployed youth, and thus recruited 2.50 lakh youngsters as volunteers. Of the total 6.03 lakh jobs created, 1.84 lakh were created on a regular basis, 3.99 lakh were outsourced and 19,701 were on contract basis. The State government had hiked the salaries for 7.02 lakh jobs who were paid a meagre amount in the previous government. Unlike the previous government, where brokers were more involved in outsourcing appointments, the present government had brought APCOS to keep transparency in the recruitments and payments, and giving no room for middlemen or corruption. In spite of having a Rs. 3,500 crore burden, APSRTC had been merged with the State government , where the lives of 51,387 RTC employees had been secured, athe Chief Minister said. He said that the job market would be expanded with the decentralisation and more jobs will be created at the village level itself. TDP slammed Mr. Jagan slammed the previous government for not keeping the election promise of providing a job to each household, and leaving the unemployed youth in the lurch by not paying the promised unemployment allowance. He said that N. Chandrababu Naidu promised to fill 1.4 lakh vacant posts listed in the election manifesto, but in reality the manifesto itself was dumped. Mr. Jagan criticised Mr. Naidu for failing to create jobs to youth in the private sector by securing Special Category Status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh in his previous rule and flayed the TDP chief for accepting a special package offered by the Central government and mortgaged state benefits to escape from the cash-for-vote case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-releases-job-calendar-for-2021-22/article34855310.ece

Shanti Lakshmi, a resident of Nadikudi village in Narayanapur mandal, sent a message to the District Collector on Thursday night narrating her plight of not being able to enrol her sister, Boddu Chinna, 39, at any Aadhaar Enrollment Centre and thus being deprived of benefits of various welfare schemes of both the State and Central governments. “My differently abled sister shares the same enrolment number as mine, and all my attempts to get her enrolled were futile, as her 10 fingers have become numb. The personnel at Aadhaar Centre have turned us away saying that porting could not be done as they could not take biometric fingerprints due to her condition. It has been an ordeal for the last two years, and so I decided to write a mail to the Collector,” said Ms. Shanthi Lakshmi. Moved by her condition, Mr. Yadav on Friday directed the incharge Tahsildar Ramavat Venkateswara Naik to visit her and get her enrolled. Mr. Naik went to the house and found the woman in an extremely pitiable condition and hence arranged his own car to get her to the nearest Aadhaar centre. The personnel were able to capture her Iris image and successfully completed the source capturing and porting was done successfully. Finally, the woman was able to get her enrollment for getting a Aadhaar Card and soon she will be able to access all welfare schemes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/an-intervention-to-get-an-aadhaar/article34854685.ece

The recommendation is to abolish the posts of Project Officer, Accounts Officer, Assistant Engineer, Assistant Project Officer and Junior Engineer in the District Rural Development Agency, which has been converted into the Department of Rural Development. The posts of translator (Malayalam) and translator (Mahl, spoken on the Minicoy island), should be abolished when the posts fall vacant in future, the committee recommended.

Briefing newspersons after a meeting of the party’s national political advisory committee here on Friday, IUML leaders, including organising secretary E.T. Mohammed Basheer and general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty, said the government had allowed many businesses and workplaces to open and markets were already buzzing with activity. However, the government stringently took a stance against opening places of worship while it allowed relaxations even to liquor outlets to function. Mr. Basheer said they were law-abiding citizens and obeyed the rules enforced from time to time. “But this attitude of the government is wrong. We are not asking about reopening mosques but all places of worship,” he said. The IUML leaders deplored the decision of the government in not showing seriousness on the issue of keeping places of worship out of bounds for believers. “Freedom to worship at a place is part of a belief.

19 June 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Fishermen win the war against virus, to resume fishing from tomorrow||At least one member in each fishermen family at Kothapatnam Pallepalem had contracted COVID-19, and some of them succumbed to the virus during its second wave. Now most of the fishermen have won the battle against the virus and are gearing up to set sail for fishing in the sea as normalcy has almost returned to the village in Kothapatnam mandal, thanks to the containment strategy effectively implemented there by the health professionals with the active involvement of sarpanch Vishwanathapalli Anand. The fishermen will resume fishing from Monday, thanks to further relaxation of the partial curfew by the authorities. They had seen worst situations in the high seas in the past. But they managed to overcome the crises without fear. They dread the pandemic more than the tsunami as most of the villagers were infected by the virus, requiring stern steps to overcome the crisis, said the sarpanch. “No fisherman was allowed to work in the salt pans or farms outside the village during the fishing holiday, and no outsider was let into the village even for visiting their relatives,” said Mr. Anand in a conversation with The Hindu . The compensation of Rs. 10,000 provided by the State government as also rice and pulses came in handy for the fishermen to pull on during the tough time, said Mr. Anand. He has taken up with the Fisheries Department the cause of 40 fishermen, who could not get the aid for, among other reasons, non-linking of mobile phone with the Aadhaar card. The health workers monitored the condition of the infected persons every day in the village that has a population of about 6,000 and provided them medical kit. ASHA and ANMs shifted those whose oxygen level fell to Ongole for better treatment. “Still 30 fishermen are down with the virus. They are responding well to the treatment and on the road to recovery,” said Mr. Anand. The fishermen are now busy mending the fishing nets and overhauling the motorised boats, and hope for a good catch this season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fishermen-win-the-war-against-virus-to-resume-fishing-from-tomorrow/article34854688.ece

19 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Digital divide may hit Kerala students||The Kerala government estimates that nearly 9 lakh students may not have access to digital equipment, General Education Principal Secretary A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish has said. Mr. Hanish told The Hindu on Friday that this was not a conclusive figure. According to Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, 6.27 lakh students did not have access to devices such as smartphones, laptops or tablets. This excluded Class 11 students, and instances where only one device was available when more were required. The government was now trying to arrive at an accurate figure by cross-checking with local bodies and school management committees. The final count would be completed soon. Besides non-availability of devices, lack of Internet connectivity is another hurdle that needs to be addressed. Online classes will begin next month with vocational higher secondary education students. “As days go by, device availability will be scaled up with the support of local bodies, people’s representatives, socio-cultural organisations, while continuing the Vidyasree student laptop scheme,” Mr. Hanish said. Meanwhile, General Education Minister V. Sivankutty has said a count of students without digital and online facilities was under way through local bodies and other departments under the umbrella of the General Education Department. The attempt was to address the issue at the school-level itself. Directions had been given to set up school-level support committees for it. For providing support, Deputy Directors of Education could be contacted at the district level, and Director of General Education at the State level, the Minister said in a statement.  The government is now trying to get an accurate figure by cross-checking it with local bodies and schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/digital-divide-may-hit-kerala-students/article34854639.ece
19 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Adani moves ahead for taking over airport||Even as the Adani Airports Holding Limited (AAHL) has sought more time from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to commence the two-month observation of the operations of Thiruvananthapuram international airport as part of its takeover, the group has posted key officials to head operations under the new dispensation. The extension of the observation period by two to three months has been demanded, citing the force majeure clause due to the prevailing pandemic situation and lack of commercial flight operations in the domestic and international sectors. The AAI board is meeting this month-end in New Delhi to look into the request of the AAHL, sources said. The AAHL had also asked for a similar extension for Guwahati and Jaipur airports. The AAI had earlier given approval to the request of the AAHL when it sought an extension of the observation period for Lucknow, Ahmedabad and Mangaluru airports. Pending cases The move comes amidst pending cases in the Supreme Court against the handing over of the operations, management and development of the international airport in the capital through public-private partnership  (PPP) mode for 50 years. The Concession Agreements of Jaipur and Guwahati airports, which are also manned by the AAI, were signed and exchanged along with the one for Thiruvananthapuram airport in January this year. Adani Trivandrum International Airport Ltd (ATIAL) had bagged the bid for 50 years. The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs had given the mandatory security clearance for the Board of directors of ATIAL in December last. The ATIAL has also submitted the performance bank guarantee to the AAI after signing the Concession Agreement. Commercial operations After the two-month observation period, ATIAL will take over the commercial operations of the airport as per the commercial operation date (COD). Meanwhile, the AAHL has posted key officials to head the crucial departments of the ATIAL that will manage the airport. Those posted include the Heads of Engineering, Finance and HR. In all, nine officials have been posted by the ATIAL and they have assumed charge. More officers will be posted in the coming weeks by the ATIAL, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/adani-moves-ahead-for-taking-over-airport/article34854637.ece

19 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Yanamala faults State’s claims on creation of employment||The government is only tricking the people by showing the merger of APSRTC with the government as creation of new jobs, the TDP has alleged. In a statement on Friday, TDP Polit Bureau member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said that the government, in a full page advertisement, claimed that 6,03,756 jobs were created in two years. However, in the ‘Pragati Pustakam’ released on May 30, the government had said that 4,77,953 posts were filled, Mr. Ramakrishnudu said, and added that the government jacked up the number in just 15 days. “It clearly indicates that the government is resorting to jugglery of numbers. If the government is sincere, let it publish details such as posts filled, phone numbers on the website,” he said. “How can the government show the 50,000-plus employees working in the APSRTC under new jobs? Also, how can it claim the 95,212 posts filled through APCOS during the TDP term as new jobs? Is it not deceiving the people?” he asked. More than one crore people of the unorganised sector had tuned jobless in the last two years, the TDP leader said. Unemployment rate “The unemployment rate is 13.5%, which is above the national average of 11.9%. It was only 3.6%during 2018-19 in A.P.

19 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Five colleges in State get AICTE-funded IDEA Labs||Five colleges in the State have been selected for establishment of the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE)- funded IDEA (Idea Development, Evaluation and Application) labs 2020-21. These institutions are Potti Sriramulu Chalavadi Mallikarjuna Rao College of Engineering and Technology in Vijayawada, QIS College of Engineering and Technology in Ongole, Sagi Rama Krishnam Raju (SRKR) Engineering College in Bhimavaram, Sree Vidya Niketan Engineering College at Rangampet and Vignan's Institute of Infromation Technology in Visakhapatnam. To encourage students for application of Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fundamentals towards enhanced hands-on experience, learning by doing and even product visualisation, the Council has selected 49 institutions across the country to set up these labs. As a common facility embedded in the institution, the IDEA Lab will make engineering graduates more imaginative and creative, besides getting basic training in the 21st century skills like critical thinking, problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, communication and lifelong learning among other things. The selected institutions are expected to participate financially, to match the contribution sought from AICTE in establishing the IDEA Lab which ideally required an area of 5,000 sq. ft. These labs should remain open round- the-clock and should be equipped with facilities, tools and consumables to support translation of an idea to prototype development or develop solution of a problem. The colleges will have to hold workshops, trainings, ideation sessions, boot camps and competitions and participate in national and international events. The duration of the project will be two years and the Council will monitor the IDEA Lab as part of IDEA Labs Network (IDEALNET) for five years so that cultural change in the campus becomes visible due to the fully functional lab. “Once established, the lab can be utilised by students of not just our college but also from the colleges located in the vicinity,” said secretary and correspondent of SRKR College Sagi Vithal Rangaraju. Chalavadi Mallikarjuna Rao, president of Potti Sriramulu Chlavadi Mallikarjuna Rao College of Engineering and Technology at Kothapet, said the college would collaborate with industry partners like the Vijayawada-based Efftronics Systems Pvt. Ltd. which would support the IDEA Lab by providing specialised equipment worth Rs. 50 lakh, besides lending the domain expertise in the area of “Smart Building and Smart Cities”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/five-colleges-in-state-get-aicte-funded-idea-labs/article34855317.ece

According to information, the Medical and Health Department is not in a position to clear the pending bills due to paucity of funds. The government has to pay Rs. 898.35 crore for various medical services, including purchase of essential medicines, but the fund flow has ceased, effectively affecting COVID-19 management in the State. About Rs. 398 crore is pending release from the Finance Department under different heads for COVID-19 management. To be precise, the total bills pending are worth Rs. 398,35,18,254, sources say. The Andhra Pradesh Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Corporation purchased COVID-19 home isolation kits, medicines, triple-layer masks, PPE kits, Remdesivir injections and other essential items for which Rs. 276 crore needs to be paid. Another Rs. 176 crore has to be paid for laboratory equipment, medical equipment and COVID-19 kits purchased. For installation and repair of oxygen pipelines, civil works and construction of temporary hospitals, payment of Rs. 48 crore is overdue, the sources say. For oxygen supplies, Rs. 36.91 crore has been spent so far. Apart from this, payment of another Rs. 100 crore to private hospitals under the State health insurance scheme, is said to have been stuck in a dispute for several months now for technical issues. Between April 7, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the government spent Rs. 316.94 crore through the Aarogyasri Health Care Trust for treatment of 96,521 COVID-19 patients under the State health insurance scheme. Since April this year, another Rs. 50 crore has been spent so far. However, a dispute has arisen between the trust and the private hospitals over the payment as there was said to be no pre-authorisation. “The available funds are hardly sufficient even to foot the oxygen bill,” says a senior official of the department on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-management-hit-as-health-dept-left-with-only-rs-29-crore/article34854682.ece

Party State president Somu Veerraju alleged that the YSRCP government was playing vote-bank politics by appeasing non-Hindus and cracking down on ‘Hindu dharma’ with ulterior motive. He alleged that over 100 temples were either desecrated or razed after the YSRCP came to power and the government tried to wriggle out of the situation by saying that some mentally deranged persons were behind it. Speaking to mediapersons during his visit of West Godavari on Friday, he said the government had no intention to rebuild the temples and apprehend those involved in incidents like the burning of chariot of Antarvedi temple and desecration of the idol of Lord Rama at Ramateertham. But, it was bent on doing undesirable things like getting the statue of Tipu at Proddutur, he said and questioned the reason for denial of permission to the BJP for taking out ‘'Hindu Chaitanya Yatra’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/drop-move-to-install-tipu-statue-deodhar/article34855320.ece

Special teams, formed by the city police, have launched a manhunt for the accused. On June 7, unidentified miscreants reportedly made good with about eight tolas of gold ornaments, apart from other valuables from a locked house at Balayya Sastry Layout. On June 8, the city police received a jolt after a series of house break-ins were reported. In the first case, 26 tolas of gold ornaments and valuables were looted from a house at Jagannadhapuram in Akkayyapalem. In the second case, the miscreants made good with about 15 tolas of gold ornaments and other valuables from a house at Venkateswara Nagar at Maharanipeta. Similarly, about 10 tolas gold ornaments and cash were stolen from a house at Kasturi Nagar, Kailasapuram, the same day. The PM Palem police received a complaint from a resident that about 30 tolas of gold ornaments were missing from his house. According to police officials, in most of the offences reported since May, the burglars have been targeting locked houses, when inmates go to other places or when the inmates slept by keeping open the doors or slept on their terrace. ‘Local gangs’ Police said that due to the COVID-19 restrictions, movement of inter-State gangs was not suspected and these crimes might have been committed by local gangs. “Teams were formed to crack the cases and investigation is on,” said Assistant Commissioner of Police (CCS) Sravan Kumar. The crime wing police advise citizens to inform them if at all they had to leave their house for any purpose including COVID-19 situation, so that their house can be monitored. The police also appealed to the people to install CCTVs through Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS) by placing a request. A 67-year-old woman of Madhuranagar, who returned home last month, after undergoing treatment at a hospital for COVID-19, found about 16 tolas of gold ornaments and other valuables missing. “Citizens going out after locking their house can install LHMS and appeal for CCTV installation for monitoring. If people find anyone suspicious, they can inform the control room or police station,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crimes) V. Suresh Babu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/spate-of-burglaries-gives-police-a-jolt/article34855330.ece

19 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CM springs surprise on sarpanch||Friday will be an unforgettable day for Vasalamarri village sarpanch P. Anjaneyulu. Heading the remote village in Turkapalli mandal of Yadadri-Bhongir district as sarpanch, this elected representative from the grassroots would have never imagined that he would receive a phone call from none less than Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. And, the latter promising that he would personally visit Mr. Anjaneyulu’s house and bless the family would surely be beyond his wildest dreams. The Chief Minister was slated to pay surprise visit to villages and towns to inspect the progress of works taken up under Palle and Pattana Pragati programmes from Sunday starting with Siddipet. He sprang a surprise calling up the sarpanch and informing him that he would visit the village on June 22. Incidentally, Vasalamarri is one such village which Mr. Rao desired adopting to ensure its all-round development. “I could not come to the village as I was affected by Coronavirus so were a number of people across the country. I am coming there on June 22 for launching the project,” the Chief Minister told Mr. Anjaneyulu. When Mr. Rao enquired about the population of the village, the sarpanch said it would be around 2,600. Mr. Rao said the villagers should not trouble themselves on the food arrangements as they would be made by the government. “Will arrangements for hosting lunch to 3,000 suffice, because I will have an entire team accompanying me?” the Chief Minister asked, adding that number of those attending would be no issue as arrangements could be made as required. Mr. Rao asked Mr. Anjaneyulu to select two locations in the village – one for hosting community lunch to the entire village and the other for the conduct of a meeting with residents. “Make sure that there are two separate locations. People can have their lunch and leisurely come to the meeting. I will also have my lunch with the residents,” Mr. Rao said. He said a team of officials headed by the District Collector would visit the village to see the location and take up other works like erecting rain-proof tents for both locations. Obviously elated over the information, Mr. Anjaneyulu suggested that there was a location spread over 30 acres on the fringes of the village where the Chief Minister made a brief halt in the past that would be ideal for the event. He, however, insisted that the Chief Minister visit his house and bless his family. The Chief Minister responded positively, saying he would come to Mr. Anjaneyulu’s house in the intervening time between lunch and his meeting with the residents of the village. Mr. Rao made it clear that the sarpanch should take together all the people irrespective of their political affiliations as “the meeting is for development of each and every household of the village”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cm-springs-surprise-on-sarpanch/article34855218.ece
19 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Lights, camera, action for Telugu film units||On June 14, director Merlapaka Gandhi and his team resumed filming their new Telugu project Maestro , as lockdown restrictions eased in Hyderabad. Director Maruthi’s film starring Santosh Shobhan and actor Vishal’s new film Not a Common Man directed by Saravanan are also on floors. A few more units are expected to follow suit in a week or two. An important criteria to return to work has been to get as many members of the cast and crew — junior artistes, make-up, stunt, and others — vaccinated. Second wave interruption The severity of the second wave of COVID-19 has prompted units to urge the cast and crew to strictly adhere to safety measures. In addition to frequent sanitisation, disinfection and mask compliance, visitors will not be allowed and actors will have fewer assistants on set. Merlapaka Gandhi states that several unit members have taken either the first or both doses of the vaccine: “There was nervousness before we resumed work. We got tested and are following safety protocols. There’s a tendency among a few to lower their masks as the day progresses, but whenever we notice it, we ask them to wear the mask properly.”  Maestro, starring Nithiin, Tamannaah Bhatia and Nabha Natesh, is a remake of the 2018 Hindi thriller Andhadhun . “This story doesn’t involve many actors, so we are able to film with a small crew,” says Gandhi, adding that after the day’s shoot, he retires to his office, not home, to avoid risking the health of his wife and children.  Actor, writer and creative producer Siddhu Jonnalagadda is looking forward to resuming filming Narudi Brathuku Natana from June 25 and says the team has been briefed on safety measures: “The production house is helping unit members get vaccinated. To begin with, we will film my solo scenes. The second wave sent shivers down our spines; learning from that experience, we need to remember not to let our guard down,” he says. The other films expected to begin shooting later this month include director Vikram Kumar’s Thank You headlined by Naga Chaitanya, director Gunashekhar’s Shaakuntalam starring Samantha Akkineni and the Ravi Teja starrer Khiladi directed by Ramesh Varma. Venkatesh and Varun Tej starrer F3 directed by Anil Ravipudi and S S Rajamouli’s RRR starring NTR and Ram Charan are among the other units expected to begin shooting from July 1. Leading producer D Sureshbabu says it’s also important to ensure vaccination to those involved in post-production facilities, and the support staff in studios and homes. He also cautions, “It’s tough to keep vigil at all times; it boils down to personal discipline. Many are eager to return to work and normalcy. However, it’s a question of life Vs. livelihood. I hope everyone prioritises safety, avoid dining together and hanging out in groups.” Theatre opening awaited Production houses are also waiting for theatres to reopen, to begin scheduling film release dates. But how safe will it be to return to cinema halls? In Telangana, when they opened between mid-December 2020 and mid-April 2021, viewers doing away with masks once they cross the security check became a common sight. Many in the film industry concede that they and their family members hesitated to enter movie halls. However, film promotions and releases continued till the second wave began to peak. This time around, producers state that stricter vigil may be warranted when theatres reopen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/lights-camera-action-for-telugu-film-units/article34855211.ece
19 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Telangana seeks AP’s school revamp software||The Telangana government has sought the support of the Andhra Pradesh government for use of the software developed for the ‘Nadu-Nedu’ scheme – the flagship school revamp programme of the Jaganmohan Reddy government. A.P. Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy has asked the officials to extend support to Telangana officials after Principal Secretary Higher Education Sandeep Kumar Sultania wrote to his AP counterpart B. Rajashekhar seeking No-Objection Certificate (NoC) for use of the software developed by the TCS exclusively for the AP government. Mr. Sultania in his letter said that TCS had requested them for an NoC from the AP government since an end-to-end encrypted software was developed exclusively for the Nadu-Nedu scheme. He said the government of Telangana had embarked on a school infrastructure development project similar to that of Nadu-Nedu and the TCS had expressed that the Telangana government had to acquire a formal NoC from the AP government for designing a similar software. The decision to approach the AP government was taken after the Cabinet Sub Committee on strengthening school infrastructure at its meeting on Thursday discussed the ways and means to implement the plan. The Cabinet sub-committee was formed after the government in its 2021 budget announced the scheme to upgrade government schools with an allocation of Rs. 4,000 crore over the next two years. The scheme envisages construction and repair of buildings and sanitation facilities, and provision of furniture and other amenities. However, it is yet to be known whether the TCS would be asked to make changes to suit the needs of Telangana government’s plans or adopt it completely. The Nadu-Nedu scheme of AP was launched in 2019 to transform the existing infrastructure of the 44,512 schools in a phased manner over a period of three years. Under the programme, which has been catching the attention of all the states in the country, nine infrastructure components are being taken up — toilets with running water, drinking water supply, repairs, electrification with fans and tube lights, furniture for students and staff, green chalk boards, painting of schools, compound walls and English labs. Under Phase-I, the scheme will cover 15,715 schools of which works in 15,115 have been launched. So far, Rs. 3,046 crore has been released.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telangana-seeks-aps-school-revamp-software/article34855220.ece
19 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||All 4 KCR projects contributing nothing to irrigation: Ponnala||Senior Congress leader Ponnala Lakshmaiah has alleged that not a single acre has been added to the cultivation under the four new projects – Kaleshwaram, Palamuru Rangareddy, Sitarama Lift Irrigation Scheme and Tupakula Gudem barrage taken up by TRS government, and challenged the government for a debate on this. At a press conference, he said if Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao doesn’t want to come for the debate he can send any irrigation expert from Telangana or other States for the debate. He said the TRS government has spent Rs. 76,764 crore in the last six years and yet the entire irrigation was being done through projects constructed by Congress governments. Mr. Lakshmaiah said the water being lifted through Kaleshwaram now would have to be pumped into the sea ultimately as the projects would receive sufficient inflows from the rains. KCR is trying to hoodwink people, projecting Kaleshwaram project as a saviour for Telangana though it has not contributed to additional irrigation. The Congress leader said the Irrigation Department statistics reveal that 41.21 lakh acres to be irrigated for Kharif 2021 were irrigation projects built by the previous governments. These include 37.19 lakh acres under Major Irrigation Projects (all built by the Congress governments) and 4.02 lakh acres under Medium irrigation projects (assuming all projects get filled), he claimed. The major projects include SRSP – 1 (9.68 lakh acres), SRSP – 2 (3.72 lakh acres), FFC (0.20), Devadula (2 lakh acres); Kadem (0.60 lakhs), Mid Maner (0.52 lakhs), Nizamsagar (1.75 lakhs), Guthpa (0.39), Alisagar (0.54), Jurala (1.09 lakhs), Nettempadu (1.40 lakhs), Bhima (2 lakhs), Kalwakurthi (3.50 lakhs), Koilsagar (0.54), Nagarjunsagar (6.58 lakhs) and AMRP (2.68 lakhs).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/all-4-kcr-projects-contributing-nothing-to-irrigation-ponnala/article34855222.ece

19 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||New PCC chief likely in a week||The process of selection of president of the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) has began yet again in New Delhi and the announcement is likely to be made within a week. Sources said that the consultations are on with the concerned hierarchy within the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee like the PCC chief, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader and other seniors. The list of names of probables will be taken to AICC president Sonia Gandhi for final approval. With All India Congress Committee (AICC) incharge for Telangana and Member of Parliament from Madurai Manickam Tagore in New Delhi it was rumoured that he had met Sonia Gandhi to submit his report yet again. However, he was apparently present as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin made a courtesy call on Sonia Gandhi. Mr. Tagore had submitted a report in January this year after holding wide consultations with the party leaders in Telangana. The five names that cropped up earlier and considered by the party high command are the only names being discussed as of now and no new name is in the list, a senior party official told The Hindu on the condition of anonimity. These include Parliament members, A. Revanth Reddy and Komatireddy Venkata Reddy, MLA D. Sreedhar Babu, MLC T. Jeevan Reddy and former MP Madhu Yaskhi. Mr. Revanth Reddy is in New Delhi along with his family and his stay is also being linked to the discussions. The tone and tenor of some leaders who had lobbied for the post also softened now as they realised that they don’t stand a chance. “However, clarity will emerge in a couple of days,” a senior leader said adding that apart from the PCC other key posts like the Campaign Committee chairman will also be finalised. Party is keen to make the changes now to infuse freshness into the political activity. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief issue came to the fore also because the high command is also discussing the PCC changes in poll-bound States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/new-pcc-chief-likely-in-a-week/article34855224.ece
19 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||A cup of chai changes food delivery boy’s fortune||It was a delivery of Hyderabadi chai on a rainy night that changed Mohd Aqeel Ahmed’s life. It began when Robin Mukesh placed an order for chai from a restaurant in Lakdi Ka Pul at 10 in the night. Within 15 minutes, a container of piping hot tea was delivered to Mukesh who lives in an apartment block in King Koti area. “I wanted hot tea as I was working from home. I was surprised to see the delivery executive near my home in 15 minutes. But he had a strange request. He wanted me to collect the delivery as I stay in an apartment,” recalls Mr. Mukesh. When he went down, he was surprised to see Aqeel Ahmed on a cycle, drenched to the bone. “I was shocked and asked Aqeel if I could click his photo. He allowed me to do so and I posted the photograph in our foodies’ group on Monday at 11.10 p.m. By morning, the post had gone viral and people said they wanted to do something (to help him),” says Mr Mukesh about the heart-warming story. At that point, R. Ravikanth Reddy, the admin of the Great Hyderabad Food and Travel Club on Facebook, stepped in by sharing the fundraiser post about Aqeel. “I posted it at 8 p.m. on Tuesday and when I woke up in the morning, the target of Rs. 65,800 for a two-wheeler was achieved,” says Mukesh. “We do charity on a different scale. But this incident showed how members of a foodie group can quickly mobilise funds to help someone. One big donor was a person from the US who saw the post and sent across Rs. 30,000. We exceeded the target,” adds Mr. Reddy. On Friday, at 10.30 a.m., Aqeel received the keys and helmet for his new motorbike with which he plans to increase his deliveries from 20 to 40 per day.  We do charity on a different scale. But this incident showed how members of a foodie group can quickly mobilise funds to help someone. R.

19 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Five arrested for selling land with forged documents||Five persons of a gang who tried to sell agricultural lands by forging documents without the knowledge of the owners were arrested by the Cyberabad police here on Friday. They forged documents include sale deeds and agreement of sale in the name of gullible purchasers.

Adinarayana Murthy started several real estate companies, including RAN Estates Pvt. Ltd., ANR Avenues and Turnkey Projects Pvt. Ltd., Sri Sai Adarsh Enterprises and Sri Ramya Real Estates and Developers, all from Ameerpet. In March, a realtor approached the police stating Adinarayana Murthy and his associates have brought a proposal to him saying that they would sell lands situated in Golluru village of Maheshwaram mandal with a promise that they would arrange registration of the lands in his favour if he is interested to buy. Further, they showed ownership documents consisting of land documents and pattadar passbooks. “After mutual discussions, they agreed to sell the lands to get the sale deed directly registered on his name from the owners. The sale amount was fixed at Rs. 1.40 crore per acre, and for total consideration of Rs. 56 crore for 40 acres,” Commissioner of Police VC Sajjanar said.

Based on his complaint, a case was registered and subsequent investigation was taken up and the accused arrested. Police seized 51 pattadar pass books, 264 non-judicial stamp papers,16 empty pattadar pass books, 91 documents, nine revenue rubber stamps of various mandals from their possession.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/five-arrested-for-selling-land-with-forged-documents/article34855213.ece
19 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘State violating its own G.O. on selling lands’||AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan Kumar has refuted the allegations made by Ministers T Harish Rao and KT Rama Rao that the Congress had sold thousands of acres of the land during its rule, and claimed that Congress had brought G.O. 571 to reclaim 88,000 acres of land allotted to companies like Vanpic and Brahimini steels. He said that N. Kiran Kumar Reddy government in the united Andhra Pradesh issued GO 571 on May 15, 2012 to reclaim the lands. In fact, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) had protested at the HMDA against selling the lands in 2012 and how come it wants to sell the same lands now by violating the Principle of Public Trust Doctrine, he questioned. He said the TRS government had adopted GO 571 issued in 2012 to issue a new GO 61 on May 15, 2015 on the land allotment policy. “But the very same government is violating the guidelines mentioned in the GO. Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, who was in a clandestine agreement with his counterpart in Andhra Pradesh Y S Janganmohan Reddy is not taking any action with regard to reclaiming the lands allotted to the companies allegedly belonging to those close to YS Jagan,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-violating-its-own-go-on-selling-lands/article34855223.ece

19 June 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Vemulaghat oustee ends life||In a shocking incident, Tutukuri Mallareddy (70), an oustee of Vemulaghat village in Toguta mandal, committed suicide by self immolation. He reportedly prepared the pyre with the wood that was collected from his demolished house. The incident took place in the wee hours of Friday. Knowing about the incident heavy police force was mobilised in the village to prevent any untoward incident. Media people were not allowed into the village. This is one of the villages that would be submerged under Mallannasagar. He took the extreme step as he was reportedly denied allotment of house under Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) package. According to sources, Mallareddy was resident of Vemulaghat, with three daughters. His elder daughter and son-in-law passed away long ago. His wife died of cancer about nine months ago. His second son-in-law died of Coronavirus about a month ago. Though Mallareddy was paid R&R package along with others, officials reportedly denied sanctioning house to him as he was single. Mallareddy thought of giving the house to his third daughter and son-in-law who had served him and his wife during difficult times. “Mallareddy was worried over denial of house to him. He had repeatedly told this to several villagers. On Thursday, he had collected the wood from his house demolished by officials. We thought that he was collecting it to sell. But he prepared the pyre and immolated himself,” Y. Srinivas Reddy, a villager of Vemulaghat told The Hindu . However, Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) K. Anantha Reddy, in a recorded video, said the allegations being levelled by villagers were not right and Mallareddy was allotted house number 848 in the R&R Colony and he was also paid package. This was confirmed by Tirupathi Reddy, grandson of Mallareddy in another video-recorded statement. Mr. Anantha Reddy urged the oustees not to take any extreme step as the authorities, including Collector, were ready to address their problems. Dubbak MLA M. Raghunandan Rao visited the family of Mallareddy at the government hospital and consoled them. “Officials are demolishing houses. But they should think what forced Mallareddy to take the extreme step. A farmer preparing pier himself and immolating himself is a shame on administration. At least now the district authorities should respond with human face,” said Mr. Raghunandan Rao adding that some oustees were still there at Vemulaghat, Etigaddakishtapur and Pallepahad. However, he was not allowed to visit the village. Congress leader Ch. Srinivas Reddy, who tried to visit the village, was also arrested by the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/vemulaghat-oustee-ends-life/article34855226.ece
19 June 2021||YADADRI-BHUVANAGIRI,TELANGANA||Focus on ‘Adoption Vasalamarri’||Following Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s call to Vasalamarri sarpanch P. Anjaneyulu on Friday, the district administration, which was preoccupied with COVID-19 services till recently, has resumed its project ‘Adoption Vasalamarri’. District Collector Pamela Satpathy, along with team and Alair legislator G. Sunitha, rushed to Vasalamarri to take a look at the ground plan. According to officials, the village was identified into 10 wards in November last year, for focused surveys and development. Already, officials were instructed to set up camps in the village and follow up works, such as sanitation, tree plantation and others, on priority and on daily basis. For the Chief Minister, who interacted with the aggrieved residents during his return journey to Gajwel on October 31, Vasalamarri would be made another Ankapur, the State’s ‘role model village’ from Nizamabad district. He had also promised to develop Vasalamarri with an outlay of Rs. 100 crore. Vasalamarri, located on the side of Bhongir-Pragnapur road (NH 161AA), with a population of about 2, 600, would be affected with the four-laning works of the highway up to Yadadri, among other persistent issues such as poor housing and livelihood. Following KCR’s assurance, the district administration set the plan in motion within three days and started a door-to-door survey, recording demographic details. Each team for the 10 wards was headed by a district department head and qualitative reports were prepared. While District Rural Development Officer Upender Reddy was appointed Village Special Officer, Gajwel Area Development Authority (GADA) Special Officer A. Muthyam Reddy visited the village and conducted several sessions with officials. According to an official concerned with the plan, apart from improving drainage system, electricity and roads that pass through Vasalamarri, special instructions were given for identification and ways to build capacities of women and youth for their self-reliance . About 270 residents were taken to Ankapur on an ‘awareness trip’ to understand village development, technology and dynamics in agriculture, and seed and food processing units. Officials also conducted a special health camp to record health profile of residents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/focus-on-adoption-vasalamarri/article34855215.ece
19 June 2021||New Delhi,||‘Breach of COVID-19 norms in markets will hasten third wave’||The Delhi High Court on Friday took suo motu cognisance of violations of COVID-19 protocols at various markets across the Capital where people are seen not wearing masks and flouting social distancing norms. A Bench of Justices Navin Chawla and Asha Menon said, “We have paid a huge price in the second wave. We do not know if there is any household that has not suffered in the second wave, closely or remotely.” “Such breaches will only hasten the third wave, which is likely to come, and this cannot be permitted,” the HC said. The Bench issued notices to the Centre and the Delhi government noting that strict measures were required to be implemented across the city to prevent further spread of COVID-19. If COVID-19 norms continue to be flouted “we will be in a great trouble... God help us if all that happens”, said the Bench. The High Court directed authorities to take strict measures to sensitise the public, shopkeepers and market associations. The direction came after the HC took note of several photographs sent to its judges by AIIMS doctors showing people crowding marketplaces without following COVID-19 protocols. ‘Deploy personnel’ The High Court suggested deploying civil defence volunteers and police personnel at marketplaces. It has posted the case for further hearing on July 9 .  During the hearing, the counsels for the Centre and Delhi government assured the court that strict measures are already being taken to ensure protocol is maintained at markets and also followed by the street vendors. Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, said he will take up the concerns raised by the court to the authorities concerned. “We cannot afford a third wave,” Mr. Sharma added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/breach-of-covid-19-norms-in-markets-will-hasten-third-wave/article34855167.ece
19 June 2021||New Delhi,||127 people fined per hour for not adhering to COVID norms||More than 3,000 people were issued fines every day over the last two months for not adhering to COVID-appropriate behaviour with Delhi government teams finding and prosecuting as many as 127 offenders per hour. Delhi government recorded highest daily violations on Thursday — 5,301. As many as 1,89,307 people were fined for offences ranging from not wearing face masks — or wearing them improperly — non-adherence to social distancing norms and spitting in public places between April 17 and June 17, according to government records. The Capital went through a series of six-week-long lockdowns between mid-April and May during which prosecution figures remained relatively low compared to three recent weeks during which the city has been “unlocking” in phases. With more people stepping out, more prosecutions are being made, said government sources. However, the same sources also concede the other side of the argument: higher prosecution is taking place because more and more people are being found not adhering to COVID norms. During the first weeklong lockdown, which was in effect from April 19 to April 26, 23,073 people were issued fines; the number fell to 16,965 between the second lockdown from April 27 to May 3 during the second week-long lockdown. The third installment of the lockdown saw 17,052 prosecutions from May 4 to May 10, the fourth, from May 11 to May 17, saw 17,798, the fifth lockdown recorded 17,728 fines between May 18 and May 24 and the sixth and final installment, till May 31, saw 21,164 challans. As the unlock process began from early June, the number of fines has increased every week; the first weeklong unlock phase — during which mainly construction and industrial activity was allowed by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) — saw 20,966 fines till June 6. The second phase, during which the Delhi Metro in addition to neighbourhood and mall-based shops were allowed to open along with both private and public offices from June 7 to June 13, saw 29,343 prosecutions. In its third, ongoing phase of unlock, the Capital recorded 20,361 fines between just June 14 and June 17. According to government records, the North district, with 27,273, saw the highest number of fines being issued between April 17 and June 17. The Shahdara district with 26,483 and the South district with 21,295 fines was at second and third place in terms of the total number of fines issued, respectively. The north-west district, with 8392, recorded the lowest number of challans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/127-people-fined-per-hour-for-not-adhering-to-covid-norms/article34855159.ece
19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pandemics part of draft Master Plan 2041||Apart from developing systems and infrastructure that can withstand or respond to earthquakes, fires, floods and other disasters, the draft Master Plan for Delhi (MPD)-2041 also lays out a plan for disease outbreaks and pandemics. Mixed-use development with work centres, homes and other facilities in close proximity of each other and decentralised workspaces in the form of co-working spaces are some of the aspects underscored in the draft MPD 2041, as a part of its plan to reduce vulnerability to pandemics. “Decentralised workspaces shall be promoted in the form of co-working spaces, shared workspaces within slum rehabilitation projects, support for home-based work and so on. Additionally, common community spaces shall be promoted to be utilised for providing refuge spots, common kitchens and quarantine spaces at the time of emergency,” the draft MPD-2041 reads. The plan also facilitates the creation of multi-facility plots, which can be temporarily repurposed along with other government facilities during times of disaster. Further, the draft master plan stated: “Development of adequate affordable rental or ownership housing options for the poor, worker housing, hostels for women and men shall be prmoted to reduce crowding within dwelling units and support migrant housing in the city.” “Development of large green areas, mandatory creation of open areas, public spaces and plazas in new developments and reducing built densities through planned regeneration will support requirements of social distancing during pandemics while providing an active public realm during normal times,” the plan proposed. The draft MPD-2041 also said better habitat design and green-rated developments will be promoted to reduce the dependence on mechanical ventilation systems. The documents also proposed the development of a disaster response protocol for the national capital, outlining the procedure to be followed for different types of disasters. “All service providing agencies shall develop emergency response plans and guidelines to ensure that there is minimal impact on delivery of these essential services during times of disaster,” the draft plan read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/pandemics-part-of-draft-master-plan-2041/article34855165.ece
19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Seven people nabbed for running fake call centres||Seven people have been arrested for running a fake call centre that allegedly duped foreigners of several crores, the police said on Friday. DCP (West) Urvija Goel said the accused have been identified as Gaurav (24), Amit Anand (46), Ajneesh Rana (37), Aryan Saxena (21), Yogesh Prasad (28), Naveen Kumar (22), and Aman Preet Kaur (24). The police said they got information that some persons were running an international online cheating racket in Tilak Nagar’s Ganesh Nagar. The accused were engaged in using illegal techniques.  ‘Call from Amazon’ During probe, it was found that they were cheating people based in the USA on the pretext of providing them technical support by posing as tech supporters of Amazon. “On Thursday, the police reached Ganesh Nagar where seven people were found engaged in calls,” Ms. Goel said. During interrogation, it was revealed that the tech support scam begins with a pre-recorded call, claiming to be from Amazon and telling the victim that suspicious transactions have taken place in their Amazon account. Eventually, the accused would persuade them to connect for resolving that issue and get their computer or mobile remote access. The police said the accused would then exploit the victim following which they would block the call, As the numbers used by the alleged were spoofed VOIP numbers, the complainant can neither call back nor trace those numbers, Ms. Goel said. The accused got details of the U.S. residents using illegal techniques, the officer added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/seven-people-nabbed-for-running-fake-call-centres/article34855157.ece
19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi gets time till June 30 to operationalise ePoS in ration shops||The Centre has accused the Delhi government of violating the National Food Security Act (NFSA) by failing to operationalise electronic point of sale (ePoS) devices at its ration shops and implement the One Nation One Ration Card scheme. In a letter dated Thursday, the Food Ministry issued an ultimatum to the State government, demanding that action is taken by the end of the month. Section 12 of the NFSA says that the Centre and States shall endeavour to undertake reforms in the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), including the “application of information and communication technology tools including end-to-end computerization in order to ensure transparent recording of transactions at all levels, and to prevent diversion”, as well as leveraging Aadhaar and ensuring full transparency of records. “By not operationalising ePoS devices at the fair price shops (for transparent distribution of foodgrains), GNCTD is in violation of Section-12 of the Act. Reforms under TPDS are mandated under the Act to promote transparency and rightful targeting,” said the letter, noting that the Food Ministry has written more than 12 letters on the issue over the last three years. “However, the distribution of foodgrains in Delhi is still being done using old/manual register-based mechanisms. Further, this non-compliance is also blocking the implementation of One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) for numerous migrant beneficiaries in the National Capital,” it added. The Ministry also emphasised the clause calling for doorstep delivery to TPDS outlets, distinguishing it from the Delhi government’s drive to deliver ration to the homes of beneficiaries. The letter added that the Delhi government failed to comply with Sections 28 and 29 of the NFSA by not conducting periodic social audits on the functioning of fair price shops or setting up vigilance committees at the grassroots level. The Ministry also accused the Delhi government of being “insensitive to the needs and rights” of Scheduled Castes and Tribes by dismissing a directive to maintain data on beneficiaries from these communities. “It is very unfortunate that while other State Governments have assured that they would do the needful in this regard, GNCTD merely informed that the data was not available with them,” said the letter. Citing Section 38, which says that State governments shall comply with directions issued by the Centre for effective implementation of the NFSA, the Food Ministry issued directives to the State to “take steps to fulfil the pending obligations of Section-12 of the Act immediately to enable the transparent distribution of foodgrains [via ePoS devices] under both NFSA and PM-GKAY to all NFSA beneficiaries in Delhi...A compliance to this effect may be sent by June 30, 2021.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-gets-time-till-june-30-to-operationalise-epos-in-ration-shops/article34855166.ece

19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Man arrested for chit fund fraud in city||A man has been arrested in a chit fund fraud case, the police said on Friday. The accused — Mool Chand — was arrested by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police. Chand lured people from his locality for investing in his chit fund scheme by offering handsome returns and liquid funds, said an officer. The matter came to the fore when a complaint was filed by 24 victims alleging that Chand lured them to invest as a monthly deposit in the scheme, which was floated with 20 shares of Rs. 10,000 each for a period of 20 months. He had collected around Rs. 50 lakhs from the victims and also issued cheques to some of them against their investment. After collecting money from the victims, he sold his house and absconded with his family, the police added. After conducting preliminary enquiry into the complaint, a case under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120 B (Criminal Conspiracy) and other relevant sections of the IPC was then registered. “The Prize Chits & Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act was registered in March and probe was taken up. During investgation, it was revealed that Chand used to run a small manufacturing unit of disposable paper plates at his house. After suffering losses, he started the scheme to earn easy money,” an officer said. The investigation revealed that the accused used to accept the monthly deposit in cash and maintained registers for keeping records of subscribers and their respective shares, he said. “The cheques, later on, got dishonoured upon presentation. In January 2021, the money was to be paid back in a lump sum after maturity. When the victims started asking Chand to pay them back, he sold his house and fled off,” he added. He was tracked on the basis of surveillance and arrested on Thursday, the police said, adding further investigation in the case is going on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/man-arrested-for-chit-fund-fraud-in-city/article34855162.ece

19 June 2021||JAIPUR,||‘Lift restrictions on MGNREGS works in rural areas’||Civil society groups in Rajasthan on Friday called for lifting of restrictions on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) works in the rural areas, while affirming that the State government’s orders had weakened the flagship employment venture during the COVID-19 pandemic. Against 50 lakh labourers engaged for MGNREGS works during June last year, only 18.8 lakh have got the work this year, despite the rural population’s complete dependence on the scheme for their livelihood. Works have not been sanctioned on a large scale in the village panchayats and those demanding employment as a statutory right are not getting it. Activists said an order of the State government to restrict the number of labourers at a site to 30 to avoid crowding was being misinterpreted for sanctioning only a single work in each village panchayat. This has resulted in a very few persons getting employment in the villages, leading to hunger and starvation. In a memorandum sent to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, the Suchna Evum Rozgar Adhikar Abhiyan has demanded that the orders on restrictions be withdrawn and a provision be made for giving work for an additional 50 days to the villagers affected by the pandemic. A ‘ Kaam Maango ’ (seek the work) campaign should also be launched in all blocks of the State and the measurement of task for giving wages reduced by half for the labourers who were recovering from the COVID-19 infection, Mukesh Nirvasit of the Abhiyan said. Representatives of about 100 organisations signed the memorandum, which was submitted to the Collectors at district headquarters and Block Development Officers in more than 50 blocks on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/lift-restrictions-on-mgnregs-works-in-rural-areas/article34855171.ece
19 June 2021||Mumbai,||4 held for fake vaccination camps||The Mumbai police arrested four men on Friday in connection with a fake vaccination camp organised by them at a residential society in western suburbs of the city. Police filed an FIR against the four — Mahendra Singh (39), Sanjay Gupta (29), Chandan alias Lalit Singh (32) and Nitin Mode (32) — for organising the camp at Hiranandani Heritage in Kandivali on May 30. Besides Hiranandani, the gang had conducted similar camps at two production houses, one college and some corporate houses in Kandivali, Borivali, Andheri, Parel and Thane, police said. One person has been detained in Satna, Madhya Pradesh, and would be brought to Mumbai soon. It is suspected that he worked for a doctor who too is believed to be involved in the case, police said. The main accused Mahendra Singh is a Class X dropout who used to work with a medical association. He supervised and allotted work to others at the camps. Mr. Gupta, who is into event management, made on ground arrangements while the other two worked with hospitals and stole data from CoWin app to use as ids for those who were administered vaccines. As many as 390 residents of Hiranandani Heritage paid Rs. 1,260 each for a shot, and Rs. 4.56 lakh was paid by the society to the organisers. One Rajesh Pandey had approached the society saying he was PRO of Kokilaben Ambani Hospital and wanted to organise a vaccination camp. Mr. Pandey is absconding. Dilip Sawant, Additional Police Commissioner (North), said. “It is important that the society officials go through the circulars issued by the corporation and check on hospitals authorised to give jabs. There was no competent doctor present during the camp. With the help of BMC, we are investigating the vaccine’s authenticity.” The accused have been booked under sections of cheating, forgery, adulteration of the IPC and relevant sections of IT Act. “We have also charged them for adulteration as the seals of the vials were broken,” Mr. Sawant said. The accused have been remanded in police custody till June 25.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/4-held-for-fake-vaccination-camps/article34854893.ece

19 June 2021||Mumbai,||Plea seeks HC directions to fill vacant posts in MSHRC||A public interest litigation (PIL) petition has been filed before the Bombay High Court seeking directions from the court to the Maharashtra government to fill all vacant posts in the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission. The plea has been filed by advocate Vaishnavi Gholave (23) through advocate Vinod Sangvikar. The PIL said that on March 6, 2001, the Commission was constituted, and it consisted of one chairman, one judicial member, one expert member, one secretary, and one special inspector general of police. “There have been no regular appointments from July 2018. On April 27, 2021, the acting chairperson, the only adjudicating member, retired,” it said. On May 25, 2021, Ms. Gholave filed a Right to Information query seeking details on the vacant posts in the Commission. On May 28, she received a response that said, “Out of the total sanctioned 51 posts, only 26 posts are filled, and the rest 25 are vacant. All three adjudicatory members’ posts are lying vacant, and the post of chairperson has been vacant for more than three years.” The matter is expected to be heard in the coming week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/plea-seeks-hc-directions-to-fill-vacant-posts-in-mshrc/article34854895.ece

19 June 2021||Pune,||Arrest mastermind in Antilia bomb scare case: Minister||A day after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested former Mumbai policeman Pradeep Sharma in the Antilia bomb scare case and the murder of businessman Mansukh Hiren, NCP leader and Maharashtra Rural Development Minister Hasan Mushrif alleged there was a mastermind, who was apparently controlling Mr. Sharma and assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, who was arrested three months ago in connection with the same case. Hinting at former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh as the possible “mastermind”, Mr. Mushrif demanded his arrest while further alleging that the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was apparently trying to protect this “force” behind the two arrested policemen. “When an explosive-laden SUV was found parked outside Mukesh Ambani’s residence ‘Antilia’, I had demanded that the probe agencies arrest the mastermind in this case. Mr. Vaze and Mr. Sharma could not have the daring to carry out such a big racket. Another force lurks behind them which the BJP is trying to shield,” claimed Mr. Mushrif, speaking in Kolhapur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/arrest-mastermind-in-antilia-bomb-scare-case-minister/article34854891.ece

The court also imposed a penalty of Rs. 10,000 on convict Anil Kumar, alias Nillu, a woodcutter. The 16-year-old girl was raped and killed in a forested area in Shimla’s Kotkhai when she was returning home from her school on July 4, 2017. The court had held Anil guilty on April 28 under the IPC sections related to rape and murder and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Special Judge Rajeev Bhardwaj pronounced the order in the presence of the convict on Friday. Not satisfied with the verdict, Gudiya’s mother demanded reinvestigation into the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/life-in-jail-till-death-for-man-in-kotkhai-case/article34855169.ece
19 June 2021||Tehran,||Conservative cleric tipped to win as Iran votes in presidential poll||Iranians voted on Friday in a presidential election, in which conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi is seen as all but certain to coast to victory after all serious rivals were barred from running. After a lacklustre campaign, turnout was expected to fall to a new low in a country exhausted by a punishing regime of U.S. economic sanctions that has dashed the hopes of many for a brighter future. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, cast the first vote in Tehran and then urged Iran’s nearly 60 million eligible voters to follow suit before the scheduled close of polls at midnight. “The sooner you perform this task and duty, the better,” said the 81-year-old, stressing that voting “serves to build the future” of the Iranian people. Pictures of often flag-waving voters dominated state TV coverage, but away from the polling stations some voiced anger at what they saw as a stage-managed election. Economic woes “Whether I vote or not, someone has already been elected,” scoffed Tehran shopkeeper Saeed Zareie about the pre-election vetting that barred all but seven of the more than 600 hopefuls. “They organise the elections for the media.” Enthusiasm has been dampened further by the economic malaise of spiralling inflation and job losses, that has been deepened by the pandemic. “I’m not a politician, I don’t know anything about politics,” said Tehran car mechanic Nasrollah. “I have no money. All families are now facing economic problems. How can we vote for these people who did this to us? It’s not right.” Iranian opposition groups abroad and some dissidents at home have urged a boycott of the vote they see as an engineered victory for Mr. Raisi, the 60-year-old head of the judiciary, to cement ultraconservative control. But many queued to vote at schools, mosques and community centres, some carrying Iran’s green, white and red national flag. One conservative mother wearing the full-body black chador came with her two young sons dressed in the camouflage uniform of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Ultimate political power in Iran, since its 1979 revolution toppled the US-backed monarchy, rests with the supreme leader. But the President, as the top official of the state bureaucracy, also wields significant influence in fields from industrial policy to foreign affairs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/conservative-cleric-tipped-to-win-as-iran-votes-in-presidential-poll/article34854575.ece
19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||What led to the Biden-Putin summit?||In 2011, Joe Biden, then Vice President in the Obama administration, visited Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. Inside Mr. Putin’s office, Mr. Biden “held his hand a few inches from his nose,” he recalled later in a conversation with journalist Evan Osnos. “I said, ‘Mr. Prime Minister, I am looking into your eyes, and I don’t think you have a soul’.” When Mr. Osnos, who has described this conversation in his book Joe Biden American Dreamer , asked if he said that to Mr. Putin, Mr. Biden replied, ‘Absolutely, positively”. In March 2021, after assuming the White House,Mr. Biden described Mr. Putin as a “killer”.He also said the Russian leader was “going to pay” for the “interference” in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Three months later, the sameMr. Biden met Mr. Putin in the Swiss city of Genevaand sought a more predictable relationship between the “two great powers”. Western alliance In the past, when American Presidents visited Europe and met NATO allies, Russia had been their main focus. But this time, when Mr. Biden went to Europe, his first foreign trip after becoming the President, the focus was on China — a sign of the emerging shifts in the global power balance. Mr. Biden held a host of talks with separate blocs in Europe — the Group of Seven (G7), NATO and the EU — with a focus on strengthening the western alliance. The G7 industrialised nations — the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan — issued a communiqué slamming China’s human rights records. Issues such as the detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang, the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, growing tensions with Taiwan and the alleged lack of transparency on COVID-19 were all mentioned in the G7 statement. The 30-member NATO, whose traditional focus has been on Russia, has also issued a statement in which China has been mentioned multiple times. NATO members warned against the “systemic challenges to the rules-based international order” emanating from China’s rise. The U.S. and the 27-member EU have decided to cooperate more on technology, regulation, industrial development and trade in an attempt to help the West compete better with China. They have also decided to set up a high-level trade and technology council, which would boost innovation and investment. The China focus This approach is in line with the Biden administration’s overall focus on reorienting American foreign policy to deal with the China challenge more effectively. In the past six months since he assumed office, Mr. Biden has taken a host of decisions in this regard. He ended America’s support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, and is pulling back all American troops from Afghanistan by September 11. In March, he called the first summit of Quad countries — the U.S., India, Japan and Australia — which decided to boost vaccine production to help other countries. At home, the U.S. Congress passed the $250 billion tech and manufacturing Bill, which would ensure funds for the semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing initiatives. The aim is undoubtedly to counter China. And then, Mr. Biden travelled to Europe to rally reluctant allies around the U.S. in the emerging geopolitical contest. When Mr. Biden moves forward, focusing on China, Russia remains a distraction. Ties between the two countries, as both leaders have admitted, are at the lowest point since the end of the Cold War. There were allegations of Russian cyberattacks and election interference in the U.S., while Moscow is reeling under Western sanctions and seems determined to resist any move by NATO to expand into its backyard. Ukraine remains an unresolved crisis. Earlier this year, Mr. Putin had assembled Russian troops on the Ukraine border in a direct challenge to Mr. Biden. After he recalled Russian Ambassador from Washington and asked the American Ambassador to return for consultations, bilateral relations between the two countries practically collapsed. On the other side, Russia was steadily deepening its partnership with China. Mr. Biden appears to have wanted to arrest this free fall of ties and bring in some order. Detente with Russia In the Geneva summit, Mr. Biden stopped short of characterising Mr. Putin, which he had done in the past, and held talks on critical issues. One summit doesn’t resolve the serious foreign policy differences between the two former Cold War rivals, but both leaders have sought a détente. Mr. Putin said it’s “primarily a pragmatic relationship”, while Mr. Biden said it’s not about trust but about “self interest”. And they decided to return their Ambassadors and follow up bilateral engagements with “a strategic stability dialogue” on arms reduction. The message from Geneva is that the leaders wanted to establish rules of engagement so that the countries can better address their differences and seek common ground on issues of mutual interest. With some predictability in ties with Russia, Mr. Biden can strengthen his China-focused foreign policy. And with a less hostile America, Mr. Putin can retain Russian influence in the country’s backyard. In the past, President Donald Trump had sought to isolate China and reach out to Russia. But, amid allegations that a Russian cyber campaign helped him win the 2016 elections, Mr. Trump’s attempts to build a bond with Mr. Putin met with strong resistance in Washington. But Mr. Biden, an establishment Democrat himself, seems to be having more leeway in the Russia policy. It’s too early to see any meaningful change in Russia-U.S. relations. But the Geneva summit suggests that policymakers in Washington have at least started thinking of Russia as a secondary challenge that needs to be tackled diplomatically, not only through coercion, if the U.S. wants to take on a rising China.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/what-led-to-the-biden-putin-summit/article34854579.ece
19 June 2021||Hong Kong,||Hong Kong newspaper raises print run fivefold after arrests||Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily increased its print run more than fivefold to 5,00,000 copies as residents lined up Friday to buy the paper in a show of support for beleaguered press freedoms, a day after police arrested five top editors and executives. The raid on the paper’s offices by hundreds of police and security agents — along with the freezing of $2.3 million worth of its assets — marked the first time a sweeping national security law has been used against the media. It was the latest sign of a widening crackdown on civil liberties in the semi-autonomous city, which has long cherished freedoms that don’t exist elsewhere in China. Police said the editors were arrested on suspicion of foreign collusion to endanger national security, based on over 30 articles that authorities said had called for international sanctions against China and Hong Kong. On Friday, the National Security Department charged two men, according to a government statement. The South China Morning Post newspaper cited an unnamed source saying they are Apply Daily ’s chief editor Ryan Law and Cheung Kim-hung, the CEO of Apple Daily ’s publisher Next Digital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hong-kong-newspaper-raises-print-run-fivefold-after-arrests/article34854576.ece
19 June 2021||Washington,||U.S. to spend $3.2 bn to develop treatments for COVID-19||The United States has announced that it will spend $3.2 billion on developing antiviral treatments for COVID-19 and prepare for other “pandemic threats” — viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics. Vaccines will continue to remain the “centrepiece of our arsenal against COVID-19,” Anthony Fauci, medical adviser to the U.S. President, said on Thursday, when he described the programme, called the Antiviral Program for Pandemics. “However, antivirals can and are an important complement to existing vaccines, especially for individuals with certain conditions that might put them at a greater risk,” he said. “And it also adds a line of defence against other unexpected emerging things, like variants of concern that we are currently dealing with…,” he added. Regarding viruses with “pandemic potential”, Dr. Fauci put up a slide listing some of them: coronaviruses (e.g., SARS , MERS), filoviruses (e.g. Ebola), togaviruses (e.g., chikungunya), paramyxoviruses (e.g., Nipah) and picornaviruses (e.g., enterovirus D68). Vaccine allocation The programme seeks to accelerate the testing and authorisation of promising medicines and also support the discovery of new molecules by industry and academia, he said. Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Roche are among those testing antiviral pills currently, the Associated Press reported. The U.S. will be allocating 55 million vaccine doses to other countries “in the coming days,” the country’s coronavirus response coordinator Jeffrey Zients said at Thursday’s briefing. These 55 million doses are from a stockpile of 80 million doses that the U.S. has committed to other countries. This includes 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that has not yet been approved for use in America. The U.S. has already allocated 25 million of these doses bilaterally and via international vaccine distribution alliance COVAX. It is unclear how many doses India will receive totally, but indications are it will not be more than a few million. Some countries — such as Canada and Mexico — have received such doses. “There’ll be an increasing number of shipments each and every week as we ramp up these efforts. The process to export the 80 million takes partnership in coordination with the receiving governments. But that’s well underway now,” Mr. Zients said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-to-spend-32-bn-to-develop-treatments-for-covid-19/article34854573.ece
19 June 2021||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka to seek India’s help to treat COVID-19 affected lion||Sri Lankan authorities on  Friday said they would seek guidance from India on treating animals contracting COVID-19, after a lion at a Colombo zoo tested positive. Eleven-year-old Thor, a lion gifted by a zoo in Seoul in 2013, tested positive for COVID-19, becoming the first known case of an animal contracting the deadly virus in the island nation, which is currently experiencing a persistent third wave, with over 60,000 active infections. “We are seeking guidance from the Central Zoo Authority in India in order to treat Thor,” said Ishini Wickremesinghe, Director General of the Department of National Zoological Gardens. In a statement on Friday, she said Thor experienced breathing difficulties and did not eat over the last few days. Soon after, authorities at the Dehiwala Zoo in Colombo decided to test the lion for a possible COVID-19 infection. While antigen tests showed a negative result, a few PCR tests taken subsequently showed the lion as COVID-19 positive. Thor has since been receiving oxygen support, while other animals have been isolated, according to zoo authorities. The animals’ keepers have also been sent to quarantine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-to-seek-indias-help-to-treat-covid-19-affected-lion/article34854577.ece

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||A village basking in vaccine glory||A 3-km dirt track from Bandipora town allows vehicles passage to the whooshing Madhumati stream at Athwatoo village near the foothills of the Himalayas. The stream is noisy and in full flow — the glaciers nearby are melting fast under the warmth of the June sun in north Kashmir. Across the stream, there are multiple narrow pony tracks on steep slopes. They lead to Viewan village, about 35 km away from the Bandipora district headquarters. On foot from Athwatoo, Viewan’s last house is 11 km away. From here, the glaciers feeding the stream suddenly become visible and look like shimmering mirrors. On the pony tracks, human habitation is visible first in Tangtari after 3 km of trekking. This cluster of 12 families is in the lower flank of Viewan village. About 2 km away, Taziyat Jan and her daughter Naziya Jan sit in a two-storey mud-and-wood house buttressed against a slope in the midst of a dense forest. In this village — quaint, inaccessible and quiet — Taziyat has received her first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. “I had heard a lot of negative things about the vaccine. I was hesitant at first, but doctors counselled us and motivated us to take it. They said the vaccination certificates are going to be an important document to move around and visit offices. So, I agreed,” she says. Viewan shot into the limelight on June 7 when it was declared India’s first vaccinated village against COVID-19. Everyone aged 18 and above has received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This glory has led to a big push for a pro-vaccine movement in Kashmir. A remote village There are 710 adults — 348 of them aged above 45 years and 362 above 18 years — in and around Viewan village. Unlike the rest of the country, where fear of the virus prevails and lockdowns are still in effect, the local farmers and herders in the village have resumed a normal routine with some confidence. Nawab Gojri, Taziyat’s husband, got vaccinated in the first week of June. He then left on an arduous journey to G.G. Gali along with his cattle comprising 500 sheep. The upper reaches have untouched, green meadows where the cattle enjoy grazing. Back home, a ferocious dog keeps watch against any attack by bears. “I had fever and dizziness after getting vaccinated, but it subsided quickly. My husband and I feel fine now. I am worried for my daughter who has suffered from a foot disease since childhood. The treatment is expensive, and we have dropped the idea of visiting any hospital,” Taziyat says. Taziyat, like most inhabitants of Viewan, does not possess a radio, television or mobile phone. Only a few villagers have radio sets and trek to points where they can catch a signal. With no communication access, information about the virus trickled in through a few locals like Rafiq Rehman. A farmer in his 30s, Rafiq knew that something terrible was unfolding in the plains throughout the year and people were dying. “I first heard about the pandemic on the radio in March,” Rehman says. Rehman and his family decided then that they would not venture towards the town. Taziyat first came to know about the virus when doctors started streaming into the village in the last week of May. “Doctors told me that there is this disease which can kill us. They said if a person contracts it, the whole village can be wiped out. But Allah will take care of us now. We had no case of COVID-19 last year or this year,” Taziyat says. The topography of Viewan village may have helped it to escape the fast-spreading pandemic in Bandipora district. It is a small village, remote, and landlocked. But for the same reasons, it has been a daunting task for the officials to vaccinate its population. Shedding the Wuhan tag Bandipora district has a population of 3.92 lakh, according to the 2011 Census. Ninety-eight people have died of COVID-19 in the district so far. Thirty-six of them died in the second wave this year among the 4,338 people who tested positive until June 15. The Deputy Commissioner of Bandipora, Dr Owais Ahmad, believes in aggressive sampling. This is what has helped keep the mortality rate low in this district. At least 2,44,215 samples, including 1,33,152 this year, have been collected since the pandemic outbreak. The sample size is equal to 62.2% of the total population of the district. “Around 90% of the 45-plus age group has been covered so far.  Extensive sampling, isolation of positive patients and strict preventive measures have all helped the district control the spread of the virus,” Ahmad says. The district administration also worked on setting up a five-bed COVID-19 Care Centre in every panchayat. Last year, though, things were different for the district. Bandipora was labelled the ‘Wuhan of Kashmir’ when about 90% of the population in Gund Jahangir village, which has 1,500 people, tested positive for the virus in May-June. “I still remember when the houses in Gund Jahangir village emptied out and most of the people were shifted to quarantine centres last year. We dreaded walking through the streets and fields of Gund Jahangir,” says Dr Masarat Iqbal Wani, Block Medical Officer, Bandipora. Wani, backed by Ahmad, was keen to not only get rid of this label but also beat the virus. The team began to work on a model, now known as the Viewan model, to battle the pandemic. The thrust, Wani says, was to create a chain of resource persons who could dispel the various myths about the vaccine, develop a rapport with the hesitant population, and convey the importance of vaccination before convincing the people to take the jab. “We chose Viewan among 29 other remote villages of Bandipora because even if a single COVID-19-affected person made his or her entry into these pockets, it would have been catastrophic. It would have been very difficult for the affected population to reach the nearest medical centres in the plains. Vaccinating them was like creating a buffer wall, which we did,” Wani says. All 267 villagers in the main cluster of Viewan village have been vaccinated with Covishield. In the other  28 villages, the 45-plus population has been inoculated with one dose. The Viewan model The officials decided to first sensitise the population. They chose locals to influence the villagers, initiated vaccination drives, and sent a dedicated team of medical practitioners door-to-door for inoculation. Doctors were stationed nearby to address medical complications arising from vaccination. Around 600 people of the Bandipora health department split into 60 teams to vaccinate the population. The population aged 45 and above is nearing 100% inoculation this week. The pace of the drive for people aged 18 and above has slowed down due to a low stock of vaccines. It was one such team comprising doctors, one auxiliary nurse midwife, an accredited social health activist worker, an anganwadi worker, a booth-level officer, teachers, sarpanchs, panchs, block development council members and voluntary influencers that visited Viewan on May 21 with a narrative and a method. “There was hesitancy among the population regarding the vaccine. They had heard that some scientist  had warned that people will die within two years of taking the vaccine,” says Wani. Many men hid in the jungles to escape getting vaccinated. “We managed to vaccinate only six people in the village, including the sarpanch, on our first trip,” he says. Bagh Hussain, the sarpanch, says he could not sleep the night after inoculation. “We had heard that our limbs would fall off, we would die, etc. I was traumatised by these thoughts. But I realised that I need to show faith in the doctors to ensure that my community is safe from the virus,” he says. For the next 10 days after the first visit, the team did not disturb the village. It was in the first week of June that the team returned with more evidence. All the doctors and paramedical staff carried videos of people being vaccinated to earn the trust of the villagers. “Once we were back in the village, we called all the six people who had been vaccinated 10 days earlier to tell us how they feel. The live demonstration worked for the rest of the population,” Wani says. The team had another problem: all the elders in the village would either go to the fields or the upper reaches to graze cattle during the day. “So, we decided to do door-to-door vaccination at night. The sarpanch, who was vaccinated in the first trip, accompanied us to ensure that there was no communication gap,” Wani says. The vaccination drive would start after sundown and continue well into midnight. As there was no accommodation available in this remote village, the female staff of the health department stayed with the families, and the male staff stayed at the Viewan high school building. The building has been empty since the second wave hit India: all the 80-odd students enrolled there are at home. The entire population was vaccinated within three days and two nights. Recalling the tour of the village, Jehangeer Ahmad, who is in his 20s, says he started trekking around 8 a.m. and reached the village around 12:30 p.m. It was not easy to develop a connection with the villagers immediately. “We started a free medical camp once we reached the village. People started trooping in. Most women were anaemic. We addressed their chronic diseases. At the same time, we made them understand that vaccine certificates would help people access government offices in the future besides saving their lives,” Ahmad says. Neelofar Jan, 30, a public health worker who vaccinated the villagers, has blisters from the arduous trek but that did not deter her from raising awareness about the vaccines. She says the women were very hesitant. “We sat with them and educated them by providing a lot of details. We gave them a patient hearing. The biggest concern among women was infertility. We told them that this vaccine was like other vaccines which they had received as children to fight polio and measles. We told them that it is an immunity booster. Some people shut their doors but then, slowly, everyone started opening their doors to us,” Jan says. The task of sensitising the population was not possible without a local influencer. Azad Hussain Sheikh, a government teacher who has worked as a booth-level officer during elections since 2008, had developed a rapport with the population. “I have visited Viewan many times. People know me and have faith in me. I used that influence to reinforce a pro-vaccine narrative. It worked,” Sheikh says. Only 10 pregnant women could not be vaccinated in Viewan as the government has not yet approved of a policy to inoculate this segment. “When we vaccinated the entire eligible population of the village, we did not know that it would be the first village in the country to get this tag. We are very happy to achieve this feat. It was a joint effort between the top officials of the administration and grassroots representatives,” Ahmad says. Since the village has no Internet, there was no way the team could register the details online. Details were written manually on a file at the spot. “Three days later, when the staff returned, the data were fed into the application for an official record,” Wani says. A pro-vaccine movement The focus on Viewan has spurred a pro-vaccine movement in Bandipora district. Majaz Hassan Khan, a candidate from Banakoot who lost the block development council polls, says he used the technique deployed during electioneering in his block to get people vaccinated. “I went door-to-door and pleaded with the people to get vaccinated, just like I would do to seek votes. When a medical team is backed by the political class in such initiatives, it does multiply the effect,” Khan says. The Viewan model is being replicated across Bandipora. Health workers have drafted elaborate plans to go and inoculate people at night in far-off villages like Kundara, Chandaji and Sumlar where menfolk work in the fields during the day or take cattle for grazing. “Late evening and midnight inoculations have proved successful in far-off villages. We need to design our vaccination plan according to the requirement of the population. Each village, semi-urban and urban pocket may require a different approach,” Wani says. About 27 km away from Wani’s hospital at the district headquarters, shikaras (small wooden boats) are decked up, with blue boxes of vaccines placed safely at one end. Wearing personal protection equipment, doctors and paramedical staff have decided to create a vaccine buffer in and around Wular lake, India’s third largest freshwater lake. At Kolhama, an island in the lake, doctors took samples to check if the population has been affected by the virus. After this examination, healthcare workers started vaccinating about 2,400 people. In another cluster of Zurimanz, 250 fishermen were vaccinated when they were out fishing in the lake during the day. Bandipora’s influencers, like kick-boxing champion Tajamul Islam, 13, are also out on the streets to encourage those above 18 to line up for vaccination. “We can only defeat the virus by getting a jab,” Islam says. The Viewan model has impressed the Bombay High Court too. On June 12, while hearing a petition, the court underlined the need to look at the door-to-door vaccination programme carried out successfully by Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala, with special reference to the country’s first village that has got vaccinated. “How is it that individual States like Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir have introduced and are successfully doing door-to-door vaccination? What is the Centre’s comment on the Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir pattern?” the Bench asked. Unaware of the glory, Taziyat keeps looking at the sky-touching ridges of the Bandipora mountains where her vaccinated husband has gone to graze the cattle. “I am waiting for him to return safely with healthy cattle. We need to earn money to treat our daughter.

In an article published in Nature Medicine on June 9, an analysis of data from the United Kingdom, gathered between December 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 when the alpha variant was predominant, showed that the AstraZeneca vaccine had an effectiveness of 64% after one dose and 79% after two doses, in protecting against severe illness and death. In the same article ((https://go.nature.com/3zBxR8x), the authors also found that a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 had a significant protective effect against re-infection. Vaccine data On June 14, Public Health England released a report that showed that the AstraZeneca vaccine had an effectiveness of 71% after one dose and 92% after two doses in protecting from hospitalisation due to the delta variant (https://bit.ly/2S9kk7j). In the first report of vaccine effectiveness from India, researchers from the Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, reported an analysis of 8,991 staff who had been vaccinated between January 21, 2021 and April 30, 2021, predominantly with Covishield, in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings (https://bit.ly/3qeCEsb). The protective effect of vaccination was 92% against need for oxygen and 94% against need for intensive care. There were no deaths, but about 10% of those who had received one or two doses were infected. Although sequencing was not available, many breakthrough infections were probably due to the delta variant strain. These data from the United Kingdom and India show that the Covishield vaccine is working against the variants. More detailed studies on whether the vaccines are continuing to work, if yes, for how long, or against new variants, will continue to be needed. We also need to consider what we expect from vaccines at different stages of the pandemic. At the level of the individual, we expect vaccines to be safe and provide protection from disease and death at least, and preferably also from mild disease and infection. From the point of view of public health, we expect vaccines to decrease the burden of illness and spread of infection. For society, however, beyond the needs of public health, the ability to go back to productivity and social interactions also matters. These different needs require policy approaches that balance the achievement of health and societal goals with the potential impact, and the exigencies of supply constraints. In a time of urgent need and short supply, a clear and measurable goal is essential. The prioritisation and delivery strategy needs to align with the goal to achieve maximum impact. We have been somewhat confused about the goal, with early announcements of vaccinating 300 million people being replaced by all adults. With the increase in highly transmissible variants, it is clear that to both prevent disease and slow spread, we will need to cover a larger proportion of the population, possibly extending at a later stage to children. On herd immunity When vaccines seemed to be somewhere in the future with no predictability on timing or supply, discussions on the pandemic focused on ‘herd immunity’ or the percentage of the population that needed to be infected or vaccinated in order to slow the spread of infection. The Swedish strategy of limited restrictions and the Great Barrington declaration (https://gbdeclaration.org/)attracted much opprobrium as many scientific commentators considered it callous to follow a strategy which meant that a lot of people would get infected with the virus. Herd immunity or herd effect or herd protection is an often misunderstood term, but a key attribute is that the more transmissible the agent, the higher the level of the population that needs to be infected or vaccinated. With the delta variant, it is clear that the earlier plan to vaccinate a smaller proportion of the population is not appropriate and reaching up to 85% of the population might be necessary. This implies that not only will we have to consider all adults but we should be planning for children as well. Long- and short-term goals The control of infection in the population is the long-term goal. The short-term goal is to protect individuals at highest risk and to save lives. The deaths from COVID-19 show clearly that those who are the oldest are at the greatest risk of severe disease and mortality, with distinct stratification of severity by age, followed by those with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Yet, the risk of severe disease and death among younger people, though low, is not zero and therefore when large numbers of young people get infected some of them will die even with the best medical management. Nonetheless, the goal of preventing the maximum number of severe cases and deaths clearly requires an age descending approach. This was indeed the strategy that was initially implemented in India, but the opening of the age tiers has not kept pace with the supply. The Government has not revealed a clear road map of availability of vaccines and their supply to individual States. This has highlighted the reluctance by the Government of India to reveal information which would help in formulating a predictable delivery mechanism that could be communicated to citizens. Coupled with the anti-science statements made by those seen as close to the Government, this has led to a situation where the public is confused as to how best to cope with the novel coronavirus pandemic. With the promise of vaccines as at least a partial solution, but with no certainty on availability, doubt, fear, anxiety and depression are widespread. To move forward, we must accept that it is extremely unlikely that we will achieve the goal of vaccinating every adult by the end of 2021. Therefore, based on the principles of public health, we must vaccinate those most at risk from serious illness and death first. Based on population pyramid data, we can extrapolate that there are about 360 million above the age of 45 years. Even though recent data from the United Kingdom with the delta variant indicates a slightly lower effectiveness against severe disease requiring hospitalisation with a single dose (71% with one dose and 92% with two doses), the high rates of previous exposures in India may make it feasible to immunise a large part of our population with a single dose, at least initially (https://bit.ly/35vIjAG). Rural focus The final prioritisation and approach should be modelled before policy is made and implemented, but for delivery, a rural focus is key. We must take the vaccine to every village, building on the experiences of the pulse polio programme and conducting elections. Community leaders should be empowered with information and tools to broadcast the message that the vaccine saves lives. The central government has centralised vaccine purchase but must revisit the private sector allocation and cede distribution to States, providing support when requested. The CoWIN app must not be a limiting factor on access to the vaccine. Evidence, models, good data As more vaccines become available the vaccination policy must be adapted quickly to changing circumstances. We must generate evidence and develop models to design the appropriate vaccination strategy for younger populations. If cases are climbing in a particular region, we should direct vaccine doses there to protect as much of the population as possible and decrease both disease and further spread. High vaccination coverage in cities may protect rural areas. Some professions are most likely to spread infection and should therefore be prioritised for vaccination. Finally, the Government must trust its citizens and share the information that is solely available to it. A notable aspect of the pandemic is the absence of credible data from the government. This has led to speculative ideas based on poor or poorly understood information and misinformation. The management of the pandemic has been severely impacted by this lack of granular, interpretable, actionable data. We need to restore society to normalcy. Good data, or the ability to measure what matters, is the key.

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||In India, looking beyond the binary to a spectrum||Last month, when the cases surrounding the question of same-sex marriages came up before the High Court of Delhi, the Union Government was found to be dithering. The Solicitor General of India made himself available only to request the court to have the matter adjourned on the ground that it was not urgent. Though the Union Government argued that the matter was not important in the context of the second wave of COVID-19 cases, it overlooked the basic notion that the plight of persons in same-sex and queer relationships looking after each other — without the legal protection of marital relationships — was exacerbated by the pandemic. In any case, it is a matter of some concern that the Union Government does not find urgency in a matter of extending civil rights to a class of persons who have approached a constitutional court. Nevertheless, given the march of law — both international and domestic — in the direction of expanding human rights, jurisprudence necessarily means that the provision of marriage rights to same-sex and queer couples is only a matter of time. Any further delay in doing so would fall foul of our constitutional guarantees, judgments rendered by various High Courts and evolving international jurisprudence. The last two decades have witnessed tremendous progress in establishing civil rights for the LGBTQIA+ community. International jurisprudence In 2005, the Constitutional Court of South Africa in the case of Minister of Home Affairs and Another vs Fourie and Another ; Lesbian and Gay Equality Project and Eighteen Others vs Minister of Home Affairs and Others [2005] ZACC 19, unanimously held that the common law definition of marriage i.e. “a union of one man with one woman” was inconsistent with the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. Consequently, the Parliament of South Africa was given 12 months to amend the Marriage Act 25 of 1961, failing which the Marriage Act would stand amended, by virtue of the decision of the Constitutional Court, to include the words “or spouse” after the words “or husband”. As a result of the verdict, the Civil Union Act, 2006 was enacted, enabling the voluntary union of two persons above 18 years of age, by way of marriage. In 2007 in Australia, the reforms to civil rights of queer community were prompted by the Honourable Michael Kirby (then judge of the High Court of Australia) writing to the Attorney-General of Australia asking for the judicial pension scheme to be extended to his gay partner of 38 years (at that time). After initial opposition from the Federal Government, the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws – General Law Reform) Act 2008 came to be enacted to provide provide equal entitlements for same-sex couples in matters of, inter alia , social security, employment and taxation. Similarly, in England and Wales, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 enabled same-sex couples to marry in civil ceremonies or with religious rites. More recently, in 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples. The case of Obergefell vs Hodges ushered in a landmark shift in the American position and allowing same-sex marriages to be recognised and treated on a par with opposite-sex marriages. While doing so, the Supreme Court of the United States held the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples to be a “grave and continuing harm, serving to disrespect and subordinate gays and lesbians”. Across the world, the recognition of the unequal laws discriminating against the LGBTQIA+ community has acted as a trigger to reform and modernise legal architecture to become more inclusive and equal.  Courts and civil rights In India, marriages solemnised under personal laws such as the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 and so on. At present, though same-sex and queer marriages are not clearly recognised in India, we are not bereft of judicial guidance. In the case of Arunkumar and Sreeja vs The Inspector General of Registration and Ors. [W.P.(MD)No. 4125 of 2019 & W.P.(MD)No. 3220 of 2019], the Madurai Bench of the High Court of Madras employed a beneficial and purposive interpretation holding that the term ‘bride’ under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 includes transwomen and intersex persons identifying as women. Therefore, a marriage solemnised between a male and a transwoman, both professing the Hindu religion, is deemed to be a valid marriage under the Act. The import of this judgment cannot be overstated as it expands the scope of a term used in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 in a progressive manner and sets the stage for re-imagining marriage rights of the LGBTQIA+ community. The judgment of the Madras High Court builds on the tenets laid down by the Supreme Court of India in Shafin Jahan vs Asokan K.M. and Others AIR 2018 SC 1933 (Hadiya case), wherein the right to choose and marry a partner was considered to be a constitutionally guaranteed freedom. By doing so, the Supreme Court held that the “intimacies of marriage lie within a core zone of privacy, which is inviolable” and that “society has no role to play in determining our choice of partners”. The only logical interpretation from reading these cases together, it is apparent that any legal or statutory bar to same-sex and queer marriages must necessarily be held to be unconstitutional and specifically violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. No longer can the position of the Union Government that marriage is a bond between “a biological man and a biological woman” be tenable.  Expanding scope of marriage The domain of marriages, including religious marriages, cannot be immune to reform and review. Self-respect marriages were legalised in Tamil Nadu (and subsequently, in Puducherry) through amendments to the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Self-respect marriages, commonly conducted among those who are part of the Dravidian Movement, have done away with priests and religious symbols such as fire or saptapadi . Instead, solemnisation of self-respect marriages only requires an exchange of rings or garlands or tying of the mangalsutra . Such reform of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 to bring self-respect marriages under its very umbrella, is seen as a strong move towards breaking caste-based practices within the institution of marriage. Similarly, understanding the needs of the LGBTQIA+ community today, the law must now expand the institution of marriage to include all gender and sexual identities. At least 29 countries in the world have legalised same-sex marriage. It is time that India thinks beyond the binary and reviews its existing legal architecture in order to legalise marriages irrespective of gender identity and sexual orientation.

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Fair assessment||With its marks tabulation framework for Class 12 students encompassing three assessment years starting with Class 10, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has ended prolonged anxiety among lakhs of students. The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) has also developed a similar system. Student evaluation after a chaotic pandemic year remains a challenge in all countries, and many have opted for a hybrid system of school-level internal assessments combined with any examinations that may have been held. The CBSE scheme, evolved to fulfil a Supreme Court mandate, distributes score weightage across the Class 10 public examination, the Class 11 annual test, and the Class 12 school tests in a 30:30:40 ratio for theory, and actual score for internal assessment and practicals. This aims to level out any aberrant phase in a student’s performance. Since the marks considered from Class 10 will be the average of the best three subjects among five, students must feel reassured. When they wrote that examination, they had no inkling of the future importance of the score. A provision to take a Class 12 public examination at a later date to attain a higher score when the pandemic has waned should also have a calming effect. Evidently, there are some challenges to uniformly implementing the CBSE plan, and its success hinges on the approach of school result committees responsible for inclusion of Class 12 marks. Uneven access to devices and online connectivity in the final school year, with an impact on scores or even resulting in non-appearance must be resolved by the result committees. Successful conclusion of Class 12 assessment, which lacks the standardisation available in a public examination, and declaration of results by July 31 depend on result committees marking the theory segment transparently and moderating marks for the senior secondary years based on the school’s performance over a period of time. There is then the issue of fraud. Even in the U.K., reports indicate influential parents brought pressure on schools to give their wards an unfair hike in grades in a similar mixed evaluation system, with veiled threats of legal disputes. For fairness, CBSE mandates the participation of external members on the result committees, but it will take utmost openness to dispel students’ apprehensions. State Boards waiting for the central model for comparison also need to draw up safeguards, including a dependable dispute resolution process. Education boards were caught unawares last year by the pandemic and could not evolve suitable evaluation tools. Unfortunately, the course of the pandemic remains uncertain, and developing a continuous assessment system for 2021-22 and beyond has become a necessity. The CBSE has taken the lead on this, and State Boards must not lose time in forming their own.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fair-assessment/article34854559.ece
19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Cold peace||The Geneva summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday, has set a pragmatic tone for engagement between the two competing powers. Mr. Biden had, in the past, called Mr. Putin “a killer”. Relations have hit the lowest point in recent years since the end of the Cold War. The U.S. has accused Russia of interfering in its elections and launching cyberattacks and criticised its stifling of internal dissent, while Moscow has slammed America’s “interventionist” foreign policy. Despite these differences, the leaders held talks on all critical issues, bringing diplomacy to the centre-stage. After the summit, they have struck cautious optimism that is rooted in self-interest. Mr. Biden sought a more predictable, rational engagement, while Mr. Putin said relations were “primarily pragmatic”. They have decided to return their Ambassadors to the Embassies and announced “a strategic stability dialogue” to discuss terms of arms control measures. While there was no major breakthrough, which was not expected anyway, they could at least demonstrate a willingness to strengthen engagement and reduce tensions. There are structural issues in the U.S.-Russia ties. When Russia ended its post-Soviet strategic retreat and adopted a more assertive foreign policy under Mr. Putin, partly in response to NATO expansion into eastern Europe, the West saw it as a threat to its primacy. The 2008 Georgia war practically ended the romance between “democratic Russia” and the West. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 renewed tensions. Russia was thrown out of the G8, and western sanctions followed. But such steps did not deter Mr. Putin. Ties hit rock bottom after allegations that Russian intelligence units had carried out cyberattacks and run an online campaign to get Donald Trump elected President in the 2016 U.S. election. Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin cannot resolve these geopolitical and bilateral issues in one summit. But they can certainly take measures to prevent relations from worsening. For the U.S., the cyberattacks are a red line. Russia, which had amassed troops on the Ukraine border earlier this year, sees NATO’s expansion into its border region as a threat. Both countries should be ready to address their critical concerns and agree to a cold peace, which would help in addressing other geopolitical problems such as Syria. The U.S. should be less pessimistic about Russia’s foreign policy goals. Whether the Americans like it or not, Russia, despite its weakened economic status, remains a great power. Mr. Putin should also realise that if his goal is to restore Russia’s lost glory in global politics, he should be ready to cooperate with the West. Permanent hostility with other powers cannot be of much help to Russia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cold-peace/article34854560.ece
19 June 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Q2 manufacturing expectations drop’||Early results from the RBI’s June Industrial Outlook Survey show that not only has the summary index of current business conditions for the manufacturing sector dropped for the current quarter, but also that the index of expectations for the second quarter of FY2022 has declined, as per observations made by Shashanka Bhide, member of the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee, at the MPC meeting earlier this month. The RBI on Friday released the minutes of the meeting. “These perceptions of business conditions point to the adverse economic conditions,” Dr. Bhide noted. He said while the data on the impact of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was limited, qualitative data from the surveys of households and enterprises suggest ‘significant dent’ in consumer and business sentiment. “The survey of Consumer Confidence conducted by RBI in the last week of April and up to May 10, in 13 major cities... reveals a sharp rise in the percentage of respondents who perceive the current general economic conditions to be worse than a year back, compared to a similar survey conducted two months back,” he added. Importantly, 51.5% of the respondents opined that economic conditions would be worse a year ahead. Observing that the economy’s recovery would hinge on the decline in the spread of the disease, he said, “acceleration in the vaccination program and availability of health care would be a key to boost the confidence of the consumers, workers and producers in the resumption of their economic lives”. Ashima Goyal, another member, cautioned against laying too much store by the latest round of the RBI’s surveys, noting that these were conducted during a “period of highest fear and uncertainty that very likely affected consumer responses” given that the number of fresh cases peaked on May 7. “Robust inferences have to await surveys taken in more normal times,” she suggested. ‘Forecasts less reliable’ Dr. Goyal also noted that the MPC had moved to data-based guidance, given that expectations and forecasts were less reliable in times of ‘such uncertainty’, a view echoed by fellow member Jayanth R. Varma. Prof. Varma said the MPC must be sensitive to the risk that inflation expectations could become entrenched if inflation remains elevated for too long.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/q2-manufacturing-expectations-drop/article34854548.ece
19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||OWO is our largest redevelopment, it is the group’s commitment to Britain||The Hinduja Group recently put up its OWO Residences by Raffles, Europe’s first Raffles-branded residences, on the market. Targeted at ultra-high-net-worth individuals, who may aspire to own a piece of the Old War Office, the property’s redevelopment is set to be completed in 2022.   Group co-chairman G.P. Hinduja said the property, which had stood witness to many wars and had been closed to the public for more than a century, had been transformed into a destination of tolerance, peace and happiness. Excerpts:  How significant is this development? We have a great liking for heritage buildings and we gained great experience in restoring Carlton House Terrace, which is our residence now. We have a good team in place under the company Westminster Development Services. This vertical will work on development of heritage properties. My son Sanjay and my daughter-in-law Shalini (wife of Dheeraj Hinduja) have been actively involved in this project. We are already in negotiations with 2-3 more such iconic heritage properties. For the Hinduja family and the Group, this is our largest real estate redevelopment. The Old War Office has seen many wars and bad times; our aim was to transform this into a destination of tolerance, peace and happiness. There is nothing quite like ‘The OWO’ — a building constructed in 1906 for government and war. In the 21st century, it has undergone a transformation on a scale never achieved before, bringing it new life and purpose. We have tried to maintain its originality. We are converting a Grade II listed century-old building into luxury, serviced residences with a five-star hotel. Located on Whitehall, close to 10 Downing Street, St James’s Park, Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster, The OWO is one of London’s most important addresses. Residents, hotel guests and visitors will be a short stroll from Buckingham Palace, The National Gallery, The Tate and The Royal Academy. Our late father always taught us to act local and think global. We have been living here for 40 years and wanted to create a legacy of our contribution to the U.K. The OWO is our commitment to Britain. What has gone into this? It has been a journey of learning and discovery, restoration and conservation, alliances and partnerships, and even the most unexpected — a global pandemic. We have brought in the world’s best architects, engineers, craftsmen and designers to create a location never seen before for homeowners, hotel guests and visitors. Having undergone a monumental and painstaking transformation over the last five years, this landmark is set to complete in 2022 and will also comprise the Capital’s first Raffles Hotel with 125-rooms and suites, a collection of nine restaurants and bars, and an immersive spa. We worked closely with organisations specialising in historic buildings including Historic England and the Prince’s Regeneration Trust. What was the cost of acquisition? How much did you invest in restoration? There is a huge demand for private residences in the pandemic-hit world. We have received a good response. However, we are being very careful; we want to conduct a KYC and background check for every buyer. The total value of the project was £1.2 billion. At the time, the media widely reported the purchase price was £340 million. We had a Switzerland-based company as a partner in this project; however they faced some financial difficulties midway due to the global pandemic following which we bought their shares. This is owned 100% by the Hinduja family. We have spent 5 years on the redevelopment to reach the stage today where we are launching sales of The OWO Residences by Raffles. How challenging has the restoration been? This is a monumental transformation of an enormous building — with over 1,100 offices spread across 2.5 miles of corridors. We have had to ensure the building remained structurally sound while adding over 1,80,000 sq. ft to provide 7,60,000 sq. ft of floor space with new floors to both the existing roof and basement. What is the most expensive property in the complex? The starting price for 2-bedroom residences is £5.8 million. The most expensive will be the larger turret residences (each with a private 3-storey turret) and the two penthouses, each of which are ‘price on application’. There are penthouses which could be around £150 million and four- to five-bedroom residencies would cost in the range of £7,000 to £8,000 per sq. ft. As we have announced the commencement of sales this week, it is too early to share the pricing of these residences. What is the Group’s long-term plan in real estate? For the Hinduja family and Group, this is our largest real estate redevelopment. We remain open to other opportunities to restore and redevelop unique historic ‘trophy’ properties across the U.K. and Europe. Our founder believed land and property increase in value and [he] invested across India. Our real estate company, Hinduja Realty Ventures Ltd. has large land banks across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Mumbai, where plans are in hand for major redevelopments. What is your assessment of the pandemic-hit global and Indian economies? The global economy is resilient and will bounce back — stock prices are high in the U.K., property prices are rising and across many economies, there is some optimism. For India, we have the skill, know-how and expertise to become a top-five global economy — it is a bed of roses, but there are also thorns. The government must make it easier and more attractive for foreign investment. If this is implemented well, India can become the third-largest economy in the next 8-10 years. The unfortunate thing is implementation has a long way to go in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/owo-is-our-largest-redevelopment-it-is-the-groups-commitment-to-britain/article34854550.ece

19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||New-look men’s squad for Tokyo||The 16-member Indian men’s hockey squad for the Tokyo Olympics was announced on Friday with a few surprise inclusions and omissions that reiterate the team management’s preference for youngsters. Only five players from the Rio Olympics have been retained, with P.R. Sreejesh and Manpreet Singh playing their third Olympics. Harmanpreet Singh, Rupinder Pal Singh and Surender Kumar are the other three. Surprise exclusions While Birendra Lakra, who missed Rio due to a knee injury and surgery, returns, the most surprising exclusions are those of the striking trio of S.V. Sunil, Akashdeep Singh and Ramandeep Singh. The three have a collective 600 caps and 200 international goals in major competitions. While Hockey India said the team was “fuelled with a fresh approach-based intense training and preparation” at the ongoing preparatory camp, the absence of seniors, along with Varun Kumar, seems to indicate persistence with the fresh-legs formula in team selection, especially in the attack section. Tough task “It has not been an easy process to make the final selection as there is a lot of quality and ambition in this group of players. The performance levels of all the athletes are at an optimum level and more importantly they work well together,” coach Graham Reid said. Focused on training “We are now focused on training with the same intensity and our goal is to put forward our best performance as a collective unit in Tokyo,” he added. India is grouped in Pool A along with Olympic champion Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and host Japan.  The squad: Goalkeeper: P.R. Sreejesh; Defenders: Harmanpreet Singh, Rupinder Pal Singh, Surender Kumar, Amit Rohidas, Birendra Lakra; Midfielders: Hardik Singh, Manpreet Singh, Vivek Sagar Prasad, Nilakanta Sharma, Sumit; Forwards: Shamsher Singh, Dilpreet Singh, Gurjant Singh, Lalit Upadhyay and Mandeep Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/new-look-mens-squad-for-tokyo/article34854712.ece
19 June 2021||Southampton,||Rain washes out first day||The eagerly-awaited opening day of the World Test Championship final between India and New Zealand was rained out here on Friday, which is set to bring the reserve day into the equation. As per the ICC playing conditions guidelines for the WTC final, if required, the reserve sixth day can now come into effect with six hours of play lost on day one itself.  There was forecast of rain and thunder showers and the heavens opened up last evening with relentless downpour continuing till afternoon. Puddles everywhere With puddles forming throughout the outfield, even the best drainage system couldn’t have possibly forced some action on the opening day. Umpires Michael Gough and Richard Illingworth, after multiple inspections, called off the game at 7.30 p.m. IST (3 p.m. local time). While there has been talk about Southampton being the preferred venue, it has been learnt that the BCCI was taken into confidence by both the ICC and England and Wales Cricket Board before they finalised the venue which also has a five-star facility within the premises, helping create a tight bio-secure bubble. Fickle weather The English weather is known to be fickle and, in any case, there was no guarantee that the match being played at any other venue would have not led to a wash-out on the first day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rain-washes-out-first-day/article34854658.ece
19 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Hockey stalwart Pritam hopes for Govt. support for her academy||In 2002, when the Indian women’s hockey team won the Commonwealth Games gold, Pritam Rani Siwach was one of the pillars of that victory. But the 46-year old is happier and prouder today with three of her trainees making it to the squad for the Tokyo Olympics. The three — Neha Goyal, Nisha Warsi and Sharmila — are products of the academy run by Pritam and her husband Kuldeep in Sonepat since 2004. While Neha has been around for a while, cementing her place in the national side, Sharmila and Nisha are relative newcomers. Proud as a parent “I feel like I am personally going to play in the Olympics, I don’t think I ever felt this proud even as a player. It is like three of my own daughters have achieved something. “Given their background and the absence of support, for them to reach this level and for a small academy like mine to have a role in their development, the feeling cannot be explained,” Pritam told The Hindu . While Neha’s story has been told before — an abusive father, a supportive mother and her determination — Pritam believes Nisha and Sharmila deserve equal appreciation.  “Nisha too has been with me for almost seven to eight years, she came as a fifth-standard student. “Coming from a Muslim family, it was far more difficult for her to pursue sports because of societal pressure. She even quit for a while before I convinced her mother and sister to let her continue,” Pritam said. Sharmila, on the other hand, had other hurdles. Despite a supportive family, Sharmila, who belongs to Kandi village in Hisar had to adjust to living on her own all these years. “Several of my girls stay at the Tika Ram School hostel because we do not have a residential academy or place for them to stay,” Pritam said. Proof of success She insists she isn’t looking for any long-term financial support from the officials. “For girls like them, I hope the government takes note of our efforts and supports us. All we seek is sanctioning an astro-turf field and a residential academy. “The operational part we will manage ourselves. I have applied many times but there has been no response. If they want proof of success, I think these girls have given them that. Hopefully now things will move,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pritam-hopes-for-govt-support-for-academy/article34855123.ece
19 June 2021||KOCHI,||SL not sending sprint relay team for Nationals||Sri Lanka will not be sending its women’s 4x100m relay team for the National inter-State athletics championship, the last qualifier for the Tokyo Olympics, which begins in Patiala on June 25. “The relay team will not be coming. We will be sending a smaller team, five will be coming to India on June 23,” Prema Pinnawela, the general secretary of Sri Lanka Athletics, told The Hindu from Colombo on Friday. Quartermiler Kalinga Kumarage, javelin thrower Sumedha Ranasinghe (both men), 400m runner Nadeesha Ramanayake, two-lapper Nimali Waliwarsha and 3000m steeple chaser Nilani Rathnayake (women) would be coming to India once they get the clearance. India desperately needs international relay teams to compete in the coming Nationals to improve its chances of going to Tokyo. In the 4x400m, the country has a confirmed berth in the mixed event and is in the 15th spot in the men’s and women’s sections in the Road to Tokyo rankings. And in the women’s 4x100m, India is in the 22nd spot. Only 16 teams are allowed in the relays at the Olympics and the qualification doors close on June 29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sl-not-sending-sprint-relay-team-for-nationals/article34854937.ece
19 June 2021||Sao Paulo,||Brazil has it easy against Peru||Brazil changed half of its starting lineup to face Peru on Thursday in its second Copa America match and still cruised to a 4-0 victory. It was the Selecao’s ninth consecutive victory, and another display that suggests the tournament hosts are the favourites to defend their South American title. Defender Alex Sandro, Neymar, midfielder Everton Ribeiro and striker Richarlison scored the goals in Rio de Janeiro. The result puts Brazil atop the Group B standings with six points. Colombia is two points behind after its 0-0 draw with Venezuela. Neymar’s record Neymar’s goal took him past former Brazil striker Ronaldo as the country’s second top goalscorer behind Pele. Neymar reached the mark in 107 games and is now just nine behind Pele, who scored 77 goals in 92 games. “It’s obviously a great honour for me to be part of the Brazil team’s history,” a tearful Neymar said. “To be completely honest, my dream was always to play for Brazil, to wear this shirt. I never imagined I would reach these numbers.” Pele backed Neymar and wrote on Instagram, “Today, he took another step towards my goalscoring record for the (national team). And I’m rooting for him to get there.” An understrength Venezuela managed just one shot at goal for the second game in a row but shut out a superior Colombia. Venezuela mustered just one shot at goal compared to Colombia’s 17, requiring a dazzling performance from its goalkeeper Wuilker Farinez to keep a clean sheet.  The results: Group B: Colombia 0 drew with Venezuela 0; Brazil 4 (Alex Sandro 12, Neymar 68, Everton Ribeiro 89, Richarlison 90+3) bt Peru 0.    By The Numbers   8 - Venezuela goalkeeper Wuilker Farinez’s eight saves against Colombia are the joint-most to keep a clean sheet in the Copa America since 2007, following Paraguay’s Gatito Fernandez in the 0-0 draw against Brazil in 2019  43 - Brazil has never lost in the 43 previous games under Tite in all competitions when it has scored the opener (W38 D5)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/brazil-has-it-easy-against-peru/article34854707.ece
19 June 2021||Chennai,||India has conquered the ‘away’ barrier||Just as the weather gods swung a damp curtain across Southampton’s Ageas Bowl and washed out the WTC final’s opening day, it was also time to acknowledge India’s switch in mindset that helped Virat Kohli’s men travel so far. Back at Centurion, South Africa, 2018, disappointment was writ large on Kohli’s visage. India had lost a Test it should have won and the mood in the press conference room was grim. The skipper breathed fire: “If you want to win away from home, you’ve got to eat, breathe and sleep with it in your mind. You have got to dream about it.” And when India won the next Test — it lost the series 2-1 though — at the Wanderers on a rather vicious pitch, Kohli’s men appeared to have got the message. Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri made a conscious effort not to complain about conditions away from home. As bowling coach B. Arun would say, “We wanted to make the foreign soil our home ground.” Shastri got the side to make this mental switch. Away games were no longer seen as a barrier. And when India stunned Australia 2-1 in the Test series down under in 2018-19, Shastri said, “The lessons we learnt in South Africa enabled us to win here.” The conquering of the ‘away series’ psychological hurdle has been a huge factor in India progressing to the WTC final.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-has-conquered-the-away-barrier/article34854648.ece
19 June 2021||Bristol,||Shafali dazzles with second fifty of the match||India was 83 for one at stumps after being forced to follow-on on the third day of the one-off Test against England here on Friday. Debutant Shafali Verma once again looked in great touch as she remained not out on 55 off 68 deliveries when the day’s play ended after the final session was washed out. The other opener, Smriti Mandhana (8), departed early. Deepti Sharma (18 batting) was the other unbeaten batter. Deficit of 165 Earlier, resuming at 187 for five, India was all out for 231 in its first innings, 165 runs short of England’s 396. Deepti Sharma (29 not out) was the only player to put up a fight even as the others fell cheaply. From 167 for no loss, India lost eight wickets for 30 runs. Left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone finished with four for 88.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shafali-dazzles-with-second-fifty-of-the-match/article34854649.ece
19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Playing XI can be changed as the toss is not yet over, says Sridhar||On a dull day of endless waiting and no cricket action, it is important to stay in good spirits. India fielding coach R. Sridhar was certainly in a cheerful mood, starting the end-of-day media interaction with his own take on the viral Cristiano Ronaldo-Coca Cola incident. “Should I move the Coke bottle before we start? Will the share prices be affected if I do it?” Sridhar joked, before taking questions from the media. Given that the toss has not been conducted yet, and that persistent rain can affect match conditions, the Indian team has the option to make changes to the playing eleven announced earlier. “I think the playing eleven which was announced on Thursday is the eleven which takes the pitch and conditions out of the equation. “It’s the eleven which can play and perform on any given surface, and in any given weather conditions. But having said that, the toss is not yet over. If a decision needs to be taken, it will be taken at the time of the toss,” Sridhar said. The players and staff are closely following the Indian women’s team’s Test match against England, Sridhar said. “We have not missed a beat in the girls’ game, right from day one. It is broadcast live in our team rooms and breakfast area. “Today, when we were waiting for the rain to stop, all of us were sitting together and encouraging our girls… Shafali (Varma) reminds us so much of Viru (Virender Sehwag), with the way she plays and her mindset,” Sridhar said. Wait and see New Zealand vice-captain Tom Latham stated that the playing eleven is yet to be finalised. “We have not confirmed the final eleven. We have to wait and see when we get the chance to look at the wicket,” Latham said.  Should I move the Coke bottle before we start?

19 June 2021||SAN DIEGO,||Oosthuizen and Henley in the van||Louis Oosthuizen completed his first-round play in the U.S. Open with a pair of pars on Friday morning to maintain a share of first place at Torrey Pines. The South African is tied with Russell Henley, who posted a 4-under 67 in the first round on Thursday. Oosthuizen began the U.S. Open with a sub-70 round for the third year in a row. Upon returning to the course on Friday, he had two holes to play to finish his first round. Italy’s Francesco Molinari and Spain’s Rafa Cabrera Bello are one stroke back at 3-under. Big bunch Two-time champion Brooks Koepka, Xander Schauffele, Hayden Buckley, Spain’s Jon Rahm and Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama of Japan were set to begin the second round at 2 under. About three dozen golfers completed first rounds on Friday after play was suspended the previous day because of darkness. Earlier on Thursday, the beginning of the tournament was delayed for about 90 minutes because of fog. A total of 23 golfers ended up under par through the first round.  Leading scores: 67: Russell Henley (USA), Louis Oosthuizen (RSA); 68: Francesco Molinari (Ita), Rafa Cabrera Bello (Esp); 69: Brooks Koepka (USA), Xander Schauffele (USA), Hayden Buckley (USA), Hideki Matsuyama (Jpn), Jon Rahm (Esp), Rikuya Hoshino (Jpn) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/oosthuizen-and-henley-in-the-van/article34854657.ece
19 June 2021||Amsterdam,||The Dutch coast into the pre-quarterfinals||An early Memphis Depay penalty and a Denzel Dumfries goal gave the Netherlands a convincing 2-0 victory over Austria on Thursday and a place in the Euro 2020 last 16 as Group C winner. The Dutch cannot be overtaken at the head of the standings after a second win while Austria’s hopes rest on the result of its last match against Ukraine. The 11th-minute spot-kick provided an early platform for the home side and flying full back Dumfries proved a popular scorer at the Johan Cruyff Arena as he doubled the tally in the 67th minute with his second goal in as many matches. The Dutch were awarded the penalty after Dumfries was caught on the foot by Austrian captain David Alba on the corner of the penalty area. But it was only given after referee Orel Grinfeeld consulted the pitchside VAR monitor, with Depay dispatching spot-kick powerfully underneath the diving Daniel Bachman. The second goal came after Donyell Malen beat the offside trap and unselfishly played in the charging Dumfries, whose finish was enthusiastically celebrated by his team mates and the 16,000-strong crowd. Emil Forsberg’s second-half penalty sealed Sweden a 1-0 win over Slovakia in Saint Petersburg on Friday as the Scandinavians moved top of Group E. A point in its final game against Poland would be enough of a top-two finish for Sweden in the group.  The results: Group C: the Netherlands 2 (Depay 11-pen, Dumfries 67) bt Austria 0.   Group E: Sweden 1 (Forsberg 77-pen) bt Slovakia 0.   Group D: Croatia 1 (Perisic 47) drew with Czech Republic 1 (Schick 37-pen).

19 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Luca SC unveils stadium project||Malappuram-based Luca Soccer Club will soon have its own stadium. The club which figures in the Kerala Premier League (KPL) has unveiled its ambitious project — Luca Soccer Hub — which will come up in Manjeri. The Rs. 15 crore project will come up on 15 acres of land near Eranad with the support of Abreco Group of Companies, which is the club's sponsor. The Luca Soccer Hub will house a 7500-capacity football stadium and a full size synthetic training field.

19 June 2021||Kolkata,||When quarantine did wonders for bonding||The 10-day quarantine period in Paris did wonders for team bonding, feels seasoned Deepika Kumari as Indian women’s archery team gets ready for its final Tokyo Olympic qualifier event on Sunday. The World No. 3 Deepika, who has already qualified in the individual recurve category, has a different challenge this time though. As the senior-most archer, she has to bring out the best from her team, comprising teenager Komalika Bari and the fast-improving Ankita Bhakat — the only change to the team that missed out on the team quota from the World Championships in 2019. “Normally, I stay aloof and take time to gel with the juniors, but during this quarantine in Vichy, we would spend hours together after practice,” said Deepika from Paris. “ Transparency hona chaiye team game mein (transparency is key to team’s success) and I think it is helping us tremendously. I’m happy with the team coordination. We understand each other very well now,” she said. “As a senior-most member of the team, the priority for me is to remain confident all the time so that it rubs off on them. Acha karna hai aur karwana bhi hai (I’ve to do well myself and also help bring out the best from them). It’s my duty,” Deepika said. The women’s team checked in ahead of the men’s and compound teams and entered a bio-secure bubble in Vichy, about 400kms from the venue Stade Charlety in Paris, but it was allowed to practice. “It’s their first time and it’s natural for them to be nervous. I don’t want my team to miss out after one poor round. My role will always be to push them and take them to a zone so that they can give their best for qualification,” Deepika said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/when-quarantine-did-wonders-for-bonding/article34855121.ece

19 June 2021||Kolkata,||Indians need to improve in technical ability: Stimac||The national coach Igor Stimac said there are not enough players with requisite technical ability to make the senior national football team competitive enough. Speaking to the media on Friday, following India’s recently concluded World Cup qualification campaign, Stimac said that the stake-holders of Indian football should look at this fact and devise a system that would help Indian footballers have enough games to grow in terms of technical ability. “To be honest there are not many players with the technical ability. As a national team we suffer all the weaknesses that are apparent in the country’s top league, the ISL. This happens when most of the important positions in the team are occupied by foreign players. This definitely limits the choice when we go to select the Indian players,” Stimac said. India’s World Cup chances were over when it finished third in its group but that result helped it move to the third round of the 2023 Asian Cup qualifiers. Looking at the way forward for the Indian players, Stimac said: “They need to play more than 40 matches a season. It is only then that they can compete against the best in the continent. The clubs need to be playing football for a longer period, otherwise the players will be sitting idle for half of the year,” Stimac said. As regards preparing the team for the Asian Cup qualifiers scheduled in February, Stimac said: “We have to exploit the FIFA calendar and start the camp in August. We would like to play two friendlies in September and if the ISL starts late, we can continue playing friendlies in October and November. Once the ISL starts, the players will be having enough competitive matches before the February qualifiers,” Stimac said. Stimac’s contract with the All India Football Federation expires in September and the former World Cupper from Croatia hoped that the national federation would appreciate the qualitative progress the team has made.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indians-need-to-improve-in-technical-ability-stimac/article34854709.ece

The decision was justified with Shannon Gabriel, who missed the first Test through injury, Jayden Seales and senior seamer Kemar Roach picking up a wicket each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wi-makes-early-inroads/article34854651.ece
19 June 2021||KOLKATA,||Indians look to gain sparring experience||The Tokyo Olympics-bound Indian boxers will look to gain some valuable sparring experience during their final exposure tour to Italy over the next few weeks. Eight of the nine Olympics-qualified boxers — including Amit Panghal (52kg) and Vikas Krishan (69kg) among men and Simranjit Kaur (60kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg) among women — and eight other elite pugilists of the country will be part of the trip to Assisi till July 10. London Olympics bronze medallist M.C. Mary Kom (51kg) has preferred to stay back and train at the Army Sports Institute (ASI), Pune. Significant The camp assumes significance as boxers from at least six other countries, including Italy, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Ecuador and France, are expected to take part. “The idea is to get some good sparring. Facing different national sparring styles and different opponents is important. We get good sparring in India, but the boxers know each other well. It’s not the same when you go out and spar with others from different countries,” high performance director Santiago Nieva told The Hindu on Friday hours before the squad’s departure to Italy. In the run-up to the Olympics, Nieva said, “the focus is on how to be more effective, more aggressive and add more power on the punches”. “Different situations require different solutions and you have to be quick to find out what suits you better. There are different intelligence levels and the best way to explain a point to someone is to show it to him on the video.” Back in training According to Nieva, Manish Kaushik (63kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg) have got back to training after recovering from COVID-19. Nieva expressed satisfaction over the Indian boxers’ exposure tours amid the pandemic. “Compared to other countries and bearing in mind the current situation, we are in a good position,” he said.

Kamsa spared Devaki’s life, but killed every child born to her because of the threat to his life. He killed the first six sons born to her. When Devaki was carrying the seventh child, a miracle happened. Lord Narayana summoned Yogamaya and asked her to transfer Devaki’s four-month-old foetus to the womb of Rohini, another wife of Vasudeva. When this was accomplished, everyone thought that Devaki’s foetus had aborted. Now Kamsa, naturally, was in a state of confusion. The voice warning him had not spoken of such a situation. Should he count the aborted foetus as number seven? Or should he not? Kamsa did not know, and lost his peace of mind because of this. This too was Krishna’s leela. The Lord makes sure that those who detest Him or detest His devotees lose their sleep and happiness, said V.S. Karunakarachariar in a discourse. The foetus transferred to Rohini’s womb was born at the appropriate time and was named Balarama. So the seventh child of Devaki was safe and sound. When Devaki became pregnant for the eighth time, Kamsa wondered if it would not be wise to kill her and be rid of the threat to his life once and for all. But he did not. Kamsa deciding to spare Devaki’s life was the Lord’s doing and was one of Krishna’s leelas. Devaki carried the eighth child full term and Krishna was born. Vedanta Desika says that He was born in rishaba lagna, when five planets were in the most auspicious position. Appayya Dikshitar in his commentary on Vedanta Desika’s Yadavabhyudaya gives the astrological details. When Krishna was born, Chandra was in rishaba lagna, Mars was in Makara rasi, Mercury was in Kanya rasi, Jupiter was in Karkataka rasi and Saturn was in Tula rasi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/kamsas-confusion/article34854615.ece

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Warm hugs miles away||Even as COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc, artists are finding creative ways to express the myriad moods associated with the pandemic and lockdowns. The Covid Art Museum (CAM), perhaps the first of its kind in the world, features art conveying hope, anxiety, courage, fear, boredom, struggle, solidarity, loneliness, and, even the feeling of ‘languishing.’ Created by Emma Calvo, José Guerrero and Irene Llorca, three friends, advertising executives and art enthusiasts in Barcelona, Spain, the digital museum, launched on March 19, 2020 features art from all over the world. Centred on the pandemic, it includes photographs, animation, installations, illustrations, graphic art and cartoons. Common elements such as masks, sanitisers, gloves, methods of social distancing and, of course, the Coronavirus itself, can be found in many of the pieces. Edited excerpts from an e-mail interview with José Guerrero: Why did you create this digital museum? We created the museum because we were locked up at home like everyone else, in Spain. It was a strange and worrying situation, but people were doing amazing things such as concerts on balconies, yoga classes on rooftops and streaming choreographies. One of these activities was also art that talked about the pandemic. We thought it would be a good idea to bring all these works together in one museum so they wouldn’t fall into oblivion. That’s how we created The CAM on Instagram from the sofa of our homes. How many works are there now?  There are more than 840 publications at the time of this interview. Every day we upload new works.They come from all over the world — from Brazil, USA and Spain to India, Indonesia and Russia. How are the artworks selected?  The main criteria is that they should be related to the current moment: the crisis of COVID-19. That’s why we don’t close ourselves to any technique. We collect all kinds of art whether they are illustrations, photographs, paintings, poems, drawings, animations, videos.... From all the works received or found, a selection of those that best reflect the situation, is published. Quality and originality are also important to us. Even if it is digital right now, we are still a museum. We want to keep the standards of a museum you would physically visit. Has anyone from India been featured?  There are several published works that have come from India and they are very interesting projects. They bring their particular vision of the situation, because despite the similarities, each part of the world has experienced the pandemic in a different way. How do you think art has helped people cope with social isolation?  The Internet connects people from all over the world regardless of distance, and that is very useful in the context of crisis, pandemic and quarantine. Being stuck at home, under such circumstances, one can feel depressed, worried and very lonely. That’s why we thought it was a good idea to create a museum that would show what was happening at the time. Then, the public would see that millions of people were living and feeling the same thing. In times of crisis, it is essential to feel accompanied.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/warm-hugs-miles-away/article34854862.ece
19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The red-nosed superhero||Spiderman is often at Dharavi. Santa Claus, too, is a frequent visitor. Only, last Christmas he doled out masks instead of candy. All thanks to 37-year-old Ashok Kurmi, a benevolent shape shifter who changes his getup at the behest of children living in the Mumbai slums. An employee with a pharmaceutical company, Ashok took it upon himself to spread not only joy, but also the message of hygiene, social distancing and the importance of masks, when the pandemic took the country in its grip last March. “I was working from home. At about 11.30 am I would set out to various parts of Mumbai, sanitising localities and spreading awareness on COVID-19. I want to help people living in the slums, and the homeless who live under flyovers,” he says. Initially, Ashok wore a PPE kit but that made people, especially kids, nervous. They assumed that he was in their neighbourhood to take away a COVID patient. “I realised that if I wanted to communicate with kids, I should dress in a way that connects with them. So, I started visiting in a Mickey Mouse costume. I got a good response and could teach them about the virus and how to stay safe,” he says. Eventually, the children started suggesting different characters for Ashok to dress up as. Doraemon, Santa and Spiderman followed in quick succession. He changes his look every 25 days. Now, if you spot a clown armed with a sanitisation device on the streets of Mumbai, be sure to give him a pat on the back. “That is my current avatar,” Ashok says over a call from Mumbai. Being a clown does not come cheap. He bought a sanitisation machine for Rs. 9,000 with his own savings. “The sodium hypochlorite solution that I use, costs around Rs. 1,300 for five litres. That quantity is easily used up in one area,” he says. So far, Ashok says he has sanitised around two lakh houses in the city. Right from conveyance and the masks he distributes to his costume and the charts he makes for the kids, all expenses are borne by him. It amounts to roughly Rs. 15,000 a month. Ashok revisits every locality after two weeks. He first sanitises the streets, the houses, doors and windows and then calls out to the kids, asking them to wear their masks before making an appearance. “Now they eagerly wait for me to visit them,” says Ashok, adding that he is pleased to see them following his advice. It takes him around six hours to complete his work in a locality. Sometimes, language can be a barrier, he says: “In some areas the kids understand Hindi or Marathi and in some places they understand Tamil. I plan ahead and make charts in those languages, with a little help from the Internet.” Ashok also takes the time to draw boxes at bus stands and taxi stands so people can maintain social distancing. He says the police are happy with his work, and even suggest which area to head to next. Old habits “Getting dressed up as a character is not new to me,” says Ashok, “Every December, I used to distribute gifts to children in the waiting area of Sion hospital and Tata Memorial Hospital as Santa Claus,” he says. This new role is an offshoot of that. His family comprising his parents, wife and two-and-a-half year old daughter were reluctant to let him out initially. “But I explained to them that this needs to be done. People on the streets don’t really have an idea of the risks and how to stay safe, and need help. Now, my family is supportive,” he says, adding that they help him with his one hour make-up routine, as he starts getting into the character of a clown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-red-nosed-superhero/article34854864.ece
19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Portrait of an artist in quarantine||When Bala Govind Kumar tested positive for COVID-19 on April 26 in Chennai, he spent 14 days in isolation at his rented apartment in Kilpauk, feeling lonely and listless. Through these days, he used his iPad to create a visual diary of his emotions through art. The series of six paintings, Quarantine Days, is an exploration of the concept of self. “All I could see was myself. Why not create self-portraits, I thought,” says Bala, whose style is greatly inspired by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. He recorded a video of himself engaged in various daily chores and made a montage of the stills for his first work titled Rooted. It shows versions of himself staring out the window and at the ceiling, eating, and looking at his phone. For the 25-year-old self-taught artist and architect hailing from Tirunelveli and working as an art director in Chennai, this was a healing process. “Art is my natural way of self-expression. And it made my days of isolation easier to bear.” Bala chose to work digitally as it did not require him to go out to procure art supplies. “In another time, I would have preferred acrylic or oil paint. But now I realise digital art gives you a lot of artistic freedom; it is easy to pursue even in extraordinary circumstances such as this.” The works are a meeting place of Bala’s emotions and his physical reality. He describes each stage of the disease and his mental state — breathing difficulty, loss of taste and smell and fatigue. “I could not work every day. On the days I felt better, I would create two works,” he says. After six days indoors, he went up to the terrace, spending time with plants which rejuvenated his mind and he captured that, in one of the works. Bala explains how art was not just restorative but also gave him a glimpse into the philosophical. “We are bound by time. Whatever we may think we are, we cannot run from this.” Bala plans to exhibit his works when the COVID-19 situation improves. Currently in Tirunelveli, he is working on a series, Misplaced Goat, which is a quest to rediscover his hometown through its rich tradition of folk art.  Bala Govind’s works are for sale @kalaa_shala on Instagram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/portrait-of-an-artist-in-quarantine/article34854865.ece
19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Sushi for a reason||It was a coincidence, but quite a happy one. I had some delicious sushi rolls earlier this week, and then heard, a few days later, that June 18 was International Sushi Day. I was glad to know that I had done my bit to mark the occasion. The sushi came from #UnboxDeliciousness, the home delivery and takeaway offering from Pullman & Novotel New Delhi. The hotel in Aerocity offers Indian street food from its Café Pluck, regional Indian cuisine from Food Exchange, and Mediterranean cuisine from a section called Farmers’ Basket at Pluck. The pan Asian cuisine is from its restaurant Honk. I’d had a meal at Honk many years ago, and remember in particular the Asian greens and avocado-duck-cherry dumplings. This time, my meal consisted of two kinds of sushi rolls, prawns in chilli XO sauce, twice cooked Belgian pork with greens, and massaman lamb curry with jasmine rice and noodles. I started with the rolls — classic California rolls (Rs. 1,050) and salmon and cucumber rolls (Rs. 1,195). One bite of the salmon roll, and I realised why sushi is considered the king of all food. A well-prepared roll is indeed an epicurean’s delight. Sushi keeps the essence of the main ingredient — salmon, tuna, or even cucumber — while enhancing the taste with nori or a rice coating, and some sauces. Both the California roll, with crab, avocado, and sesame seeds, and the salmon, avocado, and cucumber sushi were superb. I had the salmon roll with a little bit of wasabi, and the sudden shock of its pungent taste along with the effect of roe bursting in my mouth was electrifying. I went on to the jasmine rice and pork. The pork was, however, a bit chewy, and tasted a lot better the next day, when it had been heated up, and had become softer. The sticky jasmine rice — with its light fragrance — complemented the hot prawns (Rs. 1,450). The prawns were juicy and tender, and the sauce was good enough to clear up my sinuses. I enjoyed the dish thoroughly. The massaman lamb curry (Rs. 1,200) had been cooked with potatoes and onion, tempered with tamarind, and flavoured with galangal, chillies and lemon grass. Mildly sweet, and mildly tart, it reminded me a bit of the Sunday mutton curry that we have: that too celebrates the potato, and is cooked with a pinch of sugar. I am told the delivery service is taking off. The food is packed well, and hygiene standards are strictly maintained. The hotel follows a contactless delivery and payment system. Food is delivered up to a radius of 40km from the hotel, in Delhi and Gurugram. The service offers a Honk dimsum lunch and the chef’s recommendations include fish and chips, free range chicken burger and an ‘Immune booster’ salad. The murgh dum biryani is a hot favourite (Rs. 1,145), too. I was content with my sushi-led pan-Asian meal. Happy belated sushi day, Readers.

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||A hundred ways to say thank you||“It’s one thing to be grateful, it’s another to express it in ways that are deeper than just the words ‘thank you’,” says Maya Patel, one of the founders of Mumbai-based Gratitude Project (GP) that was started in the last week of May. “We wanted the wall to be a space of that expression of how people’s lives have been touched in positive ways.” Over the last year, there have been many projects offering thanks to frontline workers in healthcare, agrarian community, last mile delivery, law enforcement, sanitation, security, and media. Some of them write letters, some raise funds and others pitch in to buy them essentials. Maya is also glad the project comes at a time when many people feel demoralised by the state of the nation while the rest of the world gets back to normal. While social media has certainly become a black hole of rants, they wanted GP to be a ray of light amid the noise. Those working on the project are Maansi Vohra, Hriyanka Shah, Mili Sanwalka, Shivika Poonglia, Latisha Shah, Alekha Advani and Maya, all of whom worked with the YouthFeed India campaign over the pandemic. Through their work, the girls were able to see which communities were not given as much thanks as they deserved, and they conceptualised a gratitude hub. The website, designed by SH-One with graphics by Ravina Puri, is minimalist so posts have more impact. Maya adds that the team wanted people to be creative and explore beyond a ‘normal thank you’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-hundred-ways-to-say-thank-you/article34854863.ece
19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The remote food photographer||In April 2020, wellness consultant Ishani Vellodi Reddy, one of photographer Sumanth Kumar’s long-time clients, approached him with a unique assignment. “She wanted me to photograph a few dishes for her website and social media,” he says. While this might sound like any other photoshoot, what set it apart was the fact that Vellodi is now based in the UK and Kumar in Chennai. “She sent me reference images of her dishes, such as the five-ingredient tomato feta sauce, vegan chocolate truffles, and tahini maple overnight oats,” says Kumar, who could only source the bare minimum cutlery during lockdown and relied on YouTube videos to make the dishes himself. “I failed miserably,” he admits. “Only my recreation of the sauce was approved, and Ishani almost dropped me from the project.” So, Kumar — who quit a career as a news photographer in 2012 to take up freelance photography — went all out with the props and even got a chef to pitch in. “I bought all the cutlery and crockery I could lay my hands on at IKEA. My friend, Indrani Singh in Puducherry, dabbles in pottery and as she wasn’t getting a lot of work during the pandemic, I asked her to make stoneware plates, bowls and cups.” With experts on board, he gave the shoot a second chance — and it worked. Vellodi’s project was one of the first at his remote photography studio, Picture Palate. The lockdown initiative set up last year was an addition to his existing kitty of freelance projects with ITC Hotels, Hyatt Hotels, and the like. In May 2020, he landed his second assignment, for advertising firm 78 Design. “I shot their entire project on food ingredients over Zoom with art director Namashvi Desai,” he says. The idea of a remote studio is “to be able to order pictures of food online, like you’d order food on a delivery app”. The only requirement from potential clients is reference pictures. And specific props, if any. While restaurants send images of dishes prepared during R&D, bloggers often send reference shots off the Internet. In the last year, he has shot images remotely for Vellodi; Dindigul Thalappakatti Restaurant; DANK, a restobar in Chennai; KSM Ashwagandha, and is in talks with an author in Pune for her new cookbook. From cocktails and shawarma platters to delicate desserts and even raw food shots, Kumar, 38, has done it all. While images shot for restaurants always use fresh ingredients (as digital menus can easily reveal detailing, that is, mock food), he says artificial products go into banners and book covers. “We use engine oil, shoe polish for glazing, half-cooked ingredients, silicone ice cream, acrylic ice cubes, and the like [to make the food pop],” says the artist. Lessons from the past While setting up a business during a pandemic can be risky, Kumar says it wasn’t as difficult for him — he’d had his first brush with remote photography five years ago with a cocktail book project (Westland) for Tulleeho Wine and Spirits Academy in New Delhi. “With the art director in Delhi, and a low budget, we decided to work remotely,” says Kumar, who hired a bartender, and sourced barware for it. “We created a WhatsApp group with the art directors, who’d improvise on my shots. We were done in 10 days,” he says. While Kumar was certain back then that this could be a possible career path, he had a tough time breaking into the market. “I wasn’t taken seriously, and people wouldn’t trust their projects with remote photography. So, in a way, the pandemic helped as it forced people to think from a remote state-of-mind.” Kumar’s studio, which he set up in three months in an independent house in Valasaravakkam, where he stays with his cat, is where the magic happens. The food is cooked by a team of chefs, home cooks, bakers, and food stylists, and then shot aesthetically. “I decided to use all the props from earlier shoots that I had tucked away. In the last year, I’ve spent almost Rs. 1 lakh to add planters, glassware, and artificial flowers to the inventory.” A majority of the garnishes come from the garden to ensure “the frame is fresh”. “I grow basil, rosemary, coriander, lemon, curry leaves, tomatoes and chillies, and will soon plant vegetables like radish and baby carrots,” says Kumar, who has brushed up his cooking skills over the last year too. “I make a great raw mango pickle now!” he says. A market abroad He admits that there are times when working ‘in-person’ seems simpler. “It’s easier with an art director or client in your studio telling you to move the spoon by an inch to the right, or tuck the napkin more neatly under the plate,” says Kumar, who is also working on a recipe channel for his YouTube page, a cross-exchange of sorts. “Home bakers who don’t have a professional set-up can avail my services and, in turn, I will showcase their recipes on my feed.” Since most hotels have in-house photographers, and food bloggers double up as photographers, I ask him where he sees his business heading. “I’m aiming for Indian restaurants across the globe. Not well-established ones, but hotels and cafes that can’t afford professional photographers,” he says. Now in talks with an international Andhra restaurant chain, a Sri Lankan restaurant in Australia, and a home baker in Dubai, he adds, “At the end of the day, food bloggers aren’t food photographers. We bring an elevated sense of quality, professionalism, and appeal. It’s almost like asking you to allow us to become a salesman for your restaurant!” Rs. 35,000 per day, for eight shots.

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Bamboo toilet in Somerset House||The India Pavilion at the ongoing London Design Biennale 2021 (LDB) is mapping ‘hero stories’ — from innovator-engineer Sonam Wangchuk’s ice stupas (which melt in summer to generate water) to smokeless chulahs . All inventive, indigenous, and sustainable ideas developed in various parts of the country in the last few years. “It is quite an ‘aha’ moment to see what India looks like through the lens of its people and their efforts to make a sustainable world,” says architect Nisha Mathew Ghosh, 52, who has curated the pavilion. “It is exciting to imagine a future of collaborations to build this world of better ecological stewardship together.” The pavilion at Somerset House, titled ‘Small Is Beautiful: A Billion Stories’, comprises 150 entries segregated into five categories: Clean Air, Clean Water, Clean Earth, Clean Energy, and Forest. Ranging from product inventions to material explorations, each responds to the overarching theme of ‘Resonances’, as chosen by LDB’s artistic director, Es Devlin.  Back to nature  The India Pavilion engages with the ideas of sustainability through effective design. “All these projects are reactions to situations and contexts. For example, the Story of Fish [by landscape architect Prachi Chopade Wakaley] uses art as strategy — making a fish from waste glass bottles to remind people to keep their water sources clean; Pollinator People [by landscape architect Vidisha Barwal] uses the logic and process of pollination to offer a design for the recovery of ecosystems; and Forest Cabin [by Architecture Brio], shows you how to build lightly in a forest setting with least impact,” says Nisha. Among the plethora of intriguing projects, Bamboo Toilet — an initiative by Tata Trust, and designed by Delhi-based Shift Studio — has piqued interest. The brief was to build a toilet that would meet the needs of rural India, and Mayank Mishra of Shift Studio says they came up with a design that used bamboo and EcoSan technology (dry toilets that do not use water). Ideal for places that have scarcity of water, it converts human excreta into compost and fertiliser. “An individual unit will cost anywhere between Rs. 12,000 and Rs. 24,000, which can come down when built and managed by the community,”explains Mishra. “It was challenging to evolve processes to elevate bamboo from a craft material to an engineering level [meeting the needs for structural constructions].”  Travelling stories  Speaking of the showcase’s engagement with viewers at Somerset House, where the various projects are being screened on a large projection, Nisha explains, “It’s a showcase that is packed with ideas and needs a couple of hours to fully watch and observe.” Beyond the Biennale, she feels that the ideas, which have emerged from traditional wisdom, scientific temper, and the communities’ needs, must be shared with the entire country. “We could do a travelling exhibition,” she says. “These stories can be vital to bring about a change. People must know what’s happening in various parts of India.” Moreover, she believes the current situation underlines the need for solutions that are local and interconnected, while still recognising the value of the large scale. “The two need to work together for the preservation of our resources. If an earlier Indian austerity could be referred to, it was doing the most with the least, and I believe design will respond in this manner given the conditions around us. We don’t have a choice but to re-look at maximising the potential of our natural resources for the benefit of communities post pandemic, and this has to begin with great ideas.”  London Design Biennale is on at Somerset House till June 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/bamboo-toilet-in-somerset-house/article34854499.ece
19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Betting on Father’s Hour||I’m a great dad, don’t get me wrong, but Father’s Day terrifies me. It’s another date I’m reminded that I forgot. If you really want a Dad’s Day, it should be up to us dads to pick any one. Like casual leave. I’ll take it whenever I want to. Huge extended family function? Sorry, I can’t make it – I’m having a Father’s Day. Else, allow us a Father’s Hour — 24 of them to permutate. There’s the match and I’m claiming my Father’s Hour. With about 5000 calories in deep-fried snacks and a remote control within arm’s reach. And of legitimately being emotionally unavailable (which is non-bailable jailable in the wife’s eyes). It’s not true that I never listen. I devoutly listen to the chaps in the commentary box who are kindly celebrating Father’s Hour with me, whether they’re fathers or not. What makes Father’s Day even more alarming is being asked what I want to do. The para above, obviously. But this ‘What I want to do’ is intricately linked to ‘What we want to do’ as a family. It’s a devious trap. The last time we did this family time, it clashed with the Roland Garros finals. So we sat through a family movie, with puppies and babies, which got my wife weeping. I was weeping too. Real tears. Because my friend kept pinging me about the nail-biting first set. I was so emotionally available, emotionally overwrought even - that I had to rush to the loo, to get him to aim his video at his TV. I returned to find that the puppy was still lost, or was it the grandpa? And they unfairly stayed lost through the second set as well. What I’d like on Father’s Day is not to be asked trick questions. And really, they’re all trick questions. Which section is the kid in? What is the history teacher’s surname? Did you remember to buy fabric softener — I said so thrice? Do I look fatter in this or this? Do you remember what we said 11 years, 3 months and 15 days ago in the veranda at Isha’s baby shower? I remember neither the baby nor its shower and only remember Isha for reasons you won’t want to know. For Father’s Day, listen to my answers, though. Permanent answers which never change. To kid #1, you’re too young for a boyfriend, and you always will be. To kid #2, no, your haircut doesn’t suit you, and what it costs doesn’t suit me. To both: I’m not paying your criminally-high fees for your vocabulary to comprise single alphabets like k, or c u. Actually, Father’s Day isn’t so bad. Those kind chaps have planned the Euro Cup fixtures around it. Let’s celebrate it with some family time and weep together — at the sheer beauty of this pass or that impossible save — and re-watch old matches for the 19th time.

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Grappling with grief||I used to be a huge cynic of any day earmarked for a particular topic with a well-practiced line — why do you need a day to celebrate women when they should be celebrated every single day, for example. But, having lost my father recently, June 20, Father’s Day, is suddenly full of meaning for me. Many movies are rooted in reality and for those who have opted for a career surrounded by cinema, one finds parallels between reel and real life. A few years ago, I began watching Michael Haneke’s extremely moving portrayal of old age, the Cannes, BAFTA and Oscar winning Amour (2012). My own parents were at that time relatively spry, recovering from a quadruple bypass and a double knee-surgery respectively. Even so, I found it quite difficult to watch and couldn’t help thinking about them. More recently, when I watched Anthony Hopkins’ magisterial and heart-rending performance in The Father , which deservedly won him the best actor BAFTA and Oscar amongst numerous other accolades, my thoughts immediately turned to my then increasingly frail father. I remember speaking to my friends who have elderly parents and cautioning them about the extreme emotional response the film would provoke in them. Different people have different ways of dealing with grief, but the truth is, there is no way at all to deal with it. The loss hits you like a sledgehammer and you can only hope that the wound becomes numb over time. As a perverse exercise in coping, I cast my mind over films that deal with grief and was surprised at the sheer number of them. Many of them are maudlin and saccharin, but several are celebratory. Top of mind was Kurosawa’s Ikiru (1952) where a bureaucrat, after a lifetime of pushing papers, decides to make a difference when he finds out he has terminal cancer. In Chris Kelly’s Other People (2016), a writer returns home to care for his dying mother, while in Roger Michell’s Blackbird (2019), a remake of the Danish film Silent Heart (2014), Susan Sarandon, a terminally ill mother, brings together her entire family one last time. A film dealing more directly with bereavement is Kieslowski’s Three Colors: Blue (1993) where Juliette Binoche’s character must cope with the deaths of her husband and child. Specifically on fathers, in Tim Burton’s Big Fish (2003), Albert Finney is on his deathbed and his son Ewan McGregor must decipher if the tall tales his father used to spin are true or not. For the young or the young at heart, the ultimate pieces of work about the passing of a parent are perhaps The Lion King musical and films. And in Stephen Daldry’s Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011) a son searches for clues about his father, who passed during the 9/11 attacks. Beginning with the death of Irrfan Khan in 2020, the last year or so has forced me to write many obituaries, but nothing shattered me more than placing my father’s obituary (written by my sister) in The Hindu . May he rest in peace.

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||What he gave me||There was nothing extraordinary about the day my father died. I recall coming home from college, and finding an empty house; my friend pulling up in an auto-rickshaw, saying “Hurry up, your dad’s in hospital”. In the days before mobile phones there was no other way to get the news to me. I was 18 that year, the oldest of three siblings. As a self-obsessed teen, I don’t remember having long conversations with him. My mother was a more present, constant figure while daddy was the fun guy, easygoing and laid-back. Food was an integral part of his happiness. After Sunday mass, we’d pile into our white Ambassador and drive to a nearby Sindhi restaurant. There, we’d order dal pakwan , chole with greasy bhature or piping hot ragda pattice and bring them home for brunch. After my dad died, did we continue the Sunday brunch tradition? I can’t recollect. My grief in those early years was all-encompassing. I remember running to the window when we heard a jeep rumble outside, the words “Daddy’s home!” almost tumbling out of my mouth before reality slammed in. With time, though, the pain eases and the good memories return. And on trips to see my family in Mumbai, my brother and I make road-trips at dawn to the Sindhi restaurant, now all spiffy, where we order breakfast and raise a glass of lassi to the man who taught us how to live large.

However, for us to sustain the skill and artisans associated with it, we need to make it more mainstream and link it to fashion,” believes designer Anavila Misra. Most recently, Kolkata-based designer Kavya Singh Kundu used deadstock (saris, stoles and scarves) from weavers in Phulia, West Bengal, to create an upcycled collection. In ‘Tale as Old as Time’, she has experimented with cuts, switching up the traditional aesthetic to create versatile pieces such as one-shoulder dresses. “Going forward, we need to simplify the weave and work on more youthful and detailed silhouettes to make it more relevant,” she says, pointing to how a section of younger weavers are creating fresh, contemporary motifs, which are almost like abstract works of art. “These appeal to a younger demographic as well as to an international clientele, and will ensure that jamdani continues to have a future,” adds Kundu.

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The ‘Dodge’y lifestyle||A gun-toting priest stopping you outside a church can be daunting. But for Smriti Bhadauria and Kartik Vasan, ambassadors of Indian van life, it’s just one of the many memorable experiences they’ve been making since they sold their condo in downtown Toronto last year and hit the road in a vintage, brown campervan, their dog Everest in tow. “When we entered the US, in the state of Oregon, in January, we were trying to take a picture of Mt Hood while driving through Portland,” recalls Kartik. “As we pulled into the parking lot of a church, a man waved us down. He seemed friendly, but when he got closer we realised he was holding a big gun in his hand. We remained calm and soon found out that he was the pastor of the church and was only cleaning his gun,” he laughs.  Breaking brown  The couple, in their early 30s, met in Toronto in 2014. A year earlier, Smriti had read about an old couple travelling from Patagonia (South America) to Alaska and the idea of caravanning had appealed to her. So, when she met Kartik, she shared it with him. “Smriti’s love for the outdoors and adventure completely changed my outlook towards life,” he says. But you could say that the travelling bug had bitten Smriti and Kartik well before that. “I’ve seen 100 cities in India, as my father had a touring job [as a power grid safety head],” says Smriti. Kartik’s father was a diplomat, because of which he grew up in seven countries. So, when they got the van in 2018 (a spur of the moment decision while on a camping trip), they started thinking about quitting their jobs and travelling with just their savings. However, it was not easy convincing their parents of their plan to live a nomadic life — working remotely, exploring nature and living in a 77 Dodge B200. Van life was a foreign idea. As Kartik recently told Condé Nast Traveller , “Our brown upbringing has conditioned us to live a certain way. My parents often call us and tell us, ‘Your friends just bought a home.’ But these are fleeting feelings. When you park in a beautiful spot, the moment just passes by.” The youngsters received the green signal once they tied the knot last year in February. Today, the two call their parents regularly and “show them beautiful sunrises and sunsets. This gives them peace of mind knowing that we are safe, working and still able to see new places”. Their Instagram, @thebrownvanlife, has over 8,000 followers too. Kartik and Smriti travel slowly — usually driving between three to five hours daily, and never at night — so they get to stay in a place for a few days. “We don’t burn too much fuel because it impacts the environment. All our electricals are solar powered, so we are eco-friendly and self-sustaining,” adds Kartik. The van is outfitted with a queen-size bed, a kitchen with a fridge, and a 20-gallon water tank.  Finding their balance  In January this year, the couple drove across several states in the US. “We were in a grocery store in Utah when they announced they had extra vaccine slots. So we walked in for yoghurt and came out vaccinated! Which was such a stress relief for our parents and for us,” says Smriti. After exploring the US for four months, they entered Mexico. “We are currently in Baja and ready for the ferry to Mainland Mexico,” she says. Detailed paperwork is a critical part of the venture. “We have Canadian permanent residency, but hold Indian passports. Our biggest advantage is our 10-year US visa that allows us to travel to all of North and Central American countries with a visa on arrival. People often feel we come from rich backgrounds or that we have a lot of savings, but the truth is we have worked really hard to obtain this lifestyle. The idea of letting everything go does not sit well with our Indian upbringing, so we decided to keep our jobs while living and travelling in different places,” says Smriti, who is in digital marketing. In fact, the duo had started planning their remote jobs early on, so they could support their caravanning lifestyle. “We work from 6.30 am to 1.30 pm, and then take the rest of the day to explore or cover distance. We have not monetised our trip yet; we fund it with our jobs,” says Kartik, an IT consultant.  Map to everywhere  The two have also tried to be distinct from their western counterparts. “Since we are possibly the only Indians pursuing this life full time, we did not have a reference point. We also realised that whatever we do might become a reference point for others. So it was important for us to bring representation into the dialogue. We discuss all the social and cultural issues Indian kids and adults might face starting a life like this,” explains Smriti. The duration of their journey is still unknown (though visiting 10 countries is one of their goals). “In terms of itinerary, our immediate goal is to get to Patagonia while exploring different countries in Central and South America, and experience all the cultures. We will go to Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and by next year enter Columbia to start the South American leg of the journey.” And Everest will play the role of a security guard everywhere. “Our photo model, best hiking partner, and optimism booster,” Smriti signs off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-dodgey-lifestyle/article34854510.ece

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The office lease market||Industry data and Anarock Research reveals that over 7,400 leases spanning approximately 90 million sq. ft. area will come up for renewal in 2021 across the top six commercial real estate hubs — Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Gurugram, and Noida. Data further reveals that 2021 has the highest lease expiry pipeline when compared to the next two years of 2022 and 2023. Year 2022 will see nearly 7,000 leases for approximately 78 million sq. ft. come up for renewal, and approximately 4,200 leases for over 55 million sq. ft. in 2023. Of the approximately 7,400 leases expiring in 2021, Mumbai has the highest share at about 44%, followed by Pune with a 17% share. These two cities have been among the worst-affected by the second wave. The impact on leasing activity there over the year bears watching. Key pointers The total number of leases coming up for renewal in 2021 account for 90 million sq. ft. area.  Interestingly, in terms of area, Bengaluru has the largest share at about 37%, with Mumbai coming in a distant second with a share of about 19%.  Of the total number of leases coming up for renewal in 2021, Chennai comprises a 5% share — in terms of overall area, it has a 12% share.  Gurugram has a 15% share each in terms of number of leases due for renewal and total area.  Noida has the least number of leases due for renewal, comprising a mere 3% share of both total lease numbers and the overall area. Prashant Thakur, Director & Head — Research, Anarock Property Consultants says, “The office market has been under strain since the pandemic hit. However, the IT/ITeS sectors have been on a hiring spree in 2020 and 2021 due to massive business accruals. To accommodate these employees in a future when we see a gradual return of employees and adoption of hybrid workplace practices by Infotech giants, office space demand will grow.” Office demand also is expected to gather momentum from 2022 onwards in the wake of robust hiring by large corporates. These big corporates will definitely renew their leases, though some of the smaller companies may consider rationalising space. “The leases coming up for renewal in 2021 were entered into at much lower rentals — at rates that prevailed 3 to 5 years ago — since office leases are usually signed for the long-term. There is some room for rental escalation in many of these leases,” he adds. Trends in the second wave The second wave in India is far more excruciating than the first, and some companies are once again in wait-and-watch mode with their real estate decisions. Leasing activity has begun to tame down. This is also validated by the fact that average vacancy levels in Grade A office space across the top 7 cities is up again, breaching the 15% mark. Rising Covid-19 cases in cities like MMR and Bengaluru — the markets with highest commercial demand — and stringent curfew restrictions are cause for concern. However, Mumbai and Pune are already beginning to see a decline in daily cases. Meanwhile, major IT/ITeS companies are hiring in bulk to fulfil the surge in work orders and have a healthy pipeline for the current year as well. Recent Anarock Research revealed that the top four Indian IT/ITeS firms — TCS, Infosys, HCL and Wipro — alone hired approximately 42,000 employees in the first nine months of FY 2021. Also, multinational majors Cognizant and Capgemini hired nearly 39,500 employees in CY 2020, with bulk hiring plans for CY 2021. They plan to hire ~23,000 and ~30,000 employees respectively in the CY 2021. Many other IT firms are on a hiring spree amid acceleration in their overall business post the pandemic. This eventually bodes well for overall office space demand in 2022 and 2023, when we may see gradual return of normalcy coupled with the newly added workforce. The IT/ITeS sectors are among the prime drivers of overall leasing activity in the top cities. Bulk hiring by these firms will influence demand for large quality office spaces.

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Betting on Father’s Hour||I’m a great dad, don’t get me wrong, but Father’s Day terrifies me. It’s another date I’m reminded that I forgot. If you really want a Dad’s Day, it should be up to us dads to pick any one. Like casual leave. I’ll take it whenever I want to. Huge extended family function? Sorry, I can’t make it – I’m having a Father’s Day. Else, allow us a Father’s Hour — 24 of them to permutate. There’s the match and I’m claiming my Father’s Hour. With about 5000 calories in deep-fried snacks and a remote control within arm’s reach. And of legitimately being emotionally unavailable (which is non-bailable jailable in the wife’s eyes). It’s not true that I never listen. I devoutly listen to the chaps in the commentary box who are kindly celebrating Father’s Hour with me, whether they’re fathers or not. What makes Father’s Day even more alarming is being asked what I want to do. The para above, obviously. But this ‘What I want to do’ is intricately linked to ‘What we want to do’ as a family. It’s a devious trap. The last time we did this family time, it clashed with the Roland Garros finals. So we sat through a family movie, with puppies and babies, which got my wife weeping. I was weeping too. Real tears. Because my friend kept pinging me about the nail-biting first set. I was so emotionally available, emotionally overwrought even - that I had to rush to the loo, to get him to aim his video at his TV. I returned to find that the puppy was still lost, or was it the grandpa? And they unfairly stayed lost through the second set as well. What I’d like on Father’s Day is not to be asked trick questions. And really, they’re all trick questions. Which section is the kid in? What is the history teacher’s surname? Did you remember to buy fabric softener — I said so thrice? Do I look fatter in this or this? Do you remember what we said 11 years, 3 months and 15 days ago in the veranda at Isha’s baby shower? I remember neither the baby nor its shower and only remember Isha for reasons you won’t want to know. For Father’s Day, listen to my answers, though. Permanent answers which never change. To kid #1, you’re too young for a boyfriend, and you always will be. To kid #2, no, your haircut doesn’t suit you, and what it costs doesn’t suit me. To both: I’m not paying your criminally-high fees for your vocabulary to comprise single alphabets like k, or c u. Actually, Father’s Day isn’t so bad. Those kind chaps have planned the Euro Cup fixtures around it. Let’s celebrate it with some family time and weep together — at the sheer beauty of this pass or that impossible save — and re-watch old matches for the 19th time. We’ll have such a great Father’s Day, you may just forget to remind me about it from the next year on.

19 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||NGOs slam jab clause in market reopening order in Meghalaya||Iewduh, Meghalaya’s largest traditional market in State capital Shillong, reopened partially on Friday after a long lockdown. But the condition that business would be allowed only if the traders are vaccinated drew flak from various quarters. The East Khasi Hills district administration had on June 15 issued an order for the partial reopening of Iewduh from June 18 provided the shopkeepers and vendors have taken the COVID-19 vaccine. The order also said 185 shops and an equal number of vendors would be allowed to open each day on a rotational basis. Iewduh has more than 4,000 shops but the traditional chief of the area had provided a list of 1,222 shops to the district authorities for reopening. Local NGOs and political parties protested the order, asserting that the government does not have the right to force people to take the vaccine under any pretext. On June 17, the youth wing of the Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement, a regional political party, demanded revocation of the vaccination order asking the shops and establishments to indicate the vaccination status of their staff. It opposed another order directing the cab operators and bus drivers to get themselves vaccinated before resuming operations. “Such orders amount to the violation of a person’s constitutional rights besides going against a Supreme Court observation on medical autonomy of a person,” youth wing president Thomas Passah said. The Chief Executive Member of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council, Titosstarwell Chyne, also said vaccination should be voluntary and could not be forced on the people. Minister’s defence State Health Minister A.L. Hek defended the order. “This is more of an appeal meant for the protection of shopkeepers and customers,” he said. Rajya Sabha member and State president of the National People’s Party, W.R. Kharlukhi, said epidemic or pandemic-related orders were issued and strategies adopted after inputs from health experts. “People and groups should stop opposing the vaccination orders and let the health experts do their job,” he said. Local organisations have also flayed cash incentives for people to get vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ngos-slam-jab-clause-in-market-reopening-order-in-meghalaya/article34855151.ece
19 June 2021||New Delhi,||CM, L-G discuss measures to prepare for third wave||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Friday met virtually to discuss preparations for the plausible third wave of COVID-19 hitting the Capital. According to the government, Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Baijal and presided over a presentation inclusive of “extensive preparedness measures” highlighting enhanced healthcare infrastructure that the government has been building since the pandemic. “The Chief Minister discussed in detail about the State Level Task Force constituted to increase the number of health workers, the committee for the management of the third wave and the Pediatric Task Force to streamline effective treatment of children from COVID-19,” the government stated. Oxygen supply “He also apprised the L-G about PSA oxygen plants, cryogenic plants, LMO storage plants, oxygen and bed management in hospitals, arrangement of medicines and vaccination,” the government also stated. According to the government, preparations are being based on the possibility of likely 37,000 and maximum of 45,000 cases per day during the possible third wave. If the third wave comes and oxygen demand increases, the Delhi government has worked on a war footing to maintain a rigorous supply of oxygen, the government said quoting the Chief Minister. “The CM apprised the L-G that in a worst-case scenario of a possible third wave and the general situation, other preparations including augmentation of beds is being done,” the government stated. A committee, the government stated, has been constituted to assess the oxygen supply infrastructure in Delhi government hospitals having 100 or more beds and also examine the adequacy of provisions in the expansion plan and suggest the way forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cm-l-g-discuss-measures-to-prepare-for-third-wave/article34854885.ece

When you park in a beautiful spot, the moment just passes by.” The youngsters received the green signal once they tied the knot last year in February. Today, the two call their parents regularly and “show them beautiful sunrises and sunsets. This gives them peace of mind knowing that we are safe, working and still able to see new places”. Their Instagram, @thebrownvanlife, has over 8,000 followers too. Kartik and Smriti travel slowly — usually driving between three to five hours daily, and never at night — so they get to stay in a place for a few days. “We don’t burn too much fuel because it impacts the environment. All our electricals are solar powered, so we are eco-friendly and self-sustaining,” adds Kartik. The van is outfitted with a queen-size bed, a kitchen with a fridge, and a 20-gallon water tank.  Finding their balance  In January this year, the couple drove across several states in the US. “We were in a grocery store in Utah when they announced they had extra vaccine slots. So we walked in for yoghurt and came out vaccinated! Which was such a stress relief for our parents and for us,” says Smriti. After exploring the US for four months, they entered Mexico. “We are currently in Baja and ready for the ferry to Mainland Mexico,” she says. Detailed paperwork is a critical part of the venture. “We have Canadian permanent residency, but hold Indian passports. Our biggest advantage is our 10-year US visa that allows us to travel to all of North and Central American countries with a visa on arrival. People often feel we come from rich backgrounds or that we have a lot of savings, but the truth is we have worked really hard to obtain this lifestyle. The idea of letting everything go does not sit well with our Indian upbringing, so we decided to keep our jobs while living and travelling in different places,” says Smriti, who is in digital marketing. In fact, the duo had started planning their remote jobs early on, so they could support their caravanning lifestyle. “We work from 6.30 am to 1.30 pm, and then take the rest of the day to explore or cover distance. We have not monetised our trip yet; we fund it with our jobs,” says Kartik, an IT consultant.  Map to everywhere  The two have also tried to be distinct from their western counterparts. “Since we are possibly the only Indians pursuing this life full time, we did not have a reference point. We also realised that whatever we do might become a reference point for others. So it was important for us to bring representation into the dialogue. We discuss all the social and cultural issues Indian kids and adults might face starting a life like this,” explains Smriti. The duration of their journey is still unknown (though visiting 10 countries is one of their goals). “In terms of itinerary, our immediate goal is to get to Patagonia while exploring different countries in Central and South America, and experience all the cultures. We will go to Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and by next year enter Columbia to start the South American leg of the journey.” And Everest will play the role of a security guard everywhere. “Our photo model, best hiking partner, and optimism booster,” Smriti signs off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-dodgey-lifestyle/article34855142.ece
19 June 2021||Guwahati,||Auctioning of two closed Assam paper mills cancelled||The e-auctioning of two closed paper mills of the Hindustan Paper Corporation Limited (HPCL) in Assam has been cancelled as no private entity deposited the requisite earnest money of Rs. 55 crore within June 15. The associations of officers and employees of the Cachar and Nagaon paper mills had challenged the National Company Law Tribunal’s nod to HPCL for auctioning the mills on June 30. The case came up for hearing on June 16. The counsel for liquidator Kuldeep Varma told the court of Chief Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia and Justice Manash Ranjan Pathak that “no one responded to the e-auction sale notice” on June 1 to deposit the Rs. 55 crore as earnest money within the deadline. The reserve price for the two mills was Rs. 1,139 crore and the auction was to have been conducted on the site of the Metal Scrap Trade Corporation.  Applications dismissed The court observed that the e-auction was thus not going to take place and dismissed the interim applications challenging the sale of the paper mills. “Now that the e-auctioning is not happening, the government should live up to its promise and revive its wholly-owned mills to end the trauma and torture of the employees who have not been paid their dues for 54 months,” Manobendra Chakraborty, president of the Joint Action Committee of Recognised Unions told The Hindu on June 18. “We have already lost 89 workers who died because of hunger and inability to get treatment for their illnesses, which violates the right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) has governments at the Centre and in Assam, and both have repeatedly assured the mills will be revived,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/auctioning-of-two-closed-assam-paper-mills-cancelled/article34855153.ece

The meeting was held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. “The Punjab Minor Mineral Rules, 2013 and Policy Guidelines for Registration and Working of Stone Crushers in the State of Punjab, 2015, will be amended to ensure that any kind of minor mineral extracted from the State is properly accounted for,” said an official statement. The statement said the amendments to these rules-guidelines will pave the way for stricter curbs on illegal stone crushing. “The amendments make it mandatory for the registration of a carrier used for transportation of minerals in any form, and the requirement of a mineral transport permit, with carrier to be fitted with GPS for real time tracking. Also, registration of wheel mounted-chain mounted excavators involved in excavation of minerals in the State, and all such machinery, shall be fitted with GPS to monitor their movement in real time,” it said. The amendments will also empower the government to levy strict penalty under Indian Penal Code and other laws, in case anyone tries to establish check-post for checking of slips or collection of illegal royalty.  Online registration “It will also enable the Water Resources Department to keep a check on the stone-crushers, as their registration has been made mandatory on the online portal developed by the department. Also, the material processed by them will be duly accounted for. Similarly, the rules for issuing transport permits to the vehicles transporting the minerals are also being suitably amended to check illegal transportation,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-govt-nod-for-stringent-guidelines-to-curb-illegal-mining/article34855156.ece

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||What he gave me||There was nothing extraordinary about the day my father died. I recall coming home from college, and finding an empty house; my friend pulling up in an auto-rickshaw, saying “Hurry up, your dad’s in hospital”. In the days before mobile phones there was no other way to get the news to me. I was 18 that year, the oldest of three siblings. As a self-obsessed teen, I don’t remember having long conversations with him. My mother was a more present, constant figure while daddy was the fun guy, easygoing and laid-back. Food was an integral part of his happiness. After Sunday mass, we’d pile into our white Ambassador and drive to a nearby Sindhi restaurant. There, we’d order dal pakwan , chole with greasy bhature or piping hot ragda pattice and bring them home for brunch. After my dad died, did we continue the Sunday brunch tradition? I can’t recollect. My grief in those early years was all-encompassing. I remember running to the window when we heard a jeep rumble outside, the words “Daddy’s home!” almost tumbling out of my mouth before reality slammed in. With time, though, the pain eases and the good memories return. And on trips to see my family in Mumbai, my brother and I make road-trips at dawn to the Sindhi restaurant, now all spiffy, where we order breakfast and raise a glass of lassi to the man who taught us how to live large.

19 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assam MLA quits Cong., to join BJP||The Congress in Assam lost one of its 29 MLAs, who is set to join the Bharatiya Janata Party on June 21. Rupjyoti Kurmi, a tea community leader, submitted his resignation to party president Sonia Gandhi as well as Assembly Speaker Biswajit Daimary on Friday. He had won the Mariani constituency in eastern Assam four times in a row since 2006 and was the only Congress MLA representing the tea plantation workers to have won in the 2021 Assembly polls. “I will be joining the BJP on Monday,” Mr. Kurmi said. The BJP is expected to field him as its candidate for the Mariani by-election. Mr. Kurmi, the son of former Congress Minister Rupam Kurmi, made it clear that he quit the party after he was snubbed for the State president’s post after incumbent Ripun Bora decided to step down. “Young leaders do not get a chance... The Congress ignores newcomers, grassroots workers and indigenous minority leaders,” he told journalists. The APCC issued a statement saying Mr. Kurmi has been expelled for “anti-party activities”. It said the AICC approved his expulsion. Senior party MLA and former Minister Bharat Narah said Mr. Kurmi’s resignation is a big blow to the party. There is speculation that another MLA would quit the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-mla-quits-cong-to-join-bjp/article34854872.ece

Justice Navin Chawla was informed by the Centre that visa and travel exemption approval form required due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been granted by the Australian embassy to the mother, who is a widow. “I find the government is taking proactive steps in the matter. The writ petition is disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to file a fresh petition in case the need arises,” the High Court said.  The Centre government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul said that though visa and travel exemption have been granted to the woman, they have now received a fresh application from the family seeking to arrange for repatriation of the son to India. Mr. Digpaul said the government is looking into the issue and extending all possible help to the family. The advocate, representing the woman, said repatriation of the son is an alternate prayer considering there are no flights to Australia and even after visa clearance, the mother will be unable to go there. The woman, in her plea, has stated her son had gone to Australia in 2018 to pursue his higher studies. The plea said her son has been diagnosed with a life-threatening condition of end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis, nephrotic-range proteinuria with haematuria and is also at risk of thrombosis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/centre-helping-woman-for-sons-treatment-in-oz/article34854874.ece

The Department of Archaeology and Museum on Friday pointed out that that there are illegal farmhouses in the forest areas of the Aravalis located in Faridabad and Gurugram districts and keeping with the spirit of the apex court’s direction, all these illegal farmhouses may also be demolished. 50 in Faridabad Forest Minister Kanwal Pal Gujjar’s reply in the State Assembly last year revealed that a total of 60 illegal farmhouses were constructed in the Aravalli area, including 50 in Faridabad and 10 in Gurugram between 2000 and 2020. The area is notified under Sections 4 and 5 of Punjab Land Preservation Act. The farmhouses have been given electricity connections by the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) and do not have permission under Forest Conservation (FC) Act or the Controlled Area Act. “To comply with the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, all such illegal farmhouses may also be demolished,” read a communication from the department, sent by Ashok Khemka, Principal Secretary, (Archaeological Department) to the Chief Minister’s office through the Ministry. Petition rejected Mr. Khemka added that the Supreme Court has rejected the plea petition of rehabilitating illegal encroachments of public land at public expense. “Therefore, the rehabilitation of illegal encroachers of ASI protected sites at Ther Mound Sirsa, Rakhigarhi and Privthi Raj Fort Hansi needs a relook, and all such encroachers may be removed from public land without rewarding them for the encroachment,” he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/archaeology-department-seeks-demolition-of-60-farmhouses-in-aravalis/article34854889.ece

However, for us to sustain the skill and artisans associated with it, we need to make it more mainstream and link it to fashion,” believes designer Anavila Misra. Most recently, Kolkata-based designer Kavya Singh Kundu used deadstock (saris, stoles and scarves) from weavers in Phulia, West Bengal, to create an upcycled collection. In ‘Tale as Old as Time’, she has experimented with cuts, switching up the traditional aesthetic to create versatile pieces such as one-shoulder dresses. “Going forward, we need to simplify the weave and work on more youthful and detailed silhouettes to make it more relevant,” she says, pointing to how a section of younger weavers are creating fresh, contemporary motifs, which are almost like abstract works of art. “These appeal to a younger demographic as well as to an international clientele, and will ensure that jamdani continues to have a future,” adds Kundu.

19 June 2021||June 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Bamboo toilet in Somerset House||The India Pavilion at the ongoing London Design Biennale 2021 (LDB) is mapping ‘hero stories’ — from innovator-engineer Sonam Wangchuk’s ice stupas (which melt in summer to generate water) to smokeless chulahs . All inventive, indigenous, and sustainable ideas developed in various parts of the country in the last few years. “It is quite an ‘aha’ moment to see what India looks like through the lens of its people and their efforts to make a sustainable world,” says architect Nisha Mathew Ghosh, 52, who has curated the pavilion. “It is exciting to imagine a future of collaborations to build this world of better ecological stewardship together.” The pavilion at Somerset House, titled ‘Small Is Beautiful: A Billion Stories’, comprises 150 entries segregated into five categories: Clean Air, Clean Water, Clean Earth, Clean Energy, and Forest. Ranging from product inventions to material explorations, each responds to the overarching theme of ‘Resonances’, as chosen by LDB’s artistic director, Es Devlin.  Back to nature  The India Pavilion engages with the ideas of sustainability through effective design. “All these projects are reactions to situations and contexts. For example, the Story of Fish [by landscape architect Prachi Chopade Wakaley] uses art as strategy — making a fish from waste glass bottles to remind people to keep their water sources clean; Pollinator People [by landscape architect Vidisha Barwal] uses the logic and process of pollination to offer a design for the recovery of ecosystems; and Forest Cabin [by Architecture Brio], shows you how to build lightly in a forest setting with least impact,” says Nisha. Among the plethora of intriguing projects, Bamboo Toilet — an initiative by Tata Trust, and designed by Delhi-based Shift Studio — has piqued interest. The brief was to build a toilet that would meet the needs of rural India, and Mayank Mishra of Shift Studio says they came up with a design that used bamboo and EcoSan technology (dry toilets that do not use water). Ideal for places that have scarcity of water, it converts human excreta into compost and fertiliser. “An individual unit will cost anywhere between Rs. 12,000 and Rs. 24,000, which can come down when built and managed by the community,”explains Mishra. “It was challenging to evolve processes to elevate bamboo from a craft material to an engineering level [meeting the needs for structural constructions].”  Travelling stories  Speaking of the showcase’s engagement with viewers at Somerset House, where the various projects are being screened on a large projection, Nisha explains, “It’s a showcase that is packed with ideas and needs a couple of hours to fully watch and observe.” Beyond the Biennale, she feels that the ideas, which have emerged from traditional wisdom, scientific temper, and the communities’ needs, must be shared with the entire country. “We could do a travelling exhibition,” she says. “These stories can be vital to bring about a change. People must know what’s happening in various parts of India.” Moreover, she believes the current situation underlines the need for solutions that are local and interconnected, while still recognising the value of the large scale. “The two need to work together for the preservation of our resources. If an earlier Indian austerity could be referred to, it was doing the most with the least, and I believe design will respond in this manner given the conditions around us. We don’t have a choice but to re-look at maximising the potential of our natural resources for the benefit of communities post pandemic, and this has to begin with great ideas.”  London Design Biennale is on at Somerset House   till June 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bamboo-toilet-in-somerset-house/article34855141.ece
