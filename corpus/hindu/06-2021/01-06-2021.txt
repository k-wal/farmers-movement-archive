01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||GDP shrinks by 7.3%; Q4 uptick moderates 2020-21 carnage||India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by 7.3% in 2020-21, as per provisional National Income estimates released by the National Statistical Office on Monday, marginally better than the 8% contraction in the economy projected earlier. GDP growth in 2019-20, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, was 4%. The Gross Value Added (GVA) in the economy shrank 6.2% in 2020-21, compared to a 4.1% rise in the previous year. Only two sectors bucked the trend of negative GVA growth — agriculture, forestry and fishing, which rose 3.6%, and electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services (up 1.9%). Though this is the bleakest performance on record for the economy, the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2020-21 helped moderate the damage, with a higher-than-expected growth of 1.6% in GDP. This marked the second quarter of positive growth after the country entered a technical recession in the first half of the year. GDP had contracted 24.4% in April-June 2020, followed by a 7.4% shrinkage in the second quarter. It had returned to positive territory in the September to December quarter with a marginal 0.5% growth. GVA for trade, hotels, transport, communication and broadcasting-related services saw the sharpest decline of 18.2%, followed by construction (-8.6%), mining and quarrying (-8.5%) and manufacturing (-7.2%). Economists said these numbers would moderate growth prospects for 2021-22 through the base effect, even as the scourge of the virus is hurting activity again. “With a lower contraction in GDP as well as GVA in 2020-21, the sharp recovery projected for 2021-22 by a number of agencies like the IMF at 12.5% and the RBI at 10.5% may have to be moderated,” said D.K. Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India. “The combination of the second wave and the revised base effect may imply a lower GDP growth for the Indian economy for 2021-22, may be in the range of 9-9.5%,” Mr. Srivastava added. Chief Economic Advisor to the Finance Ministry K.V. Subramanian said he doesn’t expect GDP forecasts to be significantly affected. “Whether growth will be in double digits or single digits, there is uncertainty. Some of the scientists are talking about the possibility of a third wave too. It would be speculative to tell you exact numbers,” he said, stressing that vaccination was important for the health of the people and economy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gdp-shrinks-by-73-q4-uptick-moderates-2020-21-carnage/article34693786.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC bats for ‘one price for vaccines across nation’||The government on Monday claimed it will inoculate the “entire eligible population” by 2021-end, only to be barraged with questions from the Supreme Court about the efficacy of its policy, which allows the Centre to procure just 50% of the vaccines while leaving the States to buy their own. The court also challenged the differential vaccine pricing policy, saying “there needs to be one price for vaccines across the nation”. The virtual hearing, however, began on a positive note with Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta assuring that “on vaccination, as per our estimate, from the domestic market and Sputnik V, we expect the entire eligible population to get vaccinated by the end of this year”. Mr. Mehta said the government was in talks with other manufacturers like Pfizer. If the discussions succeed, the government would be able to advance its deadline for completing the immunisation. He added that he would file an affidavit with the latest updates. But the court highlighted the difference in vaccine prices between the Centre and the States. When the Centre can purchase vaccine in bulk for Rs. 150 per dose, the States have to pay Rs. 300 to Rs. 600. Justice L. Nageswara Rao, on the Bench, asked why even the two vaccines — Covaxin and Covishield — were differentially priced. “What is the rationale for this dual pricing policy? Why is the Centre procuring at a lower price and why has the Centre fixed its vaccine purchase at 50% and left the States to their own devices?” Justice Bhat asked. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said some States and municipal corporations had gone ahead and floated their own “global tenders” to buy vaccines. “We want to know if the policy of the country is that all States are on their own to supply tenders,” he asked the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-bats-for-one-price-for-vaccines-across-nation/article34693783.ece

01 June 2021||Bengaluru,||Continue lockdown till TPR falls below 5%, says panel||The State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monday recommended that Karnataka continue the lockdown in a stricter form, ‘placing lives before livelihoods’. In its recommendations drafted at its 107th meeting held on Sunday, the TAC has said that it is essential for the State “to continue lockdown restrictions till the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) falls below 5%, daily new cases below 5,000 and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) falls below 1%.” TAC chairman M.K. Sudharshan told The Hindu on Monday that the committee at a meeting that went on for over five hours on Sunday reviewed the current COVID-19 situation in the State. “We unanimously drafted the recommendations placing the health and lives of people before livelihoods, which is the need of the hour,” he said. Although new cases have fallen to less than 20,000 in the State and less than 5,000 in Bengaluru Urban, active cases continue to be over three lakh. As on Monday, Karnataka reported 16,604 new cases of which 3,992 cases are from Bengaluru Urban. With 44,473 recoveries, the State now has 3,13,730 active patients. The TPR for the day stood at 13.57% and CFR touched 2.47%. Although experts have been asserting that the TPR can be brought down only if testing is ramped up, the number of tests conducted daily continue to be around 1.3 lakh. Lockdown restrictions have been in place in the State from April 27 onwards in different phases. “The current lockdown is till June 7. However, the general advisory from the Government of India recommends continuation of restrictions till the end of June 2021 in districts having a TPR of more than 10% and oxygenated bed occupancy of more than 60%. We have recommended further continuation of the lockdown in this context,” he said. “The lockdown restrictions, if continued, should be reviewed on a weekly basis for any relaxations and concessions. Whenever unlocking is considered, the approach used in 2020 from June-November should be used as a basis for a graded (quantum) and phase-wise (different activities) relaxation of imposed restrictions,” Dr. Sudarshan said. Asserting that it would be advisable for the lockdown restrictions to be continued to consolidate the gains made so far during the existing lockdown, the TAC chairman added that it is now left to the government to take a decision. Special SOPs for holding exams TAC members, who also deliberated on the conduct of board examinations for Class 10 (SSLC) and Class 12 (PUC), have pointed out that it is very challenging to hold exams in the current scenario. “If the examinations are to be conducted, it is strongly recommended to provide ‘a special SOP’ for this purpose. The teachers should be well trained and necessary facilities should be arranged in exam centres. A special vaccination drive may be planned to provide at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine to all those engaged in examination work or those who are already vaccinated should be engaged,” the report on recommendations stated.  The general advisory recommends continuation of restrictions till the end of June 2021 in districts with TPR of more than 10% and oxygenated bed occupancy of more than 60%. M.K.

01 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Vaccine stocks will last only for two more days: T.N. govt.||The Tamil Nadu government on Monday informed the Madras High Court that its COVID-19 vaccine stocks would last only for two more days. It has so far vaccinated only 87.7 lakh people, including 75.73 lakh in the age group of 45 and above and 11.97 lakh aged 18 to 44. The court was also told that the State had sent a communication to the Centre seeking supply of adequate doses on a priority basis. The submissions were made before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy at the hearing of a suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up by the court to monitor the fight against the pandemic. Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram said the Centre had so far supplied 83.08 lakh doses for the 45 years-and-above category and 13.10 lakh doses for the 18-44 age group. On the other hand, Additional Solicitor-General R. Sankaranarayanan said Tamil Nadu was in possession of 5,20,472 doses (3,23,830 doses of Covishield and 1,96,642 doses of Covaxin) as on Sunday. He said that since the start of vaccination, the Centre had supplied 95,61,620 doses (80,04,340 doses of Covishield and 15,57,280 doses of Covaxin) to the State, which had consumed 90,41,148 doses (76,80,510 doses of Covishield and 13,60,638 doses of Covaxin). He also said that though only 13,22,400 doses had been allocated to Tamil Nadu free of cost (for vaccinating those aged above 45) for the month of May, the Centre had supplied 14,22,400 doses, including those of Covishield and Covaxin. Similarly, the State had been supplied with the entire monthly allocation of 11,18,530 doses of Covishield through direct procurement for vaccinating the 18-44 age group.  The Centre has so far supplied 83.08 lakh doses for the 45 years-and-above category and 13.10 lakh doses for the 18-44 age group R.

01 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Nod for ‘Anandaiah preparation’, excluding eye drops||The State government on Monday permitted the usage of the herbal preparation being given to COVID patients by B. Anandaiah, an ayurvedic practitioner of Krishnapatnam in Nellore district, by taking into account the findings of the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, but kept on hold its decision on the eye drops claimed to be life saving for those with dangerously low levels of oxygen. While giving the green signal to the herbal preparation, the government warned that COVID patients should not stop taking the drugs prescribed by doctors in the normal course. According to an official release, the government was yet to receive a conclusive proof of the efficacy of the eye drops, while it had been established that the concoction of ingredients such as honey, pepper, green camphor, nutmeg, black cumin, cinnamon and medicinal herbs was not harmful, but may not be able to cure the Coronavirus infection. Further, the government said people could use the “Anandaiah medicine” by volition and suggested to COVID patients to send their family members or relatives to collect the medicine. It may be noted that Mr. Anandaiah claimed to be a practitioner of ayurveda for over 30 years and that the traditional medicines given by him were useful in treating not only COVID but also various other infections.  Meanwhile, Commissioner of AYUSH V. Ramulu told mediapersons that the herbal concoction being distributed by Mr. Anandaiah was not an ayurvedic medicine. It was found to not have any side effects and there were no such complaints so far. People could take the preparation as a health supplement that could boost immunity. The validation or otherwise of the eye drops was likely to take another two to three weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-clears-use-of-herbal-mix-by-covid-patients/article34693753.ece
01 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||When height blocks doctor’s IPS dream||Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu has asked the Centre to amend a service condition that requires an eligible candidate to be of a certain height to become an IPS officer. He wrote to Union Minister for Personnel, Grievances, DoNER and Pensions Jitendra Singh seeking the amendment after the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) dismissed a petition by an Arunachal Pradesh doctor whose hope of becoming an IPS officer fell short by 2.5 cm. Ojing Dameng, from Milang village in the State’s Upper Siang district bordering China, was ranked 644th in the Civil Services Examination of 2017. Selected for the Indian Revenue Service (IRS), he is posted in Kolkata. Mr. Dameng was placed second in the provisional list of IPS officers in the Scheduled Tribes category. But a medical examination conducted by the Central Standing Medical Board (CSMB) found him unfit for the IPS because he is 162.5 cm tall, which is 2.5 cm less than the required minimum height of 165 cm for male candidates for the IPS. He challenged the CSMB’s decision at the CAT in August 2018. He argued that candidates belonging to the ST category and races such as Gorkha, Assamese, Kumaoni, Naga, Garhwali, etc., are entitled to a relaxation of 15 cm in the minimum height required for the IPS. But the CAT dismissed his petition on May 27 pointing out that he did not belong to the communities eligible for height relaxation. According to Mr. Khandu, the condition on height would deprive aspirants of Arunachal Pradesh. “This service condition was framed in 1951 and apparently, not updated. Arunachal Pradesh came into existence as a Union Territory in 1972 and attained statehood in 1987. You will appreciate that when the All India Services Act was framed, the present-day Arunachal was under Assam administration and when the benefit was extended to ‘Assamese’ in the Act, the spirit would have been to include the tribes of Arunachal too,” he wrote to Mr. Singh.  Mr. Dameng, who plans to challenge the CAT decision in a High Court, said it would be unfair for a certain category of candidates who clear the exams conducted by the UPSC and medical tests only to be stumped by the height clause. “This needs to be done, at least for the future generations of people in Arunachal Pradesh and others places who are not tall enough,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/when-height-blocks-doctors-ips-dream/article34693775.ece
01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s time to define limits of sedition: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday said “it is time to define the limits of sedition” even as it protected two Telugu channels from any coercive action by the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Andhra Pradesh government for their reportage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the State. A three-judge Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud flagged indiscriminate use of the sedition law against critics, journalists, social media users, activists and citizens for airing grievances about the governments’ COVID-19 management, or even for seeking help to gain medical access, equipment, drugs and oxygen cylinders. “We are of the view that the ambit and parameters of the provisions of Sections 124A (sedition), 153A and 505 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 would require interpretation, particularly in the context of the right of the electronic and print media to communicate news, information and the rights, even those that may be critical of the prevailing regime in any part of the nation,” the court noted in its order. ‘Muzzling the media’ “This is muzzling the media,” Justice L. Nageswara Rao, another judge on the Bench along with Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, said about the manner in which A.P. had tried to “silence” channels TV5 and ABN. “It is time to define the limits of sedition,” Justice Chandrachud said. The court issued notice to the A.P. government and directed that “there shall be a stay on the respondents [the State] adopting coercive proceedings against the two TV channels”. Justice Chandrachud pointed out that the court had categorically told the States not to initiate penal action against the critics of COVID-19 management measures in an April 30 order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/its-time-to-define-limits-of-sedition-sc/article34693784.ece

01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Central Vista project essential, of public importance: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed a petition seeking to halt the construction activities at the Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project in view of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in the country. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh remarked that there was no reason for the court to suspend the construction activities as the workers were staying at the project site, and “COVID-19 protocols are adhered to and COVID-19 appropriate behaviour is being followed”. “We are of the view that this is a motivated petition preferred by the petitioners and not a genuine public interest litigation [petition],” the court said while imposing a cost of Rs. 1 lakh on petitioners Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator; and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker. ‘Not an essential activity’ The petitioners had argued that the project was not an essential activity and hence, it could be put on hold for now during the pandemic. The court noted that the work at the Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment was part of the Central Vista Project and of vital public importance and the legality of the project had been upheld by Supreme Court. “By no stretch of imagination, it can be said that Central Vista Project or Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project is not an essential project,” the court said, adding, “If this type of project is stopped by the court, the main project cannot be completed within the stipulated time.” It noted that the work at the Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project had to be completed by November 2021. While the petitioners argued that the time limit be extended, the court said, “Such kind of arguments cannot be accepted by this court, keeping in view that the construction activity of this essential project or of a project of national importance cannot be stopped especially when the conditions imposed by the order of the DDMA dated 19th April, 2021...are not flouted or violated.” The HC remarked that several other agencies were undertaking construction projects in Delhi. “It is obvious that petitioners have selectively chosen only one project which is of national importance, at a vital place where Republic Day celebrations are held in Delhi and is a part and parcel of the larger project, namely, Central Vista Project,” it stated. ‘Very selective’ Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta had argued that the PIL raised in the case was “very selective”. Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, for the petitioners, stated that his clients were only delivering a message of health and safety for the people of Delhi and if the government could not see it, then it was a “sorry reflection” of its concern for the lives of the citizens. Mr. Luthra had referred to the ongoing project work as not Central Vista, rather “central fortress of death”, comparing it to “Auschwitz”. Mr. Mehta had expressed displeasure with the comparison, saying one could criticise and be venomous about it, but such terms should not be used in court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/central-vista-project-essential-of-public-importance-delhi-hc/article34693699.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Class 12 exam: govt. says decision by Thursday||The Union government on Monday sought time till Thursday from the Supreme Court to take a “final decision” on whether the Class 12 Board examinations should be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The government will take a final decision within the next few days… Give us time till Thursday,” Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal submitted. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari agreed, but stated that the government had to give “good reasons” in case it decided to depart from its policy in 2020 to cancel the conduct of the examinations because of the pandemic and assess students on the basis of their earlier marks. “You take a decision… But in case you depart from your policy last year, you must give us a good reason why you are departing [from it],” Justice Khanwilkar said. Mr. Venugopal tried to indicate that the pandemic had struck when the Board examinations were on last year. “Some students had one paper left, some had four papers to do,” he submitted. Justice Khanwilkar said, “There is a sanguine hope expressed by the petitioners here that the policy adopted last year — to cancel the examinations in the face of the pandemic — would be adopted this year, too. So, if you are departing from your notification last year, you should give us good reasons.” Last year, the Supreme Court accepted a Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) scheme to assess the marks of the cancelled papers of Class 10 and 12 by taking an average of best performances in the papers already taken. The court, on Monday, was hearing a petition filed by advocate Mamta Sharma to direct the authorities to forgo the examinations and conceive an objective methodology to declare the Class 12 results within a specific time frame. “Issue a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to cancel the examinations of Class 12 and devise an objective methodology to declare the result within a specific time frame,” Ms. Sharma urged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/class-12-exam-govt-says-decision-by-thursday/article34693711.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Year-end deadline for full vaccination tight||At the current pace of vaccination, it could be eight months before every adult Indian gets at least one shot of vaccine, back-of-the-envelope calculations from the government’s portal CoWin suggest. About 16.7 crore first doses have been administered till Monday. The Centre expects to inoculate 94.4 crore adults, according to a note last week by R.S. Sharma, Chairman of the technical committee that oversees the portal. Several Cabinet Ministers and policy advisers, spearheading India’s COVID vaccination campaign, have claimed that India will inoculate “all eligible” by December. These statements do not specify if that refers to just all adults, or the number of doses administered. Last week, India administered 30 lakh doses a day on consecutive days — after over 45 days when fewer than 20 lakh doses were given every day. Assuming that pace were to continue, it would take 256 days, or over eight months, to complete the targeted number of adults. The recommended vaccination protocol is to administer two doses at least four to 16 weeks apart depending on the vaccine administered. Given that only 4.4 crore second doses have been administered and the daily pace of second doses — for most of last month — has been about 10% of that of the first dose (on May 29, 27 lakh first doses were administered to 3 lakh second doses), it could theoretically be years before all those over 18 get their second doses. Jabs for all Despite opening vaccination for all adults, there were fewer doses administered in May — around six crore — as opposed to 7.7 crore doses administered in April. The Health Ministry said on Sunday that close to 8 crore doses were available in May (counting wastage and stocks with States) and that 12 crore will be available in June for the Centre, the States and private hospitals. India hit a highpoint of administering 45 lakh doses a day on April 5 after which the pace has declined. Experts say that India has the capacity to administer 100 lakh shots a day. That works out to about 25-30 crore vaccines being supplied a month. “Drawing on our capacity of at least a 1,50,000 support staff (auxiliary nursing midwife), we have been able to administer polio drops to at least 30 million children within days,” said Sujatha Rao, former Health Secretary. “However the problem we face [with COVID vaccines] is that there isn’t certainty on the supply.” Chandrakant Lahariya, epidemiologist and former consultant to the World Health Organisation, said that until at least October there would be supply constraints. “It would be quite likely that India would move to a single shot vaccine administration policy. 100 lakh a day is doable, but we also have to account for people’s receptiveness in the future.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/year-end-deadline-for-full-vaccination-tight/article34693730.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Decision soon on oxygen use for industrial purposes||The government would take a decision to lift restrictions on use of liquid oxygen for industrial purposes “as soon as possible”, an official said. “We are talking to State governments to find out what their needs for medical oxygen are. After confirmation from them as well as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, whatever needs to be done to revive the continuous process industries we will do as soon as possible,” said Giridhar Aramane, Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, who is the convener of the Empowered Group 4 that oversees the country’s demand for medical oxygen and its logistics. The current demand for medical oxygen was down to 5,200 metric tonnes (MT) a day from a peak of 8,900 MT last month. This was expected to drop further to 3,000 MT in the next one week. On April 22, the government issued an order banning the supply of liquid oxygen to industry in view of increased demand for medical oxygen. The Empowered Group was consulting medical professionals to assess the demand for medical oxygen for the next wave. ‘Foreseeing scenarios’ “We are trying to foresee certain scenarios in consultation with experts to determine how the oxygen situation can be improved in case of any future flare-up? We are consulting medical professionals. In two weeks, we plan to do basic future planning. But we want to make it clear that we can’t really foresee or predict what is going to happen,” Mr. Aramane said. “Those who are blaming the government in hindsight on O2 and other issues did not warn us to be prepared for four lakh cases. The worst of projections were also not for more than a lakh of cases a day. All these people criticising the government should understand that such fierce form of second wave couldn’t have been dealt with by any government like we did in such a short time,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/decision-soon-on-oxygen-use-for-industrial-purposes/article34693704.ece
01 June 2021||New Delhi,||Justice Mishra likely to head NHRC||Former Supreme Court Justice Arun Kumar Mishra is likely to be the new Chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) after a high-powered recommendation committee proposed his name on Monday, a source informed The Hindu . Former Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, Mahesh Mittal Kumar, and former Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Rajiv Jain, had also been recommended by the high-powered panel as members of the NHRC, but the official notification is yet to be out until the filing of this report. The selection panel consisted of Prime Minister Narendra Modi; Home Minister Amit Shah; Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Harivansh; Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla; and the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge. Mr. Kharge is learnt to have registered his dissent after the committee didn’t accept his suggestion to appoint a member from either the Dalit, Adivasi or minority communities. The Congress leader is learnt to have argued that since most complaints at the NHRC pertained to these socially disadvantaged groups, there should be at least one representative from these communities in the Commission. When other members pointed out that the concerned Act on the NHRC did not make any specific provisions about any group except a woman member, Mr. Kharge is learnt to have pointed out that there was no specific bar in appointments. He then suggested that the panel meet again in a week’s time with more names from these communities. He recorded his dissent when the committee decided to go ahead with the shortlisted names instead of looking for fresh names. For over five months now, the NHRC has been without a full-time head after Justice H.L. Dattu retired last December. A highly-placed source said while 12 names were shortlisted for the two vacancies, the shortlisted candidates for the position of Chairperson included three former Chief Justices of India (CJIs).  As a sitting judge of the top court, Justice Mishra, while addressing an international conference, had described Mr. Modi as an “internationally acclaimed visionary who could think globally and act locally”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/justice-mishra-likely-to-head-nhrc/article34693716.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Policy should be clear, flexible: SC||Acknowledging one’s error is not a sign of weakness but that of strength, Supreme Court judge Justice D.Y. Chandrachud told the Union government on Monday. “The ability to recognise that I am wrong is not a sign of weakness, but of strength,” Justice Chandrachud orally addressed Solicitor-General Tushar Mehtaduring a virtual hearing. Justice Chandrachud was heading a three-judge Special Bench hearing a suo motu case covering the various fronts of the government’s COVID-19 management. The Bench questioned the government’s dual vaccine pricing policy between the Centre and the States, the vaccination coverage in rural India, how it was almost impossible to get vaccination slots on CoWin, the “digital divide” in the registration process for vaccination in “Digital India” and how the dead are “thrown” into rivers or buried in shallow graves. The court referred to a recent video footage and pictures of two men throwing the body of a COVID-19 patient from a bridge into a river in Uttar Pradesh. “I don’t know whether a complaint has been filed against the news channel for sedition for publishing the photograph…” Justice Chandrachud said. This comment comes amid some States allegedly registering FIRs booking social media users and the electronic media on sedition charge. The top court banned States from taking penal action in such cases in an order on April 30. Justice Chandrachud said the government could not fight the pandemic on a day-to-day basis in an ad hoc manner. “You need your policy to anticipate changes. Your policy should also be enforceable on the ground. Your policy needs to be clear-cut. If new issues come up, your policy has to be amended… But first, there should be a degree of flexibility in you… It can’t be that you have made a policy and you cannot change that,” Justice Chandrachud said. Mr. Mehta agreed that no policy was cast in stone. “If matters change, the government will have to change,” he said. Justice Chandrachud referred to how the External Affairs Minister had gone abroad for a dialogue on vaccines. “It shows the seriousness of the situation,” Justice Chandrachud said. At one point, Mr. Mehta expressed his concern about having to trouble Justice Chandrachud, who has just recovered from COVID-19. “The interest of the nation comes first, my health comes later,” Justice Chandrachud replied. Justice Chandrachud, to set the record straight with the Centre, said “We are not going to run the Central government or make policy for you. This is a platform for dialogue across the spectrum… The idea is not to criticise but to strengthen the arms of the government”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/policy-should-be-clear-flexible-sc/article34693733.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP gets into battle mode for 2022 polls||The BJP has kick-started preparations for the election cycle in 2022, with the party’s general secretary (organisation), B.L. Santosh, travelling to Uttarakhand last weekend and to Uttar Pradesh on Monday to hold organisational meetings. Elections to several Assemblies, including of Punjab and later in the year, Gujarat, will take place next year. The experience of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the perception of the BJP and governments led by it during that period weighed heavily on the meetings. Sources confirmed to The Hindu that while in Lucknow, Mr. Santosh held meetings with State unit office-bearers. State Health Minister Jay Pratap Singh and Health Education Minister Suresh Khanna were present. “The main focus of these meetings is, of course, to look at ways by which the ‘ seva hi sanghathan’ programme of rural outreach during COVID-19 pandemic announced by party president J.P. Nadda are carried out. But yes, organisational restructuring may also be discussed,” said a source who did not confirm whether this could mean the replacement of the party’s State president, Swatantra Dev Singh.  ‘Unrest within party’ “There is much unrest within the party, with several MLAs having publicly written to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on the many ways in which the administration had failed to respond to the pandemic and also the anger among the people with the ruling party. Stock-taking is, therefore, important,” the source said. “After the panchayat polls, many zilla parishads are yet to elect the heads of these district-level bodies and, therefore, the party also needs to discuss how best to get their candidates elected to that post in most districts, get in touch with independents, etc.,” an Uttar Pradesh BJP office-bearer said. The State government headed by Mr. Adityanath will be launching an intensive vaccination programme from June 1, and BJP workers have been asked to make sure that they are visible on the ground to ensure its success. In Uttarakhand, Mr. Santosh addressed the State’s core committee, the first time after Tirath Singh Rawat replaced Trivendra Singh Rawat as Chief Minister. Here too, the emphasis was on reaching out to rural areas by party workers in order to help deal with the pandemic in its second wave. The emphasis, say sources, was to bridge the perception divide that the BJP organisation was absent from the ground at a critical time. Earlier in the week, RSS second-in-command Dattatreya Hosabele visited U.P., sources said, as part of a previously finalised tour programme, but he held meetings at the organisational level as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-gets-into-battle-mode-for-2022-polls/article34693713.ece
01 June 2021||New Delhi,||Twitter has to comply with IT Rules: HC||The Delhi High Court on Monday said Twitter has to comply with the new Information Technology Rules for digital media if they have not been stayed by the court. Justice Rekha Palli also issued notice to the Centre and Twitter on a plea by advocate Amit Acharya, seeking to appoint Resident Grievance Officer under Rule 4 of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Ethics Code) Rules 2021. “They have to follow it [Rules], if it has not been stayed,” the court said during the hearing. The Central government standing counsel said Twitter has not complied with the Rules, but the social media platform claimed that it has complied with them and appointed a resident grievance officer. Mr. Acharya, in his plea filed through advocates Akash Vajpai and Manish Kumar, claimed that he wanted to raise grievance against two alleged “offensive and objectionable tweet” with the resident grievance officer. ‘Details not available’ “However the Petitioner was unable to find the contact details of the resident grievance officer on the website of Twitter,” he said. The petition said the Information Technology Rules 2021 have come into effect from February 25, 2021 and the Centre had given three months’ time to every significant social media intermediary to comply with them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/twitter-has-to-comply-with-it-rules-hc/article34693690.ece
01 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||5 trapped in Meghalaya coal mine after dynamite blast||A dynamite blast led to the flooding of a coal mine in East Jaintia Hills district in Meghalaya, trapping five labourers, officials said on Monday. The district police launched a search operation after receiving information from the police at Cachar district in southern Assam about the possible death of five to seven labourers in a mine accident on May 30. One Karimul Bari, from Cachar, told the local police that his neighbour was among the trapped. East Jaintia Hills Superintendent of Police Jagpal Singh Dhanoa said they identified the probable site of the incident in the Sutnga area on Monday morning. “According to eyewitnesses, five persons were trapped when water rushed into the mine after a sudden explosion of dynamite,” he said. Mr. Dhanoa said the operation was being led by the State Disaster Response Force. Preliminary investigations revealed that the mine’s sordar (manager), Nizam Ali, did not take any initiative to rescue the labourers. “Based on the account of the survivors, an FIR has been registered,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/5-trapped-in-meghalaya-coal-mine-after-dynamite-blast/article34693706.ece
01 June 2021||Kolkata,||‘Political, organisational reasons for defeat’||Almost a month after the results of the West Bengal Assembly election, the State committee of the CPI(M) has come out with an assessment on its humiliating defeat. They pointed out that a number of factors, the primary one being the steep polarisation between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP, led to its defeat. The West Bengal State Committee of the CPI(M) met on May 29. A total of 46 members of the committee participated in the assessment, which described the reasons for the party’s poor performance as both “political and organisational”. “There has been sharp polarisation between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP. This is probably the main reason for such results. Idealism, democracy and issues of lives and livelihood of the people have taken a back seat. It will be wrong to attribute the results of the Assembly polls to communal polarisation,” an official statement issued by the committee said. ‘Alternative government’ “Our call for an alternative government was rejected. We could not reach out to the people with our views... People of the State did not have confidence in our front and policies,” the committee said on May 30. Both the Trinamool Congress and the BJP resorted to “identity politics”, which could not be countered, itadded. The BJP’s aggressive campaign also brought up the issue of Bengali liberty and freedom to the fore. “There was an anti-establishment feeling at the time the results were declared, but the aggressive campaign resulted in anti-BJP feelings. In such circumstances, people overlooked the issues of corruption and lawlessness and chose the Trinamool Congress as the main anti-BJP force in the State,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/political-organisational-reasons-for-defeat/article34693718.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||1.75 crore vaccine doses are available with States: Centre||More than 1.75 crore COVID vaccine doses are still available with the States and Union Territories, the Health Ministry claimed in a release on Monday, adding that more than 2.73 lakh (2,73,970) vaccine doses are in the pipeline and will be received by the States and Union Territories within the next three days. “The Central government has so far provided, both through the free of cost category and through direct State procurement category, more than 23 crore vaccine doses (23,11,68,480) to States and Union Territories. Of this, the total consumption, including wastages is 21,22,38,652 doses (as per data available at 8 a.m. today),” it said. Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan also chaired a review meeting through video conferencing with administrators from States and Union Territories on the progress of vaccination, on Monday. At the meeting Mr. Bhushan noted that there is a substantial scope to accelerate the pace of vaccination further amid reports from several States of vaccine shortage. He said production was being scaled up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/175-crore-vaccine-doses-are-available-with-states-centre/article34693727.ece
01 June 2021||New Delhi,||SC flags digital divide in vaccine access||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the government to “please wake up and smell the coffee” about the digital divide hampering vaccine access in the country. A three-judge Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud highlighted the farfetchedness of an illiterate villager from rural India crossing the “digital divide” to register for COVID-19 vaccination on the CoWin portal where slots disappear in the blink of an eye. Justice Chandrachud said the government should be aware of the ground realities in ‘Digital India’. Vaccination policy today is entirely exclusionary of the rural areas, the court said. One of the judges on the Bench, Justice S. Ravindra Bhat said he had received distress calls from across the country from people unable to register on CoWin. The court asked why the marginalised section should not be treated on par with people having co-morbities for early vaccination. On the difference in prices for procurement between the Centre and States, Justice Chandrachud said, “Article 1 of the Constitution says Bharat is a Union of States. When the Constitution says that, we will follow the federal rule. Then the Government of India has to wholly procure the vaccines and distribute them. Here, individual States are left in a lurch…”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-flags-digital-divide-in-vaccine-access/article34693731.ece
01 June 2021||Chennai,||Daily test positivity rate dips to 9% from 12.7% a week ago||India recorded 1,22,964 new COVID-19 cases and 2,743 new deaths till 9.35 p.m. on Monday. The country has so far reported a total of 2,81,69,970 cases and 3,31,871 deaths. Tamil Nadu reported 27,936 new infections, followed by Karnataka (16,604) and Maharashtra (15,077). Maharashtra recorded 500 new casualties on the day, followed by Tamil Nadu (478) and Karnataka (411). Maharashtra’s fatalities include backlog deaths which were missed in the previous reports. The figures do not include cases and deaths from Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Tripura and Ladakh. The data are sourced from the respective States’ health bulletins. Only 16.83 lakh samples were tested in the country on Sunday (the results for which were made available on Monday), which is nearly 3.81 lakh fewer tests than those conducted on Saturday. It is also 2.45 lakh less tests than those conducted on the previous Sunday (May 23). India’s average daily test positivity rate (positive cases identified for every 100 tests) continues to decline. It was 9% on May 30 compared to 12.7% recorded a week before. About 10.18 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the country in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Monday, which is 20.18 lakh doses fewer than that of the previous 24 hours. However, it is around 75,000 more doses than what was recorded during the same period a week ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/daily-test-positivity-rate-dips-to-9-from-127-a-week-ago/article34693738.ece

01 June 2021||Mumbai,||Maratha community brought under EWS quota||In a bid to extend relief to the Maratha community in the State, the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra on Monday extended the benefits of reservation for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) to the Socially and Economically Backward Class (SEBC). Previously, the government had decided that the Maratha community could not take advantage of the 10% EWS category as Maratha reservation was in force in the State. The Supreme Court, however, scrapped the SEBC reservation in jobs and education, making it possible for the State government to extend the benefit of the EWS quota to the Marathas. As per the government resolution, a person fulfilling the criterion for EWS would be eligible for 10% reservation in educational institutes, barring minority institutes. This would also be applied for State government recruitment. The resolution said the reservation would be above the existing reservation. It also stated that the benefit would be available from September 9, 2020, when the apex court brought an interim stay on the reservation, to May 5, 2021, when the final verdict was announced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maratha-community-brought-under-ews-quota/article34693709.ece

01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Housing Minister trashes ex-civil servants’ letter||Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri on Monday said the 60 retired civil servants who recently endorsed an open letter expressing concern over the Central Vista project were a disgrace to the country. The letter was not based on facts and some of them needed to have their head examined before signing it, he stated at a press conference. The letter, addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Urban Development Minister, said: “This project began, if reports are to be believed, because of a superstitious belief that the present Parliament building is ‘unlucky’, as well as with the thought of leaving a particular government and its leader’s impression on the architecture of Delhi...” Mr. Puri said any civil servant with about 40 years of experience would not rely on reports that needed to be “believed”. Without naming one signatory, he said a retired official was the Cabinet Secretary to the Government of India when the plan to have a new Parliament building started taking shape in 2012. The new building was being constructed as the present one was cramped. As the freeze on parliamentary seats and seat allocations to States would be lifted in 2026, the number of members in both the Houses would increase, he noted. There was an element of mischief and wishful thinking (of those opposing the project).  When they saw that the Supreme Court cleared it, they went to the Delhi High Court where also the government had now got the clearance and a cost of Rs. 1 lakh was imposed on the petitioner, he said. On Monday, the Delhi High Court ruled that the petition was motivated, and said the national project was vital and essential.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/housing-minister-trashes-ex-civil-servants-letter/article34693693.ece

The new list takes the total number on the list to 209. It is planned to be implemented progressively with effect from December 2021 to December 2025, the Defence Ministry said. “The second list lays special focus on weapons and systems which are currently under development/trials and are likely to translate into firm orders in the future. Like the first list, import substitution of ammunition which is a recurring requirement has been given special focus,” a statement said. The ‘second positive indigenisation list’ comprises complex systems, sensors, simulator, weapons and ammunitions like helicopters, next generation corvettes, Air Borne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) systems, tank engines, medium power radar for mountains, Medium Range Surface to Air Missile (MRSAM) weapon systems and many more such items, it stated. The second list has been prepared after several rounds of consultations with government and private manufacturing industry confederations to assess future capabilities of Indian Industry which will be able to meet requirements of the armed forces, the statement said. “Not only does the list recognise the potential of local defence industry, it will also invigorate impetus to domestic Research and Development by attracting fresh investment into technology and manufacturing capabilities,” it said. The list also provides an excellent opportunity for ‘start-ups’ as also Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/defence-ministry-notifies-108-negative-imports/article34693694.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||EPFO allows withdrawal of 2nd COVID advance||Around six crore subscribers of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) can now withdraw a second non-refundable COVID-19 advance, the Labour Ministry announced on Monday. The initial provision for special withdrawal to meet financial needs during the pandemic was introduced in March 2020. The advance will allow subscribers to withdraw money equivalent to three months basic wages plus dearness allowance, or up to 75% of the amount standing to their credit in their Provident Fund account, whichever is less. Members can apply for less amounts as well. Those who have already availed the first COVID-19 advance are also free to opt for a second advance. The provision and process for withdrawal is the same for both advances. “The COVID-19 advance has been a great help to the EPF members during the pandemic, especially for those having monthly wages of less than Rs. 15,000,” said the Ministry statement. “As on date, EPFO has settled more than 76.31 lakh COVID-19 advance claims thereby disbursing a total of Rs. 18,698.15 crore.” Given the urgent need of members for financial support, especially with a mucormycosis epidemic during the second wave of the pandemic, EPFO said it would accord top priority to COVID-19 claims.  “EPFO is committed to settling these claims within three days of their receipt. For this, EPFO has deployed a system driven auto-claim settlement process in respect of all such members whose KYC requirement is complete in all respects,” said the statement. “Auto-mode of settlement enables EPFO to reduce the claim settlement cycle to just 3 days as against the statutory requirement to settle the claims within 20 days.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/epfo-allows-withdrawal-of-2nd-covid-advance/article34693697.ece

Localised lockdowns Recovery hopes will hinge on the duration for which localised restrictions will persist in coming months and whether an accelerated pace of vaccine rollout can prevent a third Covid surge, she said. “The economic outlook remains highly uncertain, and periodic material revisions to our growth forecasts may persist in FY2022, like last year. At present, we expect real GDP to expand in the range of 8%-9.5%,” Ms. Nayar. More revisions possible The National Statistical Office attributed the improvement over its earlier growth estimates, to the improved performance of indicators, used in compilation of GVA, in the fourth quarter of 2020-21, owing to the calibrated and steady opening of the economy. The NSO also warned that data collection had been impacted as much as any other activity by the pandemic, so its estimates could undergo sharp revisions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indias-gdp-shrinks-by-73-in-2020-2021/article34693700.ece
01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s time to define limits of sedition: Supreme Court||Justice Chandrachud pointed out that the court had categorically told the States not to initiate penal action against the critics of COVID-19 management measures in an April 30 order. Justice Chandrachud referred to how, in an earlier suo motu hearing, he had wondered whether sedition charges would be launched against a news channel that had published a photograph of two persons throwing the body of a COVID-19 patient into a river from a bridge in Uttar Pradesh. “I had this case [Andhra] in mind when I said that,” he said. The court acknowledged the argument that the media was well within its rights to air critical programmes about a prevailing regime without attracting sedition. ‘Unfortunate assault’ TV5, represented by senior advocate Shyam Divan and advocates Vipin Nair and P.B. Suresh, and ABN Andhrajyothi argued that the sedition FIR against them was an “unfortunate assault”. The State had accused them of sedition for reporting news about the pandemic in an “unbiased manner”. “Merely because the content of the news reported in an unbiased manner is critical of a government or not to its liking, it cannot be said that the news outlet has committed an act of sedition or inciting hatred. To do so would be directly contrary to the freedom of Press,” ABN, represented by Guntur Pramod Kumar, said in the petition. TV5 said the “vague” FIR had a chilling effect on free speech in the media.  Plea for contempt case Both channels urged the Supreme Court to initiate contempt proceedings against the senior officials of the State government for violating the April 30 order of the Supreme Court to “immediately cease any direct and indirect threats of prosecution and arrest to citizens, who air their grievances”. Here the Andhra government had “gone one step ahead” to penalise the media, the channels said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/its-time-to-define-limits-of-sedition-supreme-court/article34693701.ece

This prompted Mr. Bandyopadhyay, who had been given a three-month extension from May 31, his original date of retirement, to opt for superannuation. Since Mr. Bandyopadhyay chose to retire on Monday and not avail the three-month extension given to him at the request of the State, it was not immediately clear what action the Centre would initiate. A senior official said on condition of anonymity, “The Centre or the DoPT is not the disciplinary authority for an officer posted in the State. They cannot initiate disciplinary proceedings against him.” H. K. Dwivedi, who was Additional Chief Secretary (Home) will be the new Chief Secretary and B.P. Gopalika the Additional Chief Secretary (Home). The developments concerning Mr. Bandyopadhyay, whom the Centre had asked to report to Delhi on May 31, had brought the Centre-State ties to a new low.

Speaking about the possibility of a mixed dose regime trial, NITI Aayog member (Health) V.K. Paul said: “There is growing scientific interest in the matter world-wide and India too should look into it. This is a biological plausibility and if proven effective it could go a long way in enhancing faster coverage and acting as a better booster dose that can be offered for use.” N.K. Arora, chairperson of the Working Group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, said vaccines were never mixed. “Doses of different vaccine brands are administered as separate doses to complete the schedule. Purpose is improved immune effectiveness, safety and programmatic convenience. This is also called interchangeability. There is no talk of single dose for any vaccine,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-can-look-at-plan-for-vaccine-interchangeability/article34693728.ece

Talking to presspersons after meeting Mr. Shah here, Mr. Faizal said he apprised the Home Minister of the strong opposition to the draft laws proposed by the new administrator, Praful Patel. He said he also told Mr. Shah about the widespread protests on the islands. “He has assured us that whatever laws that are under the consideration, they will be sent to Lakshadweep where local representatives in the district panchayat will be consulted,” Mr. Faizal said.

01 June 2021||Mumbai,||Vaccine fiasco leaves students fuming in Mumbai||Hundreds of students, who thronged the HBT Medical College and Dr. RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital at Juhu on Monday — after Cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted last week that free walk-in vaccinations would be available for students going abroad — had to return disappointed with only limited number of doses available. On May 28, Mr. Thackeray had tweeted that though numbers are small, the career opportunities of students couldn’t be missed. He said BMC has arranged three-day free walk-in vaccination from Monday atRajawadi, Cooper & Kasturba hospitals. However, several students waited for long hours on Monday only to be turned away by the hospitals. Aditi Srivastava, 21, who is scheduled to go to London, recounted her experience. “The time for the vaccination was from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. I reached there around 8 a.m. only to find students waiting there from 5 a.m. There were at least 400 students outside the hospital. There was no line and no one was following any COVID-19 protocol. There was a counter where a lady was verifying documents and and giving a token number. However, within half an hour, it was announced that there were only 50 doses and all were over.” Neeraj Sharma, 22, who is going to U.S., said, “I was told the vaccination drive would start at 10 a.m. at Cooper Hospital so I reached around 8.30 a.m. But after waiting in a long queue outside the hospital for half an hour a lady announced that all doses for the day are over.” Himon Roy Chaudhry, 23, going to Germany, had been in the queue since 7 a.m. but was told to come back the next day at 10 a.m. He said, “There was a lot of confusion and hundreds of students were waiting since 3 a.m., I am told. After waiting for three hours, I was turned away after being told there were only 50 doses and they had been administered.” However, Dean of Cooper Hospital, Dr. Pinakin Gujjur, said there was bound to be chaos without any prior appointment and registration. He said, “We received 50 vials for today and everyone expects to be vaccinated the same day. If there are no appointments and only walk-ins, this was going to happen. We are expecting 300 vials soon.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-fiasco-leaves-students-fuming-in-mumbai/article34693736.ece

01 June 2021||B. Tilak ChandarMadurai,TAMIL NADU||Auto and taxi drivers in dire straits||It is back to square one for drivers of autorickshaws and taxis in Madurai. While they were yet to recover from the financial stress they suffered during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown imposed last year, the present lockdown has made their situation even worse. Even the odd jobs they had undertaken did not click, they say. Some of them took up jobs as security guards and electricians while few others started mobile fruits-and-vegetable shops. But, with the lockdown restrictions imposed this year in view of the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases, they have to give up these jobs as well, they say. They are not only under financial stress, but also under psychological stress. “When the lockdown restrictions were relaxed last year, we were able to pay back the loans and make ends meet,” said K. Pandi, an auto driver. But the second wave of COVID-19 has hit them even harder, he says. “Everything has come to a standstill. I am not able to pay the house rent. I cannot borrow money from friends and relatives as I am yet to pay back the amount I already borrowed,” he says. Another auto driver R. Muthu Mari, who had set up a mobile fruit-and-vegetable shop, has given up on the business as he was unable to make profits. “ I thought that it will ease the financial situation, but the business did not click. I could hardly make any money,” he says. Financial assistance provided by the State is insufficient, they say. Agreeing with him was taxi driver M. Kandasamy. “Many of my friends have sold their vehicles. I sold jewels of my wife and daughter due to the present financial straits,” he says. The lockdown restrictions have been imposed by the State government in view of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and it is important to stay indoors. He hopes that the present situation would improve otherwise they would be pushed to penury.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/auto-and-taxi-drivers-in-dire-straits/article34693954.ece
01 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||With fall in COVID-19 cases, govt. hospitals get a breather||After several weeks, government hospitals in the city have finally got a breather. With the steady fall in fresh coronavirus infections in Chennai, some of the major COVID-19 hospitals have registered a dip in patient inflow — both outpatient and in-patients — over the past four days. For hospital authorities, doctors, staff nurses and hospital workers, the reduction in patient inflow has come as a sigh of relief after hectic weeks. From a time when 250 to 260 ambulances queued up a day, the bays at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) are much clearer now. “We are receiving 114 ambulances per day now. Earlier, at a given point in time, we used to have at least 60 ambulances bringing in patients on the campus,” E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH, said. The hospital’s COVID-19 in-patient census has dropped from 250-270 per day to 100 per day. Similarly, the number of outpatients at the COVID-19 OPD has reduced from 500-700 a day to 250-300 now, he said. “To reduce the number of staff involved in COVID-19 work, patients in lesser occupied wards are moved to wards that have more beds occupied. This way, we can ensure that our manpower resources are conserved. As a result, many of the additional COVID-19 wards opened in other blocks apart from the dedicated COVID-19 facility in Tower-3 are empty now,” he said. In addition, patients who do not require oxygen support and those requiring less than five litres of oxygen are shifted to COVID-19 Care Centres to decongest the main hospital. “With the drop in cases, it is important to speed up vaccination, continue COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and ensure strict enforcement of restrictions in private gatherings,” Dr. Theranirajan said. At the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, dean R. Jayanthi, said the outpatient numbers have reduced upto one-fourth. “We used to receive 500 to 600 outpatients a day earlier. Now, we are seeing around 200 outpatients. The in-patient strength is down by half. From 200 admissions, we have 80 to 100 now,” she said. K. Narayanasamy, director of Government Corona Hospital, said the number of persons requiring oxygen was stable at the hospital. “It will gradually reduce,” he said. The hospital registers 70 to 80 admissions a day now when compared to 110 to 120 admissions earlier. “We have around 100 vacant beds now,” he said. ‘Getting sleep now’ A government doctor, who has been treating COVID-19 patients, said the number of cases have reduced, and they were able to accommodate patients freely. “This is definitely a breather. We are getting some sleep now,” he said. “There has been a significant drop in inflow since last week. Still, we get sick patients, and we still have deaths in the young due to multiple factors,” he said. Dr. Jayanthi said that it was important to keep the infrastructure ready and not dismantle it. “The lessons learnt in these two waves should be kept in mind. People should continue to follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/with-fall-in-covid-19-cases-govt-hospitals-get-a-breather/article34694040.ece
01 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. looks westward as lockdown yields benefits||When the image of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin donning a PPE kit to go into the COVID-19 wards in the western region hit social media, it expectedly spiralled into viral status. His act of walking into the COVID-19 high-dependence units and ICUs where the sicker patients are receiving treatment, despite the advice to the contrary from doctors, brought him praise across the political spectrum, but it was likely planned as more of a confidence-building strategy. With the western districts piping Chennai to the post heading the number of daily cases, Mr. Stalin’s act had a lot of tactical significance too — it would tell the people of the district that the Chief Minister was with them at this very crucial juncture; it would also tell the people and the doctors that he summons the weight of the health machinery to their assistance. Even in the first wave, the trend of the western region falling into the Chennai pattern after a couple of weeks was quite obvious. A similar trend has come to play in the second wave too, except this time the total numbers have shot past the Chennai figures, once the number in the metro began to fall. According to the Union Ministry of Health’s figures, the test positivity rate (the percentage of positive cases among all the tests conducted) for the last one week is the highest in the western region, at 28.6 %, while in the rest of Tamil Nadu it was 17.67%. While the western region accounted for 18% of the daily cases on May 1, it accounted for 35.9% on May 30. While Tamil Nadu’s own figures might point out a more keen difference, the trend is along predictable lines.  Lockdown buys time But working with the spare time that the two-week lockdown provided, and based on the projections of the epidemiological curve, health officials took up a targeted approach in these regions. While efforts were made to nearly double the infrastructure, a localised strategy was employed, with the rural and urban divides and the special requirements of tribal and remote areas and forests factored in. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said the focus is on these regions showing higher daily test rates — and disease containment. Non- compliance with the protocols and low testing rates were noticed in these areas, and “we decided to reset these things.” “While Coimbatore was testing high numbers, we had to ramp it up in the other areas. We are also working with the local governments to ensure that people come in early for testing and treatment, and possible migration within the western region as carrying infections across was also on our radar.” The two-week lockdown has served its purpose of reducing the burden on the healthcare system, says a senior health official. Meanwhile, efforts are on, using the epidemiological projection models to expand and strategise as per the local requirements, he adds. Health officials are hoping to use the next week to put in place a field surveillance, of which goal is to have one person from within the community visit every house in the State every day for a status check. This has been the cornerstone of the Tamil Nadu strategy, while the inspiration was derived from the Chennai model of the focus volunteer and syndromic surveillance, dropping the importance of RT-PCR tests or CT scans. The focus shifted to treating people for their symptoms. Simultaneously, the test-and-treat strategy was also used, with the goal of bringing in people with mild symptoms early for treatment and reducing the dependence on intensive care units, and conservative use of steroids. The strategies have to be different. What works in urban areas will not necessarily work in rural areas; even the messaging needs to be constructed differently. “We are attempting a kind of ring-fencing attack in rural areas, to implement a lockdown there is not very easy. We need to have the populations understand that closing down for a while is for their own benefit,” the official explains. In the west of Tamil Nadu, a variegated landscape will have to be catered to – there’s urban Coimbatore and Tiruppur, agrarian areas in Coimbatore, Namakkal and Salem, hilly and forest regions in the Nilgiris, hardcore rural pockets in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri. Apart from this, there was surge capacity planning from the Unified Command Centre in Chennai, depending on where each district is on the epidemiological curve. The implementation is done by the local body or the district administration, with monitoring assigned to the UCC. The advantages of the lockdown must not be frittered away. Whatever time the State bought with the total lockdown, it must it use effectively. A lockdown cannot last forever, the economic and social impact of it would be prohibitive. Even as the State mulls a slow lifting of restrictions after June 7, it will have to work doubly hard during this week to ensure that whatever gains achieved so far are not surrendered to the subsequent waves of the infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-looks-westward-as-lockdown-yields-benefits/article34694207.ece
01 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK dismisses Sasikala’s talk of return to active politics||The AIADMK on Monday reacted adversely to the audio calls made recently by the party’s former interim general secretary, V.K. Sasikala, to her supporters on her return to active politics. Deputy coordinator K.P. Munusamy said, “There is no link between her and the party. She is no longer in the party. Some persons are propping her up with a view to creating confusion in the AIADMK that is functioning well as the principal Opposition party”. He was responding to questions from journalists at Veppannahalli in Krishnagiri district on Ms. Sasikala’s observations that she would come back soon to run the affairs of the “party”. Social media According to one account of the audio clip that did the rounds on social media in the last few days, she assured her supporter that she would set right the situation in the party and lead it on the path shown by former Chief Minsters M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa. Mr. Munusamy, an MLA now, contended that “not even a single worker” of the AIADMK would heed her words, as “one-and-a-half crore workers and functionaries at various levels are doing their best to safeguard the interests of the party”. He added that “if the soul of Amma [Jayalalithaa] is to rest in peace, it would be better for her [Ms. Sasikala] to stay away [from politics]”. ‘No link with party’ Another AIADMK veteran S. Semmalai said there was no need for her to be concerned about the state of affairs in the party as “she has nothing to do with it”. ‘Sasikala made 125 calls’ He said the leadership had been working “cohesively”. It was learnt that Ms. Sasikala made about 125 such calls during the last one week as she was not in a position to send written replies to letters that she had received from her supporters. A month before the Assembly election in April, Ms. Sasikala announced that she would “step aside” from politics. She did not assign any reason. But during her journey from Bengaluru to Chennai on February 8 and 9 after serving a four-year sentence in a case of corruption, she went on record that she would plunge into politics again. Seat-sharing During the seat-sharing negotiations in late February, the BJP reportedly made an unsuccessful attempt to bring the AMMK, headed by Ms. Sasikala’s nephew T.T.V. Dhinakaran, under the AIADMK-led coalition. 18 seats set aside A former Minister said the idea was to set aside 18 seats for the AMMK, but the camp led by former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was against any accommodation with the AMMK. Eventually, the AMMK contested on its own and did not secure a single seat, but it spoiled the chances of the AIADMK and its allies in 21 constituencies. The AMMK secured 2.35% of the votes polled.  “Not even a single worker” of the AIADMK would heed her words K.P.

01 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||NGT rejects GRT’s review plea on its Mamallapuram resort||The southern bench of the National Green Tribunal dismissed a review application filed by GRT Hotels and Resorts Pvt. Ltd challenging its judgment in April directing the demolition of 1,100 sq. metres of the resort premises at Mamallapuram falling within 0-200 metres of the No Development Zone and imposing an environmental compensation of Rs. 10 crore. The NGT had restrained the resort from using the portion of the hotel in the 200-500 metres high tide line till it was rectified. The company moved the review application claiming that the disputed area did not fall under the CRZ-III but under the CRZ-II where construction activities were permitted towards the land side. The company claimed that some of the construction were made prior to 1991 that were exempted and the compensation of Rs. 10 crore “redefining” the number of days of violations was against the law. The Bench said a joint committee appointed by the tribunal had gone into these issues. Although detailed objections were filed, there was no dispute raised regarding the zone and they [GRT] had even admitted that it was falling under the “no development zone” and had undertaken to demolish the same by themselves,” the Bench said. It was after considering the report and the admission made by the parties that the order was passed. The Bench said it was seen from the documents submitted by the company itself that the environment clearance cum coastal regulation zone clearance was granted for this expansion in 2006 and at that time the relevant CRZ notification was CRZ notification, 1991 and not CRZ notification, 2011 as contended by the applicant. “If the constructions were not permissible under the then existing rules, the review applicant cannot rely upon the subsequent change in the CRZ rules for getting the construction protected.

01 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Check COVID-19 protocols at Renault-Nissan unit, says HC||The Madras High Court on Monday requested Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram to arrange for an inspection of Renault-Nissan automobile manufacturing unit at Oragadam near Chennai, by a senior official from Directorate of Industrial Safety on Tuesday to ascertain whether all necessary COVID-19 protocols had been followed and to mediate between the management and the workers, if necessary. First Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy hoped that the workers too would resume their duties on Tuesday and arrive at some form of solution to the fears expressed by them with regard to safety, after holding necessary talks with the management in the presence of the mediator. Physical distancing The judges also impressed upon the need to follow the physical distancing norms scrupulously. The interim orders were passed on a writ petition filed by the workmen challenging the exemption granted by the State government to automobile industries from the ongoing lockdown. Senior counsel V. Prakash contended that the exemption was unwarranted. He claimed that as many as 145 workmen had tested positive for COVID-19 and a considerable number of them were under hospitalisation. On the other hand, advocate Sanjay Mohan, representing the management, claimed that all safety measures had been put in place and stated that the company was willing to undergo an inspection by government officials concerned. After hearing both sides, the judges said that the dispute between the management and the workmen should be resolved amicably through talks and by putting in place the necessary safety protocol. They also directed the management to disclose the number of workmen who had tested positive for COVID-19 and the number hospitalised when the case gets heard next on June 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/check-covid-19-protocols-at-renault-nissan-unit-says-hc/article34694195.ece

Palaniswami on Monday sent separate letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighting the issues being faced by people on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.

01 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Consumers worried as fuel prices touch historic high||With diesel price crossing Rs. 90 a litre and touching a historic high at many places in the State on Monday, the common man and the transport operators have expressed shock and concern about its cascading effect on the cost of essential commodities. In Tiruchi, a litre of diesel cost Rs. 90.12, in Madurai Rs. 90.48, in Coimbatore Rs. 90.40 and in Sankagiri Rs. 90.34. In Chennai, a litre of diesel cost Rs. 89.90. Last year on May 31, the price was Rs. 68.22, Rs. 79.21 on January 31, 2021 and Rs. 85.75 on May 1. “In one year, there has been an increase of around Rs. 22 a litre. The Centre keeps saying that the increase is due to international crude prices or just keeps quiet. However, it ultimately falls on the common man. We can’t just hike prices since people are suffering, they don’t have any income either. Our businesses too are suffering. The national associations had called for strike but after sometime they have quietened down,” said S. Anandan of OMR Lorry Owners’ Association. Port user Padmanabhan Sambasivam said the government should cut fuel prices. “Ports have given duty concession for medical supplies needed for COVID-19. However, these items need to be moved to various hospitals and the cost of transportation would only be added to the medical supplies. Toll plazas on national highways too add to the cost of transporters,” he said. Purchasing power down T. Sathish Kumar of Balaji Supermarket in Mylapore said that the purchasing power of consumers had come down, especially among those who had lost jobs or had taken pay cuts. R. Seethalakshmi of Thoraipakkam said the government must reduce prices of petrol and diesel. “Due to pay cuts, as a family, we spend only on the essentials. Some families we know are unable to pay the school fees and are thinking of shifting their children to schools that take lower fees. The DMK had promised that it would reduce fuel prices if it came to power. I hope it keeps its word soon,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consumers-worried-as-fuel-prices-touch-historic-high/article34694192.ece
01 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. expecting more vaccines from Centre||Tamil Nadu is expecting vaccine supply from the Union government as its current stock of around five lakh doses will get exhausted by Tuesday, Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian said on Monday. “Tamil Nadu received 83 lakh doses from the Centre. The State government, through its continued efforts, paid Rs. 85.48 crore for 25 lakh doses to vaccinate those aged 18-44. We have so far received 13 lakh doses. Along with the Union government’s supply, we have received 96 lakh doses that were distributed to all districts and being administered. So far, 87 lakh doses have been administered. In the first wave, a wastage of 3% was reported. Now, we have nearly five lakh doses that will be administered today [Monday] and tomorrow [Tuesday] at all places,” he told reporters. The remaining 12 lakh of the 25 lakh doses were expected to arrive soon, he said. 864 beds at CCC The Minister said oxygen-supported beds were being created in urban and rural areas. “As part of this measure, a COVID-19 Care Centre (CCC) was created at Chennai Trade Centre. A total of 864 beds have been brought to use at the CCC. Earlier, 360 beds were readied, of which 300 were oxygen-supported. Now, 504 new beds have been brought to use. Of them, 500 are oxygen-supported. At present, 203 patients are undergoing treatment at the centre,” he said. Across the State, several beds with oxygen concentrators had been set up in urban and rural areas, he said. “The CCC at Chennai Trade Centre is the largest facility where oxygen is supplied through pipelines.” Though the number of fresh COVID-19 cases were coming down, additional beds were being set up as a precautionary measure, he said. More beds were added in districts such as Coimbatore, Tiruppur and Erode. On the charge of under-reporting of deaths, Mr. Subramanian said, “During our visits [to several districts] and meetings with officials, we have stressed that not a single death be hidden. There is no use in hiding a death. People should be informed of the actual number of deaths so that they will be cautious and follow safety norms... The government is functioning transparently, and has no need to under-report deaths.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-expecting-more-vaccines-from-centre/article34694212.ece
01 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘State cannot vaccinate its people until it gets fresh supply’||Tamil Nadu will run out of COVID-19 vaccines in two days and is likely to suspend vaccination services until fresh supply reaches the State, health officials have indicated. “The State has nearly 4.93 lakh doses of vaccines as of now. This will be sufficient for a maximum of two days,” Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said. He said that on Monday, the Centre indicated that it would allocate 42.58 lakh doses of vaccines for Tamil Nadu for June. This was double the number of doses allotted for the month of May. “But the catch is that the first lot of supply through Bharat Biotech is only after June 6, and the other supply is likely on June 9,” he said. Indicating that the State stands the risk of suspending vaccination in the interim period, he said, “We will restart vaccination the moment we get supplies.” While the State had asked for supply from June 1, the Centre said that there were certain supply issues across the country and vaccines could be supplied only gradually. He noted that though vaccination was slow in the initial period in the State, many were keen on getting vaccinated now. “We have asked Collectors to fully utilise the available doses, to bring the services to a common point, issue tokens and administer the vaccines,” he said. The official said that the vaccine stock would turn nil in a number of centres in the State.    A total of 1,62,375 persons were vaccinated across the State on Monday. The State’s overall coverage stood at 89,32,852.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-cannot-vaccinate-its-people-until-it-gets-fresh-supply/article34694211.ece

01 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai teacher accused of harassment||A group of 22 alumni of a school run by the Central government in the city has raised allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against a faculty member. They have submitted a representation to the principal demanding immediate action against him. The school has formed a committee to look into the charges. An alumnus said in the representation that the recent allegations against a teacher of a private school in the city had prompted her to share her experience on social media. Following this, several alumni made similar allegations against the faculty member, a Hindi teacher. The allegations, they said, warranted an immediate impartial inquiry. While one alumnus stated that the faculty member had groped her, a few others said he had touched them inappropriately. “So far, 22 former students, including me, have shared about how he misbehaved with them, many times in full public view. These instances span a time frame of close to 18 years,” the representation read. The alumni expressed concerns that many current students might be too scared to speak out against him. They demanded that the faculty member be suspended immediately and not be allowed to conduct classes or take part in the academic activities. The alumni also asked the school to have a child protection policy and constitute a child protection committee to look into such complaints. Under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the school was bound to report these allegations to the police, they said. The principal said he received the representation on e-mail on Monday and the school formed a committee — comprising three faculty members and an external member — to conduct a preliminary investigation. “If the allegations are found to be true, a subsequent inquiry will be conducted by a team from our regional office,” he said. Saraswathi Rangasamy, chairperson of the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said the commission was aware of the allegations and planned an inquiry. Following allegations of sexual harassment in schools, it has opened inquiries in four city schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alumni-group-alleges-harassment-by-teacher/article34694041.ece

V. Mohan, chairman, Dr. Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre, has appealed to the medical fraternity and the government to declare this June as ‘diabetes control month’.

01 June 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore district registers slight decline in fresh cases, TPR||Coimbatore district has registered a slight decline in the number of new cases of COVID-19 and the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) though it continues to top the State in terms of the daily caseload. A seven-day analysis of cases in the district showed that it was seeing a steady but slow decline of positive cases and TPR. The district had 4,734 positive cases on May 27, which declined to 3,537 on Sunday and 3,488 on Monday. The TRP that was 45.82 on May 24 fell to 33.38 on Sunday. Officials attribute the decline as a result of containment works done by different departments. Strengthening of the containment activities reduced movement of people in areas with more number of COVID-19 cases, they say. According to them, the spread of cases within families and residential complexes resulted in the daily caseload exceeding the 4,000 mark recently. “It was found that many new cases in the second wave were reported from houses and thickly populated areas where patients remained in home isolation,” said an official. During the first wave, such patients were treated at hospitals and chances of spread within the family and neighbourhood reduced, the official added. To save hospital beds for moderate and severe cases, patients with mild symptoms are referred for home isolation in the second wave of the pandemic. Of the 39,194 active cases the district had on Monday, around 29,400 persons were in home isolation as per official data. As of Sunday, 57 % of the total cases reported in the district in seven days were from the Corporation limits, according to the district administration. Corporation limits also had the highest number of containment zones, 710, as of Sunday. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said the containment measures that worked out for the current decline in the trend should be continued with the same vigour. “Cases are declining in most of the districts and in Coimbatore. We assume that the 4,734 cases reported in Coimbatore some days ago could have been the peak. However, the actual trend will be known in the next ten days or so,” he said. S. Senthil Kumar, who assumed office as the Deputy Director Health Services on Saturday, said the Health Department has been working full-fledged to bring down new infections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-district-registers-slight-decline-in-fresh-cases-tpr/article34694221.ece
01 June 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Camera traps fixed to identify elusive animal near Kalapatti||With Forest Department staff and its biologists yet to arrive at a conclusion on the identity of an animal that was sighted by a few residents at Kalapatti in Coimbatore's suburbs, the Forest Department on Monday fixed camera traps for surveillance. The camera traps were fixed at certain areas of Siva Nagar where some persons claimed to have sighted an animal which they had not seen before in the area. Following complaints from residents, the Department had sent a team to the area on May 27 to gather descriptions of the animal from those who claimed to have seen it and also to study the footprints. The team arrived at a conclusion that it could be a jungle cat. However, senior officials of the Department who differed with the finding and sought the opinion of biologists. Some of the biologists opined that the footprint looked like that of a hyena. They also felt that the footprint had an overlap due to which confirming the identity was difficult. Certain pockets of Sirumugai forest range in Coimbatore district, around 45 km from Kalapatti, and the adjoining Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve in Erode district are the nearest forest areas where hyenas are found. Considering all these factors, the Forest Department decided to fix camera traps to identify the animal. N. Rangarajan from Siva Nagar said that his tenant Mani sighted the animal around 10.30 p.m. on Sunday behind the house. “According to his description, it was not a dog,” he said. Assistant Conservator of Forests M. Senthil Kumar said that a few residents have complained that chicken had gone missing. He said that the visuals from the camera traps will be relied on to confirm the identity of the animal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/camera-traps-fixed-to-identify-elusive-animal-near-kalapatti/article34693897.ece
01 June 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘Don’t discriminate PDS card holders in relief distribution’||In distributing COVID-19 relief of Rs. 4,000 do not discriminate among Public Distribution System (ration) card holders, the Coimbatore Consumer Cause has urged the State government. In a letter to the Chief Minister, the consumer bod’s Secretary K. Kathirmathiyon said it could not find a reason why the government discriminated among rice, sugar or no-commodity card holders when everybody was affected by COVID-19. The choice was only for the type of commodity that the card holders wanted and therefore, it was wrong to provide relief to only rice card holders. He further said that the government would also do well to enhance the COVID-19 relief to families falling in the ‘below poverty line’ category or the well-deserving category like auto rickshaw drivers, pushcart vendors, daily wage earners among others. While doing so, the government could also consider withdrawing the relief to its employees, teachers, Central government employees, employees of State and Central public sector undertakings, private sector employees falling under the high net worth individuals, MLAs and MPs, income tax payers and government pensioners. Of the 2.14 crore tax payers in the State, the people falling under the aforementioned categories constituted a significant number, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said. As a first step, the government should start preparing database of people falling under the aforementioned categories and if the relief was withdrawn to those category card holders it would enable to it increase the relief to those in the deserving category, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dont-discriminate-pds-card-holders-in-relief-distribution/article34693903.ece

The Minister was in the town to dedicate a 100-bed COVID Care Centre at the Government Boys Higher Secondary School campus for which the Rotary Club of Palani and the Chamber of Commerce had jointly donated Rs. 30 lakh. The oxygen beds should be a boon to the local people as they need not travel to Dindigul Government Hospital, he said. Series of steps taken by the Government including the total lockdown had helped in reduction of positivity rate over the last four to six days. However, Mr Chakarapani said that the people should remain indoors, which alone would help prevent the spread of the virus. “The government or the officials alone cannot bring about any drastic reduction in the number of patients inflicted with the virus. It is the people who have to support the official machinery”, he stressed. The Minister said that he would hold discussions with the HR&CE Minister Sekar Babu on the modalities to establish a mega oxygen generation plant at a cost of Rs. 2 crore. This, he said, should be able to meet the demand not only of the district, but even neighbouring districts. The Palani Government Hospital has 207 beds and out of which 150 beds have been exclusively earmarked for COVID-19 patients.

Once the water was saved in the tanks, officials from the Agriculture department swung into action. Inviting the farmers was accorded top priority. When they assembled, the Collector interacted with them and encouraged them to take up a second crop as they have copious water in storage. Slowly, the interactions appeared to have borne fruit as many farmers have come forward to go for a second crop. Arid Ramanathapuram district is witnessing a change. Now, there is green cover in remote villages due to the presence of ater bodies and awareness programmes on water conservation. The district has 1,694 tanks - 502 PWD tanks and minor irrigation tanks. Mr. Dinesh wants to transform the arid district into a place with potential for raising multi-crops. Encouraged by government subsidy, 2,214 farmers cultivated 2,766 acres against the targeted 5,000 acres, raising cotton, millets and other crops. The farmers were encouraged to shift from conventional paddy to other varieties which required less water for irrigation. With a majority of the farmers having harvested their crops, Mr. Dinesh visited Achunthanvayal and commended the farmers, and also officials led by Joint Director Tom Sylus and Additional Collector M. Pradeep Kumar for their guidance. Good storage In January, against the normal rainfall of 48.5 mm, the district received 248.74 mm. As a result, Big Tank had 3.6 feet additional water (206 mcft), R.S. Mangalam Tank had eight feet of water (599.38 mcft) and Kalari Tank 9.8 ft of water (256 mcft). The farmers produced 9,400 quintals of different types of grains and cotton. On an average, they would have earned Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 15,000 each from the second crop. Attributing the success to the team work and support from farmers, Mr. Dinesh exuded confidence that they would repeat the performance next season also but with a higher target.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rainwater-stored-in-tanks-helps-farmers-in-ramanathapuram/article34693960.ece

Radhakrishnan said. Inspecting the vaccination camps organised at Paeyanvilai, Paramankurichi, Nazareth and Kurangani along with District Collector K. Senthil Raj on Monday, Mr. Radhakrishnan said all-out steps had been taken to take the vaccination rate to the maximum possible level which was the only available option to check the spread of COVID-19. “Since, the vaccines are safe and are instrumental in preventing the viral infection or saving the individual with minimum effects of viral disease, the people should get vaccinated at the earliest,” he said. Besides getting screened for the viral infection in case of any symptoms, people in rural areas should get vaccinated, he urged. The Minister appealed to the public to wear masks while coming out of their houses and to maintain physical distancing. He also inspected an irrigation tank at Kaayaamozhi and asked the officials to remove the encroachments and start desilting work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plan-afoot-to-vaccinate-10000-persons-a-day-in-thoothukudi/article34694325.ece
01 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Integrated bus stand project stirs to life||Tiruchi Corporation has sent a proposal to the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration (CMA) seeking appointment of a consultant to study the feasibility for establishing an integrated bus stand at Panchapur on Tiruchi-Madurai Highway. The move comes after Minister for Municipal Administration K.N. Nehru visited the place and held detailed discussion with Collector S. Sivarasu and Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian a few days ago. During the discussion, Mr. Nehru told the officials to allot at least 100 acres out of 560 acres of land owned by Tiruchi Corporation at Panchapur for establishing the bus stand. The proposal for an integrated bus stand has been hanging fire for over two decades due to a stalemate over identifying a suitable site. The existing central bus stand has become congested and struggles to handle the increasing traffic of buses and passengers. Mr. Nehru felt that Panchapur was ideally suited to set up the integrated bus stand as it was not only located on Tiruchi-Madurai Highway but also had good connectivity to five highways so as to operate buses to various destinations in the State. Mr. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that a consultant would be appointed to study the feasibility of establishing the bus stand. The consultant would be asked to analyse various aspects including soil condition, drinking water availability, adaptability and opportunities for future expansion. After clearance from CMA, a tender would be floated for appointing the consultant. The civic body chief said the consultant would also be given the responsibility of preparing a Detailed Project Report. A clear picture would emerge shortly. Meanwhile, sources said corporation authorities had begun consultation on identifying the land required for the project. Though there were no issues on allocating 100 acres as the civic body had more than four times the land required for the project, it should be done without affecting the sewage treatment plant at Panchapur. A vast tract of land was under use for discharging and processing the sewage collected from different parts of the city for more than 20 years. The STP was established in 1995 as part of phase-I underground drainage project. The Corporation had started works to revamp the STP to bring the unused land for processing the sewage collected under phase-II underground drainage project, which was under progress in different parts of the city. Sources added that there was scope for remodeling or reinstalling the STP to a remote location so as to provide land for the bus stand project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/integrated-bus-stand-project-stirs-to-life/article34694360.ece
01 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||A wave that wiped out their livelihood||More and more shops are displaying the board “for sale”, “to-let” boards during the second wave of COVID 19 as the small-time traders seem to be giving up hope on their business. Many appear to have wilted under the burden of paying the rent and statutory benefits like ESI and provident fund to their employees, besides other overheads. “There seemed to be a little space for sustenance until we were permitted to keep our shops open for a few hours in a day. The complete lockdown has broken our back,” said Selvaraj, a trader in hardware in Ariyamangalam in Tiruchi. “We have exhausted all means, including pledging of jewellery for remaining afloat so far. All doors are now shut for us,” said Sahayam, a trader in electrical and electronics goods. A number of two-wheeler and four-wheeler showrooms in the city have delayed payment of salaries, a manager of one such showroom said requesting anonymity. Customers in the private sector, who have availed the option of bank loan for hire purchase, have been finding it tough to pay instalments because of salary cuts and joblessness, he said. “The going has indeed become tough for many. The rent in a number of new shopping complexes is being levied on square foot basis. For grocery outlets, pharmacies, and vegetable/fruit shops, the business has taken a severe beating for months together,” Tamilselvan, zonal president of Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peramaippu said. The likelihood for the financially-battered traders to restart their livelihood even after the lockdown is lifted seems bleak, Mr. Tamilselvan said. The hardship is manageable for those who operate from the shopping complexes owned by local bodies and temples. “Private landlords have not been lenient enough during the crisis situation. They continue to charge the same rent,” said A. Muthaiya, president of Karaikal Chamber of Commerce.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-wave-that-wiped-out-their-livelihood/article34694197.ece

01 June 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Plumbers, electricians seek permission to attend to urgent calls||Plumbers and electricians have urged the government to permit them to ply their trade during the lockdown as the current restrictions have not only stifled their income but also put many of their customers into hardship. “Almost every member of our society is getting at least half-a-dozen calls every day from regular clients seeking urgent repairs to electrical or plumbing faults. But given the strict lockdown, which constrict our movement, we are not able to extend our services,” says V. Murugesan, Tiruchi District Electricians, Plumbers and Rewinders Society. Mr. Murugesan says plumbers and electricians are often prevented by police to attend to calls. “Yesterday, one of our members from Ariyamangalam was intercepted by the police near Town Station and his motorcycle was seized. The youngster, who was going to attend electric failure in a medical store, had to return and that too by foot to his home.” Some plumbers and electricians also claim that they have been receiving frantic calls from their customers to attend to urgent complaints such as break down in water motors, broken pipes and faults in electrical lines at their homes. Claiming that plumbers and electricians with identity cards issued by their society were allowed to attend calls in the city during the lockdown last year following a representation to the district authorities, Mr. Murugesan suggests that a similar approach be adopted now too. “We have issued identity cards and even T-shirts and police can allow plumbers/electricians carrying identity cards,” he says. With many of the plumbers and electricians being daily wage earners, the lockdown has also dried up their income. Many are sole bread winners in their families. “Apart from the hardship faced by our customers, we are also going jobless. We should be allowed to attend to urgent works. If there is further extensions of lockdowns, we will be in deeper mess,” observes Guru, a plumber.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plumbers-electricians-seek-permission-to-attend-to-urgent-calls/article34694364.ece

Six out of the seven doctors selected for the post of General Duty Medical Officers at the railway hospital joined duty recently and were carrying out the assigned task in shifts. The seventh doctor is expected to join soon. The move to engage contract medical practitioners at the railway hospital, over and above the sanctioned strength, was done in view of the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in Tiruchi. The medical practitioners selected on contract basis were assisting regular doctors deployed for COVID-19 duty in shifts, said a senior railway officer. The medical team along with para-medical staff worked in shifts of six hour duration to treat COVID-19 patients at the hospital situated in Ponmalai. The engagement of contract medical practitioners was for a temporary period up to March 31 or till the COVID-19 pandemic continued, whichever was earlier. The officer said 55 COVID-19 patients were undergoing treatment at the exclusive ward created for them on the ground floor of the railway hospital. All 55 beds meant for COVID-19 patients were equipped with oxygen supply with refilling of liquid medical oxygen being done every alternative day. The railway hospital was also equipped with a 1,000-litre liquid oxygen tank, which was set up during the pandemic period in June last year. The officer said the hospital did not face deficiency in oxygen supply at present. There were also about 25 to 30 non-COVID patients who were undergoing treatment for different ailments at the railway hospital. COVID Care Centre A railway medical team had been deployed separately at the Multi Disciplinary Zonal Training Institute of Southern Railway located near the Tiruchi railway junction where a COVID Care Centre was opened exclusively for railway employees and their dependents who had tested positive for the viral infection.

The drive, which was flagged off a week ago, gained momentum over the past three days. The inoculation was done through 22 centres.

01 June 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Centre likely to respond in 10 days to plea for vaccine complex lease: Thennarasu||The Union government is likely to take a decision in 10 days on leasing out the Integrated Vaccine Complex in Chengalpattu to the Tamil Nadu government, Minister for Industries Thangam Thennarasu has said. The complex, in which the Union government has invested over Rs. 700 crore through HLL Biotech Limited under the Ministry of Health, has been lying idle for several years. Hence, Tamil Nadu wants to use it for making COVID-19 vaccines, for the procurement of which it has floated global tenders. If this facility is handed over to Tamil Nadu with operational freedom, the State hopes to choose a private partner for starting up on production. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Mr. Thennarasu said DMK MP T.R. Baalu and he had met Union Minister for Industries and Commerce Piyush Goyal in New Delhi recently, following up on Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s request to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Union government’s reply was expected in 10 days, he said. He said Sterlite Copper’s second oxygen plant was likely to generate 24 tonnes of medical-grade oxygen in a couple of days. This would further strengthen supplies to hospitals across the State. Oxygen generation would start at a defunct factory at the SIPCOT Industrial Promotion Centre at Gangaikondan with over 80% of the work having been completed. The Minister reiterated that there was no shortage of vaccines which were used properly. ‘Under consideration’ Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said he was looking into the request for the utilisation of King’s Institute, Chennai; the Integrated Vaccine Complex, Chengapattu; and Pasteur Institute, Coonoor, for the manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. “I am having the matter looked into and shall revert soon,” he said in a letter to DMK MP P. Wilson, who had made the request.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-likely-to-respond-in-10-days-to-plea-for-vaccine-complex-lease-thennarasu/article34694205.ece

01 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No plan yet for government school students||With the current academic year likely to be disrupted by the third wave of COVID-19 infection — where children are feared to be at risk — schools are unlikely to resume classes on campus till the end of the year. While private school managements started online classes last week, the same cannot be said for government schools. The State has yet to chalk out a concrete learning plan for government school students for the 2021-2022 academic year. The government had decided to form an expert committee to frame guidelines for the 2021-22 academic year, and alternative teaching modules for both online and offline classes. However, sources in the department said that the State government is yet to finalise the members on the committee. During the 2020-2021 academic year, a handful of government schools, on their own initiative, conducted online classes for their students. However, the majority were unable to devise any plan to conduct online classes as students did not have access to laptops or stable internet connectivity and power supply, especially in rural areas. Even among the government school students that started online classes, a large number of students were unable to attend them. A government school headmaster in Bengaluru North said, “Even though we tried to conduct online classes, many students did not have access to smartphones or laptops. We had a daily attendance of less than 40% every day. During the 2020-2021 academic year, the only time students were able to grasp concepts was when the Vidyagama programme was conducted between July and October 2020.” The Vidyagama programme was launched so that government school students could attend classes in small groups in open spaces in their neighbourhoods. The programme was stopped as there were allegations that students and teachers contracted COVID-19 while attending these classes. Karnataka Primary School Teachers' Association president Basavaraj Gurikar said that it was not feasible to conduct online classes for government school students. “Alternative arrangements must be made for students enrolled kkn government schools as many of them do not have access to gadgets as well as the internet. There is a need to devise ways in which students can benefit academically,” he said. Niranjanaradhya V.P., a senior fellow at the Centre for Child and Law, National Law School of India University, suggested education officials draw up plans for different scenarios. “Rather than waking up late in the academic year, the government should consider reopening classes in a phased manner with very few students attending classes every few months,” he said. When contacted an official with the Department of Public Instruction said they are yet to take a call on the learning strategies for this academic year. Many parents, especially in urban areas, have urged the government to adopt a blended teaching approach. “Whenever possible, schools can conduct classes taking all the precautions possible, as well as give worksheets and study material that students can work on during their free time,” said Radha S. a domestic worker whose daughter is enrolled in a government school in Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-plan-yet-for-government-school-students/article34693838.ece
01 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||FCRA regulations make bringing in foreign aid onerous||Vinay Kumar, a patent consultant from Bengaluru who has been raising funds to provide COVID-19 relief material to remote areas in the country, has pledges to the tune of €50,000, but is finding it a nightmare to get the money into the country. The problems that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and registered organisations are facing due to the strict regulations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2010, are magnified when individuals like him attempt to channel international funds into the country. “It is almost impossible for an individual to bring foreign funds even if it is readily available,” he said in frustration. He had to partner with a German NGO. “They have never met me in person and it was a partnership based on trust. The NGO had to purchase everything there and send it to India as a ‘gift’, for which I had to pay the GST,” he said, stressing the need for special relaxations in order to put the funds raised abroad to good use here. It was only earlier this month that the FCRA Wing, Foreigners Division, Ministry of Home Affairs, introduced some relaxations to the stringent rules and announced its decision to extend the validity of registration certificates for NGOs till September 30. But this does not help private citizens who wish to bring in foreign aid. They still have to route it through an FCRA-compliant NGO. The Centre also issued a public notice stating that existing FCRA account holders would have to open an ‘FCRA account’ in the New Delhi main branch of the State Bank of India by June 30. Foreign contributions cannot be accepted in any account other than the FCRA account after July 1. Ali Mohammed Sharieff, who runs Lifeline Foundation and is also part of Mercy Mission, pointed out that many NGOs who are taking up relief work on the ground do not have FCRA registration. “Even if the funds are received by an organisation with FCRA registration, they cannot be used to engage another NGO to do the work. This is resulting in major implementation issues.” Organisations wary Many organisations that are involved in pandemic management in Bengaluru have decided not to accept funds from anyone who is not an Indian citizen, including those who are holders of Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) card and from Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), who are residents of the city. According to a representative of a residents’ collective, though many people have approached them to donate funds, they have been declining the offers. “We have been asking them to find an organisation with FCRA clearance and donate there,” the representative said. An OCI card-holder and long-time Bengaluru resident, who spoke to The Hindu on the condition of anonymity, is among those who have been able to donate only to large charitable organisations that have FCRA registration. “OCI residents, despite having PAN and Aadhaar cards, cannot donate money to smaller NGOs that are working on the ground,” he said. To work around this issue, manyOCI holders and PIOs have donated small amounts to individuals. For instance, during the migrant crisis, which was precipitated by the national lockdown last year, he donated small amounts of money directly to labourers who were going back to their home towns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fcra-regulations-make-bringing-in-foreign-aid-onerous/article34693843.ece
01 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Start vaccinating children at the earliest, recommends TAC||With the third wave of COVID-19 expected in October-November likely to hit children in greater proportion, the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has recommended that Karnataka immediately write to the Centre seeking vaccines for use in children from manufacturers such as Pfizer. Members of the TAC, who at a meeting on Sunday deliberated on how the State should prepare itself for the next wave, said Karnataka should, on priority, seek from the Centre vaccines recommended for use in children and start vaccinating this vulnerable population at the earliest. Increased mortality The ongoing second wave is expected to recede by the end of June. Between the first and second waves, there has been a 4% increase in mortality and 43% rise in the number of cases in the 0-9 age group. In the 10-19 age group, a 6% increase in mortality and 60% rise in number of cases has been recorded. “With vaccination for age groups of 18-44 and 45 and above being taken up, children will be most vulnerable to the infection during the third wave. In the wake of this, the TAC in consultation with the paediatric experts’ group set up by the State for the third wave has recommended that the State should on priority seek vaccines for children,” sources said. Sources said TAC members on Sunday deliberated in detail the current data of COVID-19 disease, testing, vaccination, the State’s first and second seroprevalence surveys, waning immunity in infected individuals, reinfections, mobility in the districts despite restrictions and lack of COVID-19 appropriate behaviour in the population. ‘Not to be ignored’ Despite the TAC cautioning the government on November 30 about the need to ramp up facilities and be prepared to tackle the second wave, the State was ill-prepared. The State should not ignore experts’ recommendations this time, sources asserted. According to the report on recommendations for the third wave, a copy of which is with The Hindu , as the next wave of COVID-19 in the State is expected during October-November, the intervening period of four months should be used to ramp up clinical facilities, training and deployment of human resources, and fulfilling other related requirements. “Special attention should be paid towards meeting the requirements of facilities for clinical management of COVID-19 in children at the Community Health Centres, taluk and district levels. As parents may act as caregivers in the hospitals, this should be factored in the planning for things like PPE kits, N-95 masks, resting facilities in the hospitals, among others,” the report stated. Besides, sampling for genomic sequencing (for variants of virus) and serology (anti-COVID-19 antibodies) from children should be started immediately. Vulnerable categories in the age group of 18-44, particularly parents of schoolgoing children, should be vaccinated on priority, the report added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/start-vaccinating-children-at-the-earliest-recommends-tac/article34693865.ece
01 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Priority for students going abroad||Students who have secured admission in colleges or universities abroad, as well as those who want to travel to other countries for work, will be vaccinated on priority basis from June 1. The National Health Mission has revised the list of preferential groups for vaccination by adding four more groups: students going to foreign countries to pursue studies, those who want to travel outside the country for employment, workers of milk co-operative societies and cable operators. The decision to include students who want to go abroad as part of this list was taken based on the suggestion given by Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who also heads the State COVID-19 task force. The Minister, in a press release, said those who want to get the jab should have a visa, admission receipts, or any such relevant documents. They will be administered Covishield. As many students plan to travel abroad as early as July, the gap between the first and second dose of Covishield has been relaxed. They can get the second dose even before completing six weeks. The Central government has extended the gap between two doses to minimum 12 weeks for other citizens. The vaccination campaign for students going to foreign countries to pursue their studies and those who need to travel to get employed in other countries will begin on June 1 at 3 p.m. at the Administrative block of Bengaluru Central University, Dr. Ashwath Narayan said. They will also be given certificates on the spot confirming that they have been vaccinated. The Chief Commissioner of BBMP and Deputy Commissioners of all districts have been asked to issue the necessary eligibility certificates to these categories after verifying their documents. The move has come as a huge relief to students who are waiting to get vaccinated before they go abroad for higher education. Hitesh Ananada, who will go to the USA in the last week of July to pursue Masters in civil engineering, had taken his first dose on May 22. “Reducing the gap between two doses will help me as I have to leave India during the end of July.” However, a student residing outside Bengaluru asked for clarity on whether they can show their admission letter and get vaccinated in their respective districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/priority-for-students-going-abroad/article34693834.ece
01 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Psychiatrist arrested for stealing, selling newborn||A year after a newborn baby boy was stolen from a maternity hospital in Chamarajpet , the police cracked the case and arrested a 34-year-old psychiatrist from a private hospital for allegedly stealing the baby and selling it to a woman for Rs. 15 lakh. The accused, Rashmi, was caught after a painstaking investigation by a team of police led by PSI Srinivas K.R., who analysed over 30,000 calls from the nearest tower before zeroing in on the accused. Investigations revealed that Dr. Rashmi had taken Rs. 15 lakh from Anupama, who was consulting her since a year. The police said Dr. Rashmi convinced Anupama that she would get her baby through surrogacy, but could not arrange for one and lied to Anupama and even gave the delivery date of May 28, 2020. When the delivery date approached, Dr. Rashmi went around the hospital and zeroed in on Husna Banu, who had delivered a baby boy two hours ago. She walked into the hospital as a doctor and walked away with the baby. The special team of police, with the help of the security guard and an autorickshaw driver, got the sketch of the suspect and circulated it, while focussing on the technical evidence. Dr. Rashmi had called Anupama that she is coming with the baby to hand it over to her as soon as she had stolen it. That was the clue which helped the police to track her down. She also told Anupama that the woman died due to delivery complications. Dr. Rashmi had huge loans, including money borrowed from her relatives in Belagavi, which she returned, the police said. The baby has been traced and rescued and it will be handed over to the parents, the police said, adding that Anupama is being questioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/psychiatrist-arrested-for-stealing-selling-newborn/article34693828.ece
01 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State puts aerial spraying of disinfectants on hold||The pilot project of aerial spraying of disinfectants, to be taken up in two different parts of the city on Monday, was launched amidst much fanfare. However, the project has now been put on hold after environmental and health concerns were raised. On Saturday, Minister for Revenue R. Ashok announced the aerial spraying project by Aerialworks Aero LLP as a means to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Over three days, the aerial spraying of organic disinfectant was to be taken up in Shivajinagar and K.R. Market areas that are thickly populated and congested. After the launch, he said the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board would study the efficacy of the initiative. He also said that the government was not paying for the project, which if successful, would be extended to other parts of the city. Confirming that the pilot had been called off, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta told The Hindu that several environmental and health concerns could arise. “We need to thoroughly study the negative ramifications of such spraying before going ahead with the project. The company approached us seeking permission for an experimental flight, which was allowed. However, after consultations with various stakeholders, a decision was taken to put the project on hold until all the public health and environmental issues are studied,” he said. He also said that while the civic body had sprayed disinfectants using jetting machines and sprayers in the past, it had been proven that the novel coronavirus spreads more through contact. This is why the State government and BBMP have both been urging citizens to follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour of wearing masks, maintaining social-distance and washing/sanitising hands frequently. Capt. Murali Ramakrishna, chief pilot, Aerialworks Aero LLP, dismissed many of the allegations levelled against the pilot. He said the solutions – Airlens Minus Corona and Sugaradhana Organic Antomicrobial concentrate - used to spray were safe and had been certified as being so by ICMR and AYUSH.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-puts-aerial-spraying-of-disinfectants-on-hold/article34693841.ece

Yediyurappa to provide vaccination to their family members, given the high risk of infection they face. They have also demanded the recruitment of more nurses to overcome the current shortage, the release of risk allowance, and the provision of mutual consultations during night shifts. Mr. Yediyurappa on Monday held an hour-long virtual conference with staff nurses of nearly a dozen hospitals and appreciated their tireless, round-the-clock efforts.

Noting the death of six nurses owing to COVID-19, Mr. Yediyurappa said an insurance of Rs. 50 lakh would be provided to the family members of the deceased nurses under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package, an insurance scheme for health workers fighting COVID-19. The amount has been paid in three cases and efforts will be made to release the insurance amount in three other cases, he added. The Chief Minister also assured the nurses of providing training and self-protective items such as PPE kits, gloves, masks, face shields, hand sanitizers, and other essentials for discharging their duties during the pandemic. Speaking to him, Vaheeda of Wenlock District Hospital, Mangaluru, urged the government to provide vaccination facility for all their family members.

Deve Gowda was catapulted from Karnataka politics to the national arena after a fractured mandate in the 1996 general elections. He came as a surprise choice to head the 13-party United Front government, supported by the Congress. A relatively unknown political face outside Karnataka back then, Mr. Gowda became the 13th Prime Minister on June 1, 1996, after the fall of the 13-day first NDA government led by Atal Behari Vajpayee. Tuesday marks the 25th anniversary of the swearing in of Mr. Gowda as the Prime Minister. He remained in power for 10 months and 22 days. Excerpts from the interview with The Hindu . You headed a coalition of 13 parties. Do you see the return of a similar coalition government now? There are strong leaders with individual strengths such as Mamata Bannerjee, M.K. Stalin, Naveen Patnaik and Arvind Kejriwal. The BJP did whatever it could do in West Bengal, but Ms. Mamata proved to be among the strongest leaders. I do not know what political compulsions will bring them together. We cannot predict what will happen. Who is there with the BJP now? Shiv Sena and Akali Dal have also left them. Faith in the Congress on forming coalitions with its support has eroded.  How do you see the current political climate? We hear BJP is reviewing why they suffered in the elections in five States. The adamant attitude not to repeal three farm laws  has eroded their popularity in Northern states. The by-election results for parliamentary seats are an indicator. If the situation is reviewed State-wise, BJP is in difficulty unless it takes some radical steps. I assume that they have experience to rectify whatever damage has happened. Image builders say Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the strongest leader in the world. On the other hand, several Congress leaders are not showing the spirit to fight.  What do you think were high points of your tenure? I was the first Prime Minister to visit Jammu and Kashmir in nine years and elections were initiated during my tenure. India signed treaties on border issues with China, talks with Pakistan were under way to bring peace and the water dispute with Bangladesh was addressed. Problems affecting the Narmada project were cleared and several projects in the North East were cleared. Projects like Delhi Metro, Koodankulam nuclear plant, telecom policy and civil aviation policy were launched to name a few. Do you still feel bad that your tenure was too short? I do not have any regrets. When I assumed power, 2,800 files were pending on my table. I had cleared all files by the time I exited. There have been no allegations against me. My government showed development is possible  in a coalition. International and inter-State issues were addressed. As the son of an ordinary farmer and without knowledge of Hindi, I managed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-is-in-difficulty-unless-it-takes-some-radical-steps/article34693854.ece

01 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Decision on extension of curbs will be made on scientific basis’||With still a week to go to end the lockdown in Karnataka, Health and Family Welfare Minister K. Sudhakar on Monday said a decision on extending it beyond June 7 will be taken on a “scientific basis” as it is aimed at saving peoples’ lives. The Minister, who received the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) report on Monday, said a final decision would be taken by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa after examining the report from experts and discussing the matter with Cabinet colleagues. The lockdown was extended in different phases from April 27. “Lockdown or unlocking is linked to the medical aspect and its consequences on human life during the pandemic has to be understood. Decisions have to be made carefully,” he said. Speaking to presspersons, Dr. Sudhakar said: “I am of the view that talking about extending the lockdown without understanding it technically or not considering experts’ opinion is not relevant... If we are not cautious, we have seen what may happen.” Responding to a question on several Ministers expressing different opinions on extending the lockdown, with some in favour and some against it, Dr. Sudhakar said: “As Health Minister, it is my duty to bring factual position to their notice as they may be unaware of the TAC recommendation. Ministers might have issued statements based on the grievances expressed by the general public after experiencing difficulty during the lockdown.” While Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekar in Mysuru said the lockdown would not be extended as the number of cases was declining, Revenue Minister R. Ashok said the lockdown would be eased in a phased manner. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai hinted about extending the lockdown till cases fall below 5,000 per day in the State. After a virtual meeting with nurses of government hospitals, Mr. Yediyurappa told mediapersons that he would discuss issues related to lockdown with experts on June 4 or 5 and take a decision.  Ministers may have issued statements based on grievances of public after experiencing difficulty during the lockdown. K.

Multispecialty Hospital issued a statement saying that the alleged audio clip aims to defame the hospital and the MLA of Basavanagudi. The hospital has termed the clip as ‘maliciously concocted’. The hospital has clarified that the vaccination drive in the hospital is an independent activity and the MLA has no connection with it. “The vaccines are procured by the hospital and are administered to people by charging government prescribed rates,” reads the statement. The hospital has decided to file a criminal case against the person involved in “mischievous and criminal act”. After the audio clip went viral on social media, the Congress had accused the BJP MLA of being involved in ‘vaccination commission scam’.

01 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Students to get vaccine before examinations?||The Department of Primary and Secondary Education will examine the possibility of vaccinating second pre-university (II PU) students before conducting the examinations. However, this may pose a challenge as most II PU students are 17 years old, and the vaccine is available only for those who are above the age of 18. S. Suresh Kumar, Primary and Secondary Education Minister, said that they had received the recommendation from experts. “We will take a decision about vaccinating students appearing for II PU examinations after discussing it with Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar," he said. The department has postponed the examinations, which were scheduled to begin on May 24, due to the rise in COVID-19 cases during the second wave. No decision has been taken regarding the revised examination schedule or how the examinations would be conducted. Meanwhile, Mr. Kumar consulted various MLCs elected from graduate constituencies and teachers’ constituencies to deliberate upon what help can be extended to private school teachers who have lost their jobs or faced salary cuts. “We have chalked out a budget of how much money we can get from different departments,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-to-get-vaccine-before-examinations/article34693836.ece
01 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vinay Kulkarni denied bail for second time||The High Court of Karnataka has rejected for the second time the plea for bail filed by former Minister Vinay R. Kulkarni in the murder of a BJP leader, while observing that “if Mr. Kulkarni is is released on bail, he will certainly tamper with all the witnesses and obstruct the fair trial against him”. The court said he is not entitled to be enlarged in bail going by his past conduct of “tampering of the witnesses, influencing the police officer, changing the public prosecutor, diverting the police and investigation by ensuring surrendering of some other persons as culprits, threatening the wife of the deceased... and paying Rs. 20 lakh to her besides assuring her a post in the Congress party...” Justice K. Natarajan made these observations in the order of dismissing Mr. Kulkarni’s bail petition. He was arrested by the CBI last year in the case of murder of Yogishgouda Goudar, a zilla panchayat member in Dharwad representing the BJP. “The investigation also revealed that the petitioner by using his influence as district in charge Minister interfered with the investigation. He paid Rs. 2 lakh to the investigating officer for tampering the witnesses and to file false chargesheet against accused number one to six, and also not to investigate the matter effectively,” the court noted from material produced by the CBI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vinay-kulkarni-denied-bail-for-second-time/article34693861.ece

The money was transferred online to the account by a woman who was desperate to purchase a drug to treat black fungus. The complainant, a working woman, admitted her 65-year-old father to a private hospital three days ago after he was diagnosed with black fungus infection. The doctors asked her to arrange for Amphotericin B injection, which is in high demand but not easily available. The doctor shared a contact number of a person, which he reportedly got from a WhatsApp group. The woman called the person who claimed to be a pharmacist.

The former Minister, who took part in the distribution of food kits and other relief materials and heard the grievances of farmers at Amaragol village, told presspersons that the State government was least bothered about the plight of farmers and commoners who have been hit hard by the lockdown. “The government has given just two hours in the district for farmers to sell vegetables, while it has given more time for the sale of liquor. Does this government have eyes and a heart?” he asked. To a query, he said the decision on extending the lockdown was the discretion of the State government and if his opinion or suggestion were asked, he would convey it to the government. During the interaction with Mr. Shivakumar, farmers complained that they were not being allowed to sell vegetables and that the police were imposing restrictions.

01 June 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||61-day fishing holiday starts today in three coastal dists||The 61-day annual deep sea fishing ban will come into effect in the coastal districts on June 1. The main objective of banning deep sea fishing during June and July is to protect fish wealth as commercially important species breed during this period. It is to prevent juveniles fishing and also excessive fishing. Accordingly, mechanised boats and traditional boats fitted with inboard or outboard engines of 10 HP and above are banned from carrying out fishing activities till July 31. However, fishing boats fitted with engines of up to 10 HP will be allowed to carry out fishing during the period. Last year, the government had reduced the deep sea fishing ban period in the coastal districts from the usual 61 days to 47 days effective from June 15 to July 31. It was in view of hardship faced by fishermen due to the lockdown and COVID-19 situation. Hence, fishermen had been given an extra fortnight’s time to carry out deep sea fishing. Mangaluru Trawl Boat Owners Association president Nitin Kumar told The Hindu that like other sectors, fisheries too has been hit hard due to COVID-19 and lockdown. Deep sea fishing activities in the State came to a halt for three months, from June to August, last year. Though fishing resumed in September, it had to be abandoned for a few days after September 15 due to cyclone. Though fishing resumed in late October, catch was meagre. “It was not even 50% of the usual catch,” he said. Many of the 800 to 900 trawl boats (that are involved in deep sea fishing beyond 15 km-20 km from the coast) in Mangaluru did not sail out for fishing due to hike in diesel prices, meagre catch and labour issue. It was same in the case of Purseine boats that sail out for fishing up to 15 km-20 km. “Only about 50 trawl boats were sailing out in Mangaluru after November,” Mr. Kumar, who is also the chairman of Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation (KFDC), said and added that about 25 Purseine boats were carrying out fishing in shallow waters. Mr. Kumar said that when the second lockdown began in late April, many of the labourers from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu left the city. The fisheries sector is gasping for breath ever since COVID-19 started, he said.  Last year, the government had reduced the deep sea fishing ban period in the coastal districts from the usual 61 days to 47 days effective from June 15 to July 31||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/61-day-fishing-holiday-starts-today-in-three-coastal-dists/article34693883.ece

Authorities had to make use of local volunteers to ensure vaccination for 300 people at UPHCs and convince the others to come at a later date. As per COWIN portal, a total of 10,708 persons received the vaccine in Dakshina Kannada on Monday. Meanwhile, with about 6,000 doses of vaccine provided by the Union government, the district administration called those in the 45+ age category to give free their first dose at 10 UPHCs in Mangaluru and PHCs in Bantwal, Puttur, Belthangady and Sullia taluks. At many vaccination centres, people started to queue up at 4 a.m. itself. Councillor from Attavar ward Shailesh Shetty and a group of volunteers from COVID War Room and Indian Red Cross Society opened the classrooms of Cascia High School in Jeppu and made 250 people and 50 health workers sit there. Others were asked to leave the premises and the school gate was closed. Tokens were given after authorities came at around 10 a.m. and vaccination commenced soon after. A total of 359 persons received the vaccine at the school. It was not so smooth an affair at the UPHC in Shakti Nagar where too people started assembling at 4 a.m. As health personnel started distributing tokens at 9 a.m., people expressed their anguish over the lack of sufficient doses. “We had a hard time convincing people to return home and come at a later date,” said an health officer from the UPHC. After giving vaccine to 200 people in the morning, the authorities called 100 people, who were in the queue in the morning, to get their vaccine at 2 p.m. A total of 333 persons were administered vaccine at this UPHC. More than 500 people, including an elderly Uday Nayak, who recently underwent surgery in his left leg after an accident, were at the UPHC in Padil when tokens for vaccination were issued at 7 a.m. “Fortunately, I could get a token. This is my fourth visit to the UPHC,” said Mr. Nayak, who was still waiting at the UPHC during the afternoon session. While those in the 45+ group were vaccinated in the adjoining building of an educational institution, 50 health workers received the vaccine at the UPHC.

An ongoing door-to-door survey in Mysuru for identifying people with COVID-19 symptoms for providing early treatment, in an effort to mitigate last-minute complications and hospitalisation of patients, has found that that many women, in view of their domestic obligations, are ignoring their health. “Women are not sent to COVID Care Centres since there won’t be anyone to deal with household work in their absence. They do not get the rest or nutrition required,” said Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, highlighting the the outcome of the survey, being carried out by About Accredited Social Health Activists and healthcare volunteers in the city and taluks. Therefore, the district administration has taken women as a focus group in the survey and found that women are neglecting their health and not reporting their symptoms, besides being unwilling to leave their homes to CCCs for treatment and rest. More CCCs Consequently, it has asked the Mysuru City Corporation to open CCCs in the taluks (18 CCCs have been established in government buildings such as hostels and residential schools). Plans are afoot to effectively isolate and monitor as many as 5,625 cases in home isolation in Mysuru city. Separate CCCs for women are also being planned for their proper care. The MCC has been asked to identify constituency-wise and ward-wise CCCs and seek volunteer help in this respect. These CCCs will be tagged to primary health centres and medical care will be provided, the Deputy Commissioner said. As many as 343 villages in Mysuru district have remained free of COVID-19 in this wave. On the other hand, all the wards in the city have cases, and a few have alarming numbers. “Our focus is on these wards and also on the gram panchayats where there are a large amount of cases,” said Ms. Sindhuri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-women-averse-to-treatment-because-of-domestic-pressures-finds-survey/article34693848.ece
01 June 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||CFTRI waits for nod to supply ‘immunity-boosting’ food supplements||The CSIR-CFTRI, which ensured several consignments of “immunity-boosting” food items during last year’s COVID-19 lockdown, has renewed the offer during the ensuing lockdown. Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) director General Shekhar C. Mande had written to the Chief Secretaries of all the States, offering help from not only CFTRI, but also the other CSIR laboratories across the country. “We are waiting for the governments to respond,” CFTRI director Sridevi Singh told The Hindu . Last year, a large volume of food items including high-protein rusk and zinc fortified mango bars, besides Spirulina-based chikkis were distributed among the needy migrant workers and patients across the country. “CFTRI has licensees all over India. Through our licensees in Delhi, we had made food available to even to patients in All India Institute of Medical Sciences,” she said. Spirulina-based chikkis were distributed in Karnataka last year. “These items contain useful micro-nutrients along with protein. To some extent, we were able to take care of the nutritional needs of people to stay healthy. These food items help boost immunity to some extent,” she said. Dr. Singh recalled that the lockdown imposed across the country last year was very severe. But, this year the supply chains do not appear to have been disrupted like last year. Yet, she said CSIR had offered assistance to different States including offer of food by CFTRI during the pandemic. Even though CFTRI may not be in a position to supply the required food items to various parts of the country from Mysuru in view of the logistics involved, Dr. Singh said they can definitely arrange for the same through their licensees, who are spread across India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cftri-waits-for-nod-to-supply-immunity-boosting-food-supplements/article34693866.ece

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Electricity tariff revision yet to be announced; citizens fear hike||As the State enters yet another lockdown amidst a second, more aggressive wave of COVID-19 infection, there is uneasiness about an impending hike in electricity tariff. For three years in a row, the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) has not announced revision in tariffs before the beginning of a new financial year. And with retrospective tariffs for the previous financial year set to be adjusted in the next two years, citizens are bracing for a possible hike. The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) had sought an average hike of Rs. 1.39 per unit for FY 2021-22, and officials had said that fixed charges is the main component of the hike and is more pronounced for three categories: HT connections, temporary connections and IP sets. In November 2020, seven months after the new fiscal commenced, the KERC had announced increase in tariff by an average 40 paise per unit. But, the commission had decided to make the new tariffs applicable from November instead of April, saying it is to ensure that consumers are not burdened during the adverse economic conditions during the pandemic. Bescom had asked for Rs. 1.96 per unit hike citing a revenue deficit of Rs. 5,872.08 crore for 2020-21. However, the commission had clarified that the relief is only temporary as Rs. 1,443 crore that would have been recovered as additional revenue towards tariff revision for seven months from April 1, 2020, to October 31, 2020, against the total revenue gap of Rs. 2,473 crore, has been kept as “regulatory asset” to be recovered from the consumers in the financial years 2022 and 2023. Apart from the pandemic, pendency of an appeal filed by KPTCL before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (ATE) against a KERC order issued in January 2020, which was disposed in October, and the election code of conduct coming into force due to the byelections also caused delay, the commission had said. This year, again, the pandemic, as well as the code of conduct for elections resulted in a delay in pronouncement of tariffs. Though no KERC official, including the chairman, was available for comment despite repeated attempts, sources in the electricity supply companies (Escoms) said they had earlier received communication from the commission that the tariff revision had been postponed. “We then heard that the announcement would happen after the elections. Escoms will find it difficult as we have to raise short term loans. In addition, generation and power supply hasn’t stopped,” said a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous. Consumption drops Officials also said consumption had dropped, perhaps owing to the recent rain as well as lockdown and pandemic effect. “The consumption is around 9000 MW now, and we are assuming IP set load falling due to the rain to be one of the reasons. In April first week, it had reached 14,000 MW. We can manage for a month or two without revision, but it will be difficult if we have to wait an additional six months along with last year’s pending arrears,” said the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/electricity-tariff-revision-yet-to-be-announced-citizens-fear-hike/article34693856.ece

01 June 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||From the brink, a striking turnaround||The Government Town LP School, Cherthala, was once on the brink of shutting down for want of students following an influx of private schools. There were fewer than 100 students in its rolls for the 2003-04 academic year. That said, the school has made a remarkable turnaround in recent years. The number of students has grown to 882 in 2021. As many as 162 students have so far joined Class 1 in the school for the academic year 2021-22, which is the highest among government schools (not including aided schools) in Alappuzha. In 2018, the school entered the Best of India Records by enrolling 233 students in four hours on April 12. A year later, it broke that record by admitting 247 students in less than one hour on May 3, 2019. The school, established in 1919, today has one of the largest number of lower primary students among government educational institutions in the State. Its journey from the brink of closure to one of the most sought-after primary education institutions in the region was made possible by the interventions of former students, prominent personalities, and teachers. Mahatma’s visit The school offers quality learning and focuses on English language programmes. Hi-tech classrooms, a dedicated website, library, YouTube channel, language camps, and children’s park are some of the attractions on offer at the school, which proudly lays claim to a visit by Mahatma Gandhi on January 18, 1937. 8% rise in admissions “We are seeing an annual rise of around 8% in new admissions. This shows the trust of parents and well-wishers,” says S. Dhanapal, the headmaster. Arvind Kumar Pai, a teacher of the school, says good teamwork, backed by quality learning programmes and support of the public, helped the school achieve the feat. “One challenge is that we do not have enough benches and desks for students when regular classes begin after the pandemic. We expect government support in addressing the issue,” Mr. Pai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/from-the-brink-a-striking-turnaround/article34694345.ece

In separate letters to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Lakshadweep Administrator Praful Khoda Patel, the Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti, an environmental organisation in the district, urged that the recent reforms would adversely affect the life and livelihood of the community there. Studies showed that the stability of the coral reefs that protect the islands had been nurtured and maintained by the life and culture of the homogeneous community that live in the islands. “From the recent draconian changes in behalf of reforms, we know that no consideration or due respect has been given to the time tested ways of land use, ocean resource utilisation and or livelihood options adopted by the community. To add insult to injury, the culture and traditions of the ethnic group there has been overlooked by intervention into the food culture, the reproductive freedom and self-reliance of the people”, the letter said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stop-all-reforms-in-lakshadweep-greens/article34694006.ece

Ram has said. Mr. Ram was delivering the keynote address at a webinar expressing solidarity with Lakshadweep, organised by the Taliparamba Sir Syed College Alumni Association on Sunday. The people of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also coming forward on the lines of the strong popular movement being formed in Kerala against the attempt to jeopardise the life of the islanders. Mr. Ram said the series of reforms being introduced by the new Administrator would undermine the development of Lakshadweep and create unrest in the islands. Speaking at the webinar, Rajya Sabha member John Brittas said that this was not only a problem of Lakshadweep, but part of a broader effort to derail democracy and the Constitution. What was happening in Lakshadweep today was a precursor to what the government intended to implement in India. P.K. Kunhalikutty, MLA, said the resolution passed unanimously by the Kerala Legislative Assembly proved the fact that the whole of Kerala stood with Lakshadweep in this time of crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/adopt-legal-measures-to-save-lakshadweep-ram/article34694008.ece
01 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Canal cleaning: corpn. finds its hands tied||Parts of the annual pre-monsoon canal cleaning ritual have not been taken up, with the Kochi Corporation’s hands being tied in the matter of longer canals. While smaller drains and canals have mostly been cleaned and desilted, others like the Perandoor canal and Kalvathy canal have not witnessed even the temporary redemption that comes from desilting. The Thevara-Perandoor canal had been cleaned and desilted beginning in 2019 and continuing into 2020 as part of the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), said Mayor M. Anilkumar. With those bills just being passed, sanctioning another round of cleaning of the Perandoor canal this year will not be possible, since it could lead to audit objection, he said. Besides, the canal has already been included in an upcoming Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) project—the Integrated Urban Regeneration and Water Transport System (IURWTS) —making it difficult for the civic body to initiate another project for the canal. Waterlogging issues At an online council meeting on Monday, councillors pointed out that not cleaning the Perandoor canal would lead to severe waterlogging in the Panampilly Nagar area. Corporation sources said a total of Rs. 7.5 crore had been spent so far on desilting, fencing and repairing the sidewall of the Thevara-Perandoor canal under the AMRUT project. The Kalvathy canal was also desilted partially under the AMRUT scheme, and another round of cleaning cannot be scheduled now, the Mayor said. Meanwhile, a project for the Mullassery canal has been hanging in the balance for nearly a year now. The Operation Breakthrough team had been tasked with clearing obstructions to the flow of water in the Mullassery canal. The corporation had paid around Rs. 4 crore for the project which is yet to take off, Mr. Anilkumar said. While a tender was invited in April for work on the canal, contractors refused to take it up, since their payments were delayed for last year’s Operation Breakthrough projects, it is learnt. Besides, encroachments on the canal will have to be identified and removed by the Revenue Department and the corporation, before any work can be done on the canal itself. Relief camps Preparations will begin soon to set up relief camps, anticipating that the city will witness waterlogging during the monsoon, Mr. Anilkumar said at the council meeting. If residents need to be shifted out of homes, COVID patients will be shifted to treatment centres, and two separate relief camps will be arranged, one for those in quarantine, he said. Corporation divisions will be divided into eight zones, and locations for camps will be identified in these zones under the supervision of the works and health standing committee chairpersons, he informed councillors at the meeting. “Work we could have done, we have completed. Other projects will take time to implement,” the Mayor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/canal-cleaning-corpn-finds-its-hands-tied/article34693998.ece

Estimates by the Kerala Film Producers Association (KFPA) say about Rs. 600 crore is at stake as the worsening pandemic crisis is likely to further delay the release of the movies. “These include big budget films such as Marakkar:Arabikadalinte Simham and Malik . The release of nearly 60 movies was hit after the first wave in March last. Nearly 60 more movies were shot between July last and April this year following the relaxations,” said M. Renjith, KFPA president. Bleak prospects Stating that a possible third wave would aggravate the crisis, Mr. Renjith said that the prospects for the industry seem bleak in 2021. “A majority of the producers remain anxious as they have taken loans on high interest and there is no window being extended for its repayment,” he said. Sibi Malayil, president of the Film Employees Federation of Kerala, said that over 50% of the about 10,000 members in the 19 trade bodies affiliated to the federation are daily wage workers and the pandemic has hit their livelihood hard. “They include outdoor unit workers, production and other assistants across departments, and assistant directors among others,” he said. Explaining that the federation had tried to provide relief as far as possible to the worst-hit in the industry after the first wave last year, Mr. Sibi Malayil said that only a few enjoyed financial security in the industry despite the general notion that all was well in the industry. “There are many who have been left unemployed for long,” he said. Plea to govt. G. Sureshkumar, president of the Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce, said that the trade body has submitted a memorandum before the new government seeking financial relief and assistance amidst the COVID-19 crisis. “We have requested the government to do away with the entertainment tax collected on tickets over and above the Goods and Services Tax as it amounted to double taxation,” he said. K. Vijayakumar, president of the Film Exhibitors’ United Organisation of Kerala, said that the second wave had doused the hopes of exhibitors, who had spent huge amount to resume operations in January after remaining shut for nearly 10 months. “We request the government to announce an interest-free financial package to overcome the crisis,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-hits-mollywood-hard/article34693995.ece

Earlier, he used to ferry close to 100 students every day to school and back in his vehicles. Thanks to the lockdown, over 3,000 van owners in Ernakulam have been rendered jobless. With no income from the vehicles, insurance and annual vehicle tax payments have been defaulted. The vehicles cannot be taken out as the insurance coverage expired a year ago, said Mr. Santhosh who has been in the sector for the past three decades. The commencement of the academic year used to be a rewarding experience for those employed in the sector, as they too would be back at work after the two-month summer break. This time, as another academic year begins in the online mode on Tuesday, a pall of gloom hangs over the lives of many school van owners and their employees. “It requires around Rs. 35,000 as insurance and another Rs. 24,000 as tax for a vehicle. I don’t know how I will raise the amount. The repayment of vehicle loan has also been defaulted. The moratorium on the loan is over, and it has become a bad debt,” said Mr. Santhosh. “I have filed Form G for the vehicles to exempt them from the annual tax. I don’t know when I would be able to revive business. With no income, many vehicle operators like me are in serious crisis,” he added. For every city school, said M.V. Susan, wife of Mr. Santhosh, who handles collection of bus fees, there would be around 50 private vehicles to ferry children. All those vehicles are now lying idle with schools shut. M.A. Sreekumar, one of the drivers employed by Mr. Santhosh, found alternative employment as a mechanic at an automobile workshop. Though the State government offered financial support to those who lost jobs in various sectors, Mr. Santhosh and Mr. Sreekumar said they were yet to get any aid from the government. “I didn’t get any support from the government, as I am not a member of any welfare scheme for drivers, said Mr. Sreekumar. Entrepreneurs like Mr. Santhosh and his crew are eagerly waiting for schools to get back to the physical mode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/school-van-operators-in-dire-straits-as-another-academic-year-begins/article34694004.ece

Kiltan, Chetlat, Bitra, Kadmath and Agatti islands will have night curfew between 5 p.m. and 6 a.m. A few essential services have been exempted from the lockdown. The administration also deputed senior officials to eight islands for “COVID management, documentation work for claiming relief under the SDRF norms, implementation of schemes and development works happening in these islands, cleanliness and interaction with local representatives, village and district panchayat members and brief them about the priorities and objectives of the administration for bringing more development in these islands (sic)”. More village panchayats passed resolutions decrying the ‘reforms’ being pushed by the administration. Islanders also see the extension of lockdown as a means to prevent protests. “The administration is just trying to put the islanders to untold misery. While RT-PCR has been made mandatory for inter-island travel, there is no facility to get it done in most islands. And, if a sample is given, it takes anywhere from three days to more than a week to get the result. It is a joke. Life has been miserable for some two months. There is no free ration or unemployement compensation, and this extension is heaping more misery on the people,” said an islander.

The Administrator is preparing ground for surrendering land assets and rights to exploit natural and deep sea resources to private monopolies favourable to the government. Mr. Patel’s actions indicate that the country has strayed from its declared policy of non-alignment, and they are preparing ground for American domination, the fishers alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fishers-forum-backs-lakshadweep-protests/article34694002.ece

He was subsequently reinstated and was later given full additional charge of Executive Director of KMML on the ground that its Managing Director Chandra Bose was on medical leave. Vigilance clearance The petitioner pointed out that as per a 2016 government order, appointments to posts such as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of any public sector undertaking should be made only after obtaining clearance from the Vigilance Department and a selection panel involving experts. However, these norms were given a go-by by the government. He was facing corruption charges and disciplinary proceedings were pending against him. It was sheer abuse of power, the petitioner alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rethink-decision-on-kmml-post-hc-tells-govt/article34694348.ece

Ramees, an accused in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, challenging the order of the Ernakulam NIA special court dismissing his bail plea. In his petition, Mr. Ramees argued that the NIA had not collected any evidence to prove the offence under Section 15 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The entire allegations of the prosecution was that he had aided the other accused in committing the alleged smuggling activity. In fact, some other accused persons were granted bail by the special court on the ground that mere smuggling of gold was not sufficient to charge them with any of the offences under the UAPA, it was argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-seeks-nia-reply-in-gold-smuggling-case/article34694018.ece

As per official estimates, the test positivity rate (TPR) in the district has declined to 15.52% on Sunday with the number of cases coming down to 834. While the availability of total beds excluding ICU beds stood at 50.5%, only 36 (12.5%) out of the 187 ICU beds and 3 (2%) out of the 151 ventilators were available across the 39 COVID hospitals (government and private). The availability of non-ICU beds with oxygen supply, meanwhile, stood at 26% (475/1,824) of the total capacity. As many as 186 patients with severe symptoms and 57 patients with critical symptoms are currently under treatment in the district. Long recovery time Health officials have attributed the high occupancy rate of ventilator and ICU beds to a sharp rise in extremely critical patients reaching hospitals during the peak and the long recovery time in ICUs. District Medical Officer Jacob Varghese said the number of critical patients would soon witness a proportionate fall. “The spread has been brought under control and more ICUs and ventilators will now be available. During the peak, we optimise the allocation of ICUs and ventilators among those who need critical support,” he said. 75 ventilators vacant In Pathanamathitta, meanwhile, the availability of ventilators and ICU beds across the 10 COVID-19 hospitals have improved markedly. As many as 75 out of 145 ventilators in the district are lying vacant currently while 23.2% (56/241) of the ICU beds are also available. The number of patients with severe symptoms stood at 575 while those with critical symptoms are 39. “The number of patients requiring ICU care is coming down gradually with the fall in cases. But considering the rise in post-COVID thrombosis and pneumonia cases, the ventilators and ICU beds may remain occupied a few more weeks,” said a senior Health official in Pathanamathitta.  Availability of ventilators, ICU beds improves in Pathanamthitta||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kottayam-struggles-with-critical-care-infra/article34694349.ece

The panchayats that have such village-level squads will improve their strength by adding more members from various wards. Trained persons Complying with the guidelines issued by the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), only trained youths will be selected to the teams. During natural calamities, the ERT members will act as first respondents in their villages and extend their service to the main rescue wings such as the National Disaster Response Force or the Fire and Rescue Service units. According to DDMA officials, each ERT will have four specialised wings that will manage the issuing of timely warnings, rescue operation, shelter preparation, and life support. They will work with other civil defence forces formed by various government departments. The ward-level ERTs will have at least 25 trained volunteers, they add. Some grama panchayats have decided to purchase and supply various emergency rescue equipment to the ward-level ERTs. In Kakkodi panchayat, the ERT has received their kit comprising rescue accessories such as chainsaw, ropes, life jackets and lifebelts. In upland areas Local bodies in the upland areas of the district have been directed to prepare better for tackling rain-related calamities. As part of assessing preparations, Revenue Department officials will soon organise panchayat-level meetings with the participation of elected representatives. Better preparations will be made in areas such as Kattippara, Vilangad, Thiruvambady and Koodaranhi where landslips and floods affected many people in the past. Voluntary groups Along with the ERTs, the grama panchayats will extend their support for strengthening local rescue wings formed by various voluntary organisations and youth clubs. Many of such squads are well-equipped with modern rescue accessories and boats for evacuating people from waterlogged areas. Arrangements are also in place to give them the required online training for complying with the COVID-19 protocol during field-level operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kozhikode-panchayats-gear-up-to-tackle-rain-related-calamities/article34693978.ece

Efforts are on to furnish a rented building near the Kadalundi level cross for launching the service. Initially, the aid post will have a sub inspector, a senior civil police officer and eight civil police officers. All the major services currently available through the local police stations will be accessible to the public from the aid post. It will also be helpful for those who frequently depended on the services of distantly located Feroke and Beypore stations. Police officials from Feroke station said there was a small police aid post in the area earlier which was closed down a few years ago following the unavailability of a good office building. The reopening was recommended recently taking into account the local residents’ plea for better police patrol activities and surveillance against anti-social elements, they said. The police aid post is also the fruition of various local body representatives’ persistent demands and follow-up activities with the police higher ups. According to them, the area has been in demand of improved police surveillance measures and service with its prominence as an emerging tourism destination. Assistant Commissioner A.M. Siddique said the aid post set up as part of facilitating a decentralised administration might be upgraded to a full-fledged station within a year. “There is an official proposal for the same which will lessen the existing workload on both Feroke and Beypore stations. The aid post is the first step to the goal,” he told The Hindu . On Sunday, Minister for Public Works and Tourism P.A.

The change has been specified in the Orange Book of Disaster Management 2: Monsoon Preparedness and Response Guidelines which has been updated by the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) ahead of the 2021 southwest monsoon. The revision, approved by the government and published on Friday, lists 10 dams in five districts: Kakkayam dam in Kozhikode, Poringalkuthu and Sholayar in Thrissur, Kallar, Irattayar, Lower Periyar and Kallarkutty in Idukki, Moozhiyar and Maniyar in Pathanamthitta, and the Aruvikkara dam in Thiruvananthapuram. New additions The dams in Thrissur and Kozhikode are newly added to the list based on the operational experiences in 2020, a KSDMA official says. Procedures for releasing water from the dams have been specified in the updated Orange Book. The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and the Irrigation Department which manage the dams should inspect the water level twice a day to determine whether the shutters have to be raised at night. The shutters should be raised only with the approval of the District Collectors. Government agencies, the authorities of the local bodies along the rivers concerned, and the public should also be adequately warned. Relief camps Guidelines pertaining to the management of relief camps have been updated, given the current COVID-19 scenario. The 2020 edition has specified the need for four types of camps for accommodating the quarantined, the symptomatic, sections vulnerable to COVID-19, and general camps. The number has been pared down to two in the 2021 edition: general relief camps and buildings having rooms with attached toilets for accommodating the home-quarantined. Evacuated COVID-19 patients will be transferred to COVID first- and second-line treatment centres and COVID-19 hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/4-more-dams-can-raise-shutters-at-night/article34694343.ece
01 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||State’s plans for SNGOU go awry||The partial disruption of the functioning of the University Grants Commission (UGC) has put paid to the State's dream of bringing distance education courses under the Sree Narayana Guru Open University (SNGOU). With the results of the Plus Two examinations expected soon, the government is likely to permit Kerala University and Calicut University to continue their distance learning programmes for another year. While a Kerala High Court order had prompted the SNGOU to defer its efforts to launch academic programmes in the open and distance learning (ODL) mode last year, the university had made all efforts to put its best foot forward in the meantime by framing the syllabus for 20 undergraduate (UG) and nine postgraduate (PG) academic programmes. The university had planned to enable students to obtain single, double and triple major. UGC delay However, the delay by the UGC’s Distance Education Bureau (DEB) in opening its web portal for submitting applications for ODL courses has come as a blow for the university. SNGOU registrar P.N. Dileep said the university has prepared itself to apply for the UGC recognition for its distance education courses. “However, the COVID-19 situation in New Delhi has apparently stalled the operations of the DEB. While the bureau had last opened its portal in October last, it was expected to reopen this March. This has not happened thus far,” he pointed out. He added that the recognition process also entailed an inspection of the facilities and arrangements that could consume more time. While nearly 90,000 students used to enrol for UG and PG distance education courses in the State, admissions for such programmes had nearly halved last year due to the uncertainty that surrounded the SNGOU’s programmes. This was attributed to the Ordinance promulgated for its launch that had barred other universities from offering ODL courses and private registrations. The issue had come up for discussion at a meeting of Vice Chancellors that was convened by Higher Education Minister R. Bindu few days ago. Both V.P. Mahadevan Pillai and M.K. Jayaraj, Vice Chancellors of Kerala and Calicut Universities respectively, expressed their willingness to continue their ODL programmes. Defects rectified Despite failing to receive the DEB nod, Calicut University had admitted nearly 35,000 students last year for its ODL programmes after rectifying defects that were flagged in its application. While the DEB remained “incommunicado”, the university continued its efforts to obtain approval. Nonetheless, the university qualified the UGC’s criteria for ODL courses with its NAAC grading of 3.13, Dr. Jayaraj pointed out. The UGC permitted universities to offer ODL programmes if it has a minimum NAAC score of 3.01 or figures among the top-100 ranks in the National Institutional Ranking Framework.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-plans-for-sngou-go-awry/article34693936.ece
01 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||PSC seeks govt. nod to restart exams by July||The Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) has sought the sanction of the State government to restart examinations for various posts from July. A letter seeking the support of various departments to organise the examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be sent to the government soon. The PSC had postponed all examinations, interviews, and certificate verification since April. According to PSC officials, a programme for July has been drawn up, with priority for examinations with a fewer number of candidates. Another challenge is to reschedule the postponed examinations. “Some exams, for instance, the ones for degree level, may have lakhs of candidates. This would require several centres to accommodate candidates by maintaining physical distancing. The Education Department has to spare enough teachers for invigilation. The Health Department has to provide assistance to carry out COVID-19-related checks and to make separate arrangements for those who have tested positive. Also, not all postponed examinations can be accommodated in July,” a PSC official told The Hindu . Online exams Organising online exams during the pandemic is quite a task for the PSC. Across all its centres, only 1,800 computer systems are available for the purpose. Some of the online examinations have been changed into OMR mode to avoid delays. Though the PSC has implemented work from home partially for its employees, none of the examination-related activities, which constitute a majority of the commission’s work, could be done that way due to the element of secrecy involved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/psc-seeks-govt-nod-to-restart-exams-by-july/article34694007.ece

The dip in cases is attributed to the dip in testing over the weekend. The test positivity rate, which had stabilised around 16 % for the past few days, dipped top 13.77%. The State’s active case pool showed a significant dip on Monday when the number of active cases went down to 2,06,982 from previous day’s figure of 2,23,727. The number of recoveries on Monday was 28,867. 174 deaths The State added 174 new deaths to the official toll list on Monday, taking the cumulative fatalities to 8,815. These are deaths which occurred over the past several days. There was a slight dip in the number of patients who were newly admitted to hospitals on Monday. New hospital admissions numbered 2,881 and number of patients being treated for moderate or severe COVID in hospitals dipped to 38,377. ICU occupancy is a true reflection of the impact of the pandemic and while there has not been a significant decrease in number, it has been a matter of great relief that the numbers have not been increasing as it did a few days ago. Total ICU admissions of critically ill COVID patients in the State in both public and private hospitals together now stands at 3,800, with 1,473 patients requiring ventilator support. The active case pool has been coming down in all districts rapidly and in Thiruvananthapuram district, the active case pool has come down to 14,587 patients. However, with 6,070 patients in hospitals, the district continues to have the highest number of hospitalisation among all others.

While there were no casualties, Fire and Rescue Services personnel and the police were kept on tenterhooks for around two hours. The fire was noticed around 5.15 p.m. at Mahadev Toy Shop, near Sree Padmanabha Theatre. The fire engulfed the third floor of the building that was apparently used as a godown for plastic and stuffed toys. The shop had a large cotton stock used to stuff toys and the fire spread rapidly. However, swift action by the Fire and Rescue Services personnel thwarted the fire from spreading to other parts of the building or adjacent ones. Besides a post office, jewellery, garment and footwear stores functioned out of the building. Several shops reopened on Monday after a month following the easing of lockdown curbs. According to traders nearby, a load of toys was brought to the godown operated by a Rajasthan native a few hours prior to the incident. Smoke from burnt plastic could be seen billowing out of the building for a long period. 15 fire units in action Around 15 fire units from the Rajaji Nagar, Chakka and Vizhinjam fire stations were pressed into action to bring the fire under control within an hour-and-a-half. The officials also undertook a short inspection to detect the source of the fire. While a short circuit is suspected to have led to the fire, a detailed investigation has been instituted. A member of the Fire and Rescue Services sustained a minor injury during the fire-fighting. He has been admitted to General Hospital. District Collector Navjot Khosa has sought reports from the fire force and the city Corporation secretary on the incident. Mayor Arya Rajendran, who visited the spot along with Deputy Mayor P.K. Raju, raised the possibility of the godown being constructed illegally. The makeshift facility has been built using corrugated iron sheets. “An inquiry into the allegations of unauthorised construction will be conducted by the Corporation’s engineering wing,” she said. She added that the previous council of the Corporation had collected details of buildings that lacked fire safety clearance. A detailed inquiry will be launched into such irregularities and appropriate action will be adopted after examining each case. Ministers Antony Raju, G.R. Anil and V.K. Prasanth, MLA, also took stock of the situation. Compensation sought A section the trading community said the fire broke out as a result of the lockdown.

Last week, the U.K. announced that it was accelerating the vaccination of those above 50 years following new evidence that one dose of Astra Zeneca (Covishield in India) vaccine had only 33% effectiveness against the variant. The U.K. shortened the dosage interval of the vaccine from 12 weeks to eight weeks, whereas two doses boosted it to nearly 60%. Pre-print According to a new pre-print released on May 26 by scientists from the Pasteur Institute, France, the variant was less sensitive to monoclonal antibodies and sera from convalescent and vaccinated individuals, making it an immune escape mutant. It said that sera from individuals having received one dose of AstraZeneca vaccine barely inhibited B.1.617.2. “In the field, the State has not studied or documented the clinical profile of those who got COVID-19 after receiving one or two doses of vaccine. This tells us about the level of protection the vaccine offers,” says E. Sreekumar, senior scientist (Virology) at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology \. At a time when vaccines are in short supply, real world data or evidence from the field can go a long way in helping the government take crucial decisions on the State’s vaccine policy. Appropriate strategy If the first dose was enough to prevent serious disease and hospitalisation, it should help the authorities decide whether covering as many people as possible with at least a single dose vaccine is the appropriate strategy for the State, it is pointed out. In fact, with 80% of the five lakh plus health-care workers in the State having already received two vaccine doses, they would form an ideal cohort in whom these studies can be done. Since April, the virus variant B.1.617.2 has been sweeping across the State. The RGCB has been doing genetic sequencing of samples from southern districts since May and of the 80 plus samples analysed so far, 95% has been B.1.617.2. Dominant strain “This variant is likely to remain the dominant circulating strain because there is no resistance in its path to stop it. Even fully vaccinated individuals could have sub-clinical infection and while they may not be at high risk, they could still transmit the infection. Universal masking is not something we can give up any time in the near future,” Dr. Sreekumar says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-to-study-clinical-profile-of-covid-hit/article34694027.ece
01 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Minister flays UGC order on blended learning||Higher Education Minister R. Bindu has voiced her disapproval towards the University Grants Commission (UGC)’s move to encourage blended learning in higher education institutions. Dr. Bindu told The Hindu the proposal, despite being touted to boost flexibility, could exacerbate the digital divide that existed in the country. “We still have not been able to plug the gulf between the have-nots and haves with regard to access of ICT devices and Internet. The move to switch over to online learning in a big way will marginalise the disadvantaged sections even further,” she said. The UGC had recently decided to permit institutions to teach up to 40% of the syllabus in each course through online mode and the remaining in offline mode. The thrust on blended learning, which was part of the Centre’s efforts to implement the National Education Policy, could rob classrooms of the human element and also impact the livelihoods of large sections of the teaching community, Dr. Bindu said. “As a teacher myself, I used to interact with students on a wide range of subjects that often went beyond the confines of curriculum. But such discussions may not find places in online classes when teachers would mostly stick to the syllabus. There is also the issue of gauging response of students,” she said. The Minister will lead an online discussion being organised by the Kerala State Higher Education Council on June 3 to evolve the State’s response to the UGC proposal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/minister-flays-ugc-order-on-blended-learning/article34694013.ece

The family noticed on Monday noon that a cobra had made its way into their bathroom. Reflecting the pandemic times that we are living in, it needed a snake rescuer in a PPE kit to get the snake out from the house, much to the relief of the patients there. Volunteer informed As soon as the family members noticed the snake in their bathroom, they informed the local rapid response team volunteer Sreekuttan, who called up the COVID-19 control room set up at V.K.Prasanth MLA’s office. The MLA’s office soon informed licensed snake rescuer R.Baavan about the situation. While the team waited for his arrival from the district’s outskirts, the control room got another call from the same household that the blood sugar level of one of the family members was suddenly dropping. When Baavan reached the house, the medical team provided him with a PPE kit. Since a bathroom being used by COVID-19 patients is a space from where there is more chance of virus spread, extreme caution had to be taken. Accompanying him to the house was a doctor to check on the patient whose blood sugar levels had dropped. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr.Baavan said that it was his first experience of catching a snake while wearing a PPE kit. Extreme caution “I was naturally apprehensive of going into a household, where three COVID-19 patients were residing. Ever since the pandemic struck, I take up assignments only selectively, ensuring safety. But, I decided to take this up since these patients are helpless with a cobra in their bathroom. Also, the PPE kit provided by the medical team gave me the confidence to go in. Before I entered, they shifted from their room to another one. Since it was a small, three-month-old cobra, I did not have much difficulty in catching it,” said Mr.Baavan, one of the licensed snake rescuers of the Forest Department. The cobra was later handed over to the Forest Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/snake-rescuer-dons-ppe-kit-to-catch-cobra/article34693946.ece

The total number of active cases also significantly came down to 3,943 from 14,000 on May 17. The cause of worry, however, remains the steady increase in the number of COVID patients getting infected with mucormycosis (black fungus). The GGH alone is treating 89 cases as on Monday, with eight-to-nine patients reporting the infection every day. About 90% of the patients receiving the treatment are COVID positive and about 80% of them have comorbidities like diabetes, as per information. There were four deaths, but it was not yet ascertained if the cause of death was COVID or mucormycosis. The hospital superintendent said that the number of patients needing ventilators or an ICU bed had come down for the past one week, but indiscriminate use of Remdesivir and steroids was making them susceptible to the fungal infection. Meanwhile, the district administration on Monday inaugurated a second Liquid Medical Oxygen storage tank on the Government General Hospital premises with a 10 KL capacity in addition to the existing 13 KL one. The second one was procured on an emergency basis from the MPLADS funds of Anantapur MP Talari Rangaiah, who formally inaugurated it in the presence of hospital Superintendent K.S.S.

Jagan Mohan Reddy virtually laid the foundation stone for the construction of 14 out of the 16 medical colleges/teaching hospitals each at Piduguralla (Guntur), Machilipatnam (Krishna), Vizianagaram, Anakapalle (Visakhapatnam), Rajahmundry (East Godavari), Amalapuram (East Godavari), Palakollu (West Godavari), Eluru (West Godavari), Bapatla (Guntur), Markapuram (Prakasam), Madanapalle (Chittoor), Penukonda (Anantapur), Nandyal (Kurnool) and Adoni (Kurnool). “I am happy that we are beginning yet another massive project by laying the foundation stone for 14 out of the 16 new medical colleges/teaching hospitals and nursing colleges across the State. The work on Paderu and Pulivendula (the other two hospitals) has begun already. I am happy that the new medical colleges will create a new ecosystem in these areas benefiting a vast number of people. As these new colleges are being set up in rural areas, they will save precious lives and reduce the stress on teaching hospitals in district headquarters. We are spending Rs. 16,000 crore on scaling up infrastructure in the Primary Health Centres, Area Hospitals and GGH in district headquarters. We do not have tertiary health care facilities like in Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru, but now we can say that there will be excellent tertiary health care facilities in each Parliamentary constituency,’’ said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. The construction of new medical colleges was scheduled to be completed within three years at an estimated cost of Rs. 8,000 crore. The government was also setting up 500-bed hospitals along with medical colleges, with modern infrastructure and state-of-the-art facilities, the Chief Minister said. “I also want to encourage active private participation in medical infrastructure like in bigger cities of Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai. Our government will allot five acres of land free of cost to private hospitals that are ready to invest Rs. 100 crore and start super speciality hospitals in three years,’’ said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Village Clinics The government had also taken up the Nadu-Nedu initiative, changing the face of government institutions ensuring to meet the national standards with an expenditure of Rs. 16,300 crore. The establishment of 10,111 YSR Village Clinics was under way creating access to healthcare in every village in addition to setting up of two PHCs in every mandal, 560 Urban Health Centres, 52 Area Hospitals and 190 CHCs. He said that the government was setting up five multi-speciality hospitals in tribal areas at a cost of Rs. 246 crore, which would be accessible for the tribal population in remote areas in the next three years. Aarogyasri expanded The Chief Minister said that the current government breathed life into the Aarogyasri programme by bringing 2,436 treatments under it and ensuring the scheme was applicable if the bill amount exceeded Rs. 1,000. He said Rs. 5,215 crore had been paid by the Aarogyasri Trust, in the last two years where Rs. 3,560 crore was spent on Aarogyasri treatments, Rs. 303 crore for Aarogya Aasara, Rs. 510 crore on employees’ health scheme, Rs. 452 crore on 104 and 108 services and Rs. 390 crore for pensions for chronic patients. He said Andhra Pradesh was the first State to include treatment for COVID-19 and black fungus under Aarogyasri. The government was also providing free eye check-up for all under YSR Kanti Velugu and conducting cochlear implant surgeries for children, with an aim to make Andhra Pradesh free from deaf and mute children.

01 June 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Stone laid for colleges at Piduguralla, Bapatla||The foundation stone for two new medical colleges — one at Piduguralla in Palnadu and the other at Bapatla — was laid remotely by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday. Gurazala MLA Kasu Mahesh Reddy said that the move to establish a 500-bedded hospital would fill a massive gap in public healthcare facility in the region. The lack of hospital beds in Palnadu region is forcing many to go all the way to Guntur, which 150 km away. Narsaraopet MP Lavu Srikrishnadevarayulu thanked Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and appealed to him to upgrade the 30-bedded area hospital to 100 beds as the region is located at a fair distance from major towns. District Collector Vivek Yadav said that the new medical facility would help people, particularly those living in tribal hamlets, as quality medical care is out of their reach. At Bapatla, Minister for Home and Disaster Management M. Sucharita, MLA Kona Raghupati, MP Nandigam Suresh and Joint Collector A.S. Dinesh Kumar were present. Mr. Raghupati said that the new medical college would help people in six Assembly constituencies in the coastal region and added that 50 acres of land had been acquired already.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stone-laid-for-colleges-at-piduguralla-bapatla/article34694384.ece
01 June 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||A revolutionary step towards achieving ‘Gram Swaraj’ dream||Taking inspiration from the ‘Gram Swaraj’ championed by Mahatma Gandhi, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy launched revolutionary measures to bring the governance to the doorstep of the people by setting up secretariats in the village and ward level, fulfilling yet another promise he had made in the run-up to the general elections in 2019. The well-designed move aiming at achieving decentralisation not only ended the ordeal of people running from pillar to post to avail themselves of services such as paying taxes, submitting applications or getting pensions and etc. but also ensured the smooth implementation of various welfare schemes. The village/ward secretariat system was launched on October 2, 2019 on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The innovative move caught the imagination of the country with several States replicating the system. Even as critics had claimed several chinks in the system, the effectiveness of the village/ward secretariats in smooth delivery of services at the doorstep of the people stood the test of time, especially during the crucial coronavirus pandemic. “The village/ward secretariat system has been playing a pivotal role in tracing of the primary and secondary contacts, distribution of essential commodities and playing a supportive role to the frontline workers and this has silenced many critics who earlier had raised eyebrows over the efficacy of the system,” says a senior government official. Robust network A village/ward volunteer covers 50 households and ensures that the benefits of all welfare schemes reach every genuine beneficiary. The massive village/ward secretariat system and its integration of the service delivery with the district, state and Central administrations was a challenge in the initial days. At present, the State has 15,004 village/ward secretariats, covering more than 13,000 villages, 120 towns and cities. There is a ward secretariat for every 2,000 people in urban areas and a village secretariat for every 4,000 people in rural areas. An officer of the rank of Joint Collector has been appointed to monitor their functioning, and a Divisional Development Officer has also been appointed. A village secretariat has 11 employees while a ward secretariat has 10, and the robust system has 1.3 lakh employees working full time. Their services would be regularised after two years of probation. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy has been particular in ensuring uniformity of facilities, and took care that all the offices are computerised. 541 services available Now, people can avail of 541 services at village/ward secretariats, while the focus is on four basic services—pension, rice cards, YSR Arogyasri and housing schemes. The village and ward secretariats, so far, have received 2.38 crore grievances of which 2.32 crore have been redressed. The technological interface has been optimised with the integration of 15 different internet applications. The system has been proved to be an effective tool in ensuring the delivery of welfare schemes, says another government official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-revolutionary-step-towards-achieving-gram-swaraj-dream/article34694398.ece

However, the Bench comprising Justice A. Muhammed Mustaque and Justice Kauser Edappagath, asked petitioner Mohammed Sadique from Kavaratti to forward his suggestions and comments in two weeks to the administrator who should forward them to the Union Home Ministry. It was for the Union Ministry to consider whether his suggestions and objections should be accepted or not. Disposing of the public interest petition, the Bench observed that nothing would prevent the Ministry from entertaining the petitioner’s suggestions and objections. It might not be proper for the court to direct the Central government to accept them. However, in any system of governance, the government would consider such suggestions that might ultimately enable it to form their decisions, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-declines-plea-for-more-time-for-lakshadweep-objections/article34693756.ece

Exuding confidence that he had secured the mandate from the Centre to go ahead with the development projects, Mr. Patel said on Monday that the proposals would be implemented after the President gave his assent “to make regulations of peace, progress, and good government” of the Union Territory under Article 240 of the Constitution. “All the draft proposals have been in the public domain for more than two months. Now, the Central government will decide on ratification or any changes to the draft proposals,” he said. On the Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, Mr. Patel said the law had been drafted to provide for the preservation of animals suitable for milch, breeding or agricultural purposes. The draft law banned the slaughter of cows, the calf of a cow, bull, and bullock. “The beef issue should not be viewed on a community basis. There is also no politics involved in the draft. If we had to play politics, we would have opted only for vegetarian food in mid-day meals for children,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/draft-laws-sent-to-mha/article34693739.ece
01 June 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Amid protests, foundation stone laid for Nandyal medical college||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy virtually laid the foundation stone for the Nandyal government medical college on Monday, amid stiff resistance from the local farming community as well as a stay order from the High Court. The project had attracted controversy after the government announced that it would be built on 50 acres of land belonging to the 115-year-old Regional Agriculture Research Station (RARS) in Nandyal. The local farming community urged the government not to use RARS land, as the institute served as a seed production station for several varieties of agriculture crops. The matter subsequently reached the High Court, which issued an interim stay order on the construction of the medical college on RARS land. Honouring the High Court order, the government laid the foundation stone for the project on the premises of the Nandyal government hospital. However, the project will still come up on the RARS land unless the High Court issues a final order to the contrary. Nandyal MP Pocha Brahmananda Reddy, MLC Gangula Prabhakar Reddy, Panyam MLA Katasani Rambhupal Reddy, Allagadda MLA Jitendra Reddy, Nandyal MLA Silpa Ravi Chandra Kishore Reddy, Joint Collector Manzeer Jeelani, and Nandyal Sub-Collector Kalpana Kumari attended the simple ceremony. Identify alternative location, urge locals People protested from their homes on a call given by the Rayalaseema Saagu Neeti Sadhana Samithi, displaying placards and urging the State government to honour the sentiments of the farming community by not using the RARS land and identifying an alternative location for the medical college. “Developing such a research station and land at an alternative location will take more than 10 years, whereas 25 to 30 acres of land can be acquired anywhere around Nandyal by spending Rs. 50 crore as has been done for the proposed Adoni Medical College,” said Samithi president Dasaratharami Reddy. College for backward area The foundation stone for the Adoni medical college and teaching hospital was also laid by the Chief Minister on Monday. “Adoni is one of the most backward areas of Andhra Pradesh, and setting up a teaching super-specialty hospital along with a nursing college will go a long way towards improving the health infrastructure in the region,” said Labour Minister Gummanur Jayaram. After the Chief Minister remotely laid the foundation stone for the Rs. 475-crore medical college along NH-167 between Adoni and Yemmiganur, the Labour Minister unveiled the pylon for the medical college, and said that the college would come up in 58.44 acres and serve areas like Mantralayam, Aluru, Pattikonda, and Yemmiganur that were far-off from any major health facility. District In-charge Collector S. Ramsundar Reddy, Yemmiganur MLA Chennakeshava Reddy, Adoni Municipal Chairperson Shantamma, and RDO Ramakrishna Reddy attended the function. Later, the Minister and MLAs honoured 16 persons who gave their land for the Adoni medical college.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/amid-protests-foundation-stone-laid-for-nandyal-medical-college/article34694378.ece

Barricades were erected at different places on the Chennai-Kolkata highway to regulate those coming from different parts of the State as also neighbouring Telangana and Tamil Nadu. Nellore Rural DSP Y. Harinath Reddy urged people not to rush to the village as the government was still working out an arrangement for smooth distribution of herbal preparations, including the one meant for treating asymptomatic cases. Meanwhile, TDP polit bureau member Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy welcomed the High Court’s direction.

01 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Push for free jabs, Pinarayi tells 11 CMs||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has attempted to enlist the support of his counterparts in 11 States to jointly persuade the Centre to procure and supply COVID-19 vaccines free of cost. Mr. Vijayan has tweeted: “Wrote to 11 CMs in the spirit of cooperative federalism. Quite unfortunate the Centre absolves itself of its duty to procure vaccines, ensure free universal vaccination. United effort to jointly pursue our genuine demand is the need of the hour so that the Centre acts immediately.” In his letter dated May 29, Mr. Vijayan said the Union government had taken a stance that States should resort to their own measures to procure the COVID-19 vaccine. It was the duty of the Centre to provide adequate doses to the States. Foreign pharmaceutical companies were unwilling to enter into an agreement with the States for supplying vaccines. They sought to exploit the scarce supply situation for financial gain. Ramp up production India’s public sector pharmaceutical companies should take up vaccine production to address the mismatch between demand and supply. The Central government should ensure that intellectual property rights and patent laws did not impede vaccine production, he said. Mr. Vijayan said the Central government’s bid to place the entire onus of procuring vaccines on States defied the very basis of cooperative federalism. “The need of the hour is a united effort from our side to put forth the genuine demand that the Centre procure vaccine needed by the States and distribute them free of cost. This will be more cost-effective as well.” Universal vaccination was the surefire method to build herd immunity. Mr Vijayan said he had written to the Prime Minister earlier spelling out the merits of the Centre taking the lead in assessing the vaccine requirements of the States. The Centre could then float a global tender for dosages as per the States’ need, he said. (He said he had enclosed a copy of his letter to the Prime Minister in his communication to his equivalents in other States.) Mr. Vijayan said vaccination should be free to ensure that none shall be denied the protection ‘due to lack of financial wherewithal.’ The unprecedented ‘impact of the second surge’ had caused alarm. Experts have warned of a third surge — the country required to prepare for such an eventuality, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/push-for-free-jabs-pinarayi-tells-11-cms/article34693747.ece
01 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||A new normal for curfew-hit cities||The Kerala government lifted the ban on walking and running for exercise in public spaces as part of a less stringent COVID-19 lockdown on Monday. Walking has been allowed between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. withphysical distancing and mask use. Gymnasiums, stadiums, sports complexes, parks, beaches, walking circuits, weekend destinations, and swimming pools will remain closed. Textile shops, jewellery and footwear showrooms “catering to weddings” can do business till 5 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays serving shoppers who furnish wedding cards. Casual sales is disallowed but home delivery can be made. The government will review the shutdown on June 9. A recent dip in the test positivity rate prompted the government on Saturday to lessen the intensity of regulations. The government also allowed stone crushing units and construction material shops to operate with minimal staff to cater to the building sector. A.P. curfew stays As part of its efforts to further bring down the number of cases, Andhra Pradesh extended the 12 noon to 6 a.m. curfew till June 10. People can go out for shopping and other daily chores between 6 a.m. and 12 noon and must adopt COVID-19 protocols on face masks and distancing. Prohibitory orders under Sec. 144 of the Indian Penal Code remain. The decision to extend the curfew was taken at a review meeting chaired by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. The curfew from May 5 to 18 following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19 was extended till May 31 and again to June 10. Karnataka’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monday said the State should continue the lockdown, currently in force till June 7 in a stricter form, “placing lives before livelihoods.” It was essential for the State “to continue lockdown restrictions till the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) falls below 5%, daily new cases below 5,000 and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) falls below 1%.” On Monday, Karnataka reported 16,604 new cases of which 3,992 cases were from Bengaluru Urban, and a daily test positivity rate of 13.57%. When the image of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin donning a PPE kit to go into the COVID-19 wards in the western region hit social media, it expectedly spiralled into viral status. His act of walking into the COVID-19 high-dependence units and ICUs where the sicker patients are receiving treatment, despite the advice to the contrary from doctors, brought him praise across the political spectrum, but it was likely planned as more of a confidence-building strategy. The two-week lockdown has served its purpose of reducing the burden on the healthcare system, says a senior health official. Meanwhile, efforts are on, using the epidemiological projection models to expand and strategise as per the local requirements, he adds. Health officials are hoping to use the next week to put in place a field surveillance.

01 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Nagaland bamboo finds home in Kerala||A rare bamboo from Nagaland has found a second home in picturesque Wagamon in Idukki, courtesy a conservation programme of the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI). The bamboo species, Chimonobambusa callosa , appeared to have adapted well to its new environment at the Wagamon orchidarium of the Kerala Forest Development Corporation (KFDC), JNTBGRI director R. Prakashkumar told The Hindu . An eastern Himalayan hill bamboo, Chimonobambusa callosa can grow to a height of five to 10 metres. The bambusetum at the JNTBGRI campus at Palode in the capital boasts a rich collection of bamboos, but finding a suitable home for the guest from Nagaland was easier said than done. JNTBGRI researchers had collected samples of the species from Jotsoma, above Kohima, from a height of 1,400 metres above mean sea level (msl) in February 2019. Attempts to grow the bamboo in Palode soon ran into difficulties. “Since the JNTBGRI campus is only 150-200 metres above sea level, the plant remains stunted and approached a possible degeneration,” noted Dr. Prakashkumar. Disappointed with the trial, JNTBGRI officials took up the matter with KFDC and samples were packed off to the orchidarium at Wagamon in December last year. Active growth “Wagamon is situated at 1,200 metres above sea level. By April, 2021, the bamboo plant had acclimatised well to the new habitat, regained its vigour and showed active growth,” Dr. Prakashkumar said. In its efforts to conserve the species, JNTBGRI has also heeded the United Nations’ call for ecosystem restoration, he said. JNTBGRI has plans to propagate the bamboo species in the State, given its soil-binding abilities. A long-rhizomed spreading bamboo, Chimonobambusa callosa is ideal for soil protection. Characterised by straight, green culms, with rings of thorns adorning the nodes, the bamboo also has ornamental value, according to the botanical garden.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nagaland-bamboo-finds-home-in-kerala/article34693752.ece

With the Union Ministry of Road Transportation and Highways making electronic payment mandatory at all the toll plazas in the country from February 15, the TTD has also decided to introduce it at the Alipiri checking point in Tirupati to minimise the waiting time of the visiting pilgrims. Though the point has been developed into a seven-lane toll plaza with separate lanes for cars, RTC buses and two-wheelers it often gets flooded with vehicles during weekends and on festive occasions causing a lot of inconvenience to visitors which prompted the TTD to opt for the FASTag. Simultaneously, the toll has also been hiked as per a decision taken in January by the board of trustees, which has since been approved by the government. The new rates applicable from Tuesday are: LCV/LMVs Rs. 50 each; mini buses, trucks and goods vehicles Rs. 100 and JCBs Rs. 200. Two-wheelers are totally exempted from any kind of payment. Statistics reveal that about 4,500 four-wheelers and over 1,000 two-wheelers pass through the toll plaza daily (during normal days) fetching an income of Rs. 4 crore annually. The revised rates are likely to triple the toll revenue. However, the TTD has decided to accept the toll in cash also for a couple of months for the convenience of visitors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fastag-increased-charges-at-alipiri-toll-plaza-from-today/article34694400.ece
01 June 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Complex caesarean done on COVID patient||Doctors performed a complicated caesarean surgery on a pregnant woman who was COVID-19 positive with low oxygen saturation at the time of admission. The woman hailing from Railway Kodur in Kadapa district was brought by her family members in the first week of May to Ankura Hospital here. The doctors diagnosed her with COVID-19 and oxygen saturation level (SPO2) at 70%. “The woman was refused admission in many hospitals. When we saw her, we knew it was a challenging case to deal with,” Dr. Vamsi Krishna, who led the team of surgeons, told the media on Monday.

The government should give them certificates of vaccination, he ordered, and wanted priority to be given to keeping adequate stocks of oxygen, and injections and tablets required to treat people afflicted with black fungus. In a review meeting on the containment of COVID at his camp office on Monday, Mr. Jagan said the decrease in the number of COVID positive cases and the improvement in recovery rate should not be a cause for complacency, as the turn likely to be taken by the pandemic was still unpredictable.

The positivity rate on May 16 was 25.56% and it came down to 15.91% on May 30.

01 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||CM lays foundation stone for medical college at Anakapalle||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy laid the foundation stone for construction of a new medical college at Anakapalle in the district, along with 13 other medical colleges at different places in the State, through the virtual mode from his camp office at Tadepalli on Monday. The foundation stones for construction of teaching hospitals at Paderu in Visakhapatnam district and at Pulivendula in YSR Kadapa district have already been laid by the Chief Minister in the past and the work on those two colleges has already started. Mr. Jagan said that the construction of all the 16 medical colleges would be completed at a cost of Rs. 8,000 crore by December, 2023. In addition to these, land would be given free of cost to individuals, who wish to set up super-speciality hospitals in district headquarters and municipal corporations. All these would change the health infrastructure in different districts and bring Andhra Pradesh on par with tier-1 cities like Hyderabad and Chennai, which have all super-speciality medical facilities, in the health sector, he said. While expressing her gratitude to the Chief Minister for sanctioning a medical college for Anakapalle, Ms. Jayalakshmi of the ‘jaggery town’, broke down while interacting with him through video conference. “My husband had tested COVID-19 positive and I rushed him to a hospital in the town, in an autorickshaw. I was told that his oxygen saturation level was very low and taking him to Visakhapatnam city, about 40 km away, was the only option to save him. I called ‘104’ ambulance and their timely help in rushing my husband to VIMS saved his life. He was discharged after his saturation level improved to 95,” she said. “The inclusion of COVID-19 under Aarogyasri was a boon to me as I did not have to pay for the treatment cost,” Ms. Jayalakshmi added. District Collector V. Vinay Chand informed the Chief Minister that the two hospitals to be set up at Paderu and Anakapalle in the district, would cater to the people from the tribal and rural areas respectively. In the absence of super-speciality medical facilities at these places, patients were being forced to travel for one-and-a-half to two hours to reach the city. Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnadh said that the proposed government teaching hospital would remain etched in the history of the town. It would meet the medical needs of the people of Chodavaram, Madugula and other areas, he said. Anakapalle MP B.V. Satyavathi spoke. Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-lays-foundation-stone-for-medical-college-at-anakapalle/article34694407.ece

Tobacco chewing increases the urge to spit by eight times and COVID-19 being an airborne disease, the chances of its spread through spitting in public places is very high. The COVID-19 can cause severe infection in smokers with bad lungs and low pulmonary immunity and can cause high mortality, he said. During the lockdown, smoking indoors increases the chances of second-hand smoking in the family members, Dr. Murali Krishna said in a statement on the occasion of World No Tobacco Day. The theme for 2021 is “Commit to quit”. He appealed to all the smokers to take the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to quit the habit of smoking and chewing tobacco. Tobacco affects all systems and a major etiological factor for the NCD (Non-Communicable Diseases) like cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular accidents, cancer, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary diseases etc. More than 20% of global tuberculosis cases can be attributed to smoking. Second hand smoking affects children, family and friends. Tobacco smoke has over 7,000 chemicals of which about 100 are proven to be carcinogenic. It’s never too late to quit smoking, says K.S. Phaneendra Kumar, consultant pulmonologist, KIMS ICON Hospital. People who quit get many benefits, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/smoking-increases-the-risk-of-contracting-covid-19-warn-doctors/article34694405.ece

In a letter to the Chief Minister, Mr. Sarma quoted a news report which says that over 50 sanitation workers in the State have lost their lives in the programme but their kin are yet to get the benefits under the scheme. A sum of Rs. 50 lakh has to be paid to the kin of those covered under the programme. Mr. Sarma said that the local bodies and other State agencies, which should have proactively intervened and processed the sanitation workers’ claims have not cared to discharge their responsibility. The insurance companies, which are PSUs under the Union government, have also failed to reach out to the sanitation workers’ families, he said. The scheme applies to all COVID frontline workers and there are hundreds more of such workers, who are in the same pitiable condition, he said.

In a statement here on Monday, party district committee secretary K. Lokanadham criticised the move of the Centre in hiking the prices of petroleum products after the conclusion of the elections in five States in the country. The prices were either stable or had decreased slightly till the counting process began on May 2. After the declaration of results, the prices began rising steadily and are galloping for the past three weeks, he said. On May 31, the price of petrol was Rs. 99.39 and diesel was Rs. 93.71 in Visakhapatnam. The Centre was hiking the prices of petroleum products, when the international prices of crude oil was on the decline. The Centre had given the freedom to oil companies to revise the prices on a daily basis and the burden was falling on the consumers, Mr Lokanadham said.

During a search operation, a joint squad of Venkatapuram police and the CRPF personnel nabbed Boodu after a brief chase, when the latter allegedly tried to flee along with several other militia members on noticing the police in the Pamunuru forest area on Sunday afternoon, police added. Presenting the arrested militia member and the seized explosive material before the media in Mulugu on Monday, Mulugu District Superintendent of Police Sangram Singh Patil said Boodu was apprehended while trying to plant the landmines/IEDs in the forest area near Pamunuru. He was acting on the instructions of Maoist leaders of Wajedu-Venkatapuram area committee to target the combing parties. He was involved in around 28 cases of Maoist violence, including the murder of Bheemeshwara Rao at Alubaka in October last year, and planting of IEDs, landmines and spikes in the forest areas frequented by the combing parties in Venkatapuram and Wajedu mandals in the past few years, the SP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/maoist-held-in-mulugu/article34694310.ece

01 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Public heave a sigh of relief with lockdown easing||The frenetic pace of the morning hours eased on Monday in Hyderabad as citizens adjusted to the longer hours allowing free movement as part of the COVID-19 ‘unlockdown’ procedure. On Sunday, the Telangana government had taken a decision to allow free movement of citizens from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. with an additional hour to return home. Traffic eases The pop-up vegetable markets that have started in many areas of the city were not as crowded on Monday as they were for the past 20 days. The flow of traffic in city junctions was smooth as restaurants, shops, electronic goods retailers, and even cloth shops remained open till 1 p.m. before police moved around with wailing sirens asking shopkeepers to down their shutters. Fuel stations are being allowed to function round the clock But in some areas there was heavy traffic. “I travelled from Banjara Hills to Gachibowli at 8 a.m. it took me a lot of time due to traffic. But while returning at 10 a.m. there was hardly any traffic,” said Y.V.S. Prasad, a businessman from Khairatabad. “We were planning to return home earlier before lunch hour. But because of the longer time of relaxation we started at noon to return,” said Sailaja, who had to attend the 11th day funeral observances of her father. Earlier, many families had to change their plans as the e-pass applications have been rejected or the site https://policeportal.tspolice.gov.in/ did not function. “My brother-in-law passed away on May 13, 2021 a few death related formalities are pending, I applied for e-pass but it was rejected so applied another e-pass please accept Sir. TS-G2105290235466XX,” said one gentleman on social media. Electronic retailers have announced extension of their business hours. Metro running time has also been increased with the last train starting at 11.45 a.m. easing the pressure on public transport as Telangana State Road Transport Corporation buses could be seen plying beyond 1 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/public-heave-a-sigh-of-relief-with-lockdown-easing/article34694295.ece
01 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||New medical colleges to boost doctors’ numbers in State||The decision of the Cabinet on Sunday to sanction seven new medical colleges will further bolster the ratio of doctors per one thousand population in the State which is already much higher than the national average and the World Health Organisation norms. The State has about 37,000 doctors registered with the Telangana Medical Council and every year nearly 3,600 medical graduates pass out of colleges. While the national average is 1 : 1,456 and WHO prescribed 1 : 1,000, the ratio in Telangana is about 1 : 900 for a population of 3.5 crore. However, the ratio is poor in rural areas because there are fewer takers for government jobs. Telangana has nine medical colleges in government and twenty-three in private sector, beside the ESI institution in Hyderabad and Bibinagar campus of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where nearly 6,500 seats are available for admission in the first year of MBBS. With the commissioning of the seven new medical colleges whenever it takes place, the seats will go up to 7,200 even if the intake is considered at the base level of 100 per college. There are also 2,000 post-graduate seats in six out of nine government colleges. The colleges at Nalgonda, Suryapet and Siddipet are yet to apply for PG seats. The Cabinet approved the colleges at Nagarkurnool, Wanaparthy, Mancherial, Jagtial, Sangareddy, Mahbubabad and Kothagudem. But, their opening will take time because the government has to set up 300 bed hospitals for each college, beside other infrastructure before making a formal application to the Ministry of Health, which will in turn direct the Medical Council of India to look into the permissions. Of the 6,500 MBBS seats available in every batch across the State, the private colleges and ESI account for 5,000 seats. The first batch with fifty students was admitted at AIIMS only last year. In the government sector, Osmania, Gandhi and Kakatiya medical colleges have 250 seats each while colleges in Mahbubnagar and Siddipet have 175 seats, Nalgonda and Suryapet 150 each and Nizamabad and RIMS Adilabad 120 each. cording to Dr. B. Karunakar Reddy, Vice-Chancellor, Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences, barring four at Karimnagar, Narketpally and Mahbubangar, all the private medical colleges had proliferated around Hyderabad. The pass percentage of final year students who took the exams in April - May was 96.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/new-medical-colleges-to-boost-doctors-numbers-in-state/article34694301.ece
01 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Banks in State to work 10 a.m-2 p.m. from today||Beginning June 1, bank branches in Telangana will have 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. as their business hours or the time when public is permitted to access services through such facilities. Announcing the new schedule, following a meeting on Monday, the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) said besides adhering to the business hours, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the branches will need to close by 4 p.m. The change, from the 8 a.m. to 12 noon working hours that the banks adopted following the State government-announced lockdown about a fortnight ago, comes in the backdrop of a relaxation in the lockdown, daily, from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. The new bank timing will be in force, till the lockdown ends on June 9. “If required, the same would be reviewed for further extension,” SLBC Convenor and SBI General Manager Krishan Sharma said. The decision, on the new timing, is to ensure that the “general population of Telangana is not put to any inconvenience and can carry out their banking transactions with ease during [the] lockdown period,” he said. As regards deploying staff on a rotational basis, something many banks had resorted to amid the second wave of the pandemic, the SLBC communication said “the respective controllers/State heads of banks will take a decision on deployment of staff on roster basis or otherwise at branches and administrative offices.” “We reiterate that the Controllers may exercise discretion in consultation with District Administrations and LDMs for any unforeseen situations to safeguard the health of general public and more of bank staff,” the communication said. The bank timings are expected to have no impact on the operations of ATMs. “The services of ATMs will be available as usual,” he said in a release. Incidentally, the SLBC had last month decided on 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. as business hours of the bank branches, in the backdrop of a sharp increase in the number COVID-19 positive cases, but could not proceed for want of approval from the State government.  Respective controllers/State heads of banks will take a decision on deployment of staff on roster basis or otherwise.

01 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Infectious SARS-CoV2 variant spreading rapidly across country||B.1.617.2, a sub-lineage of the so-called double mutated Indian variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617) which is more infectious, is currently increasing its footprint in the entire country and gradually even eclipsing the B.1.1.7 variant originated from the United Kingdom, said top scientists at the CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) on Monday. “It is fast becoming the dominant strain, and very efficiently. It is also seen to be spreading even in Delhi and Punjab where the UK variant was earlier found to be prevalent to the extent of 80-90%. Cases may be coming down due to the lockdowns, but the virus is still around. Face masks are the only weapon apart from vaccination to prevent it from spreading,” said former director and now adviser to CCMB, Rakesh Mishra. In the current second wave, the low Ct (cycle threshold) value has been apparent indicating the high viral loads, possibly contributing to more people getting infected. Similarly, it was also noticed that a significant number of those infected have been needing oxygen support. “We have to analyse why this has been happening and if the disease is progressing faster by taking the samples from the hospitals, genome sequencing and have an interaction between doctors and scientists. What we have is anecdotal account and this needs to be backed by scientific research. This is the right time to do it when the pressure has somewhat eased on the healthcare system,” he observed. Under close watch The new mutation is being kept under close watch with 10 designated laboratories, under INSCOG or Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequencing Group, taking up genome sequencing of the patients’ swab samples from different geographical locations across the country. “We are able to pick the information so far but we need to do epidemiological studies based on the data. With more labs joining this effort, we are going to increase our genome sequencing numbers to understand the virus transmission in the population. The virus will come out with new versions and we have to watch out for those which could escape our immune systems — trained by natural infection or by vaccination,” said the CCMB scientist. The way out to prevent further surges is to ramp up testing and surveillance. “The biggest opportunity is when the cases are low, we should for the kill by continuing with the testing, tracing and isolation till we get rid of the pandemic status. If the face masks are worn properly over nose and mouth — surgical masks, triple-layered cloth masks or N-95 — it can protect any person against any variant without exception as the virus can only spread from person to person,” he affirmed. This along with avoidance of “clustering of people will fetch the same results of a lockdown keeping the virus spread under control”, added Dr. Mishra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/infectious-sars-cov2-variant-spreading-rapidly-across-country/article34694274.ece
01 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Healthcare is State subject, says Kishan Reddy||Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said that while the Centre has been making all out efforts to ensure everybody gets vaccinated by the year-end, the States too should get involved since “health is a State subject.” Talking to the media after visiting the Chest Hospital on Monday, the Minister urged State governments and the Opposition parties to desist from criticising the Centre, and instead join hands to combat the pandemic unitedly. “There is malicious propaganda against the Modi government and people are being misled with false allegations about the vaccination programme. Those who criticised the indigenously made vaccines are now clamouring for them. The Centre has a clear plan to vaccinate 136 crore population with 250 crore vaccine supplies,” he said. Supplies are going to come from ramped up production of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik from various firms working round the clock. Talks on Besides, vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and others are likely to be available soon and talks are on with Pfizer to import their vaccines, he said. “Health is the prime responsibility of the State and Centre can only substitute, yet it has been providing 50% vaccines free, ensuring adequate supply of medicines, oxygen, etc., besides giving speedy clearances. States and private hospitals are permitted to procure vaccines or medicines cleared by the regulatory authorities abroad," said Mr. Reddy. Later in a virtual press conference, the Minister said the Ministry of Surface Transport, Roads & Highways has cleared a total of 33 road projects in Telangana at a total cost of Rs. 18,492 crore for 1.272 km. This includes 13 National Highway projects of 485 km estimated to cost Rs. 11,530 crore and other 20 road works like strengthening, geometric corrections, missing links and major bridges of 787 km estimated to cost Rs. 6,962 crore. Mr. Reddy requested the government to expedite land acquisition with the Centre assuring to bear 50% of the cost and provide all the necessary plans and drawings at the earliest.   Tenders for choosing a consultant for the proposed Regional Ring Road of 340 km estimated to cost Rs. 17,000 crore - touching 127 villages and 15 National/State Highways, will be opened tomorrow, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/healthcare-is-state-subject-says-kishan-reddy/article34694299.ece
01 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Alternative drug for Black Fungus treatment unveiled||Speciality biopharmaceutical firm Celon Laboratories is launching an alternative drug, Amphotericin B Emulsion, for the treatment of Mucormycosis, the fungal infection better known as Black Fungus, whose growing incidence is the latest health worry for the country grappling with the second wave of COVID-19. The new drug will be available in the market in a week. While pricing is yet to be finalised, the maximum retail price is expected to be in the band of Rs. 4,000 - Rs. 4,500 per vial. Amphotericin API, soyabean oil, egg lecithin and glycerin figure in the list of ingredients of the new drug, sources said. An increase in the number of people contracting the infection in recent weeks had led to a surge in demand of the drugs indicated for the treatment, especially Amphotericin B, which the company said, is crucial to the treatment of Mucormycosis. Though Celon has been manufacturing Liposomal Amphotericin B since 2013, market demands were not met due to the unavailability of a critical ingredient sourced from Germany — lipoids. To bypass the bottleneck caused by this sourcing obstacle and increase production of this medication, the company developed an alternative, an emulsion-based formulation. Developed by the in-house research and development team in just three weeks, the emulsion-based formulation will provide leading hospitals and COVID-19 treatment centres with increased resources to treat the Black Fungus. Celon will manufacture 10,000 vials per day, which will ensure relief for approximately 6,000 patients monthly, the release said. Managing Director M. Nagesh Kumar said the emulsion-based formulation is an ideal alternative to Liposomal Amphotericin B to combat Black Fungus. The company will start supplying in the domestic market soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/alternative-drug-for-black-fungus-treatment-unveiled/article34694272.ece
01 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Metro rail timings extended till 1 p.m. from today||The last train of the metro rail service will leave the terminal station at 1 p.m. instead of 11.45 a.m. and reach the destination by 2 p.m. from Tuesday. There is, however, no change in the starting time of the metro trains and the first train will start from the terminal station at 7 a.m. The change in timings follows the extension of relaxation by three more hours in the lockdown hours announced by the State government which became operational from Monday. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar asked the metro rail authorities to extend the services of metro rail by an hour or so, enabling the passengers to reach their destinations without any inconvenience. The Chief Secretary made the request after inspecting the metro train service arrangements and COVID-19 protocols at the metro stations on Monday. Accompanied by HMRL managing director N.V.S. Reddy and L&T MRHL managing director K.V.B. Reddy, the Chief Secretary travelled by a metro rain from Khairatabad station to Ameerpet metro inter-change station this morning. He interacted with the passengers and enquired about the train services, safety measures and other aspects. Passengers expressed satisfaction at the facilities and safety arrangements and requested that the timings be extended so that they could reach home comfortably after the closure of offices/businesses. The Chief Secretary congratulated the two senior officials for the good service that was being provided to the commuters during the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/metro-rail-timings-extended-till-1-pm-from-today/article34694291.ece
01 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Left entirely to their own means||Volunteers and NGOs have donned the mantle of medical professionals in Ghattuppal village of Chandur mandal in Nalgonda district where close to 170 persons have officially tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and six persons reportedly died. An isolation centre being run in the village through crowd funding is providing beds for 35 patients. Several others have been isolated at homes, with medicines and food being provided from outside. Even for tests, the villagers are forced to depend on philanthropists, as the number of kits provided by government is insufficient. Efforts by the volunteers began about two weeks ago, after a second COVID-19 death in the village rang alarm bells. People made beeline to the nearest primary health centre 25 kilometres away, only to be told that mere 25 rapid tests were being conducted per day for the whole mandal. “We called Dial 100 and complained about the situation. On May 19, district medical authorities arrived with 50 kits. MLA Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy sponsored 100 more kits, and on May 19, we took 111 samples. Of them 40 turned out to be positive,” narrated B.Maheshwar, a social worker and native of Ghattuppal, who is spearheading the voluntary work. Two ANMs and six ASHA workers, together with a lab technician from the same village who works in Hyderabad helped conduct the tests. So far, over 600 rapid tests have been conducted, with 400 kits sponsored by Mr. Rajagopal Reddy and 200 supplied by the government. “A group of us started an isolation centre too so that those infected can stay away from families. Stigma surrounds the disease, so no one admits to testing positive. Several in the village are getting tested in Hyderabad, whose details are not with us. Government should take up a fever survey here,” Mr. Maheshwar says. Crowd funding A ‘Ghattuppal Corona Sahaya Nidhi’ has been started for the crowd funding initiative, where alumni from the village’s school are donating via a social media group. Apart from cooking and providing food for the patients at the isolation centre, the volunteers, numbering about 20, are also supplying nutritious food to about 100 families in self isolation. Medicine kits numbering 500 have been supplied by an NGO ‘Street Cause’, while volunteers visit each infected household with pulse oximeters to check oxygen saturation levels of patients. “To bear the hospitalisation cost for a village youngster at Hyderabad, we generated funds to the tune of Rs. 16 lakh, partly from ‘Milaap’, a crowdfunding platform, and partly through direct donations,” Mr. Maheshwar shared. Absence of doctor for consultation, however, renders all their humanitarian efforts insufficient. Though the isolation centre has two oxygen cylinders with 35 litre capacity, they are not being used for the patients in distress, due to unavailability of doctors and medical staff. Instead, patients in requirement of oxygen are being kept on nebuliser.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/left-entirely-to-their-own-means/article34694293.ece

Speaking to reporters here on the seven-year rule of Mr. Modi, he said the present pandemic yet again proved the farcical governance. The dictatorial and selfish politics of Mr. Modi has severely impacted the way COVID-19 was handled and this adds to the huge list of failures in the last seven years, he said. The foundations of secularism are shattered, religion-based political interests are pursued and bred in the society to incite communal discord, he alleged. Mr. Lakshmaiah said the democratic values have been completely give a go by and it’s reflected the way Congress governments in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh were toppled using political might and money bags. Party-switching for the sake of government formation, is rife where, being in the government and forming the government are the only ambitions that Modi government has nurtured. Describing the seven-year rule as deceptive on promises made and delivered, he said - no corruption and no black money, two crore jobs every year, price reduction in all essential necessities’ - have just remained slogans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/modi-sacrificed-countrys-future-for-his-political-benefit-ponnala/article34694305.ece

Consultant radiation oncologist at Apollo Cancer Institute, P. Vijay Karan Reddy spoke about World Health Organisation’s (WHO) ‘Commit to Quit’ campaign and shared a few tips to curb cravings to smoke, saying one can try to delay the urge by keeping busy, or having a lollipop, chips or chewing gum instead. “WHO recommends the use of nicotine patches and gums but they are more effective when prescribed by your doctor based on your dependence. Take a deep breath for 10 seconds which will help you reduce your anxiety. Drink a lot of water. Do something else to distract yourself — go for a walk, watch TV, play a sport or spend time with family,” he said. Devender Singh, senior vascular surgeon at Yashoda Hospitals, said that the risk of severe infection, requirements of ventilator support and death are doubled in patients who are active smokers. “Smoking causes more deaths in COVID-19 infections. In the absence of proper treatment for COVID-19 infection, smoking remains a detrimental factor in the outcome,” he added. Voluntary Health Association of India has stated that a few Indian sports personalities have pledged to protect the youth and the next generation from the ful effects of tobacco use.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/smoking-increases-risk-of-covid-severity-doctors/article34694268.ece

01 June 2021||K Shiva ShankerHYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Most queries are regarding vaccine slot||‘Where can I get COVID-19 vaccine at the earliest date?’— This is one of the most asked questions by people in the 18-44 age group. Heads of a few major corporate hospitals in Telangana, who are awaiting the doses, too do not have a definite answer to this question. There are two reasons for amplified curiosity : (1) Booking a slot through CoWin has become a challenge. (B) Only people above 45 years are being provided with the vaccine (second dose) at Government COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (GCVC). The Telangana government is vaccinating people in high-risk group such as fruits and vegetable vendors. With this, the only option for people in the 18-44 age group in non-high-risk groups is to get vaccinated at Private CVCs. Several people have been trying from past several days to book a slot through CoWin but did not succeed yet. They wanted to know when would they find slots easily. This is directly linked to availability of vaccine doses. “Currently, no one can put finger on a date and say ‘the vaccines supply will increase henceforth’. Until a few weeks ago, we anticipated supply will increase from June 15. But now we are cautious and do not announce any dates,” said the head of a corporate hospital who did not want to be quoted. One more hospital’s management too shared the same observation and wondered how their counterparts managed to get the doses. While some of them have managed to get the vaccine doses and started conducting mass vaccination drives at gated communities and corporate companies, a few are still awaiting for their stock.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/most-queries-are-regarding-vaccine-slot/article34694281.ece

01 June 2021||New Delhi,||HC pulls up drug controller for ‘trash’ report in Gambhir case||The Delhi High Court on Monday rejected as ‘trash’ the status report filed by the drug controller on the issue of BJP MP Gautam Gambhir procuring huge amount of Fabiflu, used for treating COVID patients, when they were in short supply in the Capital. “This tendency of people trying to take advantage and then trying to appear as saviour. This has to be denounced,” a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh remarked pointing at the action of the former cricketer. The High Court said the drug controller has not done any investigation on how “a large consignment” of 2,343 strips of Tab Fabiflu was supplied to the Gautam Gambhir Foundation, which is not a medical practitioner. Questionable stand It termed as ‘questionable’ the drug controller’s stand that the drug was not in short supply. “You [drug controller] are wrong to say it was not in short supply. You want us to shut our eyes. You can’t take us for a ride. If you think we are so gullible, we are naïve, we will give you back hard. You better do you job.” While the drug controller argued that the Tab Fabiflu was bought by the Foundation through one Dr. Manish of Garg Hospital, the court asked how Mr. Gambhir was able to purchase it just because Garg Hospital said it. “Can anybody take a letter from a hospital and say give it [drug] to me... Here is a man who is hoarding thousands of strips of medicines. He is interrupting the flow of medicines,” the Bench said. “You’ve not even bothered to see if it was legal to supply drugs to the Foundation,” it told the drug controller. It directed the drug controller to submit a ‘better’ status report after taking into account the factual contradictions and legal provisions. The court also said the former cricketer has to be ‘mindful’ of the action he has taken. “Thousands of needy people who could have got these medicines were unable to do so. Two hundred and eighty five strips were left. This shows that he procured more than what was required,” it said. “If it continues, we know how to deal with it.” The court also noted it was not satisfied with the status report into allegations of procuring and hoarding medical oxygen made against AAP MLA Praveen Kumar. The court’s direction came while hearing a petition seeking lodging of an FIR against politicians who allegedly were able to procure COVID-19 drugs in huge quantity. It will hear the case again on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-pulls-up-drug-controller-for-trash-report-in-gambhir-case/article34694245.ece
01 June 2021||New Delhi,||Court quashes two Delhi govt. orders on private school fees||The High Court on Monday quashed two separate orders issued last year by the Delhi government restraining private schools in the city from collection of annual charges and development fees from students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Justice Jayant Nath said the orders “are prejudicial to the said schools and would cause an unreasonable restriction in their functioning”. The court directed that the amount payable by students would be paid in six monthly instalments from June 10 onwards. The court’s direction came on plea by the Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools, a registered association with approximately 450 private unaided schools functioning in Delhi as its members. The association had challenged the orders issued by the Department of Education, Delhi government, on April 18, 2020 and August 28, 2020 in so far as it prevented private unaided schools from collecting annual charges and development fees even beyond the lockdown period and deferring it till physical opening of the schools. They argued that even during the pandemic, the schools were directed and encouraged to take up online teaching and learning so that there was no discontinuity in imparting education to the children. The annual charges relate to hostel running expenses, administrative and general expenses, rents, communication expenses, printing and stationery, electricity and water charges among others. Development fees pertains to expenditure related to furniture, benches, chairs, wall panelling, green/black boards, computers, projectors and others items. ‘Rights curtailed’ The association argued that the action of the Delhi government curtailed their rights to fix their own fees. The Delhi government, on the other hand, argued that the lockdown was still in operation and, therefore, the two orders continued to be in operation. It argued that “on account of acute financial pressure and stress on the general public owing to the pandemic and measures imposed to deal with it having not abated, in such a situation the attempt of the private school to burden the parents by seeking to recover amounts presuming that normal physical functioning has resumed is harsh, unfair and unjust”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/court-quashes-two-delhi-govt-orders-on-private-school-fees/article34694255.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Man decides to help needy soon after recovering from COVID-19||In the first week of April, 33-year-old Himanshu Nagia contracted COVID-19 with mild symptoms. After recovering in two weeks, he decided to extend support to the needy at a time when the pandemic was raging. Mr. Nagia, resident of East Delhi’s Krishna Nagar working at a Noida-based IT company, has two kids, wife and a 60-year-old mother living with him in their multistorey residence. However, for 20-odd days, the man almost stayed in his car which he had turned into an emergency response vehicle. One can find water bottle cartons, medicines, two small oxygen cylinders, oxygen cans, thermometer and oximeters, PPE kits and gloves among other essential items. “The thought came to me when a neighbour called for help. He needed oxygen cylinder for his sister-in-law and to arrange for the same, we went to Rajouri Garden gurudwara where I realised that there were so many people who were coming in rickshaws and autos. So I thought I can try helping them using my vehicle,” he said, adding that he visited a gurudwara in Geeta Colony who was helping people with oxygen at the time and told them he would be willing to help anyone with transportation as not everyone could afford an ambulance. “I had just recovered from COVID-19 and doctors said that I would have enough antibodies for the next three months so I made use of it”. On April 26, Mr. Nagia received his first call to help transporting a patient from Krishna Nagar to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital. He recalled how he wore a PPE kit and created a cabin in his car as a precautionary measure and helped the person. Helped 23 people In the next few weeks till May 20, he helped 23 people with transportation apart from helping people and also learnt how to use the oxygen flow meter which is used along with the oxygen cylinder to set the flow. For the last week and a half, he hasn’t received any desperate calls except for ration but he continues to visit Seemapuri cremation ground to help with the last rites of unclaimed bodies. So far, while showing some transaction receipts, he said that he has spent more than Rs. 2 lakh in the process, but has now started to crowdsfund because he has spent more than what he thought he could. “Last year, we didn’t go out anywhere, so I saved and used that money for this work,” he said.  At work, he said that his clients are usually from the U.S. and the U.K., therefore, he used to manage at night and sometimes, only rarely during the day. “My office has been supportive. There was an instance when I had to drive a person and I had a client call. I requested them for 10 minutes silence,” he said. Talking about keeping his family safe, he said that he didn’t come in direct contact with his children or mother because they have never contracted the virus so far. The house if big enough to maintain distance. “For 20 days which were very dangerous, I used the washroom in our parking and now, when I go home, I bathe in sanitiser and wear a double mask even inside the house,” he said. A colleague of Mr. Nagia’s said that he helped her at 10 p.m. with oxygen cans when she was in dire need for her brother-in-law.  I had just recovered from COVID-19 and doctors said that I would have enough antibodies for the next three months so I made use of it Himanshu Nagia||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/man-decides-to-help-needy-soon-after-recovering-from-covid-19/article34694250.ece

A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel observed that a party cannot be permitted to reopen a case under the pretext of a review. “Even the judgment given subsequent to the decision in a case can be no ground for entertaining the review. Review lies only when there is error apparent on the face of the record and that fallibility is by the oversight of the court,” the Bench observed. It observed, “If a party is aggrieved of a judgment, it must approach the higher court.” The observations came when the tribunal was hearing a plea by brick kiln owners who contended that operations should be permitted during the monsoon months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/tribunal-dismisses-plea-to-review-ban-on-brick-kilns/article34694247.ece

A Bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Najmi Waziri asked the Centre to ensure that in these extraordinary circumstances when vaccines are urgently needed for saving lives, the untapped potential in the country is not taken away by foreigners. The Bench questioned the Centre for not processing Panacea’s case on priority as it was producing the same product which has been produced by the Russian company initially and asked as to what more was required to be done in this regard. It termed as “disturbing” the Centre’s reply, filed in the case, saying the authorities were virtually saying they are not aware of what the firm has been doing and its relation with Sputnik.  The Bench said the Centre’s officers are required to show some sensitivity and urgency in the matter.

01 June 2021||LUCKNOW,||Man accused of rape, unlawful conversion gets bail in U.P.||The Allahabad High Court has granted bail to a man booked under the new unlawful conversion law in Uttar Pradesh noting that the victim, an adult, had gone with him to a hotel room, where he allegedly raped her, “on her own sweet-will”. The court noted that the girl and the accused “were in a relationship since long and she used to spend time with the applicant and used to travel with him and went to a room of a hotel on her own sweet-will”. Last December, Sonu Rajpoot alias Zubair had been booked for rape, cheating and criminal intimidation and also slapped with with Sections 3/5 of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religion Conversion Act by the Nauchandi police in Meerut district. The lawyer of the accused citing the FIR argued that the girl had on her free will travelled with the man as they were in a relationship and the two used to spend time together. The woman had alleged that the man established physical relationship with her “against her wishes”, which amounts to rape. She also alleged that she did not know his religious identity till she saw his real name in the register of the hotel. The man’s lawyer argued that there was some dispute between the two relating to their community and as such their relationship could not materialise. The accused side also argued that while the alleged rape was reported to have happened on November 28, 2020, the woman lodged the FIR on December 29. A medical examination of the woman done on January 4, 2020, showed no signs of use of force, they further argued. The victim is a major and working and as such was very well aware of worldly affairs, the counsel for the accused argued. While granting bail to the man, Justice Samit Gopal on May 27 noted, “Looking to the facts and circumstances of this case, the nature of evidence and also the absence of any convincing material to indicate the possibility of tampering with the evidence, this court is of the view that the applicant may be enlarged on bail.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/man-accused-of-rape-unlawful-conversion-gets-bail-in-up/article34694259.ece

Speaking at the inauguration of multiple infrastructure works, Mr. Thackeray said, “I was really concerned when I saw crowd on the streets of Mumbai today. We have not yet lifted lockdown restrictions in Mumbai and Maharashtra as corona scare is not over yet.” The Chief Minister added that the lockdown restrictions had already slowed down various developmental works in the city and in the State. “If crowding continues, then ongoing works too will have to be stopped. If crowd continues on roads of Mumbai then we will have to impose stricter restrictions in the city,” he said. Mr. Thackeray was presiding over the programmes including inauguration of the Metro line testing between Dahanukarwadi and Aarey Metro station and stone-laying ceremony of underground and elevated road on the Western Express Highway (T1 and T2) and book launch of ‘Multiplicities’ and e-inauguration of one-side-arm of Rajnoli flyover towards Thane and Durgadi flyover, organised by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority.

Plans are afoot to make such plants functional in 24 other rural hospitals. The objective, according to Pune Zilla Parishad chief executive officer, would be to make all State-run hospitals in rural Pune self-sufficient in oxygen. “The lethal second wave has been characterised by an acute oxygen shortage. Sourcing it through private suppliers is a problematic process,” Mr. Prasad said. While the surge in Pune’s rural areas have yet to show a notable fall,a strategy, administration authorities said, had been to use corporate social responsibility effectively and bypass the usual, cumbersome government procurement methods. “This has ensured advance payments to suppliers who in turn have ensured quick supply of vital equipment and supplies during the crisis,” Mr. Prasad said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pune-administration-strives-to-make-all-rural-hospitals-self-sufficient-in-oxygen/article34693930.ece

A total of 500 deaths were added to the State’s progressive death toll, of which 184 occurred in the last week. Of the 184, as many as 133 were recorded in the last 48 hours while 316 had been added in the ongoing ‘reconciliation’ process, as per the State Health Department. The total death toll has now climbed to 95,344 with the State’s case fatality rate rising to 1.66%. The State’s total cases have touched 57,46,892 while its cumulative recoveries have gone up to 53,95,370 with the recovery rate rising to 93.55%. “Of a total 3,50,55,054 laboratory samples tested thus far, 57,46,892 (with the average case positivity falling incrementally to 16.39%) have returned positive with over 1.94 lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said. Pune reported a comparatively low spike of 1,083 new cases of which Pune city recorded just 180 new ones. As per the State Health Department figures, nine deaths were reported as the fatality toll rose to 12,507. Mumbai recorded 666 new cases to take its total case tally to 7,05,288 while the active count has declined further to 24,850. As many as 29 fatalities took the city’s toll to 14,826. In western Maharashtra, Kolhapur topped the case surge in the ‘sugar belt’ districts, registering more than 1,800 new ones as its total tally reached 1,14,163 of whom 18,557 are active.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtras-active-cases-fall-to-253-lakh/article34693928.ece
01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||As births decline, China to allow couples to have third child||China will for the first time allow couples to have a third child, the country’s government said on Monday, in a further relaxation of family planning rules five years after a “two-child policy” largely failed to boost birth rates. The announcement followed a meeting of the 25-member Politburo, chaired by China’s President and Communist Party of China General Secretary Xi Jinping, “to hear reports on major policy measures to actively address the ageing of population during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025)”, State media said. The change comes less than three weeks after the release of China’s once-in-a-decade population census that painted an alarming picture of declining births. The National Bureau of Statistics said on May 11 that 12 million babies were born last year, the lowest number since 1961, a time when Mao’s China was in the midst of a four-year famine, and down from 17.86 million in 2016. The census said China’s population was 1.41 billion in 2020, an increase of 72 million since the last census in 2010, reflecting a 5.38% growth in this period and a 0.53% annual growth. Forecasts say the population could peak in the next couple of years and most likely by 2025, when India will become the world’s most populous country. Dire situation Some Chinese demographers said the announcement on Monday, coming so soon after the census, suggested the situation could be more dire than the official numbers indicated. “Maybe it’s because the real population data is too scary,” Yi Fuxian, a demographer, told the South China Morning Post ( SCMP ). “Even if they have not published it, it probably frightened the decision makers.” The census recorded 264 million in the age group of 60 and over, up 5.44% since 2010 and accounting for 18.70% of the population. Those in the 15-59 age group were 894 million persons, down by 6.79% since 2010 and accounting for 63.35% of the population. China’s workforce in the 15-59 age bracket peaked at 925 million in 2011, according to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said previously. That number was down to 894 million in this census and would drop to 700 million by 2050. Huang Wenzheng, a fellow at the Center for China and Globalisation, in Beijing, told official broadcaster China Global Television Network (CGTN) following the release of the census that the ageing crisis “might be the biggest challenge the Chinese nation faces in the next century.” It is, however, unclear if the new announcement may address the problem, at least if the past five years are any indication. China introduced a “two child policy” in 2016, but the wide consensus is that it failed to have the desired impact. Surveys carried out by Chinese media attributed financial pressures as one main reason. A 2015 survey by the government said 70% of respondents attributed financial reasons for choosing to not have many children. An online poll on Monday of 31,000 respondents conducted by the official Xinhua news agency found 28,000 “would not consider at all” having three children, while 1,600 said they would, the SCMP reported. The poll was subsequently removed, the newspaper said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/as-births-decline-china-to-allow-couples-to-have-third-child/article34693687.ece
01 June 2021||Jerusalem,||‘Many obstacles’ remain in bid to oust Netanyahu, says Lapid||Israeli Opposition leader Yair Lapid on Monday said many obstacles remain before a diverse coalition can be built to oust veteran Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but voiced hope it will achieve the “greater goal”. Mr. Lapid, a secular centrist, has been locked in talks with the right-wing nationalist Naftali Bennett on the terms of a “change alliance” that also hinges on an array of other parties ahead of a Wednesday midnight deadline. Former TV anchor Mr. Lapid’s chances of success rose when tech millionaire Mr. Bennett, despite their ideological differences, said on Sunday he would join a “national unity government” in which the two men would take turns to serve as premier. Israel’s latest political turmoil comes more than two months after Israel’s fourth inconclusive election in less than two years and could topple the right-wing leader known as Bibi who has ruled for a total of 15 years. It also follows Israel’s bloody 11-day conflict with Islamist group Hamas in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza that ended with a May 21 ceasefire. A viable anti-Netanyahu coalition would still need the support of other parties and lawmakers to gain a majority of 61 seats in the 120-member Knesset, Israel’s legislature. But while Mr. Lapid warned of remaining hurdles, he also sought to strike a cautiously upbeat note. “We’ll have to overcome them together,” he told members of his Yesh Atid (There is a Future) party. “That’s our first test — to see if we can find smart compromises in the coming days to achieve the greater goal.” Mr. Netanyahu warned on Sunday that a left-wing government would be “dangerous to the state of Israel”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/many-obstacles-remain-in-bid-to-oust-netanyahu-says-lapid/article34693674.ece
01 June 2021||Austin,||Democrat walk-out scuppers Bill for Texas vote overhaul||Democrats in the Texas legislature used a dramatic walk-out late on Sunday to torpedo Republican plans for a restrictive voting Bill that President Joe Biden had decried as voter suppression and an “assault on democracy”. The law would — among other changes — make mail-in voting more difficult by requiring voters to give extra information, bar local officials from sending absentee ballot applications to anyone who did not request one, and end after-hours and drive-through voting. Supporters say Senate Bill 7 is designed to make voting more secure, but critics say it aims to make it more cumbersome for ethnic-minority voters, who tend to vote Democrat. “Republicans came into the legislative session hell-bent on passing legislation that would rig our democracy for their team,” Democrat state representative Jessica Gonzalez tweeted after the walk-out. “Tonight, Texas Dems drew a line in the sand and made it clear that we will fight day and night, every tactic available to us, for your right to vote.” The Bill could yet make it into law. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he would call a special session to get it through the legislature.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/democrat-walk-out-scuppers-bill-for-texas-vote-overhaul/article34693676.ece
01 June 2021||Copenhagen,||U.S. spied on Merkel, European allies with Danish help: media||The U.S. spied on top politicians in Europe, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, from 2012 to 2014 with the help of Danish intelligence, Danish and European media reported on Sunday. Danish public broadcaster Danmarks Radio (DR) said the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) had eavesdropped on Danish Internet cables to spy on top politicians and high-ranking officials in Germany, Sweden, Norway and France. The NSA had taken advantage of a surveillance collaboration with Denmark’s military intelligence unit FE to do so, it said. Denmark’s Defence Ministry has not responded to AFP’s requests for a comment. Defence Minister Trine Bramsen, who took over the defence portfolio in June 2019, was informed of the spying in August 2020, according to DR. She told the broadcaster that “systematic eavesdropping of close allies is unacceptable”. It was not clear whether Denmark authorised the U.S. to use its surveillance system to spy on its neighbours. DR revealed the information following an investigation it led together with Swedish broadcaster SVT, Norway’s NRK, Germany’s NDR, WDR and Suddeutsche Zeitung , and France’s Le Monde . German Chancellor Angela Merkel, then-Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and then-Opposition leader Peer Steinbruck were among those the NSA had spied on, DR said. The NSA was able to access SMS text messages, telephone calls, and Internet traffic, including searches, chats and messaging services, DR said. The spying was detailed in a secret, internal FE working group report codenamed “Operation Dunhammer” and presented to FE top management in May 2015, DR said. DR said its information came from nine different sources who had access to classified FE information, and said their revelations were independently confirmed by several sources. Neither the FE nor its director at the time, Lars Findsen, commented immediately on the revelations. Snowden affair The U.S. spying, if confirmed, was going on during and after the 2013 Snowden affair, which erupted when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed thousands of classified documents exposing the vast U.S. surveillance put in place after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Among other things, that documents showed the U.S. government was spying on its own citizens and carrying out widespread tapping worldwide, including of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone. In November 2020, DR reported that the U.S. had used the Danish cables to spy on Danish and European defence industries from 2012 to 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-spied-on-merkel-european-allies-with-danish-help-media/article34693683.ece

Media reports last month revealed that Iranian and Saudi officials met in Baghdad in April, their first high-level meeting since Riyadh cut diplomatic ties with Tehran in 2016. “Talks are still continuing in a good atmosphere,” Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said at a press conference. “We hope these talks can achieve a common understanding between Iran and Saudi Arabia,” he added. Ties between the two countries were cut in 2016 after Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions following the kingdom’s execution of a revered Shia cleric. The talks in Baghdad, facilitated by Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, remained secret until the Financial Times reported that a first meeting was held on April 9. Mr. Khatibzadeh confirmed the talks on May 10, saying their purpose was “both bilateral and regional”, but stressed it was “too soon” to disclose any details. “De-escalation and (establishing) ties between two great Islamic countries in the Persian Gulf region is to the benefit of both nations,” he said at the time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/saudi-talks-under-way-in-good-atmosphere-iran/article34693677.ece

The city-state, with a population of 5.7 million, recently tightened curbs following a slight uptick in cases, after months of reporting barely any local cases. This included closing schools amid signs that new variants, such as the one first detected in India, were affecting children in greater numbers. In a televised speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that school students aged 12 and over will be the next group to be inoculated. Health regulators approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds this month. It was previously only allowed for those aged 16 and above. “In this latest outbreak, we have seen more cases of children getting infected, in schools and tuition centres,” Mr. Lee said. “The children were not seriously ill, but parents are naturally worried. Therefore, we will take advantage of the June holidays to vaccinate students.” The city’s more than 4,00,000 students can start booking vaccinations from Tuesday, with the first slots available on Thursday, officials said. After schoolchildren, officials will inoculate adults 39 years and younger.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/singapore-to-vaccinate-schoolchildren-soon/article34693678.ece

Since December, Bangladesh has shifted 18,000 out of a planned 1,00,000 refugees to the low-lying silt island of Bhashan Char from the Cox’s Bazar region, where around 8,50,000 people live in squalid and cramped conditions. Monday’s protest involved up to 4,000 people, the police said, and coincided with an inspection visit by officials from the United Nations refugee agency. An international rights activist said several protesters were injured in police action. A UNHCR spokesperson said the delegation was able to meet with a large group of refugees and to listen to the various issues that they raised, which the delegation will further discuss with the Bangladesh authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thousands-of-rohingya-protest-at-bhashan-char/article34693681.ece

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Elected autocrats, their pandemic responses||A year and counting into the greatest health crisis the world has faced in over a century we can identify one overwhelming factor that separates the countries that have done relatively well from those that have been complete disasters: elected autocrats. By any measure the most dismal performers in the democratic world have been the United States, Brazil and India. Despite its vast wealth and resources and its low population density, the U.S. has one of the highest per capita death tolls in the world. Brazil has taken denialism to new levels and the novel coronavirus pandemic has been allowed to range so fiercely that the country has become a petri dish for new mutations. India’s first wave numbers were relatively mild (even accounting for underreporting) but the current wave is probably the worst and deadliest the world has seen. The reactions In all three cases it did not have to be this bad. Former U.S. President Donald Trump took the pandemic as a personal affront, initially refused to come to terms with the threat and wilfully downplayed the gravity of the pandemic. When Washington finally decided to take action, the response was crippled by policy incoherence, partisan attacks on Democratic Governors and open hostility to the scientific community. Mr. Trump even provided a definition of his autocratic writ declaring in April 2020 that “when somebody’s the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that’s the way it has got to be.” Brazil’s right-wing populist President, Jair Bolsonaro, who came to office on a platform of being tough on crime and the politically correct, has been called the tropical Trump. He dismissed the pandemic as a “little cold”, boasted that real men had nothing to worry about, attacked public health officials as promoting a hoax and fired health ministers who defied him. Measures to combat the pandemic that have been taken in Brazil have come from governors and mayors and have been met with fierce opposition and public mockery from Mr. Bolsonaro.  Narendra Modi was never an outright COVID denier, and his government did take decisive measures, imposing a nation-wide lockdown in March 2020. But having failed to consult with experts or any of the Chief Ministers that govern India’s federal States, the welfare consequences of the lockdown were severe as tens of millions of urban migrants were forced into a mass exodus back to their villages. The pandemic subsided for some time, but even as experts warned of a second wave driven by new variants, the government celebrated its national triumph over the virus, dragged its feet on vaccinations and forged ahead with large-scale election campaign events and religious festivals even as the second wave surged. But of all the policy failures that have led to calls for the government to resign, none is more egregious or more revealing of Mr. Modi’s indifference than the Government’s decision to stay within its Budget allocations and charge States for vaccines. At the current rate, it will take the world’s largest producer of vaccines more than a year to vaccinate its population. As elected autocrats, Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Modi have three things in common. First, they came to power as classic right-wing populists who branded themselves as incarnations of the people and peddled their personal virtues of strength and fortitude as substitutes for deliberation and policy making. Rulers powered by messianic faith have little patience for experts and science. All three have surrounded themselves with yes-men and ruled from the gut, peddling triumphalism (all three prematurely declared the pandemic vanquished), quack remedies (injecting disinfectants, the waters of the Ganga) and sheer macho bombast, as when Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro took a lap for surviving infection even as they received the best care in the world. The line of nationalism Second, autocrats feed on polarisation. All three have championed a virtuous nationalism — rooted alternatively in evangelism in Brazil and the U.S., or Hindutva in India — animated and weaponised by the demonisation of the other. Ethnicised nationalism works by demoting the “other” — Muslims, Blacks, immigrants, gays, secularists and all those who subscribe to ideals of civic nationalism — to the status of the undeserving and the morally deficient. Membership in the community of the nation is essentialised. Mr. Trump demonised immigrants, channelled white supremacy and stoked fears of Blacks invading suburbs. Mr. Bolsonaro routinely smears his opponents as banditos or communists and has a long track record of making homophobic and misogynistic remarks. Mr. Modi has a long record of debasing India’s 200 million Muslims, and when re-elected in 2019, doubled down on his party’s platform of making India a Hindutva project, first by turning Kashmir (India’s only Muslim majority State) into a militarised colony of the central government and then pursuing laws that are perceived by Muslims as according them second class citizenship status. In diverse societies, ethno-nationalism can only fuel social polarisation, and a polarised society is a society that cannot mobilise the trust and solidarity that responding to a pandemic calls for. The pandemic itself was shamelessly used to inflame identities, with Mr. Trump denouncing the ‘Kung Flu’, Mr. Modi’s minions raising the spectre of ‘corona jihad’, and Mr. Bolsonaro hurling homophobic slurs at mask wearers. More than anything else, this explains why the most common sensical public health measures — wearing masks, restricting social interaction, testing and getting vaccinated — all became so politicised in the U.S., India and Brazil. Third, once in power, the autocrats quickly personalised, centralised and insulated their power. All three have attacked the Constitution (literally in Mr. Trump’s case), demanded fealty from independent institutions, over-ridden the authority of expert institutions, tampered with data, assaulted the independence of the media, and elevated loyalty to the leader as the highest principle of service. This autocratisation explains the dismal failures of governance. The core tasks of a government in times of a pandemic — coordination across levels of government, clear and consistent communication of basic policies and health measures, support for frontline workers and maybe, most importantly, rallying all citizens to stand together — have all been subverted by the autocrats’ will to power. A pushback In the U.S., India and Brazil, this toxic combination of messianic populism, social polarisation, insularity and centralisation has made the pandemic that much worse and poisoned the waters of democracy. But democracies are not just about their leaders. Throughout the crisis, health-care workers and civil society organisations have stepped up where their leaders have failed, and democratic institutions have pushed back. Mr. Trump has been exposed by the media and shown the exit by the voters. The Brazilian Senate has launched a very public investigation into Mr. Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic and his poll numbers have plummeted. Mr. Modi has just been repudiated in State-level elections and the Indian Supreme Court has called out the incoherence of the government’s vaccine policy. But to take comfort in the hope that democracies will demand accountability, we must first remember, as the pandemic continues to ravage India and Brazil, that it is not only the virus, but also the hubris of autocrats, that kills.

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Power play to bring the digital ecosystem to heel||Rule 4(2) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (https://bit.ly/3c6uTyK) imposes an obligation on significant social media intermediaries providing a messaging function, to ensure traceability of the originator of information on their platforms. A failure to implement this obligation can lead to intermediaries being held responsible for illicit content on their platforms. These rules have recently come into effect. Consequently, WhatsApp has filed a petition in the Delhi High Court (https://bit.ly/3fyRPIU) alleging that the mandate for traceability violates the privacy rights of Indian citizens, by rendering WhatsApp unable to provide encrypted services. In response, the Government has, through a press release (https://bit.ly/3cop6ov), sought to question the substance and timing of WhatsApp’s petition. On scrutiny, however, it appears that the response is misconceived. The Government primarily relies on the argument that: privacy is not an absolute right, and that the traceability obligation is proportionate, and sufficiently restricted. Notably, the new Rules mandate traceability only in the case of significant social media intermediaries that provide messaging services (i.e. those that meet a user threshold of 50 lakh users, which WhatsApp does), subject to an order being passed by a court or government agency and only in the absence of any alternatives. While it is indeed true that privacy is not an absolute right, the Supreme Court of India in the two K.S. Puttaswamy decisions (of 2017 and 2018) has clarified that any restriction on this right must be necessary, proportionate and include safeguards against abuse. On traceability as a feature However, as we argue in a recent paper (https://bit.ly/3uwtmIJ), a general obligation to enable traceability as a systemic feature across certain types of digital services is neither suitable nor proportionate. Additionally, the Rules lack effective safeguards in that they fail to provide any system of independent oversight over tracing requests made by the executive. This allows government agencies the ability to seek any messaging user’s identity, virtually at will. However, anonymity from the government can be important, particularly in contexts of journalistic source protection and for whistle-blowers. Therefore, deciding whether to remove anonymity requires application of an independent judicial mind. In applying the Puttaswamy tests to the Rules, one must examine not just whether the weakening of encryption systems will lead to some law enforcement gains, but whether these are worth the costs involved. Thus, one must consider the impacts of such a measure on the general digital ecosystem in terms of the overall cybersecurity and privacy problems such an obligation could create. There is near universal consensus that mandating the presence of backdoors or weakening encryption generally — which a traceability mandate would do — would compromise the privacy and security of all individuals at all times, despite no illegal activity on their part, and would create a presumption of criminality. Other means exist In any event, the Government already has numerous alternative means of securing relevant information to investigate online offences including by accessing unencrypted data such as metadata, and other digital trails from intermediaries. Therefore, the present Rules attempt to shorten the investigative process, even though, as we argue in our paper, law enforcement is not supposed to be an entirely frictionless process. Frictionless processes lacking sufficient checks will merely incentivise fishing expeditions by government agencies. Further, the surveillance powers of the Government are in any case vast and overreaching, recognised even by the Justice B.N. Srikrishna Committee report of 2018 (https://bit.ly/3iiB6M3). Importantly, the Government already has the ability to access encrypted data under the IT Act. Notably, Section 69(3) of the Information Technology Act and Rules 17 and 13 of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009 (https://bit.ly/3c83QTB) require intermediaries to assist with decryption where they have the technical ability to do so, and where law enforcement has no alternatives. The newly notified Rules go well beyond current provisions in the law by seeking to punish relevant intermediaries for failing to adequately weaken encryption systems. The Government’s press release appears to be well aware that this is in effect what would happen if the traceability mandate were to be imposed. However, it notes that it is the responsibility of intermediaries to find an alternative method to protect user privacy, with or without the use of encryption. Scrutiny is a must The press release also claims that the new Rules were introduced pursuant to consultation. However, this does not reveal the entire story. The traceability related provision in the draft version of the Rules released in 2018 faced significant opposition from numerous stakeholders, ranging from service providers, academia, and civil society organisations. The new traceability provisions are substantially similar, and carrying out a consultation merely to reject all the views that go against state interests is far from best practice. Ideally, and given the substantive changes made to the 2018 draft (including the addition of several entirely new parts such as those pertaining to regulation of digital news), the new Rules should also have been put through a period of consultation before being notified. . Ideally, the rules should also be accompanied by an explanatory memorandum explaining the rationale for regulation. Of course, this entire discussion is notwithstanding the fact that the intermediary rules are not the manner or place to go about putting in place new substantive regulation to solve the myriad problems caused by the digital ecosystem. Indeed, the ability of the government to issue progressively more onerous obligations under the guise of “due diligence” requirements under Section 79 of the IT Act (which in essence, deals with the issue of take-down of illegal content) must be subject to judicial scrutiny. Overall, however, it is clear that the move by the Government is part of a broader power play against foreign-based technology companies, and to generally bring the digital ecosystem to heel. While, undoubtedly, there are numerous problems in the digital ecosystem that are often exacerbated or indeed created by the way intermediaries function, ill-considered regulation of the sort represented by the new intermediary rules — which appear to have little basis in evidence or care for consequences –— is not the way forward. Indeed, the only truly democratic and relatively long-term solution would be for legislative change along multiple avenues, including in the form of revising and reforming the now antiquated IT Act, 2000.

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Recognising caste-based violence against women||The horror of the gang rape of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras in 2020 is still fresh in our minds. Activists, academics and lawyers argued that the sexual violence took place on account of the woman’s gender and caste and that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (PoA Act) must be invoked. On the heels of the Hathras crime came a new judgment of the Supreme Court ( Patan Jamal Vali v. State of Andhra Pradesh ) addressing the intersectionality of caste, gender and disability. In this case, the victim of sexual assault was a blind 22-year-old Dalit woman. The trial court and the High Court had convicted the accused for rape under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and under Section 3(2)(v) of the PoA Act, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The Supreme Court, in its judgment delivered by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justice M.R. Shah, confirmed the conviction and the punishment for rape under the IPC but set aside the conviction under the PoA Act. On the one hand, this judgment is a huge step forward as the court used the opportunity to bring recognition to intersectional discrimination faced by women on the grounds of sex, caste and disability. However, by setting aside the conviction under the PoA Act, it is like many other previous judgments of the Supreme Court. The intersectional approach Let us focus on the positive aspects first. The Supreme Court, in a first, elaborated on the need for an intersectional approach, to take into account the multiple marginalities that the victim faced. It relied on well-known intersectional theorists such as Kimberlé Crenshaw who first coined the term ‘intersectionality’ and on the statement of the Combahee River Collective which addressed the intersectional discrimination faced by black women in the U.S. Using these sources, the court recognised that when the identity of a woman intersects with her caste, class, religion, disability and sexual orientation, she may face violence and discrimination due to two or more grounds. It said we need to understand how multiple sources of oppression operated cumulatively to produce a specific experience of subordination for the blind Dalit woman. Placing special emphasis on making the criminal justice system more responsive to women with disabilities facing sexual assault, the court also laid down directions to train judges, the police and prosecutors to be sensitised in such cases. But despite using an intersectional lens, the court set aside conviction under the PoA Act. The PoA Act was enacted to address atrocities against persons from SC and ST communities and was amended in 2015 to specifically recognise more atrocities against Dalit and Adivasi women including sexual assault, sexual harassment and Devadasi dedication. Section 3(2)(v) states that if any person not being an SC/ST member commits any offence under the IPC punishable with imprisonment of 10 years or more against a person on the ground that such a person is from an SC/ST community, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for life and with fine. This was amended in 2015, to change the phrase “on the ground that such person is a member of SC/ST” to “knowing that such person is a member of SC/ST”. In cases of sexual violence against Dalit and Adivasi women, courts have almost consistently set aside convictions under the PoA Act. In 2006 in Ramdas and Others v. State of Maharashtra , where a Dalit minor girl was raped, the Supreme Court set aside the conviction under the PoA Act stating that the mere fact that the victim happened to be a woman who was member of an SC community would not attract the PoA Act. In Dinesh Alias Buddha v. State of Rajasthan (2006), the Supreme Court held: “It is not case of the prosecution that the rape was committed on the victim since she was a member of Scheduled Caste.” In Asharfi v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2017), the court held that the evidence and materials on record did not show that the appellant had committed rape on the ground that the victim was member of an SC community. In 2019, in Khuman Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh , a case of murder, again the court held that the fact that the deceased was a member of an SC community was not disputed but there was no evidence to show that the offence was committed only on that ground; conviction under the PoA Act was set aside. There are several precedents insisting on an unrealistic burden of proof. This issue needs to be referred to a larger bench to take a different view. Burden of proof In all these judgments, the court held that there was no evidence to show that the accused committed sexual assault on the ground that the victim was member of an SC/ST community. One is tempted to ask: what kind of evidence would that be? How would the prosecution prove in any given case that the accused had sexually assaulted the victim because she was Dalit/ Adivasi? The only evidence that can be led is that the victim was from an SC/ST community and that the accused was aware of that. When a woman is from a marginalised caste and is disabled, she faces discrimination due to her sex, caste/tribe and disability, all of which render her vulnerable to sexual violence. This is what intersectionality theory requires us to recognise. In the Patan Jamal Vali case, the court using the intersectional lens recognises that evidence of discrimination or violence on a specific ground may be absent or difficult to prove. It agreed with the finding of the sessions judge that the prosecution’s case would not fail merely because the victim’s mother did not mention in her statement to the police that the offence was committed against her daughter because she was from an SC community. It also confirmed that it would be reasonable to presume that the accused knew the victim’s caste as he was known to the victim’s family. Despite such a nuanced understanding, the court held that there was no separate evidence led by the prosecution to show that the accused committed the offence on the basis of the victim’s caste. It is unfortunate that intersectionality, which seeks to recognise the multiple grounds of marginalisation faced by women, was used by the court to state that it becomes difficult to establish whether it was caste, gender or disability that led to the commission of the offence. Why would this matter, one might ask, if the punishment of life imprisonment was upheld? It matters because the repeated setting aside of convictions under the PoA Act bolsters the allegations that the law is misused and amounts to the erasure of caste-based violence faced by women. Further, as stated in the recent Parliamentary Standing Committee Report on Atrocities and Crimes against Women and Children, the “high acquittal rate motivates and boosts the confidence of dominant and powerful communities for continued perpetration”. This judgment was a missed opportunity for the court to use intersectionality to uphold the conviction under the PoA Act or refer the matter to a larger bench if needed. We need to stop hiding behind smokescreens of hyper-technicality of evidence and recognise caste-based violence against women when it stares us in the face. Else, our caste discrimination laws will be rendered toothless. If intersectionality theory mattered in this case, it should have influenced an interpretation of the PoA Act that reflects the lived experiences of women facing sexual violence.

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The Indian model of coexistence||The cycle of violence between the Israeli forces and the Palestinian public is neither the first nor likely to be the last of its kind. The Palestinians have been losing not only their lives and livelihood but also the very land for which this violence has been raging for over a century now. The territory in question is The Holy Land to the three religions of Abrahamic monotheism, viz., Judaism, Christianity and Islam. One can’t be a Jew or a Christian or a Muslim and deny that it is the Promised Land of the Beni Israel branch of the descendants of Abraham. The Al-Aqsa mosque in Quran is Solomon’s Temple which was the first Qibla (direction of prayer) of the Muslims. The Islamic claim on Jerusalem comes only through its association with Judaism and Christianity. A brief history Britain renounced its Mandate over Palestine in 1948, paving the way for the United Nations to divide Palestine between the Jews and Arabs, giving them about 55% and 45% of the land, respectively. The Jews, meanwhile, had declared the establishment of the state of Israel for which they had been working for long. The Palestinians, who lacked the resources to conceive of a state, failed to form a state of their own in the land allotted to them. Instead, a coalition of Arab countries invaded the nascent state of Israel to nip it in the bud. Israel not only defeated the Arab armies, but also unleashed what the Palestinians call Nakba, an Arabic word which means holocaust. Israel destroyed about 600 Palestinian villages and expelled about 80% of Arabs from its territory. In 1967, in the Six-Day War, Israel captured not just more Palestinian land but also Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and Syria’s Golan Heights. During the Yom Kippur War of 1973, the Arabs came to realise that Israel is here to stay. But the Arab states, while washing their hands off Palestine, failed to impress the same realisation upon their Palestinian brethren, a sizeable number of whom remain committed to seeking a solution through counter-violence. Non-Arab Muslim countries, while being of no help to the Palestinians have been the greatest cheerleaders of the violent section of the struggle. This vicious cycle of violence is not going to end unless there is realism on both sides. The Hamas should know that Israel will not give up on holding on to land it has held for years, and Israel should understand that total subjugation, expulsion or even decimation of Palestinians will not make it any safer. Both the sides will have to seek a solution through non-violence. A solution based on the common humanity of all stakeholders, one that is not riven by racial and religious schisms, needs to be explored. Secularisation of the discourse is an inescapable prerequisite for any workable solution. This is especially more applicable for the weaker side. Accommodation of all The Indian model of democracy and secularism, which accommodates religious, ethnic, linguistic and other diversities, could be a viable model for the peaceful coexistence of formerly antagonistic groups. The European model of the annihilation of natives in the Americas and Australia, last tried on the Jews in Nazi Germany, is not a solution which we can morally countenance and practically resort to. India, on the other hand, evolved a unique model of accommodating the victors and the vanquished, without ever resorting to the latter’s decimation. A modus vivendi has to evolve on the basis of hard realities, the first of which is that neither the Jews nor the Palestinians are going to vanish into thin air. The Palestinians missed the bus to form a state in 1948, and have missed many since then. Now, they are sparsely spread over the land in scores of non-contiguous pockets, making a cohesive state unviable. The two-state solution can be possible only if Israel frees the occupied territories and removes the Jewish settlements from there, an unlikely scenario in the foreseeable future. If the two-state solution is nowhere in the offing, a single state after the Indian model, i.e., a secular, democratic and pluralistic state, may be the only feasible option. A nation state only for the Jews would be a relapse into the ghetto mode, with all its concomitant implications. The Palestinian refugees have a right to return. That the altered demographics would impinge on the religio-racial character of Israel is not an argument which behoves a modern democratic state founded on common humanity with equal rights and opportunities for everyone. It is true that a nation state belongs to the group which constituted itself into a nation. Therefore, the group’s ethos would reflect in national life without it rubbing it in. A nation is an imagined community. As imagination expands, the foundations of the nation become deeper. For this, there could be no better model than India. Israel might not offer the right model of conflict resolution for India, but India presents a model of peaceful coexistence for Israel. Najmul Hoda is an IPS officer.

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Co-WIN, casinos and luck||The experience of booking an appointment to get vaccinated in India has been rewarding for some but frustrating for most. The procedure for a citizen to get vaccinated is to register on the Co-WIN website or Aarogya Setu app and schedule an appointment at a preferred centre. It sounds easy until you try it. Soon you realise that no matter how fast you click the confirm button, it’s not easy to get an appointment. That’s because vaccines are in short supply. And that is because the Government of India hasn’t placed enough orders. People who have been trying to get an appointment find someone or the other in their social network who got lucky with an appointment. That motivates them to keep trying. The system of getting vaccine appointments has become gamified with vaccination centres releasing alerts of slot openings on social media. These alerts inform people about the openings of vaccination slots at any time of the day or night. They keep people hooked on to the game of ‘fastest finger first’ to book an appointment. Vaccination and gambling The psychology behind why random alerts and repeated log ins into the website to try one’s luck at booking an appointment works is the same as why people gamble money in casinos or buy lottery tickets. At a casino, people put money in the slot machine and press the button. People don’t know if they’ll win. They can’t predict it. But they believe that the odds of winning increase the more they play. So, they keep gambling. Of course, most people lose more than they win because the odds are always in favour of the casino, which makes most of the money. In the case of trying their luck at getting a vaccination appointment, people eagerly wait for alerts of slot openings, log in and press the confirm button. People don’t know if they’ll ‘win’ an appointment. They can’t predict it. But people believe that the odds of ‘winning’ an appointment increase the more they log in. So, people keep trying. Of course, most people don’t ‘win’ appointments because the odds are not in their favour. The only difference between gambling at casinos and booking vaccination appointments is that in gambling, the casino wins most of the time. But regarding vaccination, both the government and the people lose. Active conditioning In Ivan Pavlov’s experiment of classical conditioning, the dogs in the experiment would start drooling when they heard the sounds associated with food preparation. They would drool when the bell rang even though no food was present. After a while, the dogs would stop responding if no food appeared after the bell was rung. But psychologist B. F. Skinner found that rats and pigeons would continue doing the task much longer if they were rewarded occasionally rather than every time. Both are types of conditioning, but Skinner’s conditioning was active, whereas Pavlov’s was passive. The dog didn’t have to do anything conscious to get the reward, whereas the rat and pigeon had to undertake a task. Making the animal take an explicit action produced a stronger, longer lasting effect on behaviour. Humans respond in similar ways as rats and pigeons when given an occasional reward for repetitive behaviour. Casinos give players the illusion of control by letting players place chips and play their cards. Giving them choices and making people take action makes them feel like they have some control, as opposed to giving purely luck-based unpredictable rewards. In case of vaccinations, the government is giving people the illusion of control by encouraging people to log in and try their luck at booking an appointment. Giving people the choice to take action towards booking an appointment makes people feel like they have some control, even though the odds are highly stacked against ‘winning’ an appointment. There is an element of surprise or uncertainty, so people are never sure when the appointment will come through. This is keeping people engaged. The question is, should the government be operating vaccinations like a casino?

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Ending encryption||Barely a day before the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 came into force, WhatsApp moved the Delhi High Court against the rules — specifically the one that mandates that a “significant social media intermediary providing services primarily in the nature of messaging shall enable the identification of the first originator of the information on its computer resource as may be required by a judicial order”. Given the specification that a “significant social media intermediary” is one with more than 50 lakh registered users, WhatsApp’s messenger service would clearly be affected. WhatsApp’s contention is that for compliance and traceability, it would have to break its end-to-end encryption service that allows messages to be read only by the sender and the receiver. Its argument is that the encryption feature allows for privacy protections and breaking it would mean a violation of privacy. The question to be asked is whether the traceability guidelines (by breaking encryption) are vital to law enforcement in cases of harmful content. A release by the Ministry of Electronics and IT has said that the traceability measure will be used by law enforcement as the “last resort” and will come by only in specific situations, such as “for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of an offence related to the sovereignty and integrity of India... or child sexual abuse material, punishable with imprisonment....” The assertion suggests that this requirement is in line with the Puttaswamy judgment that clarified that any restriction to the right of privacy must be necessary, proportionate and include safeguards against abuse. But the Government, as the law stands now, can already seek access to encrypted data under Section 69(3) of the IT Act, and Rules 17 and 13 of the 2009 Surveillance Rules that require intermediaries to assist with decryption when they have the technical ability to do so and when law enforcement has no other alternative. Besides, it can still seek unencrypted data, metadata and digital trails from intermediaries such as WhatsApp. The trouble with enforcing traceability is that without safeguards such as having any independent or judicial oversight, government agencies could seek any user’s identity on vague grounds and this could compromise the anonymity of whistle-blowers and journalistic sources, who can claim to be acting in the public interest. WhatsApp’s contention that “requiring messaging apps to ‘trace’ chats is the equivalent of asking us to keep a fingerprint of every single message sent... and fundamentally undermines right to privacy” is, therefore, not hyperbole. If anything, the Government needs to revisit its position on traceability commitments of intermediaries and instead revise the IT Act, 2000 in line with existing global best practices besides legislating the long-pending Data Protection Bill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/ending-encryption/article34693655.ece
01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||No comments||At 23, Naomi Osaka has the tennis world at her feet. With four Grand Slam titles and now ranked second in the world, Osaka has tremendous brand equity. She also speaks her mind beyond sport, be it on racism or on her mixed lineage of being born to a Haitian father and Japanese mother while growing up in the United States. It looked as though the baton of success had passed from the great Serena Williams to Osaka. Yet, the Japanese star’s fresh halo suffered a dent with her media boycott in the current French Open at Paris. Shooting the messenger is a petulant attribute that crops up in politics, sport and the arts. Often these are impulsive reactions to a bad day at work. The odd tennis press conference was skipped in the past with Serena and Novak Djokovic being guilty of such violations. But what makes it worse for Osaka is her premeditated stance revealed through her message before the French Open: ‘I am not going to do any press during Roland Garros.’ She also juxtaposed her cold-shoulder of the media with mental-health issues, hinting that journalists tend to exacerbate the fragile minds of athletes, especially those who lost a match. In one fell swoop, Osaka ignored nuance, dished out a lame excuse and trivialised the serious issue of mental health. In a universe where athletes prefer social-media posts over media interactions, the official press-conference is the last remaining avenue for probing questions that elicit insightful answers. Player-journalist interactions are the only substitute for source-based inferences that colour the narrative. Closer home, M.S. Dhoni revealed his international retirement through Instagram and lapsed into silence. Sports bodies have sensed this diffidence and in the cricket World Cup or a Grand Slam event, the post-match press-conference is a contractual obligation. In this era of click-bait headlines, it is not that all Fourth Estate members are perceptive. There have been instances of the odd insensitive question but the athlete can always offer a counter or stick to a ‘no-comments’ response. Osaka deciding to constantly pay a fine for not honouring her media commitments at the French Open has set a terrible precedent and it is fitting that the consortium of Grand Slams have hinted at harsher measures including ejecting her from the tournament. Besides excellence on the turf, commerce off the field equally drives sport. Corporate sponsors, who get some play through advertorial material as background screen in press-conferences, are obviously aggrieved. Legends such as Rafael Nadal have also spoken about how sport evolves through the symbiosis between athletes and the media. It is a pity that Osaka has suddenly turned blind to this reality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/no-comments/article34693656.ece

For, it would appear, according to expert opinion, that the failure of wood to supply the requirements of the paper industry has placed India and Burma in a unique position of advantage as the sole suppliers of the proper substitutes in the raw materials required. The paper-industry by its very nature as “a picker-up of unconsidered trifles” is, as its history shows, subjected to periodically recurring conditions of acuteness. During the past 100 years, rag, textile wastes, straw and esparto have, each in its turn, failed to meet the ever-increasing demands of the industry and the present crisis, we learn is among other causes, of economic and industrial dislocation resulting from the war, mainly due to the dearth of wood for providing pulp.

This was the theme of the keynote address delivered by Mr. Rene Maheu, Director-General of UNESCO, at the opening session of the third regional conference of Ministers of Education and those responsible for economic planning in Asia here this morning [Singapore, May 31]. Pointing out that over 62 per cent of Asian population was under the age of 25, Mr. Maheu warned: “If your (Asian) countries wish to avoid the dangers of a generation gap, they will have to devise new ways of dealing with the problems that will give young people both the means of participating in the reform of an educational system on which their future depends and the hope of finding, forthwith, a place in a society where they can work to achieve their aspirations”.

01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Vaccination key to health of economy’||The economic impact of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be very large at this point but curbing the pandemic through swift vaccination and strict COVID-19 protocols is imperative to revive economic activity, Chief Economic Adviser K.V. Subramanian said on Monday. “Vaccination is important for the health of the people as well as the health of the economy… The economic impact is inextricably linked to the overall pandemic itself. The economy had recovered very well by March but then the second wave has moderated the momentum,” he said during a briefing on the state of the economy. While the spate of lockdowns across States is beginning to hurt the economy, the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has peaked in early May and the restrictions imposed so far have been ‘asynchronous and heterogenous’ and hence the decline is not likely to be as bad as last year, the CEA said. “There has been an internal assessment on the costs of the restrictions... Whether or not it (growth) will be in double digits or single digits, there is uncertainty. Some of the scientists are talking about the possibility of a third wave – we don’t know when it will be and what will be the impact. It would be speculative to tell you exact numbers,” Mr. Subramanian said, terming the Economic Survey and Budget’s GDP growth estimates for 2021-22 (11% and about 10.5%, respectively) as ‘conservative’. ‘Immense uncertainty’ “The caveat with everything related to the pandemic, is that estimates are subject to immense uncertainty given that the trajectory of the pandemic has been hard to predict even for epidemiologists,” Mr. Subramanian pointed out. He said he expected manufacturing to do well this year, and non-contact-intensive services will also see an enhanced demand due to the feedback effects from manufacturing. “For contact-sensitive services sectors to come back..., will depend on the path of the vaccination itself,” he said. ‘Impact of restrictions’ Referring to the moderation in several indicators over the past month, the Chief Economic Adviser said: “Clearly, the restrictions imposed by the States have had some impact, but as the wave seems to be on the decline, we do anticipate that these restrictions will progressively reduce and later be removed, which may help in bringing back economic activity.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/vaccination-key-to-health-of-economy/article34693644.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sharp deterioration in overall business confidence: FICCI||The worsening conditions and muted near-term expectations due to the second wave of COVID-19 have led to a “sharp deterioration” in overall business confidence among companies, a survey by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) shows. Participating firms in the ‘Business Confidence Survey’ “unanimously felt that the government must, first and foremost, focus on controlling COVID cases” and that only a massive vaccination drive could decouple India’s economy from another pandemic-induced shock. Also, they stressed on the need for another fiscal package, focussed on addressing the demand side, along with employment-based incentives to avert any job losses. The ‘Overall Business Confidence Index’ nosedived to 51.5 after reporting a decadal high value of 74.2 in the previous round of the survey released in March 2021, the industry body said. About 70% participants reported weak demand conditions as a bothering factor in the current survey compared with 56% in the previous round. The corresponding number last year was 77%. “With household income being severely impacted and past savings already drawn down during the first wave of infections, demand conditions are expected to remain weak for longer this time around.” It added that since a much larger proportion of the population has been impacted in the current wave, there had been permanent impairment to income for many households which had faced job losses or had lost bread winners to COVID-19.

01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Fiscal deficit narrower than forecast at 9.2%||India recorded a fiscal deficit of 9.2% of GDP in 2020-21, narrower than the revised estimate of 9.5%, as per data from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) and official GDP figures released on Monday. Total revenue receipts were about Rs. 88,000 crore higher than estimated, driven largely by higher excise and customs collections, while total expenditure was Rs. 61,000 crore more than the revised estimate, according to CARE Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis. The CGA projected the revenue deficit at 7.42% of GDP, which had been assumed at Rs. 194.82 lakh crore in the Union Budget. Budget 2020-21, presented before the COVID-19 lockdowns, had set a fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of GDP. The slightly better-than-expected fiscal performance doesn’t necessarily bode well for this year’s fiscal pressures, the Reserve Bank of India’s significantly higher-than-anticipated dividend of Rs. 99,000-odd crore notwithstanding, opine economists. The government has set a target to reduce the fiscal deficit this year to 6.8%. Mr. Sabnavis pointed out that the higher-than-estimated expenditure in 2020-21 was actually driven by higher revenue expenditure of Rs. 75,000 crore. “Interestingly, capex was cut by Rs. 14,000 crore. Expenditure control will be important for FY22, as pressures will be there on tax revenue due to lockdowns, while non-tax receipts will be higher due to RBI transfer of Rs. 99,000 crore this year,” he said. ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar attributed the spurt in revenue spending to the release of food subsidies, but higher-than-anticipated tax revenues helped curtail the deficit to Rs. 18.2 lakh crore from the estimated Rs. 18.5 lakh crore. ‘Relief for bond market’ “This will come as a relief to the bond market… At this stage, there is a modest risk that the GoI’s fiscal deficit in FY22 will be higher than budgeted (Rs. 15.1 lakh crore), especially on account of shortfalls in disinvestment receipts, and higher-than budgeted expenditure. Accordingly, the space for a fiscal stimulus appears to be limited and would need to be carefully targeted,” she said. The second wave of COVID-19, Ms. Nayar said, could delay some marquee disinvestment plans, posing the biggest risk to budgeted receipts this year. While tax receipts would be affected due to the anticipation of a prolonged second wave impact on sentiment, the Centre may have to keep spending to prop up demand via a combination of free foodgrains, cash transfers and higher MGNREGA outlays, she said. “An eventual cut in cesses on fuels, which would dampen excise collections, can't be ruled out, given record-high retail fuel prices,” she said, adding that the Centre would also need to hasten vaccine availability.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fiscal-deficit-narrower-than-forecast-at-92/article34693646.ece

01 June 2021||Paris,||Federer eases into round two, Swiatek has a happy birthday||Roger Federer marked his return to the French Open with a straight sets victory over Uzbekistan qualifier Denis Istomin on Monday. The 39-year-old Federer, champion in Paris in 2009 but playing the event for only the second time since 2015, won 6-2, 6-4, 6-3. Federer, who skipped the 2020 tournament, was playing just his fourth match of the year and first at a Slam since losing to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open semifinals last year. Defending champion Iga Swiatek picked up on Monday right where she left off last year in winning the title: running yet another opponent this way and that on the red clay in a take-no-prisoners straight-sets victory. Her best friend on the tennis circuit, Kaja Juvan, was the victim on Court Philippe Chatrier this time as Swiatek emphatically kicked off her campaign to become the first woman since Justine Henin in 2007 to defend the French Open title. Playing on her 20th birthday, Swiatek treated herself to a 6-0, 7-5 victory — her eighth straight-sets win in a row at Roland Garros, having also not dropped a set in winning the trophy last year as an unseeded 19-year-old. “She didn't give me any birthday gifts,” Swiatek said of the partner with whom she won a gold medal in doubles at the Youth Olympics in 2018. But Swiatek wasn't in the gift-giving mood, either. She secured the win with a snapped cross-court backhand at the net, on her fourth match point, that Juvan hit wide. They hugged each other warmly at the net, best buddies once again. Playing ball Swiatek then gamely played ball, waving her hands like an orchestra conductor, as on-court interviewer Marion Bartoli led the crowd, thinned by coronavirus restrictions, in a somewhat squawky rendition of “Happy Birthday.” Rising Italian star Jannik Sinner saved match point in a 6-1, 4-6, 6-7(4), 7-5, 6-4 win over Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert. Perseverance pays And Daniil Medvedev proved that perseverance pays, finally winning a French Open match on his fifth attempt. The second-seeded Russian beat Alexander Bublik 6-3, 6-3, 7-5, after four previous first-round losses on the Parisian clay. Sinner was on the verge of a shock exit against Herbert. But the Frenchman could not seize his chance, shanking a shot wide at 4-5, 30-40 in the fourth set. That proved to be a turning point as Sinner finally held, broke, and sealed the set. Herbert’s missed backhand volley then gave Sinner an early break in the decider and the Italian prevailed with his deep groundstrokes. It was just the second meeting between the pair. Sinner had dropped only four games the last time they met, in a best-of-three-set match.  I feel two ways. My wish and hope and dream is that I can play it. But it needs to make sense for me, my team, my family, my country. I’m still waiting to see how things are going to develop in the next couple of weeks and month Roger Federeron his Tokyo 2020 Olympics participation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/federer-eases-into-round-two-swiatek-has-a-happy-birthday/article34693773.ece
01 June 2021||HYDERABAD,||‘Oz tour was defining moment of my career’||“Old Siraj is a story of the past, you will see a new Siraj for sure,” said the confident India pacer, all set to embark on his maiden England tour with the Indian seniors team next month. “Yes, I am more confident and mature now. Worked a lot on my line and length besides trying to improve my all-round skills as a bowler,” Mohammed Siraj said in a chat with The Hindu . “It is a great feeling to be part of this Indian team which can beat the best on their home soil. Personally, I am enjoying the kind of competition I face for a slot in such a formidable outfit,” he said. Invaluable tips “The best part is that all the seniors are so good and open to giving invaluable tips. This is helping me learn a lot about the art of pace bowling,” the 27-year-old said. “It is definitely a huge challenge to come out of a bio-bubble during a long quarantine and play the big games straight away. But again, we have to be ready for these kinds of things,” said Siraj, who has picked 16 wickets in five Tests so far. “Obviously the last Australian tour (where he spearheaded the inexperienced pace attack with aplomb to play a key role in India’s series win) was the defining moment of my career which resulted in a complete change in my attitude towards bowling,” he recalled proudly. “Honestly, I don’t know whether I will be there in the eleven or not for the WTC final, but I am determined to bowl as well as possible in the run-up to that big game,” he said. “Of course, if I get a chance to play, that will be the ultimate experience for me and a dream come true,” the vastly improved pacer said. Focusing on batting “Definitely, there is a conscious effort to improve my batting too as sometimes a crucial 20-30 runs from the tail-enders can be decisive,” he said. “Yes, having Virat bhai as India captain is a huge plus for me. Playing under him for four IPL seasons for RCB, he trusts me, understands my bowling and knows how to get the best out of me,” Siraj said. Asked what his big goal was, “To be a permanent member of the Indian team for a long, long time. “I know what kind of struggle I had gone through after a bad 2019 IPL season to push myself back into contention,” Siraj said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/oz-tour-was-defining-moment-of-my-career/article34693809.ece
01 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||KFA open to talks on commercial rights deal||In the face of mounting criticism on the proposed long-term commercial rights agreement with Meerans Sports LLP and Scoreline Sports Pvt. Ltd., the Kerala Football Association (KFA) has decided to hold an online meeting with general body members and district football association officials. Proposals sought The KFA has sent the draft of the contract to all DFA presidents and secretaries and its GB members seeking proposals or changes within a week. The KFA will hold separate meetings with each of the 14 affiliated DFAs before finalising the contract. In April the KFA invited proposals from companies to acquire the commercial rights of its State teams, leagues and competitions for 12 years. An expert committee examined the bids submitted by Eastea Chai Pvt. Ltd. and Consortium of Meerans Sports LLP and Scoreline Sports Pvt. Ltd. and recommended that the consortium be given the commercial rights. As per the contract, the consortium will pay KFA Rs. 85 lakh for the first five years and Rs. 90 lakh from the sixth to 10th year and Rs. 95 lakh for the last two years as annual guaranteed payment. The consortium will also share 10 percent of profits if any with KFA during the 12 years. The contract may be extended through negotiations at the end of the 11th year. The consortium will have the right to review the performance after three years and withdraw from the contract giving three months notice and honouring the pending payment for the season. On the other hand, KFA, with approval from its AGB, may terminate the contract with a six-month notice period but will have to repay the entire fees received till then. The consortium will also have the right to conduct AIFF and AFC coaching courses. The consortium may grant affiliation to new clubs and accord permission to DFAs to conduct new tournaments. The consortium will also run the day to day affairs of disaffiliated DFAs. The consortium will also be eligible to field a team in all KFA and AIFF-recoganised tournaments. The consortium may start, within five years, and totally manage a new professional league that would be the top-tier league in the State. The KFA will provide workspace and obtain necessary clearances from the AIFF for the consortium to function. Opposition However, a majority of KFA members and DFAs have opposed the draft proposals saying KFA was underselling itself and some terms of contract were too one-sided. They also allege that there was no transparency in the bidding process. They allege that both companies which submitted the bid proposals had the same set of promoters. They also accuse KFA secretary Anilkumar of conflict of interest as a close relative of his is associated with Scoreline Sports. There is also talk of legal action against KFA. Some of those opposed to the contract are also expected to seek the State Government's intervention in the matter.

01 June 2021||DUBAI,||Superb Sanjeet wins 91kg gold||Sanjeet shocked Rio Olympics silver medallist Vassiliy Levit to win the 91kg title in the Asian boxing championships here on Monday. Sanjeet upset the Kazakh legend, a five-time Asian medallist, 4-1 to bag India’s lone gold medal in the men’s section. Worlds silver medallist Amit Panghal (52kg) and former Worlds bronze medallist Shiva Thapa (64kg) picked up silver medals after suffering narrow losses. Sanjeet made good use of his left jabs and mixed the body blows well to score against the experienced Kazakh who peppered the Indian with well-directed head shots. In a battle of the southpaws, defending champion Panghal was unlucky to lose to World and Olympic champion Zoirov Shakhobidin of Uzbekistan. Panghal lost 3-2 despite dominating in the last two rounds. Protest not accepted Zoirov attacked and took the first round. Panghal executed some fine left shots in the second and made light of a bleeding right eyebrow to land fine combinations in the final round only to meet with disappointment. India contested the decision of the second round of the 52kg bout, but the jury did not accept the protest. In an evenly-contested fight, Thapa fell to Asian Games silver medallist Baatarsukh Chinzorig of Mongolia 3-2.  The results (finals): 52kg: Amit Panghal lost to Zoirov Shakhobidin (Uzb) 3-2; 64kg: Shiva Thapa lost to Baatarsukh Chinzorig (Mgl) 3-2; 91kg: Sanjeet bt Vassiliy Levit (Kaz) 4-1 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/superb-sanjeet-wins-91kg-gold/article34693759.ece

The Pole, who celebrated her 20th birthday with a 6-0, 7-5 win over good friend Kaja Juvan in the first round on Monday, practised with 13-time Roland Garros winner Nadal for the first time. "It was great. It wasn't a surprise because I had to prepare," said Swiatek. "Write some small topics, not to have awkward silence. But Rafa is really, really great. He's a really nice guy. Even though I am pretty introverted, it was really fun for me. "Obviously I got to feel his forehand, which was great, and his top-spin. "That was a whole new experience for me. It gave me a lot of positive energy. It was really a huge inspiration for me."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/swiatek-starstruck-before-meeting-nadal/article34693760.ece
01 June 2021||MUMBAI,||Crucial ICC Board meet to be held today||The International Cricket Council Board is set to discuss on Tuesday the venue and finalise the dates for the T20 World Cup, scheduled to be played in October-November. UAE on stand-by Although the tournament was allotted to India, the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in India has meant the ICC will push the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to move the tournament to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the designated alternative venue for the tournament. The BCCI at a special general meeting on Saturday decided to seek a month-long extension from ICC to finalise the venue. Interestingly, the meeting resolved to reschedule the remaining Indian Premier League in the UAE just before the T20 World Cup. While the BCCI will try and justify the deadline extension with the COVID-19 cases on a decline and the tax exemption issue still pending with the government, it will be interesting to see whether the ICC agrees to wait till its annual conference in July before making the call. A BCCI contingent, led by secretary Jay Shah, has reached Dubai to discuss with the ICC and UAE officials the issues regarding the T20 World Cup and the IPL. Interestingly, the ICC Board is also likely to discuss the possibility of postponing the second cycle of the World Test Championship by two years. India is set to face New Zealand in the inaugural WTC final in Southampton from June 18. Break for WTC? However, with the international calendar having become way too tight due to the pandemic and the majority of members preferring to prioritise T20 leagues, the WTC may be forced to take a two-year break, until the ODI World Cup in 2023, before initiating the second WTC cycle. Since the ODI Super League is in limbo due to COVID-19 and three limited-overs world events to be held in the next two years, the ICC Board is likely to adhere to the members’ demands to push the next WTC cycle back by two years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/crucial-icc-board-meet-to-be-held-today/article34693766.ece
01 June 2021||Mumbai,||Jemimah pens a heartfelt note to women cricketers||In the form of a heartfelt note, India's star batter Jemimah Rodrigues has thanked the previous generation of women cricketers who laid the foundation for the team that it has become today. Jemimah wrote the note after the unveiling of the team's white jersey for India's upcoming tour of England. The jerseys were handed out to the team in Mumbai, where the players are currently in quarantine. The 20-year-old said during the event head coach Ramesh Powar showed the squad the legacy of the Indian women's cricket team. "So today (coach) Ramesh (Powar) sir called us for a team meeting and showed us the history we have of women's cricket in India — from where it first started to where it has reached today... The one's who were before us that made it possible for us to be a part of what we are today," Jemimah said in an Instagram post. "The one's who did it without the recognition they deserved, the one's who brought women's cricket in India." Jemimah also said veteran cricketers Jhulan Goswami and Mithali Raj shared their experiences of being part of the squad for a long time. "Then the two legends of Indian women's cricket Mithu di and Jhulu di came up and shared with the entire team what cricket has meant to them and what it's like being a part of this Legacy."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jemimah-pens-a-heartfelt-note-to-women-cricketers/article34693770.ece

01 June 2021||Sao Paulo,||Brazil set to host Copa America||The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) said on Monday it would move next month’s Copa America to Brazil, after original host nation Argentina pulled out at the last minute due to a surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision means the oldest international tournament in the world will kick off as planned on June 13, with the final on July 10. “The 2021 Copa America will be played in Brazil!” CONMEBOL said in a statement. “The start and finish dates are confirmed. The host cities and the matches will be revealed by CONMEBOL in the coming hours.” The announcement comes less than 24 hours after Argentina said its COVID-19 outbreak meant it could not longer host and despite the fact that Brazil is still fighting its own battle with the coronavirus. More than 450,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil. Brazil has routinely reported the continent’s highest case numbers and deaths, and ranks second highest in the world for both daily reported cases and deaths at present. Joint-host plan gone This year’s Copa America was to be the first featuring joint hosts, but Colombia was removed as co-host on May 20 after a wave of protests demanding social and economic change spread across the country. CONMEBOL hoped Argentina could then host all 28 games or share them with South American neighbours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/brazil-set-to-host-copa-america/article34693806.ece
01 June 2021||CHENNAI,||‘Career spans of chess players getting shorter’||Five-time World chess champion Viswanathan Anand on Monday said that the career span of chess players has become shorter than earlier times because of the high level of hard work arising out of intense competition. “The physicality of your life is coming into the sport. The level of physical tension and physical level is much higher now. “So nowadays, it is fitness, fitness and fitness,” Anand said on ‘DRS With Ash’, a show by India cricketer R. Ashwin on Youtube. “This hard work is very energy intense and therefore, career spans are shortening. This is unquestionable,” he added. Asked about playing against younger players, Anand said he would try to bring unfamiliar situations to them by using his vast experience. “Younger players, you could drop them in any situation and they would just calculate better. And how these two strategies clashed? Computers changed that, because it has shortened the time, you need to have experience,” he said. Fischer’s influence Anand said the legendary Bobby Fischer was one of the reasons many began to look chess as a career. “In the 1970s and 80s, probably like many sports, chess was just starting to become like a career. The biggest reason was Bobby Fischer. “It was already a career for people in Soviet Union or the East Block, but that concept didn’t exist anywhere else. “But after Fischer, those doors started to open for everybody,” said Anand. Anand recalled that in India of the 1970s and 80s, chess was not a career option.  Asked if chess players are super intelligent, Anand said, “Chess players are fairly intelligent. You can see these players, even if they quit chess and go and do something else also, they do it quite well.” He also said playing chess helps a person in other ways, like improving memory and concentration. Renowned for his fast style of play, Anand said he was the world’s best rapid player till he was about 40 before the new generation took over. “The generation after that is quite hard to compete with. I’ve had one or two glorious moments like the World Rapid Championship in 2017 which I won. When I won that nobody could expect it and least of all, I didn’t expect it!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/career-spans-of-chess-players-getting-shorter-says-anand/article34693808.ece

Amrinder has signed a five year contract with the Kolkata club, it was announced on Monday.

This is going to be a new chapter in my football career. Winning all the trophies for Mumbai last year was a memorable event in my life. “I want the same success in the green and maroon jersey next season,” Amrinder said in a statement issued by ATKMB. “There are three reasons behind coming to Kolkata. They are a huge number of ATKMB supporters, the football philosophy of coach Habas and the principal owner of the team Sanjiv Goenka and the glorious history of football of this City.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/amrinder-signs-deal-with-atkmb/article34693968.ece

India had lost to Belgium in the quarterfinals in the 2016 Summer Games. Raghunath is not in the list of Olympic probables this time. “The Canada match which we drew cost us in 2016.

They can perform much better than Rio,” said Raghunath in a Hockey India release. At the Olympics, it is all about winning those close games, said Raghunath, who is currently the vice-president of Karnataka Hockey Association. “It comes down to one or two matches and how you get your rhythm right in the arena.

01 June 2021||Chennai,||CCFC owner seeks derecognition of TFA||Rohit Ramesh, owner of former I-League champion Chennai City FC, on Monday, wrote to All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary Kushal Das seeking the derecognition of Tamil Nadu Football Association (TFA). He has also proposed to the National Federation that he plans to register a new entity under Companies Act to function as the State Association (TFA) “to protect and promote the interests of football in Tamil Nadu”. Rohit, also the president of Chennai Football Association (CFA), in his letter, alleged that TFA has failed to conduct competitions and put roadblocks towards the conduct of CFA league, which has not been held since 2018. “The TFA, as per the Constitution of AIFF, is required to compulsorily conduct competitions both at a State level and a District level under Article 14(2)(k). However, neither does the TFA conduct competitions, nor does it allow districts including CFA conduct such competitions. In doing so, they have also acted in violation of the interests of Indian football and AIFF, thereby also violating Article 14(2)(o),” the letter from Rohit said. He further wrote: “..the TFA has presided over the death of more competitions within the state. This is a clear violation of Article 62 of the Constitution of the TFA itself.” Speaking to The Hindu , a TFA source said it has fulfilled all its obligations as far as holding State events in all categories in 2019-20 are concerned. “The last event we conducted was the State women’s league (2019-20) in Chennai before COVID-19 struck and AIFF asked us to stop all the activities,” the source added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ccfc-owner-seeks-derecognition-of-tfa/article34694188.ece

Desai, along with New Zealand’s Nick Webb, are the two S&C coaches of the men’s team and are in charge of getting the side into peak fitness before the World Test Championship final in Southampton from June 18. “Nick and I feel that we have benefited by the gap we got for the boys to take rest. They have had a long year,” said Desai. The Indian team will depart for the UK on Tuesday night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/quarantine-well-utilised-says-desai/article34693767.ece

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A drama before wedding||When Kamsa was driving Devaki and Vasudeva to their palace, a voice was heard saying that Devaki’s eighth child would slay Kamsa. At once Kamsa wanted to kill Devaki, but Vasudeva stopped him and reasoned with him, said V.S. Karunakarachariar in a discourse. Vasudeva argued that it was not Devaki herself who was going to kill Kamsa. It was only her son. Vasudeva promised to give all his children to Kamsa. What could have been going on in Vasudeva’s mind when he made such a promise? There was always the possibility that Kamsa might die before the eighth child was born. It was also possible that Devaki might not have eight children. Moreover, why should the voice of an unseen person be believed? Kamsa agreed, and the chariot began to move again. How was Vasudeva able to hold the attention of a man angry enough to kill? This was a Krishna leela too. We should respect our elders, and attribute our special talents, or good attributes to them. It is to emphasise this that this whole scene took place. Later, Krishna was going to give a lecture to Arjuna on the battlefield. Arjuna was a confused, unhappy man. And yet the Lord was able to get his attention. People would have said Krishna could achieve this because He was son of Vasudeva, the man whose words could ward off Kamsa’s death threat. The last verse of the Bhagavad Gita says wherever Krishna and Arjuna are to be found, there will be prosperity and victory. But Ramanujacharya in his commentary does not use the name Krishna, but says Vasudeva’s son. This was to stress the importance we have to give to our forebears. Krishna arranged for the little drama after Devaki’s wedding to show world that people must recognise that their good qualities come from their elders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/a-drama-before-wedding/article34693722.ece

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Front row seats for everyone||In 2020, the celebrated trinity of Carnatic music —Thyagaraja Swamy, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Sastry — was witness to thundering applause on a stage in Toronto, Canada. Rather, the musicians and actors who played them received the applause.  Trinity , The Madras Players’ rendition of Seetha Ravi’s short stories translated by Prabha Sridevan, retired judge of the Madras High Court, has been on stage since 2018. The 66-year-old theatre group’s creation, which strings together the lives of these three musical stalwarts into a single narrative, marries Carnatic music and live theatre making it an intruiging “Indian musical” to international audiences. The translation of Seetha Ravi’s short stories was first published in 2017, in The Hindu Sunday Magazine , on three consecutive Sundays. It was then picked up by director PC Ramakrishna. After premiering in Chennai in 2018, it travelled to Hyderabad and was later invited to Toronto, Houston, Austin, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, Philadelphia, New Jersey and Dallas in 2020. But the pandemic had other plans and the tour was cut short. After having had to cancel their tour of 11 shows in the US, following a successful run in Canada, the crew has now recorded the play for a global audience. Sabhas in Singapore and Australia, apart from the US, had expressed interest, says Ramakrishna. The two-hour-long play was filmed on the premises of Kalakshetra with a four-camera (high definition) setup. “I wanted the visual quality of film, including close ups and reactions, but the feel of stage. We used the same set that we had used for the stage,” says the director. Since the performance is heavy on live music, the songs were recorded separately and were mixed in post production. The shots were chosen sequence by sequence at the edit table which took about a month and a half to be completed, says Ramakrishna, adding, “It was important to me that the audience feel that they are still sitting in the front row.” Why does Trinity have a global appeal, despite it being set in the niche world of Carnatic music and South Indian culture? “The [Indian] diaspora brought up in music and dance abroad, appreciates the play because it deals with both music and theatre. Many in the second generation, who are learning music and dance, can now sit with their family and watch the play from wherever they are,” says Ramakrishna. Moreover, the cast — Vijay Siva playing Muthuswami Dikshitar, Gayathri Venkataraghavan as Lalitha (wife of Shyama Sastri) and S. Sunder as Thyagaraja — are not unfamiliar names, especially in North America. This is also the time when artistes travel for their individual tours, and also perform in festivals like the Cleveland Thyagaraja Festival. The diaspora is now deprived of such experiences owing to the pandemic and hence the interest in performances like this, even though virtual, has seen a rise. “The original play was 90 minutes. When North America invited us, they said they needed it to be two hours long with the musical content increased. So, I added 30 more minutes across the three sections,” says Ramakrishna.  Working in collaboration with kalakendra.com, Trinity will be launched for public viewing on June 25, 26 and 27.

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Kinsman, we have your back||Fire stunts, horse riding scenes and rebellious movement make Madurai Veeran Koothu a herculean performance to pull off. The lesser-known artform, which comes under the umbrella of therukoothu , follows the story of the underdog — an oppressed shoemaker’s son who rose through the ranks, only to be killed — and is performed with fiery wooden spokes. For 30 years, Dharmapuri Ramakrishnan lived and breathed as Madurai Veeran on stages across Tamil Nadu. It has been more than a year since he saw a stage. Earlier, when he did not have a show, he would cook for weddings. That, too, is not an option anymore. As a result of the ongoing pandemic, community-based, folk artistes who perform for weddings, funerals and temple festivals are staring at a seemingly endless period of unemployment. Since most of these forms are physical in nature, making them difficult to translate virtually, artistes are unlikely to be hired for many months to come. These are also communities who also lack resources to pivot online. Across the country, their contemporaries are leading energetic movements to fuel creative crowdfunding campaigns. Anahad’s Together Louder Stronger, an online event on September 26 will feature over 20 artistes — Shaan, Jonita Gandhi, Benny Dayal, When Chai Met Toast to name a few — performing from home to support folk groups. The campaign has already raised Rs. 45 lakh. Similiarly, Artkhoj and RK Foundations’ All for Folk initiative encourages patrons to book folk artists for online sessions and get-togethers. In Tamil Nadu, artist and activist R. Kaleeswaran, who has been working with folk artists for 25 years, says he has personally seen how badly they fared last lockdown. “It is only getting worse. Many artistes have lost their lives to COVID as well,” adds Kaleeswaran, who is founder of Alternative Media Centre, a non-profit organisation in Chennai that works with 50,000 folk artistes. The months of April, May, June and July are especially crucial as everyone, from parai artists to theatre actors, get booked for temple festivals, weddings and community events.“These are the months when they receive income. And it is with this income that they run the next four months,” he says. A vibrant community There are about seven lakh folk artistes across Tamil Nadu. Though there are around 75 groups and associations of artistes, only 38,850 of these performers have been registered with the Government of Tamil Nadu. In 2020, as a special assistance aid, each registered artiste was given Rs. 2,000 by the Tamil Nadu Folk Artistes Welfare Board. But many do not fall under this purview. Last year, with the help of cinema personalities like actors Surya, Samudira Kani, director Karthik Subburaj and many others, Kaleeswaran was able to raise close to Rs. 45 lakh. Back then and now, the backbone of Kaleeswaran’s team of volunteers has been a group of 200 students from Loyola College who understand the performers’ needs, prepare care packages and distribute funds. This time around, the crew has also partnered with Revamp by Aaval, an initiative by Chennai-based curator Priyanka Ulaganathan who is connecting with contemporary artists, patrons and audiences via social media “In the first lockdown, there was a lot of help pouring in, but this time it’s not the same since no one expected the second wave,“ says Priyanka, who has amplified the campaign by pulling in fellow artists’ works as well. “We decided to give an art print in return for anyone who contributes. This is not a ‘buying’ structure. Patrons can choose whether or not to take a print.” This is their first fundraiser, and they have raised Rs. 2 lakh already, she says. Beyond State lines While Kaleeshawaran’s project tries to reach performers in all 38 districts of Tamil Nadu, Chennai-based artiste and music producer Tenma, Shreya Nagarajan Singh and gaana singer Muthu, hope to look at Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as well, through their Funds For Folk campaign. Another pan-India effort comes from Chennai-based Sumanasa Foundation, that has been crowdfunding since March 2020. To bolster the campaign, the foundation conducted an online performing arts festival — Margazhi Manch, last December. They have distributed Rs. 1.05 crore to over 3,000 artistes representing over 250 art forms. Funds for Folk campaign plans to cater to 1,000 artistes, whom the team has worked with extensively. Tenma says, “The most annoying part is that people always assert their parambariyam (tradition) but when the time comes to really get out there and help, there aren’t many channels.” Hailing from starkly different artistic backgrounds has helped Tenma, Shreya and Muthu to do intersectional work. To that end, there also seems to be a movement among young, contemporary performers who wish to mobilise. Tenma believes this is a by-product of the generation addressing its roots, while on a search for its own identity. After an audit to understand the specific needs, they put together funds, utilities and care packages. “We will do one rollout within the next couple of weeks, and one more in another month. We see this status quo continuing for a while,” adds Shreya. Three days in, they have already raised over Rs. 6 lakhs. “We want to be an informal support system. That’s what this structure lacks,” Shreya says. Kaleeshwaran echoes this sentiment. “We are perhaps one of the few States that have a department dedicated to folk arts in the government. I wish to see it being active now more than ever.”  The months of April, May, June and July are especially crucial for folk artsites who get booked for temple festivals and community events||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/kinsman-we-have-your-back/article34693909.ece
01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Worlds shaped by laughter||According to Japanese mythology, the world was once saved from eternal darkness due to laughter. Amaterasu, the Shinto sun goddess, goes into hiding in a cave after her brother, Susanoo, shames her. Because of this, the world becomes dark and cold. Despite many attempts at persuasion by other gods, she fails to return. Then, Amenouzume, the goddess of dawn, merriment and humour, begins a comical dance. The other kamis (Shinto gods or spirits) laugh uncontrollably. Amaterasu, curious about the laugh, steps out of the cave, restoring the world’s light. French visual artist Anaïs Tondeur’s latest work,When the World was a Laugh, was inspired by this mythology. It is being showcased atContagion, Science Gallery Bengaluru’s online art and science exhibition. The work features a video of fine powder on a thin surface vibrated by laughter played from speakers underneath. The vibrations disturb the powder, causing a change in the landscape. Anaïs attempts to recreate the formation of mountains. “This is what happens on a geologic scale on a much longer timescale,” she says via a video call from France. Her miniature world is literally shaped by laughter. The nine-minute clip has different kinds of laughs including cackles, chortles, snorts, snickers, belly-laughs, a chorus of hysterics and even ‘laughter’ of animals and birds. For this project, Anaïs wanted a collection of laughs from different parts of the world. From France she collected over 30 laughs, including those of animals from forests and the countryside. “You can argue if the animals were actually laughing. But it is more of our interpretation,” she says. Due to travel restrictions, she could not complete the task in person and asked people to send her recordings of laughter. She got 70 laughs from other parts of the world, including Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune, Durgapur and New Delhi. “We classified this collection according to emotions of colours” — she colour-coded the laughs to make a digital mural — “We also wrote a story from all the laughs we received.” Then, with sound artist Floriane Pochone, Anaïs created a soundscape of laughter. “It was as if we were playing with musical notes but the notes were made of laughter,” she explains, “We are planning to add more laughter.” She also intends to display a physical installation of her work, wherein the audience can record their laughter and see how it changes the topography.

01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||K-pop on the wall||Whenever he walks into a room, Narresh Kukreja notices the walls first. “Consciously or unconsciously, your eyes always [go to] the largest surface area, more than the furniture or rugs,” says Kukreja, one half of Delhi-based designer duo Shivan & Narresh. It is no surprise then that following a line of table linens last year, the two now have a series of 10 art wallpaper prints. Drawn from five of their collections, namely Seoul, Araki, Edomer, Patu and Wilding 20s, it echoes what Kukreja had shared with The Hindu Weekend in January, that “2021 is going to be a tale of individuals wanting to tell a personal story through their homes — stories of their work, their travels”. Seoul vibes to Japanese art The wallpapers feature an eclectic mix of designs, from Renaissance art (Ballerina Carlotta Chabert as Venus on the Dame wallpaper) and Seychellois elements in a distinct Edo Art aesthetic on the Praslin wallpaper, to a seven-coloured print inspired by Korean pop culture on the Mujigay wallpaper. “We’re fortunate to have a collection of signature prints. So, it essentially came down to choosing which prints would work and deciding the right scale for it to be used as interior design,” Kukreja says, confirming that the material used is non-woven, high-quality paper. Mujigay (meaning rainbow) came from their 2020 Seoul Series, which was inspired by a 2019  visit to South Korea. “It is called so because of the strong K-pop vibe the city has,” he continues, recommending the energetic print for a child’s bedroom, a gym, or a lounge where people mingle. “Other prints like the Hututi is inspired by the traditional folk arts of Korea. You’ll see hand-painted birds and temples in the backdrop. There is a sense of traditionality to the wallpaper; it would be nice in a formal space. At the same time, they almost look like vintage stamps.” The Palmera features palm leaves and black panthers, a very Indian aesthetic, but here “inspired by a famous Japanese photo artist called Araki”. Break the white rule Kukreja adds, “As a rule of thumb, if you have a small space, there’s no point in painting it white and trying to make it larger. Instead, take the space and make it impactful.” Reiterating that the collection will provide a window to the world, Kukreja shares, “Even if people are stuck at home and not travelling, it will always be the first thing on their minds. That’s how important travel is going to be this year and probably the next as well. So to look at the wall, and get lost and discover new elements, is a very good way of escaping”.  Starts at Rs. 15,950 per roll, shivanandnarresh.com.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/k-pop-on-the-wall/article34693910.ece
01 June 2021||New Delhi,||Few Covaxin slots available, getting a second dose a task||Several people who are due to get their second Covaxin shots are finding it difficult to book slots due to a limited supply of the vaccine in the national capital. Efficacy of first dose Many of them have taken to social media to raise concerns over whether the first dose would be effective if the second dose is not administered within the stipulated period. Sanoop Krishnan (32), a nursing officer at the LNJP hospital, said the due date for his second dose was on Monday, but he did could not book the slot. “I had taken the vaccine on May 3. Later, I got a message that my due date was May 31. I have been trying to book a slot for the past two days, but nothing is available. The Central government should have purchased the vaccines instead of asking States to buy themselves,” the nurse said. Mr. Krishnan added that as a healthcare worker, he was hopeful of getting the second dose on time. But, he feels, that the general public would face even more difficulties. South Delhi resident Geetika Sengupta said the 42-day period between the two doses was already over and she had still not managed to book a slot. “When I asked at the hospital where I took the first shot, they informed me that vaccines were not available. I was told that several others like me are awaiting their second dose. The hospital said there was a possibility of vaccines being available after June 15, but there was no confirmation on the same,” said Ms. Sengupta. A 28-year-old who took the first dose of Covaxin on May 4 said: “I have been trying to book a slot for the past one week but centres are not available. The government should have kept a reserve for people who got the first dose of Covaxin.” Delhi has been facing a shortage of vaccines. Free vaccinations drive for the 18-44 age group — both Covaxin and Covishield — are not being conducted at government schools for over a week now, as per an official bulletin. Taking to Twitter, several people questioned the efficacy of the first dose if the second one was not administered within the specified period. Tagging Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on a tweet, Radhika Tongar, one such Twitter user wrote: “How is one supposed to get (the) second Covaxin dose considering no slots are opening for it. And as far as I know, the window for it hasn’t been revised too. What happens when my 42 days get over soon? [sic]” Vikram Garg, another Twitter user wrote, “…Opening Cowin site five times a day for the last three days, every slot is booked in Delhi, Noida and Gurgaon. No slot available, neither free nor paid. No point in dose 1 if dose 2 is not available. [sic]” Atishi seeks more jabs Meanwhile, AAP leader Atishi on Monday said: “Vaccinations are happening for the youth in Delhi only at private facilities at higher rates. There is no commitment from the Central government on vaccines for youth. According to the Centre, the first instalment will come on June 10 and only 5.5 lakh vaccine doses for the youth in the next month. We need 50 lakh more doses for them in Delhi. We appeal to the Centre to give more vaccines.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/few-covaxin-slots-available-getting-a-second-dose-a-task/article34693916.ece
01 June 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. panel bids to quell Punjab factionalism||As factionalism in Punjab reached a crisis point, a three-member Congress committee started meeting lawmakers from the State to work out an amicable solution. With Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh and senior party leader Navjot Sidhu on a war path over the 2015 sacrilege issue, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has tasked Opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress general secretary in-charge of Punjab Harish Rawat and senior leader J.P. Agarwal to broker peace. “The meeting was for manthan [brainstorming]. It’s not about any individual but Punjab and the Congress. These meetings will take place over three days and MLAs, MPs and senior leaders will share their views on how to consolidate the position,” Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar told reporters after he met the panel. For the past several weeks, Mr. Sidhu has been attacking the Amarinder Singh government for failing to hold the previous Parkash Singh Badal-led Akali government responsible for the 2015 Kotkapura firing incident following the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in Punjab’s Faridkot. “Those who have given orders and killed unarmed Sikhs will not be spared,” responded Mr. Jakhar without naming anyone. ‘Tacit support’ Supporters of the Chief Minister argued that Mr. Sidhu’s open rebellion cannot take place without the tacit support from the party high command since the cricketer-turned-politician is known to be close to former party chief Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Captain Singh’s loyalists also objected to Mr. Gandhi reportedly speaking to some of the Punjab MLAs through an aide ahead of their meeting with the three-member panel. Apart from Mr. Sidhu, the Chief Minister also faces challenge from former Punab Congress chief Partap Singh Bajwa and Samsher Singh Dullo. Among those who met the panel included Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal and Ministers Tript Bajwa, Brahm Mohindra, O.P. Soni, Rana Sodhi, Sukhjinder Randhawa among others. The outcome of these meetings will be important as the party is seeking to revamp its Punjab unit before Assembly elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-panel-bids-to-quell-punjab-factionalism/article34694241.ece
01 June 2021||New Delhi,||BJP leaders abusing Kejriwal to hide their failures: Sisodia||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Monday alleged that BJP leaders are “abusing” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to “hide” their failures. “First they stopped oxygen for the people of Delhi. Now, Arvind Kejriwal ji is saying that we need to vaccinate all Delhiites and they are abusing him,” Mr. Sisodia said in a video. He said the Chief Minister wants to vaccinate as many people as possible before a possible third wave. Delhi has been facing a shortage of vaccines and free vaccination of the 18-44 age group has not been happening in government schools for over a week now. ‘BJP holding elections’ “To hide their own failures in COVID management, BJP leaders keep on making false statements. When the nation was reeling with COVID cases and needed immediate help, the BJP government was more interested in managing their image and conducting elections,” Mr. Sisodia said. He said the Centre denied oxygen supply to Delhi and Mr. Kejriwal had to go to court to “fight” for the same. “Now, when Kejriwal ji is asking for adequate vaccines to inoculate all citizens, BJP leaders are again acting as obstructionists. BJP leaders can continue to say whatever they want until all citizens of Delhi are not vaccinated, Kejriwal ji will continue to fight for vaccines for all. It is shameful that BJP is playing such petty politics when its leaders should instead be vaccinating citizens in their own States,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-leaders-abusing-kejriwal-to-hide-their-failures-sisodia/article34693926.ece
01 June 2021||June 01 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Aggressive nature of pandemic’s second wave handled effectively’||The State-Level Core Team on COVID-19 Management and Care in Rajasthan has effectively handled the aggressive nature of second wave of pandemic by managing the younger and paediatric population. But the adolescent s, who have not been vaccinated so far, may be affected more in the subsequent waves, says Dr. Sudhir Bhandari, head of the Core Team and Principal of Sawai Man Singh Government Medical College, Jaipur.  The COVID-19 pandemic has put an unprecedented load on health facilities and stretched the infrastructure in Rajasthan to its limits. How can we ensure optimum utilisation of the available resources, including oxygen, and convince the people to make a judicious use of facilities available? The second wave of pandemic has been very aggressive with more and more younger population and children being affected. Unlike the first wave, 60% to 70% of the moderate to severe patients are oxygen dependent and require critical care. To meet out this situation, we have created COVID-19 triage at our dedicated institutions, where we segregated mild or asymptomatic for home quarantine, while the mild to moderate are admitted to provide them medical support. We have also conducted sensitisation programmes for doctors, paramedics and public at large for early reporting, optimal use of oxygen, proning and physiotherapy. As the head of the State-Level Core Team on COVID-19 Management and Care, what was your remit and how have you helped the State government in identifying the key areas where action was needed? Since the beginning of the first wave, we have been working intensely with our core team in various directions, such as building up infrastructure for COVID-19 patients, creating more oxygenated and ventilated beds and enhancing the capacity for RT-PCR testing. We started with zero test at Sawai Man Singh Hospital and raised to 10,000 tests per day. We are now capable of conducting more than one lakh RT-PCR tests a day in the entire State. Our team was the first to use hydroxychloroquine and antiviral drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir in the first three Italian COVID-19 patients. The core team headed by me has effectively handled the aggressive nature of the pandemic’s second wave by managing the younger and paediatric population. You were the first person to receive the COVID-19 vaccine dose in Rajasthan. Are there still apprehensions among the people about vaccination and have you succeeded in sending a clear message that our indigenous vaccine is safe? I had the honour of being the first person in Rajasthan to get vaccinated. Since we were the first in many ways, such as using hydroxychloroquine and implementing the COVID management protocols, I wanted to boost the morale of the whole medical fraternity by taking the vaccine first and increase the acceptability by the public at large with the confidence that the vaccines are safe. There are reports that people are contracting infection even after getting one or both the doses of vaccine. Does it mean that the vaccine does not provide full protection and the people should adhere to the COVID appropriate protocol? It is true that even after two doses, people are getting infection. The vaccination only protects from critical disease and ventilation and one might still contact asymptomatic or mild infection. Therefore, the compliance with the COVID appropriate behaviour, especially wearing the face mask and maintaining distance, is a must even after vaccination.  What is the likelihood of a third wave of the pandemic hitting Rajasthan and the country? As per the epidemiological studies, the third and fourth waves of the pandemic are predicted somewhere between September and December this year. They can also merge with the second wave. There is a possibility that the adolescents and children, who have not been vaccinated, may be affected more in the third wave, as the middle age and elderly population has been vaccinated to quite an extent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/aggressive-nature-of-pandemics-second-wave-handled-effectively/article34694237.ece

01 June 2021||New Delhi,||CM says city may get Sputnik V from June 20; positivity rate dips below 1%||The test positivity rate (TPR) of COVID-19 cases fell to 0.99% in the city — the lowest in more than two months — according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Monday. Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik will be given to Delhi probably after June 20. “Sputnik will probably offer vaccines after June 20. Right now, they are importing the vaccines and they will allot a section of their imported vaccines to the Delhi government. They will start domestic production from August,” the Chief Minister said. On Monday, Mr. Kejriwal inaugurated a free walk-in vaccination facility for journalists and their families at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya near ITO. “This facility will vaccinate journalists and their families of both age groups — 18-45 years and above those above 45 years — free of cost. Vaccination is the need of the hour to protect yourself from COVID. I appeal to all the journalists to come here and get themselves vaccinated for free,” Mr. Kejriwal said. A TPR of 0.99% means that less than one person out of 100 people taking COVID tests are positive for the virus. The last time the positivity was less than this was on March 19, when it was 0.93%. The TPR was as high as 36% on April 22 and has been coming down since then. 648 fresh cases The city reported 648 new COVID-19 cases in 24 hours, taking the total cases to 14,26,240. Also, 86 deaths were reported, and the total number of deaths stood at 24,237. A total of 65,240 tests were done in a day, the bulletin said. Of the total cases, 13,90,963 people have recovered and there are 11,040 active cases. Also, out of the total 24,852 hospital beds for COVID-19, 80.7% of beds were vacant. At the peak of the second wave in April, only 5-6% of beds were vacant on many days. The Chief Minister also said the city currently has around 944 cases of black fungus, including 300 at the Central government-run hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cm-says-city-may-get-sputnik-v-from-june-20-positivity-rate-dips-below-1/article34693921.ece
01 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP asks why ‘healthcare facilities failed despite AAP govt. spending over Rs. 40 cr.’||The Delhi BJP on Monday said questions need to be raised why Delhi’s healthcare facilities failed during the second COVID wave that led to numerous deaths despite Rs. 44.262 crore being spent on the health sector. The party also alleged that the Delhi government was discriminating among COVID warriors in terms of giving compensation on death in the line of duty and was not revealing the exact figures for the number of deaths. State BJP president Adesh Gupta at a press conference said: “When people were dying in second COVID wave in absence of medical facilities, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his team was busy thinking whom to blame for this and how to save the save face rather than controlling the situation, which led to many deaths.” Mr. Gupta said according to data from the municipal corporations, in the last week of April, 700 people were cremated or buried in on a day. But the State government data stated that not more than 450 died . He added that figures reveal that between April 1 to May 17 in all three corporations' crematoriums and cemeteries, there were 16,593 COVID victims whereas, during this period, the Kejriwal government released figure of only 11,061 deaths. LOP Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said records show that the number of COVID warriors is above 500 but the Delhi government has so far honoured only about a dozen of them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-asks-why-healthcare-facilities-failed-despite-aap-govt-spending-over-rs-40-cr/article34693924.ece
01 June 2021||JAIPUR,||Pakistani migrants get the jab after HC intervention||Amid an uncertainty about their citizenship status, Pakistani Hindu migrants residing in Jodhpur district have started getting COVID-19 vaccination following an intervention of the Rajasthan High Court. However, the migrants who do not possess any of the prescribed identity documents were still not getting the vaccine. A Division Bench of the High Court ruled that the Centre’s standard operating procedure (SOP) on vaccination did not exclude the migrants from Pakistan. The State government, which is yet to take a final decision on the issue, has sought some time from the court for furnishing details about the steps taken to implement the SOP. The Medical and Health Department organised vaccination camps in Kali Beri, Alkausar Nagar and Anganwa localities on the outskirts of Jodhpur city over the weekend. Hindu Singh Sodha, president of Seemant Lok Sangathan, told The Hindu on Monday that the distinction made on the basis of identity documents had deprived these migrants of vaccine protection. “The Union government has stated in the court that the vaccines will be provided based on the information from the State about the groups needing inoculation.” The State government submitted to the court that about 25,000 Pakistani minority migrants were at present residing in various districts, including 7,500 in Jodhpur. The Bench also directed the State government to ensure that ration material and food packets were made available to the needy Pakistani migrants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/pakistani-migrants-get-the-jab-after-hc-intervention/article34693914.ece
