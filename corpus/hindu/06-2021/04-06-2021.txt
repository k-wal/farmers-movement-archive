04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Significant progress in SDGs on clean energy, health: NITI index||India saw significant improvement in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to clean energy, urban development and health in 2020, according to the NITI Aayog’s 2020 SDG Index. However, there has been a major decline in the areas of industry, innovation and infrastructure as well as decent work and economic growth. Although the index shows improvement on the inequality SDGs, the NITI Aayog has omitted key economic indicators used to measure inequality in income and expenditure last year and given greater weightage to social indicators instead. Kerala retained its position at the top of the rankings in the third edition of the index, with a score of 75, followed by Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh, both scoring 72. At the other end of the scale, Bihar, Jharkhand and Assam were the worst performing States. However, all the States showed some improvement from last year’s scores, with Mizoram and Haryana seeing the biggest gains. Developed by a global consultative process on holistic development, the 17 SDGs have a 2030 deadline. The NITI Aayog launched its index in 2018 to monitor the country’s progress on the goals through data-driven assessment and to foster a competitive spirit among the States and Union Territories in achieving them. In March, an assessment by the UN of the impact of COVID-19 on the SDGs said the region India is part of may see rising inequality due to the pandemic. The NITI Aayog Index shows some improvement in the SDG on inequality, but a look at the indicators used to assess this goal shows that the think tank has changed the goalposts. Thrust on social equality In 2019, the indicators for inequality included the growth rates for household expenditure per capita among the bottom 40% of rural and urban populations, as well as the Gini coefficient — a measure of the distribution of income — in rural and urban India. The 2018 indicators included the Palma ratio, another metric for income inequality. Such economic measures have been omitted from the indicators used for this SDG in the 2020 edition of the Index. Instead, it gives greater weightage to social equality indicators, such as the percentage of women and Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe representatives in State Legislatures and the panchayati raj institutions and the levels of crime against the SC/ST communities. The only economic indicator this year is the percentage of population in the lowest two wealth quintiles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/significant-progress-in-sdgs-on-clean-energy-health-niti-index/article34722391.ece
04 June 2021||Krishnadas Rajagopal,||‘Journalists need protection against sedition charges’||The Supreme Court on Thursday quashed a sedition case registered against senior journalist and Padma Shri awardee Vinod Dua for his critical remarks against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union government in a YouTube telecast, underscoring its 59-year-old verdict that “strong words” of disapproval about the ruling regime did not amount to sedition. Free speech A Bench, led by Justice U.U. Lalit, upheld the right of every journalist to criticise, even brutally, the measures of the government with a view to improving or altering them through legal means. The free speech of a journalist should be protected from charges of sedition. The time is long past when the mere criticism of governments was sufficient to constitute sedition. The right to utter honest and reasonable criticism is a source of strength to a community rather than a weakness, the judgment said. It upheld the spirit and intent of the 1962 Kedar Nath Singh verdict, which said, “Commenting in strong terms upon the measures or acts of the government, or the governmental agencies, so as to ameliorate the condition of the people or to secure the cancellation or alteration of those acts or measures by lawful means, that is to say, without exciting those feelings of enmity and disloyalty which imply excitement to public disorder or the use of violence is not sedition”. ‘Entintled to protection’ Justice Lalit declared, “Every journalist is entitled to protection under the Kedar Nath Singh judgment.” The 1962 judgment said Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (sedition) was intended only to punish subversion of a lawfully established government through violent means.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/journalists-need-protection-against-sedition-charges/article34722386.ece

04 June 2021||New Delhi,||HC orders action against Gambhir’s foundation for stocking Fabiflu||The Drugs Control Department of Delhi on Thursday informed the High Court that the Gautam Gambhir Foundation (GGF) had been found “guilty of unauthorisedly stocking, procuring and distributing Fabiflu (medicine) to COVID-19 patients”. A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh told the drug controller to take action in the case. “Firstly, you do charity for charity. Doing charity for some other reason is no charity. We want to curb this practice and for this, we want you [drug controller] to take action,” it said. Noting the manner in which cricketer-turned-politician Gautam Gambhir procured huge quantity of the drug when it was in short supply in Delhi, the court said, “This was certainly not the way. In this pandemic it should not be done just because people have means to do it. It should not be that I will do it for one class or for my constituency people and it should not be for popularity.” The drug controller submitted that action would be taken without delay against the foundation and drug dealers too in similar cases that would be brought to its notice. ‘AAP MLA also guilty’ It said that AAP MLA Praveen Kumar had also been found guilty for similar offence under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and action would be taken against him. The drug controller’s counsel said that show-cause notices have been issued to licensees as well as those who were found to have breached the law and their responses were awaited. The court asked the drug controller to file status report within six weeks and posted the matter for hearing on July 29. It was hearing a petition seeking the lodging of an FIR on the allegations that politicians were able to procure and distribute COVID-19 medicines in huge quantities even as patients were running from pillar to post to get them. Soon after the High Court hearing, Mr. Gambhir quoted Bhagat Singh in a tweet. “I am a man and all that affects mankind concerns me - Sardar Bhagat Singh!” he posted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-orders-action-against-gambhirs-foundation-for-stocking-fabiflu/article34722874.ece

A proposal to this effect was sent for sanction to the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), led by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, and was cleared by it. State School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad on Wednesday said the proposal to cancel the exam was sent to the SDMA. “Students have been under pressure due to the pandemic for the last 14 months.

The State has cancelled the exam to protect students’ health, psychological well-being and to maintain uniformity in evaluation of performance from different boards,” she said. Ms. Gaikwad said the State government would soon announce the evaluation mechanism and the date of results. She said considering the board, school and college exams in future, the students, teachers and non-teaching staff should be given the status of frontline workers and given vaccination on priority. “I had requested the Union government earlier to vaccinate teachers and non-teaching staff first. The geographical situation was also an issue [while cancelling exams] — there will be monsoon in Maharashtra soon,” Ms. Gaikwad said. The Minister said she was aware of the challenges students are facing. “I am aware of the tension among parents and students. They were facing two challenges: COVID-19 and studies. The issue of mental stress on students was also discussed with officials,” she said.

04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Talks on with Pfizer, J&J, Moderna: MEA||India is in talks to allow major foreign vaccine manufacturers to carry out “local manufacturing”, said Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Thursday, as the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) asserted it was making “all efforts” to increase vaccine supplies, particularly from the U.S. Severe second wave Addressing the WHO’s South-East Asia Regional Health Partners’ Forum, Mr. Shringla said India was fighting an “exceptionally severe second wave” of the pandemic. “We are also part of the discussions with major vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna on sourcing and possible local manufacturing of their vaccines in India. We have also helped expedite the introduction of Sputnik V,” he said. In an order on February 5 last, U.S. President Joe Biden invoked the Defence Production Act for vaccine components, putting a squeeze on India’s vaccine manufacturing. Mr. Shringla said MEA’s representatives had been working to “ease regulatory disruptions to supply chains”. MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, replying to questions on the outcome of Mr. Jaishankar’s week-long U.S. visit, said, “We are also engaged with the U.S. administration to ensure that necessary components and raw materials for vaccine production in India are readily available. This issue was taken up most recently during External Affairs Minister [Jaishankar]’s visit to the U.S”. U.S. allocations  India was also awaiting the U.S. allocations from its surplus stockpile of 80 million Astra Zeneca vaccines, he added. In his address to the WHO, Mr. Shringla said India would create “global scale capacities” necessary to fight the pandemic. “A number of serious global conversations are under way on this in platforms such as the G7, the G20, QUAD, BRICS, the United Nations and the WTO itself,” he noted.

04 June 2021||New Delhi,||1,044 cases of mucormycosis in city||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said a total of 1,044 cases of mucormycosis (black fungus) have been reported in the city so far. “Till yesterday (Wednesday), 1,044 black fungus cases were there in Delhi. Out of these, around 92 patients have recovered fully and around 89 people have lost their lives due to black fungus,” the Minister said. The others are still under treatment at different healthcare facilities, he said. The test positivity rate of COVID-19 has remained less than 1% for four consecutive days. This is a “good sign”, said Mr. Jain and urged people to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour. “My appeal to every citizen is that please maintain social distancing, wear a mask all the time, and wash your hands from time to time.” Covaxin quandary Mr. Jain also said that many people who have taken the first dose of Covaxin are not getting the scheduled second dose in Delhi and added that the situation has become like this because of the “mismanagement” by the Central government. “They have changed the schedule for vaccination. If the Central government had given us the required number of vaccines, then no problem would have happened. But they are not providing vaccines. We are hopeful that people who are waiting for the Covaxin second dose will get it as early as possible,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/1044-cases-of-mucormycosis-in-city/article34722871.ece
04 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||Nagaland sextet drives 45-plus free for COVID-19 vaccine||Almost a year after using his SUV (sports utility vehicle) as an ambulance to ferry non-COVID-19 patients to and from hospitals, Nagaland’s H.A. Hongnao Konyak is back with his free drive for a cause. He is not alone this time. Five other vehicle owners, including two women, have joined him in ferrying 45-plus people to and from COVID-19 vaccination camps in Mon, the headquarters of Mon district bordering Myanmar. Perched 655 metres above sea level, Mon is about 355 km northeast of Nagaland capital Kohima. “COVID-19 vaccination among the 45-plus slowed down considerably after the initial enthusiasm. We found out people were reluctant to take the jab at the District Hospital, also serving as COVID Hospital,” Mon’s Deputy Commissioner Thavaseelan Karunanidhy said. More than a week ago, the district authorities decided to organise a vaccination camp at the Mon playground. But it was easier said than done; very few in the hill town had vehicles. On May 30, about 80 people — many above 60 years — turned up to get the jab. Some of them came in the vehicles of the six “free-wheelers” who call their group Civic Wheels. “They fetched the senior citizens to the camp, waited for 30 minutes to observe for any reaction and dropped them back home. We offered to bear their fuel expenses but they declined,” Mr. Karunanidhy said. The district administration had used various modes of communication, including social media, to let the town of some 30,000 people know about the six-member Civic Wheels and how to avail a free ride to and from the camp. Mr. Konyak’s partners are Phelem Naam, the only female pastor among the Konyaks, the Naga community that dominates Mon district; cancer survivor and social worker Affe Winkangshu; school teacher Tingmei Wangshu; government employee Shongwang; and Sashi, who runs an NGO.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nagaland-sextet-gives-free-ride-to-45-plus-for-vaccine/article34722515.ece

04 June 2021||ONGOLE,||Villagers raise Rs. 20 lakh to save ‘people’s doctor’||N. Bhaskara Rao, a doctor and Medical Officer of the Primary Health Centre (PHC) at the remote Karamchedu village in Prakasam district, had helped hundreds of people infected by COVID-19 stage a smart recovery, instilling in them the much-needed courage to combat the viral disease. The 38-year-old doctor had used all his persuasive skills to convince the villagers to undergo the COVID-19 test and get themselves vaccinated as the virus spread thick and fast. In the process, he himself had contracted the virus on April 24. Initially, he had taken treatment in Vijayawada. Later, he was shifted to a corporate hospital in Hyderabad as he suffered from “post-COVID fibrosis.” “He has been on ventilator support for long. Doctors treating him now advise organ transplant as his lungs are not responding to the treatment,” says Nayudamma, a native of the village. Mr. Nayudamma has taken the initiative to bring together like-minded people for a great cause. Repaying their “debt to the people’s doctor” in their own way, people of the rice rich Karamchedu village in Krishna western delta and neighbouring villages such as Swarna and Nagulapalem have mobilised over Rs. 20 lakh for the treatment of Dr. Bhaskara Rao. Crowdfunding This is not enough as the estimated medical expenditure for the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) procedures, pre-operative treatment, lung transplant, and post-operative care is expected to be between Rs. 1.50 crore to Rs. 2 crore. Hence, his wife B. Bhagyalakshmi, also a radiologist, has accessed the crowdfunding platform, ImpactGuru, to mobilise funds from large-hearted people while looking for support from the the Andhra Pradesh Government as well. “My husband has no previous medical history. He is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. He needs lung transplant as the last resort for a new lease of life,” she said. Dr. Bhaskara Rao also has aged parents and a 13-year-old son to take care of.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-ap-villagers-raise-rs-20-lakh-to-save-the-peoples-doctor/article34722354.ece

Bhoopal Reddy, one of the senior most members of the Legislative Council, was appointed pro-tem Chairman of the Council by Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan as the incumbent chairman and vice-chairman retired at the end of their term on Thursday. Mr. Reddy was a three-time member of the Council who got elected from local bodies’ constituency on each occasion. He was a Mandal Praja Parishad president prior to his election as MLC. He won on Congress ticket in the first term and switched to TRS in the second. Incidentally, the Election Commission had recently postponed election to fill six vacancies in the Council. However, one vacancy will arise on June 16 from the Governor’s quota. Even if the present chairman was to be nominated to the Council from this quota, a special session of the Upper House has to be convened for the election of the chairman. The Governor must issue a fresh notification convening the session because it was only on Thursday that that the last session of both Houses of legislature was prorogued. This was the second instance of a pro-tem chairman’s appointment to the Council, the earlier occasion being in 2011 when both the chairman A. Chakrapani and vice-chairman Mohammed Jani retired.

In a press release here on Thursday, president of Dharwad district unit of AIDSO Mahanthesh Bilur and secretary Ranjit Dhoopad have said that AIDSO strongly condemned the government’s delay in taking a decision on the examinations that were postponed long ago. They have in the release said that the delay in taking a decision on the examinations will not only put students in a state of confusion but also a create a sort of mental pressure. Even if the government decides to hold the examinations, it will have to first conduct classes, which seemed uncertain considering the possibility of a third wave of the pandemic.  So, considering all these aspects, the government should first cancel the examinations and then work out a scientific evaluation system in consultation with teachers and educational experts to confer grades, they have said. AIDSO will also request the government to consider the fact that CBSE students are likely to benefit in admissions to I PU and Engineering and other professional courses in the wake of the cancellation of their examinations.

04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Will take all steps to bring back Choksi, says MEA||India will make “all efforts” to bring back fugitive diamond trader Mehul Choksi from Dominica, where he is facing a case in a court over alleged illegal entry into the island. The response of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) came shortly before it became known that Mr. Choksi is likely to remain in custody in Dominica for a few weeks more as the next hearing is expected to be around July 1. “India remains steadfast in its efforts to ensure that fugitives are brought back to face justice. Regarding the specific case of Mehul Choksi, we understand that he is in the custody of the authorities and certain legal proceedings are under way. We will continue to make all efforts to ensure he is brought back to India,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. Accused of defrauding the Punjab National Bank and the State Bank of India of Rs. 13,500 crore, Mr. Choksi fled to Antigua and Barbuda in 2018 and took citizenship there. Meanwhile, Antigua PM Gaston Browne continued to distance his country from the fugitive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/will-take-all-steps-to-bring-back-choksi-says-mea/article34722388.ece

04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||30% PMGKAY recipients yet to get grains for May||Almost a third of all ration card holders are yet to get their free foodgrains allocation for May under the Centre’s COVID-19 relief scheme, according to the Food Ministry. At a press conference on Thursday, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey also said it was up to the States to take further action on providing rations to migrants and others without ration cards in compliance with a Supreme Court order, indicating that the Centre does not intend to revive last year’s scheme meant for these vulnerable populations. Out of the 79.25 crore beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), only 55 crore have so far received their 5 kg per person quota of free wheat or rice under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), which was announced to mitigate the economic distress caused by the pandemic. Thus, more than 30% have still not got their benefit. However, almost 90% of beneficiaries have received their regular subsidised grain for the month, raising questions over why the free grain has reached fewer beneficiaries. Food Ministry data showed that Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Odisha and Rajasthan did not even begin distribution of the May quota under PMGKAY until June 1. On Wednesday, the Centre issued an advisory to all States asking them to launch a special drive to issue ration cards to the most vulnerable sections of society, including migrant workers and street dwellers, noting that “some of the poor and needy people who do not have address proof may be finding it difficult to obtain a ration card”. However, this must be done within the existing coverage allowed for each State under the NFSA. Mr. Pandey told presspersons that there was a nationwide coverage gap of 1.97 crore beneficiaries. However, he admitted that 14 States had already reached their quota limits and would not be able to enrol any new beneficiaries. An analysis of NFSA data shows that the only major States which have significant coverage gaps are Himachal Pradesh (23%), Madhya Pradesh (14%) and Gujarat (9%). Most other large States have less than a 5% gap, which can be used to issue new ration cards. In a May 24 order, the Supreme Court had directed that migrant workers and poor people without ration cards should be provided with dry ration under the Atma Nirbhar scheme — which was implemented last year — or any other scheme found suitable by the States and Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/30-pmgkay-recipients-yet-to-get-grains-for-may/article34722304.ece
04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Submit assessment criteria: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday said it was happy that the government chose to cancel the Class XII Board exams and gave the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) two weeks to place on record the objective criteria by which they intend to assess the performance of the students. “We are happy you have decided in principle to cancel the exam… but what are the objective standards [for assessment]... That is not spelt out here in this letter,” Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, the lead judge on the Bench, asked Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal, who was appearing for the Centre. Mr. Venugopal said the process for fixing the criteria may take a “little time” and asked the court to dispose of the petition filed by an advocate, Mamta Sharma. The prayer made in the petition had been fulfilled with the cancellation of the exams. Justice Khanwilkar, however, said the petitioners would want to address the court once the government placed on record the assessment standards. “Both sides may have issues concerning the objective criteria…” “Any issue, let them file an application,” Mr. Venugopal replied. Justice Khanwilkar said the court would prefer to keep the petition pending till the objective criteria were also scrutinised. Initially, the government suggested filing the standards in four weeks, but the court insisted on two weeks. “The students have apprehensions … Many students want to go outside for further education. This requires an urgent decision. Let the persons concerned interact on a day-to-day basis,” said Justice Khanwilkar said. Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, the other judge on the Bench, also asked why the government needed even two weeks, as objective criteria for assessment had been notified last year too when the Board exams were similarly cancelled due to the pandemic. The CISCE, represented by advocate J.K. Das, urged the court to give more time, at least three weeks, to prepare the criteria for assessment. “If you want to do it [finalise the objective criteria], you can do it overnight … Everything can now be done on video conferencing … Don’t bargain for time like this … Do not force us to pass directions. Do it on your own,” Justice Khanwilkar told Mr. Das. Ms. Sharma also raised the case of exams of Class XII students under the State Boards. She said the decision on the exams should be “uniform” across all Boards. “Let the CBSE/ICSE problem get over … You had only asked for CBSE/ICSE Class XII exams … Now do not ask for the heavens,” said Justice Khanwilkar. The court adjourned the case by two weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/submit-assessment-criteria-sc/article34722319.ece
04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre orders 30 crore doses from Biological E||The Union Health Ministry has finalised arrangements with Hyderabad-based vaccine manufacturer Biological E to reserve 30 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses. In a statement issued on Thursday, the Ministry said these doses would be manufactured and stockpiled by the company from August to December. For this purpose, it would make an advance payment of Rs. 1,500 crore. The RBD protein sub-unit vaccine, now undergoing Phase-3 clinical trial, is likely to be available in a few months. “The proposal of M/s Biological E was examined and recommended for approval after due diligence by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC),” the Ministry said. The arrangement with the company was a part of the wider endeavour of the government to encourage indigenous vaccine makers by providing them support in research and development and financial aid. The vaccine candidate has been supported by the government from the preclinical stage to the Phase-3 studies. The Department of Biotechnology has provided grant-in-aid of over Rs. 100 crore and partnered with the firm to conduct all animal and assay studies through the research institute, Translational Health Science Technology Institute in Faridabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-orders-30-crore-doses-from-biological-e/article34722338.ece
04 June 2021||New Delhi,||WhatsApp is indulging in anti-user practices: govt.||The Centre has informed the Delhi High Court that WhatsApp, the instant messaging app, was indulging in “anti-users practices” by obtaining “trick consent” from the users for its updated privacy policy. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, in an affidavit filed before the court, stated that WhatsApp was “bombarding” million of its existing users who have not accepted the updated 2021 privacy policy, with notifications on a daily basis. ‘Give a direction’ The Ministry has urged the court to give a direction to WhatsApp to “desist from any action of ‘pushing notifications’ to existing users related to updated 2021 privacy policy”. “The current notifications as being pushed by the Respondent No. 2 [WhatsApp] on its users whether existing or new is against the very grain of prima facie opinion of the Competition Commission of India’s [CCI] order of March 24, 2021,” the Ministry said. The CCI had called for an investigation into WhatsApp’s new privacy policy. “Having considered the overarching terms and conditions of the new policy, the Commission is of prima facie opinion that the ‘take-it-or leave-it’ nature of privacy policy and terms of service of WhatsApp and the information sharing stipulations mentioned therein, merit a detailed investigation in view of the market position and market power enjoyed by WhatsApp,” the competition watchdog had said. The Ministry’s affidavit was in response to a petition filed by Seema Singh challenging WhatsApp’s new privacy policy, which provided for sharing information with third party service providers and other Facebook companies. Similar petitions The Facebook-owned entity was also facing similar petitions in different courts across India against its new privacy policy. WhatsApp had earlier said its new privacy policy came into effect from May 15, but also clarified that it would not start deleting accounts of those users who had not accepted it and would try to encourage them to get on board. Earlier, the Ministry had also stated that that new privacy policy was not in tune with the IT (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, 2011.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/whatsapp-is-indulging-in-anti-user-practices-govt/article34722308.ece
04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP treads with caution in U.P.||BJP general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santhosh’s visit to Lucknow over the last couple of days was a stocktaking exercise by the party in the State where the Assembly election will be held next year. While his meetings with party leaders and Ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government set off speculation about large-scale changes, the word from the central leadership is that for now, it will be more or less status quo. The government has been buffeted by allegations of mishandling of the second wave of COVID-19. Four BJP MLAs and at least one Union Minister (Santosh Gangwar) have written to the Chief Minister on the “unsatisfactory” handling of the second wave. On Wednesday, however, as he wound up his meetings, Mr. Santhosh expressed satisfaction over the government’s work. “In five weeks, @myogiadityanath’s Uttar Pradesh reduced the new daily case count by 93%. Remember it’s a state with 20+ crore population. When municipality CMs (chief ministers) could not manage a city of 1.5 crore population, Yogiji managed quite effectively,” he said on Twitter. He also lauded the government’s decision to prioritise vaccination for those with children below the age of 12. No large-scale rejig Central leaders also confirmed to The Hindu that no large-scale rejig is to be expected at this point, with elections just a few months away. “As far as Cabinet expansion goes, that will be as per the wishes of the Chief Minister with some inputs by us,” said a source. This show of confidence, however, say party leaders, should not be mistaken for complacency with regard to the devastation caused by COVID-19, as also the erosion of political support on the ground. A top leader said the party’s on-ground absence in the midst of the second wave had cost it dearly and the only way out to recoup any of that was to work harder on visibility on the ground. “The second wave came as a tidal wave, and governments, along with people, were scrambling to deal with it. Currently, emotions are high. Iss vatavaran main samvaad nahin ho sakta, log chidchida jayenge [we cannot open a dialogue with people in this environment, people will only get more upset with us]. Instead of explaining what happened, we must do our utmost to provide support,” said the leader as the BJP announced its “Seva hi Sangathan” programme. The party has been asked to assist the government’s efforts to maximise vaccination, especially in rural areas, where both vaccine hesitancy and resources are major problems. However, how all this will square up with already triumphal announcements that the second wave has more or less abated in the State is yet to be seen. Mr. Santhosh, along with the national ‘prabhari’ for U.P., Radha Mohan Singh, asked the State unit to “stay united”. Several Ministers, who also met the two men from Delhi, said the government relied more on bureaucrats than political and Cabinet colleagues, leading to over-centralisation of COVID-19 management and a tone-deafness in the administration’s response. Mr. Santhosh raised this issue with Mr. Adityanath when the two met. There have been assurances of accommodation on both sides. While the resentment among the people over the handling of COVID-19 is a new issue, the cleavages in the State unit in terms of factionalism are old. That, and a vocal section of Brahmin leadership speaking up against what is perceived as a “Thakur”-oriented bias by Mr. Adityanath, are questions that haven’t been addressed by this visit. The State election is being seen by many as a semi-final to the 2024 general election and Mr. Santhosh’s visit and his utterances lauding the government show that the strategy remains to make haste, but slowly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-treads-with-caution-in-up/article34722323.ece
04 June 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra to lift curbs cautiously||The Maharashtra government on Thursday said that it has finalised a plan to unlock the State by dividing its districts into five levels based on the coronavirus test positivity rate (TPR) and occupancy of oxygen beds. The local administration will be submitting reports based on this to the State headquarters, following which directions on lifting restrictions and unlocking will be announced. The announcement comes amid confusion after the State’s Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Vijay Vadettiwar held a press conference declaring 18 districts with a test positivity rate of less than 5% and oxygen bed occupancy of less than 25% to undergo a complete unlock. The Chief Minister’s Office, however, intervened and issued a clarification saying no restrictions had been lifted. “The proposal for the same is being considered. We will be taking complete information from the district headquarters and local administrations. Only based on that final decision will be taken,” said the clarification. Mr. Vadettiwar, who had left Mumbai for Nagpur after his press conference, said after reaching his destination that he had forgotten to mention there had been an “in principle approval” to the proposal and the Chief Minister would take the final decision. As per the proposal, Level 5 regions were in the red zone. Level 1 includes areas with less than 5% positivity rate and less than 25% oxygen bed occupancy and Level 2 can have TPR below 5% and oxygen bed occupancy from 25-40%. For Level 3, the TPR could be from 5-10% and oxygen bed occupancy 40-60%. The TPR could be between 10-20% for Level 4 with, oxygen bed occupancy at 60-75%. Level 5 will be the areas that have TPR over 20% and oxygen bed occupancy over 75%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-to-lift-curbs-cautiously/article34722335.ece
04 June 2021||Chennai,||Strong policies on black carbon can sharply cut glacier melt: World Bank study||Black carbon (BC) deposits produced by human activity which accelerate the pace of glacier and snow melt in the Himalayan region can be sharply reduced through new, currently feasible policies by an additional 50% from current levels, a study by World Bank (WB) specialists has said. The research covers the Himalaya, Karakoram and Hindu Kush (HKHK) mountain ranges, where, the report says, glaciers are melting faster than the global average ice mass. The rate of retreat of HKHK glaciers is estimated to be 0.3 metres per year in the west to 1.0 metre per year in the east. BC adds to the impact of climate change. Full implementation of current policies to mitigate BC can achieve a 23% reduction but enacting new policies and incorporating them through regional cooperation among countries can achieve enhanced benefits, the WB said in the report titled “Glaciers of the Himalayas, Climate Change, Black Carbon and Regional Resilience” released on Thursday. “BC is a short-lived pollutant that is the second-largest contributor to warming the planet behind carbon dioxide (CO2). Unlike other greenhouse gas emissions, BC is quickly washed out and can be eliminated from the atmosphere if emissions stop,” the publication says. Unlike historical carbon emissions, it is also a localised source with greater local impact. Some of the ongoing policy measures to cut BC emissions are enhancing fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, phasing out diesel vehicles and promoting electric vehicles, accelerating the use of liquefied petroleum gas for cooking and through clean cookstove programmes, as well as upgrading brick kiln technologies, says the publication, edited by Muthukumara Mani, lead economist, South Asia Region, World Bank. However, with all existing measures, water from glacier melt is still projected to increase in absolute volume by 2040, with impacts on downstream activities and communities. At a virtual panel discussion on the release of the report, Hartwig Schafer, vice-president, South Asia Region, World Bank Group, said regional integration and collaboration was one way to address the question of melting glaciers. Glacier melt produces flash floods, landslips, soil erosion, and glacial lake outburst floods.  Air temperature Deposits of BC act in two ways hastening the pace of glacier melt: by decreasing surface reflectance of sunlight and by raising air temperature, the researchers point out. “Specifically, in the Himalayas, reducing black carbon emissions from cookstoves, diesel engines, and open burning would have the greatest impact and could significantly reduce radiative forcing and help to maintain a greater portion of Himalayan glacier systems. More detailed modelling at a higher spatial resolution is needed to expand on the work already completed,” says the study, calling upon regional governments to review policies on water management, with an emphasis on basin-based regulation and use of price signals for efficiency, careful planning and use of hydropower to reflect changes in water flows and availability, and increasing the efficiency of brick kilns through proven technologies. There must also be greater knowledge sharing in the region. The WB publication says “Industry [primarily brick kilns] and residential burning of solid fuel together account for 45–66% of regional anthropogenic [man-made] BC deposition, followed by on-road diesel fuels (7–18%) and open burning (less than 3% in all seasons)” in the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/strong-policies-on-black-carbon-can-sharply-cut-glacier-melt-world-bank-study/article34722340.ece

The country has so far reported a total of 2,85,67,607 cases and 3,40,613 deaths. Tamil Nadu reported 24,405 new infections, followed by Kerala (18,853) and Karnataka (18,324). Maharashtra recorded 643 new casualties on the day, followed by Karnataka (514) and Tamil Nadu (460). Maharashtra’s fatalities include backlog deaths which were missed in the previous reports. The figures do not include cases and deaths from Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh. The data are sourced from the respective States’ health bulletins. 21.59 lakh tests Around 21.59 lakh samples were tested in the country on Wednesday (the results for which were made available on Thursday). India’s average daily test positivity rate (positive cases identified for every 100 tests) continues to decline. It was 6.4% on June 2 compared to 10.9% recorded a week before. About 24.97 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the country in the 24 hours ending 7 a.m. on Thursday, which is 3,000 doses fewer than what was recorded in the previous 24 hours. Also, it is 5 lakh lesser doses than what was recorded during the same period a week ago. The seven-day rolling average of daily vaccinations in the country stood at 26.21 lakh on June 2, which is more than the 21.83 lakh recorded on May 2. While the seven-day rolling average of daily recorded COVID-19 cases in India continues to decrease, it is still registering the highest number of new cases in the world. Brazil (63,626) and Argentina (32,860) follow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/126-lakh-fresh-cases-and-2599-deaths-registered/article34722342.ece
04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘CBSE cannot deny students name change on certificates’||The Supreme Court on Thursday found a Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) rule that prohibited students from changing or correcting their names on Board certificates, based on a presumption that it would affect “administrative efficiency”, far-removed from social realities and even “absurd”. The court said the CBSE’s examination bylaws of 2007 made it look as if the Board was more concerned about administrative paperwork than the future prospects of its students, who use their certificates as a public document to go for higher studies and gain employment. “Students stand to lose more due to inaccuracies in their certificates than the Board, whose sole worry is increasing administrative burden… Administrative efficiency cannot be the sole concern of CBSE. Every institution desires efficiency in their functioning. But it does not mean that efficiency is achieved by curbing their basic functions… One of the primary functions of CBSE is to grant certificates to its students,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar observed in a 132-page judgment. Right to be forgotten On the other hand, the court illustrated how a juvenile accused of being in conflict with the law or a sexual abuse victim whose identity is compromised due to lapses by the media or the investigative body may consider changing the name to seek rehabilitation in the society in exercise of their right to be forgotten. “If the Board, in such a case, refuses to change the name, the student would be compelled to live with the scars of the past,” Justice Khanwilkar highlighted. The court ordered the CBSE to take “immediate steps” to amend the by-laws and incorporate a mechanism outlined in the judgment “for recording correction or change, as the case may be, in the certificates already issued or to be issued by it”. The court said one’s name is an intrinsic element of identity. The right to change our name is part of the right to freedom of speech and expression.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbse-cannot-deny-students-name-change-on-certificates/article34722299.ece

04 June 2021||New Delhi,||Opposition parties likely to meet soon to evolve strategy||With the friction between some States and the Centre on the rise, the Opposition parties are likely to hold a joint meeting soon to chalk out a strategy. The last such meeting was in May 2020, when 22 parties met virtually, 50 days into the lockdown. Talks are on but so far no date has been picked. In the last few days, four Chief Ministers — Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan, Jharkhand’s Hemant Soren, Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik and Andhra Pradesh’s Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy — have demanded rationalisation of the vaccine policy, calling for centralisation of the procurement and universally free vaccines. Mr. Reddy on Thursday wrote to all his counterparts saying the situation has transformed into “Centre vs State”. “It is my request that as Chief Ministers, we speak in a single voice and urge the government of India to take charge and responsibility of the vaccination drive, the way it was happening in the early part of the year,” he wrote. The Supreme Court’s observations on Wednesday, calling the Centre’s paid COVID-19 vaccination policy for the 18-44 age group “arbitrary” and “irrational”, has added ammunition to the Opposition efforts to corner the Union government. On a separate front, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is engaged in a head-on confrontation with the Centre over its decision to attach former State Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay. In a four-page letter to the Prime Minister, she wrote: “I sincerely hope that you do not want to damage the federal amity.” Her office made it a point to send a copy of the letter to all the Opposition leaders. Congress Chief Ministers of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, Ashok Gehlot and Bhupesh Baghel respectively, are protesting against the non-inclusion of the Congress-ruled States in the eight-member Group of Ministers (GoM) to discuss the GST waiver on materials to fight the pandemic. A senior Opposition leader said, “There are enough issues that need a joint deliberation and action. Senior leaders from all sides are in constant touch. For now, we are waiting for the report of the GoM on GST. We will take a call on when to meet once the report is submitted.” Though both Mr. Patnaik and Mr. Reddy have questioned the Centre’s vaccination policy, it remains to be seen if they will join hands with the rest of the Opposition. Both of them have maintained distance from the Opposition and have often found themselves on the same side as the ruling BJP. It’s also a moot question whether Telangana and Delhi Chief Minister, K. Chandrashekar Rao and Arvind Kejriwal, will join such an effort. Sources said some efforts have been made to reach out to them, but so far, there has been no clear response from them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/opposition-parties-likely-to-meet-soon-to-evolve-strategy/article34722327.ece
04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM Modi interacts with Class XII students||In a surprise interaction with Class XII students and their parents on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the children to utilise their time in a productive and creative manner following the cancellation of their exams, and said they should never feel stressed about any examination. Joining the online interaction organised by the Education Ministry, Mr. Modi asked them how they felt following the cancellation of the Board exams in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and what they were planning to do now. The Prime Minister asked the students whether they would watch IPL, Champion’s League, or wait for the Olympics. He said they should always remember the mantra “health is wealth” and asked them what they did to remain physically fit. Several students told Mr. Modi that the announcement about the cancellation brought them relief and ended a long spell of uncertainty. Mr. Modi told them that the decision to cancel exams was taken in their interest. Some parents said students could now focus on their college admissions. The government decided on Tuesday to cancel the CBSE Class 12 Board exams amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Mr. Modi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-modi-interacts-with-class-xii-students/article34722317.ece

04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||ED arrests RJD MP in fertilizer import scam||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has arrested Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Amarendra Dhari Singh in connection with the money laundering investigation in the fertilizer import scam involving the managing director of Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd. (IFFCO) and others, a senior agency official said on Thursday. “Mr. Singh is a Rajya Sabha MP from the RJD. He has been arrested in the fertilizer scam case,” said the official. The ED is conducting the probe on the basis of a First Information Report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against IFFCO managing director U.S. Awasthi, Pravinder Singh Gahlaut, then managing director of Indian Potash Ltd. (IPL) and others, including Mr. Singh as the senior vice-president of Jyoti Trading Corporation (Dubai). Mr. Awasthi’s sons Amol and Anupam; Mr. Gahlaut’s son Vivek; Pankaj Jain of Dubai-based Jyoti Group of Companies and Rare Earth Group; and his brother Sanjay Jain, president of Jyoti Trading Corporation, have also been named, along with Rajiv Saxena, who is also under investigation in the AgustaWestland case. Highly inflated rates The scam involves the import of fertilizers and raw materials running into thousands of tonnes by IFFCO and IPL from various foreign suppliers at highly inflated rates. The Central government gives subsidy on fertilizers for supply to farmers at reasonable rates. It is alleged that the quoted rates included the commissions to be paid to Mr. Awasthi and Mr. Gahlaut. The CBI, in its case, alleged that about Rs. 685 crore of illegal commissions were received through the bank accounts of firms belonging to Mr. Saxena and some others. While Rs. 481 crore of the total amount was routed via Dubai-based Rare Earth Group, the remaining went to the Awasthi brothers and Mr. Vivek.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-arrests-rjd-mp-in-fertilizer-import-scam/article34722293.ece
04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. advised the split in MGNREGA wage benefit||The decision to split the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) wage payments by caste categories was done on the advice of the Union Finance Ministry in order to assess and highlight the benefits flowing from budgetary outlay towards Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), Rural Development Secretary N.N. Sinha told The Hindu on Thursday. He said this should not cause any delay in wage payments or any changes for beneficiaries if processes were put in place correctly, and added that there was no plan to focus MGNREGA only on districts with high SC and ST populations.  Separate categories On Wednesday, The Hindu had reported on a March 2 advisory of the Rural Development Ministry, which directed States to divide wage payments into separate categories for SCs, STs and others from this financial year. Workers’ advocates feared this move would cause unnecessary delays and complications in the payment system, and worried that it could lead to a reduction in scheme funding. “The rationale was very simple. It is not as if the payments made to SC and ST are not reported on the NREGA website, but overall, in terms of the budgetary outlay, people don’t have that intricate information about how much benefit is flowing from the Budget to the SC and ST [communities],” said Mr. Sinha. “When people take an assessment merely on the Budget head under which the programme is budgeted, then they miss out this intricate nuance. So, the Finance Ministry advised that we should make Budget provisions under SC and ST components as well,” he said, adding that the measure was to a large extent aimed at highlighting what the Centre was doing for the SC and ST communities. The Secretary said there was no need to worry about the changes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-advised-the-split-in-mgnrega-wage-benefit/article34722306.ece

The response of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) came shortly before it became known that Mr. Choksi is likely to remain in custody in Dominica for a few weeks more as the next hearing is expected to be around July 1. “India remains steadfast in its efforts to ensure that fugitives are brought back to face justice.

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Journalists need cover against sedition charges’||The court acknowledged the submission made by Mr. Dua, who is currently recovering from COVID-19, that “there is a recent trend against the media where State governments who do not find a particular telecast to be in sync with their political ideologies register FIRs against persons of the media primarily to harass them and to intimidate them so that they succumb to the line of the State or else face the music at the hands of the police”. However, the court rejected Mr. Dua’s plea that FIRs should not be registered against journalists of 10 years’ experience unless cleared by a committee constituted by the State government concerned. Mr. Dua had said the committee should comprise the Chief Justice of the High Court or a judge designated by him, the Leader of the Opposition and the Home Minister of the State. The court said such a committee was outside the present statutory framework. By granting the prayer, it would be encroaching into the legislature’s domain. The judgment came as a blow to the government, which had even raised the question whether journalism itself could legally be termed a profession. The complaint against Mr. Dua was filed by a BJP leader. The senior journalist was accused of spreading fake news. Besides sedition, other charges include causing public nuisance, printing of defamatory matter and making statements conducive to public mischief.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/journalists-need-cover-against-sedition-charges/article34722312.ece

04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Norms for employing retired officials defined||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has laid down a defined procedure to be followed by government organisations for getting vigilance clearance before employing a retired official on a contractual or consultancy basis. In a letter to the Secretaries of all the Union Ministries and departments, chief executives and chief vigilance officers of public sector undertakings, the CVC said the absence of a uniform procedure sometimes led to a situation where officials with tainted past or cases pending against them were engaged.  According to the procedure, before offering employment to retired All India Services and Group A officers of the Central government or their equivalent in other organisations owned or controlled by the Centre, vigilance clearance from the employer organisation, from which the officer has retired, should be obtained. In case a retired officer served in more than one organisation, clearance has to be obtained from all of them where the person was posted in the 10 years prior to retirement. Simultaneously, a communication seeking clearance should also be sent to the CVC. If no reply is received from the erstwhile employer (s) within 15 days of sending the communication by speed post, a reminder can be sent. If there is no response within 21 days, vigilance clearance should be deemed to have been given. Later, if the employee is found involved in any vigilance-related matter or not cleared from the vigilance point of view, the erstwhile employer organisation would be responsible for all consequential actions.  Cooling-off period In the case of retired officials taking up full-time or contractual assignments in the private sector, the Commission said often, the “cooling off” period was not observed and the act constituted serious misconduct. It directed all government organisations to formulate rules to ensure the cooling-off period was observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/norms-for-employing-retired-officials-defined/article34722320.ece
04 June 2021||CHANDIGARH/NEW DELHI,||Amarinder adds three AAP leaders to his camp||In a sign of factionalism within the Punjab Congress intensifying, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, before leaving for Delhi on Thursday, made two rebel Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs, along with the former Leader of the Opposition Sukhpal Khaira, join the Congress. The move — right in the middle of an exercise to quell dissidence in Punjab and ahead of the Chief Minister’s meeting with a three-member panel of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) — is being seen as assertion of authority by Captain Singh. His detractors have been pressing for a leadership change ahead of next year’s Assembly election. While former Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had met the AICC panel on Tuesday, former heads of Punjab Congress, Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo, are among those seeking a leadership change.   Amid the power tussle, Captain Singh roped in AAP rebel MLAs Jagdev Singh Kamalu and Pirmal Singh Dhaula to his camp.  “By inducting Mr. Khaira without waiting for the AICC nod, Captain Singh has signalled the high command. If they are thinking of a change of guard, they will also have to weigh in the possibility of a split,” said a loyalist of the Chief Minister. But the party played down the reports of factionalism. “The ongoing Punjab discussion is not a crisis management exercise but an election preparation exercise where suggestions are being taken to ensure the Congress’ victory in 2022 and youth workers should get maximum opportunity,” said AICC spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill after the panel meet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amarinder-adds-three-aap-leaders-to-his-camp/article34722325.ece

The yoga exponent has been asked to give his response within three weeks. Justice C. Hari Shankar was of the view that the statements made by Mr. Ramdev was his “opinion”, which falls under the right to freedom of expression under the Constitution. “I don’t think your allopathic profession is so fragile... I think it comes within Article 19(1)(a),” he said. The court’s remarks came while hearing a suit filed by the Delhi Medical Association (DMA) against Mr. Ramdev’s statement. It said, “There are institutions in place to check the false medical claims or magical remedies. There is a protocol in place. So you cannot say here is matter for the court to interfere. First of all I, or this court, is no one to say whether Coronil is a good or bad medicine. Whether allopathic treatment or ayurvedic treatment is better, I don’t know. These are matters which needs experts”. Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, for Mr. Ramdev, has raised objection on the maintainability of the plea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-high-court-issues-summons-to-ramdev/article34722333.ece

The Adar Poonawalla-led SII, which manufactures Covishield (Indian name for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab), had conveyed to the Centre that all vaccine makers, whether Indian or foreign, ought to be granted the same protection (against the cost of compensation in the event of severe side-effects), the company sources said. Besides Covishield and Novovax’s Covovax, the SII has also applied to the Drug Controller General of India to manufacture Sputnik V. Sputnik V is currently being manufactured by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. According to reports, the Centre is considering granting indemnity to vaccine manufacturing companies if they applied for the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA). Till date, no Indian vaccine company has ever paid indemnity and neither has the Union government, the biggest vaccine user, done so.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/serum-institute-too-seeks-indemnity-from-liability/article34722343.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Unchanging One||Kooratazhvan, in his Varadaraja Stavam, extols Lord Varadaraja’s qualities using words that remind us of Upanishadic descriptions. This is to show that Varadaraja is the Supreme One, said Valayapet Ramachariar in a discourse. One of the words he uses is niraabaadham. This means He is changeless. Non-sentient (acetana) things change by appearance and by character. When milk changes to curd, the taste and thickness change. What about cetana (sentient beings)? The atma may take different births. But it does not change in size. It may be born as a human being in one janma and as an elephant in another. It does not increase in size to match the size of the elephant. If born as a human being, the atma has dharmabhutajnana (attributive consciousness), and is able to talk, to sing, to write etc. If it is born as an animal, it cannot do these things. So, while its appearance or size does not change, there is a change in the degree of jnana it has. But the appearance or qualities of the Supreme One never change. For every action, three karanas are needed — upadana, sahakari and nimitta. The mud used to make a pot is upadana karana. The potter’s wheel etc become the sahakari karana. The potter is the nimitta karana. To get a pot you need all three. As for the Universe, the Lord is the upadana karana (the One from whom it came) and the nimitta karana (the One who made it). But in the case of the mud pot, the upadana karana, namely the mud, changes form to become a pot. How then can we say the Lord is upadana karana, and also claim He is changeless? One may wear a blue shirt in the morning and a different shirt in the evening. Does this mean the person changes? He remains the same. Likewise, Paramatma’s svarupa never changes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/unchanging-one/article34722330.ece

Recently, Mr. Roy’s son and former MLA Subhrangshu Roy said that instead of criticising a government elected by people, the BJP should reflect on introspection.

04 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Doctors see a deadly mix in second wave||In the second wave of the pandemic, COVID-19 pneumonia with respiratory failure was one of the main causes of death. As doctors witnessed a steep increase in the number of patients hospitalised in the second wave, they were taken aback by rapid disease progression and pneumonia, including in the young, unlike in the first wave. The State has been reporting over 400 deaths a day since May 21. So far, 25,665 people have succumbed to the infection, registering a case fatality rate of 1.18%. According to senior doctors, COVID-19 pneumonia with respiratory failure was one of the main causes of death. ‘Rapid progression’ “There is rapid disease progression in some patients. In the first wave, people who came in with mild lung involvement or patches in the lungs recovered with supportive line of treatment. However, even a 30%-40% lung involvement affected a patient badly in this wave,” said E. Theranirajan, Dean of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). The number of people affected was huge in the second wave, said R. Ebenezer, senior consultant and head, critical care services, Apollo Speciality Hospitals, Vanagaram. “So we had many sick patients coming in a short span of time. There was rapid transmission and people were falling sick fast. The healthcare services were overwhelmed,” he said. Comparing the first and second waves, he said cases were predominantly rampant among the elderly population with co-morbidities in the first wave. They were at high risk and bore the brunt of high mortality. “The situation is completely different in the second wave. We are seeing a huge population in the 30-40 age group getting affected, and a lot of deaths in that group. We rarely saw deaths in those aged less than 40 in the first wave. We rarely saw COVID-19 pneumonia in the young in the first wave. This took us by surprise in the second wave as young persons with no comorbidites and supposedly strong immunity were affected,” he said. “There is no doubt that the virus has mutated,” Dr. Ebenezer said. “As a result, it has become more virulent, and is affecting younger people. The majority of the deaths are due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia with respiratory failure, termed adult respiratory distress syndrome.” ‘Too late for some’ Dr. Theranirajan added that many did not seek medical help in time. “Many came to the hospital on the third to fifth day, and this was too late for some patients. Most of them who came earlier recovered well with treatment.” At the RGGGH, which conducts a daily audit of COVID-19 deaths, doctors also noticed that many younger persons with central obesity — abdominal obesity — were affected. “There was rapid progression of pneumonia, probably due to virus mutations. In people with central obesity, the lung space is occupied, reducing the vital capacity of the lungs. As a result, such patients who came in late faced the risk of developing respiratory failure, and death. Those who came in time recovered,” Dr. Theranirajan said. R. Jayanthi, Dean of the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, said that in the first wave, 80% of the patients were asymptomatic and 20% symptomatic. “It was the other way round in the second wave. Hypoxia, fast-spreading infections and families getting affected characterised the second wave. The number of people requiring hospitalisation and oxygen support was high,” she said. There was very gross involvement of the lungs, and “people turned hypoxic in no time,” she said. As a way ahead, doctors stressed the need to ramp up vaccination to prevent a third wave.  We are seeing a huge population in the 30-40 age group getting affected, and a lot of deaths in that group. We rarely saw deaths in those aged less than 40 in the first wave R.

04 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Hospital forms task force to tackle cases of mucormycosis||Gleneagles Global Health City (GGHC) has formed a 27-member mucormycosis task force to treat COVID-19 patients with the condition. The team comprises eye surgeons, ENT specialists, plastic surgeons, neurosurgeons, infectious disease experts, internal medicine consultants, diabetologists, radiologists, pathologists and dental maxillo facial surgeons. Director of Infections Diseases and Infection Control Subramanian Swaminathan said the hospital had experience handling such instances, and this had better prepared them for the current scenario. Ashwin Karuppan V., consultant in the Department of Internal Medicine and Diabetology, said with the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of cases of mucormycosis had increased, demanding timely attention of a multi-disciplinary team. Senior consultant of Histopathology Mouleeswaran said the infection had been noticed earlier in patients who had undergone organ transplant, besides those with uncontrolled diabetes and immuno-compromised patients. “We give reports within a few minutes and the final report within a day to assist physicians, surgeons and infectious disease specialists,” he said. Chief executive officer of the hospital Alok Khullar said, “Since the number of patients infected is increasing day-by-day, we are trying to ensure that we have a protocol to provide world-class treatment and excellent clinical outcomes.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hospital-forms-task-force-to-tackle-cases-of-mucormycosis/article34722830.ece
04 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Class 12 evaluation criteria might be similar to that of Class 10||Following the cancellation of the Class 12 exams for CBSE students, schools now expect that the evaluation criteria, which will be announced in two weeks, might be similar to the framework announced for the class 10 results earlier this year. The evaluation criteria for the Class 10 results took into account marks in the tests and exams conducted throughout the academic year as well as 20 marks weightage for internal assessments. The results also had to be in consonance with the school’s performance in the Class 10 board exams during the last few years. Private CBSE schools began online classes at the start of 2020-21 and through the year, conducted assessments online for Class 12 students. “Whatever exams we used to conduct during a regular school term, we conducted online. We were able to physically administer revision exams when students came back to the campus in January,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, principal, Bala Vidya Mandir. While schools had been given the flexibility to conduct practical exams any time till the end of the board exam schedule, CBSE schools in Tamil Nadu scheduled and completed the practical exams in March and April. Ashok Shankar, general secretary, CBSE Schools Management Association, said most schools also conducted multiple rounds of revision exams and pre-board exams. “The onus will now lie on the schools to comply with the criteria that the CBSE comes up with. With regard to ensuring transparency, the CBSE can recommend that its officials will carry out audits of this process at random, in schools across the State,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/class-12-evaluation-criteria-might-be-similar-to-that-of-class-10/article34722847.ece
04 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||All prisons in T.N. have been decongested, govt tells HC||The Tamil Nadu Prison department on Thursday informed the Madras High Court that prisons across the State had been decongested in view of COVID-19 and that the occupancy rate was only 58.72% as on June 1. The court was told that though the total authorised accommodation in all prisons put together was 23,592 inmates, the present overall occupancy was only 13,854. Appearing before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram said thousands of prisoners had been released on bail since March 23, 2020. The A-G also submitted a report filed by Director General of Prisons Sunil Kumar Singh listing out the steps to protect prisoners from the pandemic. The report was filed in response to a suo motu public interest litigation petition that the court had taken up in 2017 with respect to prison reforms. Senior counsel R. Vaigai, who had been appointed as amicus curiae in the case, impressed upon the need to vaccinate prisoners and prison staff on priority basis. Accepting her plea, the judges, in their interim order, wrote: “The State is requested to ensure that the inmates at the correctional homes and the staff are considered frontline personnel and administered vaccine on priority basis.” Observing that the second wave of the pandemic appeared to be subsiding now, the judges impressed upon the need to decongest prisons in future if there was a surge of COVID-19 positive cases. In his report, Mr. Singh said all prisoners and prison staff were being screened for symptoms of COVID-19 regularly and referred to the district headquarters hospital if they test positive. Sufficient number of soaps and sanitisers had also been provided in the prisons and physical distancing norms were also followed. Utmost care was being provided to the elderly prisoners with co-morbidities, he added. So far, one convict, one remand prisoner and 12 prison staff had died due to COVID-19. The government had sanctioned disaster relief fund of Rs. 1.15 crore to purchase sanitisers, disinfectants and other essential materials, the DGP said. “The prisoners are provided with egg, milk, lemon juice and channa to improve their immune system. Further, kabasura kudineer and nilavembu powder are purchased and stocked sufficiently in prisons. The kasayams are prepared in prisons and given to prisoners. Prison interviews had been suspended and prisoners are instead allowed to make video calls to their family members. “Totally 58 android mobile phones have been purchased and provided to prisons for this purpose. So far 1,295 prisoners have been given first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 38 prisoners had taken the second dose too. The Director, Public Health and Preventive Medicine has been requested to vaccinate all the prisoners,” the report filed by Mr. Singh read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-prisons-in-tn-have-been-decongested-govt-tells-hc/article34722867.ece
04 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Separate farm budget likely this year||The new DMK government under M.K. Stalin is exploring the possibility of a separate budget for the agriculture sector, in line with one of the promises in its election manifesto. According to sources in the government, the proposal is at a discussion stage. It is not yet decided whether it should be on the lines of the Railway Budget (since discontinued) or who will present it in the Assembly or whether it will be a sub-budget, officials told The Hindu . It is also not clear whether the decision would be announced in the Governor’s address to the Assembly. Instructions have been issued to all departments to explore and chalk out ways to implement the promises made in the DMK’s election manifesto. The DMK manifesto had said: “To increase agricultural productivity and output and to protect farmers’ welfare and well-being, the government will introduce an annual budget for agriculture after consulting farmers’ associations and other organisations.” Focus on farm sector Many farmers associations across the country and a few political parties had been demanding a separate budget for agriculture. “A separate budget would mean that the government is keen on focusing on agriculture. A separate session in the House would help legislators discuss for a few days about how funds are spent on this sector,” an official said. Another official said it would not mean much to the exchequer. “The Finance Department would have to approve all the figures. At the most, the Agriculture Department will get to decide how it could spend the funds allocated to it for various schemes. Also, it would be an expenditure budget since there would not be much revenue generated from the sector.” A source said the government may club irrigation and related sectors with the agriculture sector so that the budget could cover all aspects of agriculture. As per the interim budget for 2021-2022 presented earlier this year, farmers and agricultural labourers form nearly 50% of the population in Tamil Nadu. The total allocation for the agriculture sector in the revised estimates of 2020-21 was Rs. 11,109.48 crore and in the interim budget estimates for 2021-22, a provision of Rs. 11,982.71 crore was made for this sector. There are about 79.38 lakh operational land holdings across Tamil Nadu, of which 92.51% belong to small (2 ha) and marginal (1 ha) farmers. They operate about 62% of the total cultivable land, according to the Agriculture Department's policy note for 2020-21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/separate-farm-budget-likely-this-year/article34722834.ece
04 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||GCC to loan pulse oximeters to those in home quarantine||In a bid to strengthen the monitoring of COVID-19 patients under home quarantine, the Greater Chennai Corporation has launched an initiative to loan pulse oximeters to a section of them for measuring oxygen saturation at regular intervals. According to officials, the initiative would target those aged 50 or above or with comorbidities as they were the most vulnerable. The focus will be specifically on those from low income groups, who may not have the device and cannot afford to buy one. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said, “We have observed that those from relatively higher income groups generally have a pulse oximeter or buy one as soon as they test positive. It is not the same with people from low income groups as they cannot afford it.” Highlighting that the Corporation was receiving a lot of support from many organisations through corporate social responsibility initiatives, he said the civic body had asked some of them to buy pulse oximeters in large numbers. “Almost all our fever survey workers have pulse oximeters now. We have now decided to loan the surplus devices we have to those who need it but cannot afford one,” he said. He said the devices would be loaned for 10 days and would be collected back after proper sanitation. As of Thursday, the city had 28,186 active cases, of which roughly 70% are in home quarantine. As per the present COVID-19 management protocol, once a person tests positive, a field-triaging team will visit the house to assess their symptoms and measure oxygen saturation level. If further tests or admission to a COVID-19 Care Centre or hospital was required, the person will be taken there. Otherwise, the person will remain in home quarantine. From then on, the tele-counseling centres of the Corporation will take charge of periodic monitoring of the patient’s health over the phone by calling at least once a day. “As many may not have pulse oximeters, those at call centres will ask for symptoms like breathing difficulties, cough etc., to assess the severity and decide whether the patient needed institutional care,” said Deputy Corporation Commissioner (Health) Alby John Varghese. He said equipping those in home quarantine as much as possible with pulse oximetres would enhance the surveillance and shorten the delay between worsening of symptoms and admission to institutional care. “While lending it to the patients, our workers will also teach them how to use it,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-corporation-to-loan-pulse-oximeters-to-those-in-home-quarantine/article34722849.ece
04 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Social media has made it difficult to maintain credibility’||Social media has made it extremely difficult for institutional and individual identities to remain credible now as statements can be rapidly decontextualised. It is important for journalists to exercise caution at every instance to maintain credibility, political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta said at the virtual convocation of the Asian College of Journalism (ACJ)’s class of 2020-21 here on Thursday. Delivering the Lawrence Dana Pinkham lecture on ‘Who is interested in truth — Reflections on our times’, Mr. Mehta said social media had blurred professional and personal boundaries and it is harder to establish credibility now. Aspiring journalists must also examine ownerships and structures that distort production of truth. Noting that India was passing through an unprecedented phase, he said resistance to truth not only comes from authoritarian regimes but sometimes from democratic times also. The idea that private media would produce free media in pursuit of truth has turned out to be an illusion now and journalists’ lives are at stake. Social media also posed a challenge to produce a population that is receptive to truth. Felicitating the students, N. Ram, Director, The Hindu Publishing Group and Trustee, Media Development Foundation (MDF), said they would be entering journalism fields with opportunities and challenges. Economics, ecosystem and ways of media have been disrupted in the digital age. Technology and journalism have evolved rapidly in recent years. However, the intrinsic values and relevance of journalism as a democratic craft remains despite the technology-led transformations. The core tasks of journalism — verification, sense making, baring witness and investigation — as a professional pursuit continue to be relevant, Mr. Ram said. Pointing out that the values of journalism had come under pressure now, he said students must stand up for their profession and protect its independence as a democratic craft. Remembering the three alumni of ACJ who were COVID-19 victims, Sashi Kumar, Chairman, MDF and ACJ, said it was a challenging year owing to the pandemic. But it was a trendsetter as classes were delivered online during the adverse situation. While Prabhjit Singh and Arshu John were declared winners of the Asian College of Journalism’s Award for Investigative Journalism for their article in The Caravan on the Delhi riots, Sukanya Shantha won the K.P. Narayana Kumar Memorial Award for Social Impact Journalism for her article on caste discrimination in Indian prisons published in The Wire . The awards comprise cash prizes of Rs. 2 lakh and Rs. 1 lakh respectively. In the Investigative Journalism award category, there were three special mentions — Disha Shetty, Tish Sanghera and Pankhuri Kumar for Environment Undone series in India Spent ; Lakshmi Subramanian forInside Syria - The Naked and the Deadpublished in The Week , and Shalini Singh for her series on women’s health submitted to the People’s archive for Rural India . There were four special mentions in the social impact journalism category. They were Divya Gupta forShooting up: Himachal Pradesh’s spiralling heroin problempublished inThe Caravan; Aparna Ganesan, Vigneshwar K., Vivek Manahoran and Prajeesh K. forEnnore: Living in AshesinAsiaville; Tanmoy Bhaduri forBuzz of hope: traditional honey gatherers of the Sunderbans get a new lease of lifeinGaon Connectionand Sruthin Lal and Dibyaudh Das forCorona CyclipsinAsiaville. A total of 115 students received their post-graduate diplomas in journalism and another 12 students received their post-graduate diplomas in business and financial journalism.

04 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Don’t arrest former Minister till June 9, High Court tells police||The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the police to not arrest former Information Technology Minister M. Manikandan till June 9 in a rape case booked on the basis of a complaint lodged by an actress. The court passed the interim order following an anticipatory bail petition filed by him accusing the actress of being an extortionist who lays honeytraps with the assistance of a gang. Justice R. Subramanian granted the interim relief since an intervening application filed by the actress, to oppose the anticipatory bail plea, was not placed before him. After directing the High Court Registry to number the intervening petition and list it before the court along with the anticipatory bail plea on June 9, the judge ordered that the accused should not be harassed or arrested till then. “Keep your hands off for a week,” the judge told Government Counsel (Criminal Side) R. Muniyapparaj when the latter opposed grant of interim relief and apprehended that the former minister might tamper with the evidence in the meantime. Advocate V. Raghavachari, representing the actress, also complained to the court that the accused had been sending rowdy elements to threaten her. “I am being harassed. I am having photographs which have been circulated by this gentleman to various persons. I can share those photographs with the court in a sealed cover. It will show what type of behaviour this person has exhibited. I don’t know how these persons are elected as Ministers,” the counsel said inviting a strong objection from advocate R. R. John Sathyan representing the former Minister. After warning the counsel to not force the court to make any observations at this stage, the judge said he was merely adjourning the matter since the intervening application had not been placed before him and directed the prosecution to not arrest him till then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dont-arrest-former-minister-till-june-9-high-court-tells-police/article34722961.ece

04 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Take steps to curb price rise, OPS tells Stalin||The AIADMK coordinator, O. Panneerselvam, on Thursday called upon Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to make use of the Price Stabilisation Fund for curtailing the rise of prices of essential commodities in the open market. In a statement, Mr. Panneerselvam recalled how former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had utilised the Fund which led to reduction of prices of essential commodities. Citing reports of prices of various commodities in the last one year, he said while people, who were being put to economic hardship on account of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, were also hit by the price hike. A conservative estimate revealed that a family had to spend Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000 more a month. The AIADMK leader also requested the Chief Minister to take steps against hoarding and smuggling of commodities. Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Edappadi K. Palaniswami, in a letter, thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for having sent a draft detailed project report to States on the linking of Godavari-Cauvery rivers for comments.

04 June 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai Port Trust moves HC over fraud||The Chennai Port Trust (CPT) has moved the Madras High Court in connection with a case of Rs. 100.57 crore deposited by it in Indian Bank’s Koyambedu branch, Chennai, last year getting locked because the fixed deposits were closed and the money had been transferred to a current account opened by an impostor posing as the Deputy Director (Finance). Justice R. Mahadevan wondered how banks could allow such frauds to take place and ordered notice to the bank. He permitted the CPT to issue private notice to the bank, besides filing a petition to implead the Central Bureau of Investigation to the writ petition since it appeared that both the port trust as well as the bank had lodged complaints with the bureau over the fraud. In an affidavit on behalf of the CPT, its Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer D. Ramana Murthy said it deposited funds in Indian Bank’s Koyambedu branch in 14 tranches between March 7 and May 4, 2020, with a lock-in period of one year. On May 14, 2020, the bank sent an e-mail stating that the last tranche of Rs. 62.08 crore was foreclosed on May 8. Immediately, the CPT wrote to the bank questioning the foreclosure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-port-trust-moves-hc-over-fraud/article34722840.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy refused to entertain a public interest litigation petition, initially filed in the Madurai Bench of the court and then transferred to the principal seat, seeking a direction to utilise the IVC to produce COVID-19 vaccines.

Manikandan till June 9 in a rape case booked on the basis of a complaint lodged by an actor. The court passed the interim order following an anticipatory bail petition filed by him accusing the actor of being an extortionist who lays honeytraps with the assistance of a gang. Justice R. Subramanian granted the interim relief since an intervening application filed by the actress, to oppose the anticipatory bail plea, was not placed before him. After directing the High Court Registry to number the intervening petition and list it before the court along with the anticipatory bail plea on June 9, the judge ordered that the accused not be harassed or arrested till then. “Keep your hands off for a week,” the judge told Government Counsel (criminal side) R. Muniyapparaj when the latter opposed grant of interim relief and apprehended that the former Minister might tamper with the evidence in the meantime. Advocate V. Raghavachari, representing the actor, also complained to the court that the accused had been sending rowdy elements to threaten her. “I am being harassed. I am having photographs which have been circulated by this gentleman to various persons. I can share those photographs with the court in a sealed cover. It will show what type of behaviour this person has exhibited. I don’t know how these persons are elected as Ministers,” the counsel said, inviting strong objection from advocate R. R. John Sathyan, representing the former Minister. After warning counsel to not force the court to make any observations at this stage, the judge said he was merely adjourning the matter since the intervening application had not been placed before him, and directed the prosecution to not arrest him till then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dont-arrest-former-it-minister-till-june-9-says-hc/article34722832.ece

04 June 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Fall in number of COVID-19 cases in Coimbatore gives confidence’||The decline in number of COVID-19 cases in Coimbatore gives confidence in combating the pandemic, but the time has not yet come to lower the guard, said District Collector S. Nagarajan here on Thursday. Mr. Nagarajan told The Hindu that the concern of the administration was to tackle the spread in semi urban and rural pockets where the COVID-19 protocols were taking a serious beating. Having surpassed Chennai to become the district with highest number of cases, tight measures have been put in place in Coimbatore to stop the spread of the infection, he said. While stepping up the screening, the focus is more on quality. Currently, about 11,000 tests are done every day and is likely to be stepped by another 3,000 tests. Two government laboratories at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and ESI Medical College Hospital handle 5,000 samples a day. Plans are on to rope in private laboratories to augment the number of tests per day, he added. Officials have been instructed to display zero tolerance to false negative cases, while false positive reports are also not being entertained. A fraction of swabs tested at private labs is also to be sent for a repeat test at the State Public Health Laboratories to ensure quality control. In the event of early detection of infection in patients with only mild symptoms or asymptomatic, the individuals are referred to the COVID-19 Care Centres. Of the 7,100 beds in CCCs, only 2,824 beds are occupied at present. The district has added nearly 3,000 beds in the last three weeks, he said. From urban areas, the spread is now happening in semi urban and rural areas causing concern, basically because of small community level functions being held flouting COVID-19 prevention protocols. Just as the Coimbatore Corporation has emulated the Chennai model of daily door-to-door visit and identifying symptomatic cases early using one fever survey volunteer for every 100 households, the suburban Blocks such as Periyanaickenpalayam, Sulur, Thondamuthur have also started early identification. The door-to-door surveys are led by IAS officers and DROs with extensive technical support from the Directorate of Public Health. In respect of oxygen beds, the strategy is now to create more oxygen beds, including upgrading CCCs to Oxygen Treatment Centres as the first line of treatment even for patients requiring oxygen, Mr. Nagarajan said. As of now, 92 private hospitals have been permitted to treat COVID-19 patients and all have been temporarily empanelled under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS). The focus is on ensuring sufficient beds for CMCHIS patients, redressing complaints of not accepting CMCHIS or overcharging of private patients. A special cell has been created to audit the erring hospitals and take action under the provisions of the Clinical Establishment Act. All that the district administration wants from the public is to follow the basics of breaking the transmission chain – masking, hand hygiene, following the standard operating procedures in industry and commerce and avoiding unnecessary social gatherings, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fall-in-number-of-covid-19-cases-in-coimbatore-gives-confidence/article34722507.ece

In a memorandum to the State government, the Railway Suppliers Association said there are nearly 70 units, mostly in the small and micro category, that cater to the railway sector. These units supply components for coaches, engines, wagons, and signal and communication that are manufactured at workshops and industries located across the country. The Railways had operated goods trains throughout the lockdown period, oxygen container special trains, and some passenger trains, too. Hence, workshops in the northern States are asking for components. But, the supplying industries in Tamil Nadu are unable to cater to the demand because of the lockdown. They are losing orders to units located in other States. Hence, the State government should bring the railway suppliers under the “essential” category, said the association. In another press release, the Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Associations thanked the government for resuming supply of industrial oxygen. The Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises here use industrial oxygen for some basic operations and were hit when the supply was stopped. With resumption of supply, these units will benefit, the federation said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/railway-suppliers-seek-essential-industry-status/article34722858.ece

Representatives from tribal settlements in the Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) areas, a landscape home to the highest number of tribal families in Coimbatore district, claimed that at least 10 % of families lack ration cards to get these benefits. “There are 17 tribal settlements in Coimbatore district limits of ATR. As per official records with the Forest Department, which are several years old, there are 986 families. The actual number of families will be more than 1,000. Of these, around 100 families do not have ration cards,” claims V.S. Paramasivam, Coimbatore district president of the Tamil Nadu Tribal Association. According to him, 10 families at Koomatti tribal settlement, around 40 km away from Valparai, do not have ration cards. Some of them got married 15 years ago and they are also yet to have ration cards. They have to walk all this distance to buy provisions which is now not possible due to the lockdown, he says. Activist S. Thanraj from Ekta Parishad, Tamil Nadu, collected lists of families from some tribal settlements who do not have ration cards and shared the same with The Hindu . As per the list, 51 families from Kulipatti, Gopalpathi, Mavadappu and Kattupatti settlements do not have ration cards. According to a woman from Kulipatti settlement, more than 10 families lack ration cards. “Many of them are not aware of the procedures to be followed to get a ration card and its benefits. In such a case, authorities should have come to their assistance and help them get essential documents such as ration card, voter ID and Aadhaar. Due to the restrictions of the COVID-19 induced lockdown, the residents do not go out often. The financial assistance of Rs. 4,000 and the kit of groceries will be a huge relief for them. The government should make appropriate steps to ensure that these benefits reach them,” he says. District Supply Officer R. Kumaresan, however, claimed that the department conducted special camps till January this year for tribal families for ration card. “A very few tribal families, that of persons who got married after January, may not have ration cards. All other tribal families in the district have cards,” he said. Mr. Paramasivam through the help of philanthropists have supplied provisions to 13 tribal settlements including Koomatti in ATR limits so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-tribal-families-lack-ration-cards-to-get-govts-dole/article34722504.ece

04 June 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Remove time restrictions for mandis, say jaggery traders||The ‘mandai vellam’ (jaggery) makers and traders of Madurai have been deeply impacted by the imposition of intense complete lockdown. While the district administration has recently permitted the functioning of jaggery mandis on three days a week, the traders urge the district administration to permit functioning of mandis without any time restrictions. The jaggery, which is made by grinding sugarcane, is a major business in nearly eight villages in the Alanganallur region - Kottaimedu, Kallanai, Valasai, Melachinnampatti, Kalvelipatti, Kondaiyampatti and Thanichiyam. C. Jothivel, a farmer from Kottaimedu, who also runs a jaggery manufacturing unit, said that the failure in regular procurement of sugarcane by National Cooperative Sugar Mills in Alanganallur in recent years had encouraged many farmers to produce jaggery, a value addition. The ‘mandai vellam’ produced in Madurai region has a good demand in Kerala and Tirunelveli for being almost organic without any chemicals. Mr. Jothivel, on behalf of other farmers and jaggery manufacturers, submitted a petition to the Collector requesting to permit functioning of jaggery mandis that were closed from May 24 during the intense complete lockdown period. He had said that the non-operation of mandis caused huge financial loss for both the farmers as well as the manufacturers. Based on this request, the district administration permitted the functioning of the mandis for three days a week during fixed timings. But, the time restrictions pose several challenges for the jaggery traders, said M. Karthikeyan, secretary of Tamil Nadu Jaggery Merchants Association. “The jaggery from Madurai is mostly sold in Kerala, where there are some restrictions imposed due to the pandemic. Hence, if the district administration removes the time restrictions imposed in functioning of mandis, then it will not affect the supply chain,?” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/remove-time-restrictions-for-mandis-say-jaggery-traders/article34722568.ece

The absence of a well-stocked library was one of the major impediments for students and research scholars of Madurai. “There is currently no library in Madurai which has all the important historical books or books of international authors. So, the establishment of this library will benefit the student community,” he added. President of Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry N. Jegatheesan said that the library, which would be established at a cost of Rs. 70 crore, would help students in southern districts to prepare well for various competitive examinations.

04 June 2021||Perambalur,TAMIL NADU||Two held for assaulting NGO field worker||A special police team of Perambalur district on Thursday arrested two persons who reportedly went absconding after allegedly attacking a field coordinator working for a non-governmental organisation and belonging to Scheduled Caste community. The accused T. Muthukumar and D. Thotti alias Ramesh - both Caste Hindus (Vanniyar community) of Keelaperambalur village - were secured by a special police team at Pennadam in neighbouring Perambalur district. The Kunnam Police had registered a case acting on a complaint preferred by the field coordinator P. Arul Prabu of Ogalur village in Kunnam taluk in Perambalur district. Arul Prabu in his complaint stated that on May 27, he was engaged in work at Keelaperambalur village along with a person by name Ganesan, a field officer, and a few labourers. They were procuring millets from farmers for marketing. At that time, Muthukumar and Ramesh came to the spot and demanded to know why Arul Prabu had come to the village.

04 June 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||45% COVID-19 victims had no comorbidities in Puducherry||At least 45% of patients who succumbed to the second wave of coronavirus pandemic had no underlying co-morbid condition, according to a mortality analysis undertaken by the Health Department. The study, which examined a total of 866 deaths that occurred till May 31 during the second wave, found that while 461 patients had some form of co-morbidity — most commonly diabetes mellitus, hypertension or chronic renal disease — 404 patients had no underlying risk. No data was available in the case of one patient, a document prepared by the Health Department noted. This is also the point in the mortality graph where the second wave has pulled away to differentiate itself from the chart of the first wave of COVID-19 that began in January-March in 2020. The other departure was in the high proportions of deaths in the younger age segments with the study finding that 32.2% of casualties were in the 45-60 age segment. The age-wise mortality charts showed that 8.5% were in the 19-44 years age bracket and 1.1% in the 6-18 age group. Taken together, almost 42% of second wave deaths was among those less than 60 years of age. However, those above 60 years of age continued to constitute the demographic at highest mortality risk (59%). Gender-wise, 58% of victims were men and about 42% women. One of the other significant findings was that all the patients had been tested for COVID-19 only upon reaching the hospital after they had already developed near full-stage disease with acute symptoms, including breathlessness and chest pain. "We found that patients who develop classical signs such as fever, fatigue or dry cough manage with self-medication at home for the first four or five days. By the time they reach a hospital, we may have missed the golden window for timely intervention," said T. Arun, Health Secretary. Pointing out that late hospitalisation was the single most important factor driving the mortality among COVID-19 patients, which was the case in the first and the second wave, the official said this was borne out by empirical evidence. While 660 patients (76%) died within a week of hospitalisation, 105 (12.2%) were so ill that they could not make it past 24 hours of admission. The mortality risk tapered off in proportion with the longer duration of hospital stay with a total of 72 patients succumbing to complications after a period of two weeks or more of hospitalisation. “We have been trying to address this area of concern in all our public messaging by urging the public to get tested as soon as they get early signs of discomfort,” Mr. Arun said. Once a person volunteers for a test, it activates the health system to take over from there — from triaging, home monitoring or hospitalisation. “It is remarkable that we have not registered a single home isolation death so far,” an official said. Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan had the other day revealed the findings that an estimated 95% of those requiring oxygen-supported ICU admission were not vaccinated while the remaining 5% per were those who had taken the jab recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/45-covid-19-victims-had-no-comorbidities/article34722851.ece

04 June 2021||Ramanathapuram,TAMIL NADU||Three held on charge of impersonation||The District Crime Branch (DCB) police in Ramanathapuram have registered a case of impersonation against three persons including an ex-serviceman and an employee with the Fire and Rescue Services Department for misusing the name of the Superintendent of Police and blocking the savings bank account of a person in Villupuram district. Police said Rajasekar of Yemeneswaram, near Paramakudi, sought facilitation of a bank loan from Kuppan of Valavanoor, Villupuram district. He promised to arrange it for a commission. Rajasekar told about the ‘proposal’ to his friend Murugan, an ex-serviceman in Kamudakudi, who too was interested in taking the loan. As Kuppandid not get the loan and also failed to return the commission, the duo approached Santharam, employed in the Fire and Rescue Service Department at Yemeneswaram. It is said that Santharam gave them the idea of sending a letter purportedly written by the SP directing the bank manager to block the account of Kuppan. On receipt of the ‘letter from SP Ramnad’, the bank manager blocked the account of Kuppan. When Kuppan wanted to know the reason, the bank informed him about the ‘letter’. After Kuppan contested the letter, the bank enquired with the SP office here. The personnel at the office of the SP denied issuing any such letter. Hence, a complaint was preferred with the SP by the bank manager. Based on investigation, police detained the trio and registered a case of impersonation, among others, on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/three-held-on-charge-of-impersonation/article34722962.ece

After finalising the tenders, the contracts were issued towards the end of May and works were under way on a rapid pace in all places. The progress of works were being closely monitored. “We have drawn up a schedule and the progress is monitored not only by PWD officials but also the respective Collectors and senior IAS officers nominated as monitoring officers,” Mr. Saxena said. Answering a query on complaints over desilting of canals in tail-end areas, Mr. Saxena said that complaints, if any, can be taken up with the respective Collectors or brought to his notice. “We will monitor and act upon them immediately,” he added.

04 June 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Though numbers dip, there is no let up in testing of samples||Even as the number of active COVID-19 cases in Tiruchi district reports a dip, the district administration continues to test nearly 5,000 samples per day, keeping a check on the spread of the viral infection. While the number of cases had witnessed a plateau in urban Tiruchi, a significant spike was reported in semi-urban and rural parts of the district. “Areas in Lalgudi, Tiruverumbur and Manapparai marked a significant increase not only due to the lockdown but also because of the spread of the viral infection within clusters in the areas,” a senior health official said. To continue monitoring people across the district, random tests continue to be conducted. “We take samples from vendors at shops, residents among others. These random samples help determine the spread of infection in pockets,” the official said. When a patient tests positive, at least 30 of his primary and secondary contacts are tested. The Tiruchi Corporation deployed health officers equipped with pulse oximeters to check the oxygen saturation levels of residents across its 65 wards in four zones. “Since there was a spike in the number of asymptomatic patients, monitoring the residents’ oxygen levels helps to ensure that the infection does not spread to other members of their family,” S. Sivasubramanian, City Corporation Commissioner said. In the rural parts of the district, Block Health Officers, Village Health Nurses and Primary Healthcare Centres were conducting door-to-door surveillance. According to the COVID-19 treatment protocol released by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Primary Healthcare Centres have to admit patients who were COVID-19 positive with oxygen saturation of 90 to 94%. “Only if the patients are not improving will they be admitted to a District Headquarters Hospital, Medical College Hospital or other dedicated COVID-19 treating centres,” the official said. The enthusiasm of the public to take the COVID-19 vaccine has also helped in containing the intensity of the infection, another health official said. On June 3, vaccine had been taken by 10,085 people, one of the highest responses across the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/though-numbers-dip-there-is-no-let-up-in-testing-of-samples/article34723008.ece

04 June 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||TNPGTA asks govt. to conduct Plus Two exam||Tamil Nadu Post-Graduate Teachers’ Association has appealed to the State government to conduct Plus Two examination as it will deny the Centre another opportunity to enforce NEET on students of the State and ensure smooth admission in professional and arts and science colleges. In a memorandum sent to Commissioner for School Education, association president K.P.O. Suresh and general secretary P. Manoharan said the State government was discussing a decision on the examination following the Centre’s decision not to conduct board examination for CBSE students citing the second wave of COVID-19 as reason. By doing so, the Centre would make NEET mandatory for medical admission this year too. Hence, the State government, which opposed NEET, should conduct Plus Two exam after the intensity of the second wave subsided. It could think of downsizing the portions and examination duration. “The PG teachers are prepared to extend all possible help for successful conduct of the public examination,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnpgta-asks-govt-to-conduct-plus-two-exam/article34722960.ece

04 June 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Drones being used to disinfect containment zones in the Nilgiris||The Gudalur Municipality is using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, to disinfect containment zones in Gudalur town. Speaking to The Hindu , Gudalur Municipality Commissioner V. Bhaskaran said that there had been a surge in COVID-19 cases in Gudalur during the second wave of the pandemic. “As on date, there are 51 containment zones in Gudalur,” said Mr. Bhaskaran. To minimise the contact that municipality workers have with people living inside containment zones, the drones are being used to disinfect the areas for the last few days. The drones have a capacity to carry around 10 litres of disinfectant, and using the drones offers the municipality the added advantage of disinfecting even hard-to-reach locations within a given area, said officials. A trial was conducted at the Gudalur bus stand area earlier this week, and the drone is now being used in containment zones across Gudalur. On Thursday, Nilgiris District Cllector J. Innocent Divya said that the district had received an additional 7,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and that people were readily getting themselves vaccinated at Primary Health Centers and government hospitals across the district. The Collector said that there were more than 600 containment zones in the district, and urged people to not enter or leave these zones to prevent the spread of COVID-19. She added that daily checks were being conducted to ensure that people living in containment zones have access to provisions and medication. The district has set up 11 facilities to treat COVID-19 patients, including four government hospitals. There was no shortage of beds or oxygen for patients in the Nilgiris, added Ms. Divya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drones-being-used-to-disinfect-containment-zones-in-the-nilgiris/article34722489.ece

04 June 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Summer ploughing taken up free of cost for marginal farmers||Even as the Department of Agriculture has appealed farmers to go for summer ploughing, Tractor and Farm Equipments Ltd. (TAFE) has come forward to help marginal farmers plough their farmlands free of cost. Free ploughing started on Wednesday and was expected to cover up to 15,000 acres of land in Virudhunagar district in the next two months before the northeast monsoon sets in, said Joint Director of Agriculture (Virudhunagar) S. Uthandaraman. The private tractor manufacturer came up with the scheme to help farmers overcome the crisis induced by COVID-19 in 2020 and ploughed over 8,000 acres of land. Farmers owning up to two acres were eligible to avail themselves of the benefit under the scheme. The company had issued a toll-free number 1800 4200100 through which farmers could register themselves under the scheme. They could also register through Uzhavan App and JFarm App. TAFE would send its tractors and bear the cost of fuel and driver expenses, Mr. Uthandaraman said. Assistant Director of Agriculture (Rajapalayam) Subbiah said summer ploughing came with many benefits as it would loosen and aerate soil and reduce the effect of compaction. It would also increase moisture-holding capacity of soil and reduce erosion, thereby retaining nutrients. “Weeds will be removed without much expenditure and theycan be used as natural manure.” Various types of pests living underground were eradicated due to direct exposure to sunlight and birds, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/summer-ploughing-taken-up-free-of-cost-for-marginal-farmers/article34722965.ece

Arumugam. Mr. Arumugam said in a press release that the Central government introduced a special scheme last year to draw an advance from the Provident Fund. “This act of drawing money from the Provident Fund of employees’ savings for the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana is nothing but defeating the very basic principle of Provident Fund Scheme,” he said. The Central trade unions had demanded that the government safeguard the families of employees during the pandemic period by granting a solatium of Rs. 7,500 a month. Now, the government, instead of saving the employees from the pandemic and lockdown is making the situation worse through the scheme. Provident Fund is a life-long saving by a worker or employee with contribution from the employer that can be used after retirement. By taking an advance from that amount, the worker or employee is losing his saving. Hence, the government should extend a solatium of Rs. 7,500 a month from March last year to employees, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/provide-solatium-to-workers-govt-told/article34722856.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Bank auctions jewellery||Seventy-one borrowers, who had pledged their gold jewellery with Bodi Krishna Nagar branch of a private bank in November last, were in for shock when the bank informed them that the valuables were auctioned on May 31. CSB Bank (formerly known as Catholic Syrian Bank) had announced that it would lend more money for pledged jewellery than other nationalised banks. Hence, many customers, mostly small traders, pledged their jewellery with the bank. Most of the borrowers, who invested the money in their businesses, could not pay interest due to COVID-19 and lockdowns. The rainfall in the district during December and January followed by rise in COVID-19 positive cases resulted in frequent closure of businesses. As the State prepared for elections held in April-May, it not only resulted in poor sales, but due to the model code of conduct, people were unable to carry cash. Hence, businesses reported dull sales. Meanwhile, the bank sent in a final call of notice to borrowers about public auctioning of their valuables. A couple, Nagarajan and Priyanka, said they had pledged 165 gm of jewellery and borrowed Rs. 6.50 lakh. “The bank informed us that the loan to be paid was Rs. 7 lakh. At a time when we are unable to pay the interest, the bank’s notice to redeem the jewels came as a shock,” they said. However, when they approached the bank after making alternative arrangements, the manager said they had already initiated action. Like them, many other borrowers, who had turned up at the bank branch, said the State government should intervene and help them redeem their jewellery. Many traders in Bodi, who had pledged their jewellery, said when they approached the bank manager, they simply refused to give permission for a meeting under the pretext of following SOP in view of COVID-19. When contacted by The Hindu , a bank official, requesting anonymity, said it was a gold loan given to borrowers with due intimation/reminders to pay the interest and redeem the valuables. The bank followed the laid out procedures only.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bank-auctions-jewellery/article34722963.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||‘By opposing NEP, T.N. might miss chance to enhance educational standards’||Former Vice-Chancellor of Anna University E. Balagurusamy has written to Chief Minister M K Stalin contending that by not being part of the National Education Policy (NEP 2020), Tamil Nadu could miss the opportunity to enhance educational standards and achievements, he cautioned. According to him, higher educational institutions could face problems with national agencies such as the UGC, AICTE and Medical Council. It could also adversely affect the possibility of getting funds and grants from central regulatory agencies and government departments for developmental projects and research. Listing out what he described as "myths" about the NEP, the former UPSC Member said the policy did not seek to impose Hindi. Instead it sought a three-language formula to enable students learn an additional language. Students would not be filtered at the end of 3rd, 5th and 8th standard exams. The aim of the exam is to assess the learning outcomes. It is for the States to decide the pattern of exam and promotion policies, he felt. He believed that the vocational stream of education that the Policy has advocated is not an equivalent of ‘kula thozhil’ (hereditary vocation). Instead vocational education paved the way for jobs when students finished school. While in India only 10% receive vocational education, in Korea it is as much as 96%; in Japan (80%); Germany it is 75% and in the United Kingdom as many as 68% pursue the programme. Although education was on the concurrent list and the Union government had the right to frame policies, the State could adapt certain provisions to suit the local needs and aspirations. As for the fears of social justice being undermined, he said the Policy proposed several initiatives to incentivise schemes for SC, ST, OBC students. The policy would not affect the State’s reservation policy, and this had been promised by the Union government. Mr. Balagurusamy dismissed the argument that the policy would encourage autonomy of institutions and thereby commercialisation. “Autonomy provides greater flexibility towards introduction of new courses, curriculum design, appointment of faculty, assessment methods, collaborations,” he said. Currently, over 70% colleges and 30% schools are run by private managements. The government proposed to enhance the gross enrolment ratio to 50% which would be possible only if corporate companies would invest in education, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/by-opposing-nep-tn-might-miss-chance-to-enhance-educational-standards/article34722868.ece
04 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||GST collection went down 42% in April||Signalling what could be in store for the State in terms of collection of Goods and Service Tax (GST) for the month of May, when the State was in lockdown, the collection fell by 42% from March while the COVID-19 pandemic was raging in Bengaluru. The total GST collection, including cess, fell from Rs. 9,954 crore in March to Rs. 5,731 crore in April. This is expected to slide steeply in the month of May, the figures for which are expected this month. The fall in collection for April came after a record collection in the country in March. For the State, the net collection from State Goods and Services Tax (SGST), Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) settlement, Karnataka Sales Tax, and Professional Tax dipped from Rs. 7,123 crore in March to Rs. 4,304 crore in April — a 40% decline. This is excluding the compensation received. “We have not calculated a possible dip for May, but it could be big considering what has come for the month of April and the lockdown in place in May,” a senior Finance Department official said. While the State has been under lockdown since May 10 to curb the spread of COVID-19, restrictions were in place across Karnataka since the last week of April. Nearly 20 districts have implemented a stricter lockdown than the Statewide lockdown in May. KST also down Similarly, the collection of one of the important sources of revenue for the State — Karnataka Sales Tax (KST) — is also down. While Rs. 1,885 crore was collected for March, it was down to Rs. 1,620 crore in April — a decline of about 14 %. With lockdown restrictions on movement of vehicles bringing down petrol and diesel consumption in May, it is expected to go down further. The collection of Professional Tax is also down from Rs. 106.28 crore to Rs. 82.75 crore in the two months. But in comparison to the corresponding two months last year, the collection improved slightly to Rs. 189 crore, as against Rs. 182 crore.    Last year was worse The figures for April/May this year are far better when compared to the corresponding months of 2020, when the national lockdown was in force. A total GST collection of Rs. 15,686 crore has been reported this year, as against Rs. 6,537 crore last year — a 139% increase. On the Sales Tax front too, the collection of Rs. 3,506 crore this year, as against Rs. 1,662 crore last year, is more than double for the two months, with a growth of 110%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gst-collection-went-down-42-in-april/article34722479.ece

Nearly 83% of the total 3,01,49,275 tests conducted till date have been done using the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method. RT-PCR is the gold standard that has negligible chances of false negativity. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said Uttar Pradesh leads the chart with five crore tests; U.P. has a population three times that of Karnataka. Maharashtra, which has nearly twice the population of Karnataka, stands second with 3.6 crore tests. In south India, Karnataka is followed by Tamil Nadu and Kerala. While Tamil Nadu has carried out 2.8 crore tests, the number in Kerala is 2 crore. Andhra Pradesh has carried out 1.9 crore test and Telangana 1.5 crore tests. Testing had been ramped up from May 2020. From a total of 3,031 tests in March 2020, the State conducted nearly 16 lakh tests in August. This further went up to nearly 20 lakh tests in September. The tests per million went up from 44,099 on September 1 to 72,541 on September 30. On October 2, the number of tests had touched 50,89,730. The one-crore mark was breached on November 21, 2020 and the two crore mark on March 17, 2021. V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka and member of State COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said, “From five ICMR VRDL testing labs – NIV State unit and VRDL labs in BMCRI, Mysuru, Hassan and Shivamogga – in March, we had 15 labs by April 12, 2020. On April 14, the Prime Minister announced that every district in the country will have one lab by May 31, after which the testing infrastructure was expanded.” The response was overwhelming. In six months, there was an exponential rise in the number of labs. Currently, a total of 192 centres, including 66 government laboratories, are functional in Karnataka with an average capacity of 1,03,900 tests per day, excluding Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT). C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State COVID-19 task force, said although 1.4 lakh samples being tested daily is a good number, there is a need to further ramp up testing in high-risk districts.  From five ICMR VRDL testing labs in March 2020, we had 15 labs by April 12, 2020 V.

04 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Three districts report outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease||At a time when people are facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the cattle population in the State too is facing a threat as there has been an outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in a few villages. The disease has been reported from Chickballapur, Bengaluru Urban, and Ramanagaram districts so far. FMD is a serious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals and can even be fatal. It is a nightmare for farmers as it can cause permanent damage to the health system of cattle and affect the financial viability of animal husbandry. Veterinarians working at the grassroot level blame this for the State missing out on previous round of FMD vaccination. “Vaccination against FMD is strictly carried out once in six months to prevent the outbreak of the viral disease. But the previous round of vaccination scheduled sometime in October 2020 could not be carried out due to COVID-19 pandemic then,” said a veterinary doctor. State Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Director Shivaram B.N. said that the situation was under control. Pointing out that FMD vaccination drive is purely a Central government programme, he admitted that the previous round could not be taken up because of COVID-19. However, the next round of vaccination is scheduled sometime in July, he pointed out. “But as an immediate measure, we have permitted deputy directors of all the affected districts to procure the vaccine from private vendors and ensure that cattle population is vaccinated against FMD,” he said. Meanwhile, in Bannikuppe village of Ramanagaram district, over 10 cows are believed to have been infected by FMD according to B.G. Sathish, secretary of the milk producers’ co-operative society of the village. “Last year, there was no serious incidence of FMD in our village. But this time, due to the delay in cattle vaccination programme, the FMD has infected at least 10 cows in the village,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-districts-report-outbreak-of-foot-and-mouth-disease/article34722451.ece
04 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Two more arrested in gangrape case||The Ramamurthy Nagar police on Thursday arrested two more persons who were allegedly involved in the rape and torture of a woman from Bangladesh. According to the police, the accused, Azeem amd Jamal, both around 30 years old, were evading the police following the arrest of their friends. “We were on the lookout for them, and tracked them through their mobile phones to a labourers’ colony in north Bengaluru where they were hiding,” said a senior police official, adding that like the other accused, Azeem and Jamal also hail from Bangladesh. “They crossed the border illegally and were operating out of Bengaluru. They are part of the prostitution ring, and are close associates of the prime accused, Sobuj. They assisted him in trafficking women from Bangladesh.” To date, the police have arrested 12 people involved in the alleged incident, which came to light after video clips started circulating in Assam and other States in northeast India. According to the Bengaluru police, most of the gang members have been arrested. “However, further investigation is on to ascertain the role of others in the racket,” the police added . On June 2, the police opened fire on the main accused Sobuj who reportedly runs the prostitution ring.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-more-arrested-in-gangrape-case/article34722450.ece
04 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||209 flood-prone areas identified||Ahead of the monsoon, 209 areas across Bengaluru have been identified as prone to flooding. Of these, 58 have been classified as ‘hyper-sensitive’ and 151 as ‘sensitive’. Reviewing monsoon preparedness on Thursday, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa directed officials to find permanent solution to the problem of flooding. While the BBMP has already taken up annual maintenance of 440 km of rajakaluve (stormwater drains) with retaining walls, the Chief Minister directed civic officials to take up regular maintenance of lakes. They were directed to ensure that rainwater flows through the rajakaluves from one lake to another, which would help prevent flooding. A communiqué from the Chief Minister’s office stated that BBMP officials apprised Mr. Yediyurappa of other measures, such as establishing 63 temporary control rooms, and eight zonal control rooms. They will function round-the-clock and have the manpower and machines for immediate rescue and relief operations during the upcoming monsoon months. The silt from roadside drains and connecting drains have been cleared while 26 water level sensors have been installed in major drains to monitor water levels. Details of quantum of rain received are publicly available on the ‘Megha Sandesha’ app, apart from water-logging points and advisory to the public, according to a statement from the CM’s office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/209-flood-prone-areas-identified/article34722439.ece
04 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State improves ranking in NITI Aayog’s SDG Index||Karnataka ranked third in NITI Aayog’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index for 2020-21, as per a report released on Thursday. Karnataka improved its score from 66 in 2019-20 to 72 in 2020-21 and improved its ranking from fourth place to third. The State has shown progress in nine of 16 goals. Along with Karnataka, three other States — Andhra Pradesh, Goa, and Uttarakand — too scored 72 and ranked third. Kerala (with a score of 75) has been adjudged top performer, while Bihar (50) was the worst-performing State in this year’s India index. Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu shared the second spot with a score of 74. The Index for SDGs evaluates the progress of States and Union Territories on social, economic, and environmental parameters. Karnataka improved its scores on indicators related to reducing poverty; good health and well-being; gender equality; affordable and clean energy; industry, innovation and infrastructure; sustainable cities and communication; responsible consumption and production; and peace, justice and strong institutions. Its scores declined in areas such as quality education; clean water and sanitation; decent work and economic growth; reduced inequality; climate action; and life on land indicators. Sources said the State was yet to make progress in the monitoring and reporting of districts and taluks and linking SDGs to the Budget. Health concerns With regard to health, the State’s score improved in issues related to diseases and mortality rates. However, the score related to number of physicians, nurses, and midwives per 10,000 people reduced from 72 in 2019-20 to 70 in 2020-21, which according to an expert is a matter of concern, particularly when the State is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. First launched in December 2018, the index has become the primary tool for monitoring progress on SDGs in the country and has simultaneously fostered competition among the States and UTs by ranking them on global goals. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa released the State government’s SDGs Vision 2030 last December and said an estimated Rs. 10 lakh crore was needed to meet the SDGs target in the next 10 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-improves-ranking-in-niti-aayogs-sdg-index/article34722487.ece
04 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Karnataka sees red over Google result||A video clip claiming that Google was showing “Kannada” as the reply to a question, ‘Which is the ugliest language of India?’, went viral on Thursday. The producers of the clip asked Kannidigas to report to the webpage, debtconsolidationsquad.com, which had shared this information in a post. However, many took objection to Google itself, alleging that the search engine had called “Kannada”the “ugliest language” and reported the web page en masse. Even the State governmenthas decided to take legal action against Google. Kannada and Culture Minister Arvind Limbavali said the State government will take legal action. “If Kannada is now called the ugliest language in India, it is merely an attempt by Google to insult this pride of Kannadigas. Demand apology from Google to Kannada, Kannadigas. Legal action will be taken against Google for maligning the image of our beautiful language!” he tweeted. The Kannada Sahitya Parishat even mailed a complaint to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The web page was later removed by Google from its search results. Former Chief Minister H. D. Kumaraswamy in a series of tweets took objection to “lack of sensitivity by Google” and asked why the web page was removed only after Kannadigas took objection to it. Arun Javagal, a Karnataka Rakshana Vedike activist and a software engineer, said the post on the webpage may have been a deliberate attempt to stir up trouble and that the right way to deal with it was to report the page to Google, which was done. “Google is a search engine which has picked up the specific page because of the keywords used. The process is automated,” he explained. He added that the “self-respect and pride” which has spurred Kannadigas into action over the clip would be put to better use if it is channelised into more structural issues like seeking all services in Kannada and seeking a more federal governance system in the country. Google India issued an apology later in the day “Search isn’t always perfect. Sometimes, the way consent is described on the internet can yield surprising results to specific queries. We know this is not ideal, but we take swift corrective action when we are made aware of an issue and are continually working to improve our algorithms. Naturally, these are not reflective of the opinions of Google, and we apologise for the misunderstanding and hurting any sentiments,” Google India said in a statement on Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/karnataka-sees-red-over-google-result/article34722453.ece
04 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rs. 500-cr. package announced||The State government on Thursday announced a second COVID-19 relief package of Rs. 500 crore, largely for the unorganised sectors impacted by the lockdown imposed in the State since April 27. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said relief of Rs. 3,000 each would be given to power looms weavers, with a maximum of two workers per loom. Around 59,000 power looms are to benefit.

04 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||With more beds vacant, hospitals wind up step-down facilities||With more than 10,000 beds available in hospitals and COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs), not including another 50% that are reportedly unoccupied in the private quota, step-down hospitals in Bengaluru have started shutting down. According to data provided by the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA), 18 hospitals had established step-down facilities in 34 hotels across Bengaluru. Together, they had 1,304 beds, but on May 28, just around 270 beds in these facilities were occupied. PHANA President H.M. Prasanna told The Hindu that many hospitals had decided to shut down the step-down facilities by May-end. “Given the number of COVID-19 cases in the city, there is no need for these facilities. With beds available under both private and government quota and low occupancy in these facilities, it did not make sense to continue with them,” he said and added that the focus had now shifted to vaccination. During the peak of the second wave when there was a dearth of beds, hospitals had tied up with hotels to establish step-down facilities where COVID-19 patients on the road to recovery could be monitored. This was an attempt to free up beds for more critical cases. The drop in positive cases in Bengaluru has meant that even ICU and HDU beds are now available. According to data on the BBMP website, of the 13,295 beds under government quota, 8,952 beds were available as on 7 p.m. on Thursday. Of these, 6,051 were general beds, 2,807 HDU, 59 ICU and 26 ICU-Ventilator beds. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said closure of step-down facilities was a natural corollary of the COVID-19 cases reducing. Stating that this was a predictable trend, he said that COVID-19 required a dynamic response.  Given the number of COVID-19 cases, there is no need for these facilities. With beds available under both private and government quota and low occupancy in these facilities, it did not make sense to continue with them H.M.

04 June 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bed allotment software for triage centres, CCCs||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike on Thursday launched a new software for hospital bed allocation for patients walking into Physical Triaging Centres (PTC) and COVID-19 Care Centres (CCC) in Bengaluru. A total of 26 hospitals are mapped across all zones for beds to be blocked exclusively from triaging centres. During the launch of the software, Forest and Environment Minister Arvind Limbavali, who is the nodal minister for control rooms, said BBMP plans to move towards mandatory physical triaging as a prerequisite for all patients seeking hospital admission. At present, triaging is mostly taking place over the telephone through zonal and central control rooms. This facility will continue to be available. “By making physical triaging as the primary source of patient evaluation over tele-triaging, more rational and optimal allocation of critical care hospital beds can be made. In accordance, BBMP’s COVID-19 Hospital Bed Management System (CHBMS) has now been upgraded, and a detailed Physical Triage Module (PTM) has been developed and integrated,” according to a statement from the civic body. Presently, PTM is deployed at 16 physical triage centres across eight zones, and this will soon be increased. These physical centres are fully functional to triage all walk-in patients, evaluate them clinically, and allocate beds. They are equipped with ambulances, which can double up as Mobile Triage Units (MTUs) for patients who are unable to visit the PTCs, due to their medical condition. Each PTC has two doctors and two paramedics in each shift, along with computer and internet facilities. They are attached to at least one COVID-19 Care Centre with oxygen beds, and 26 hospitals across the city, BBMP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bed-allotment-software-for-triage-centres-cccs/article34722445.ece

04 June 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Transport staff seek salaries for lockdown period||Honorary president of NWKRTC Employees Federation P.H. Neeralakeri has urged the State government to immediately release the salaries of employees of North West Karnataka and North East Karnataka Road Transport Corporations for the month of May and the lockdown period. Addressing presspersons in Dharwad on Thursday, Mr. Neeralakeri said that both the transport corporations should discharge their responsibilities properly and arrange to pay their salary dues. “The strike was held from April 7 to 22 and subsequently, following a direction from the High Court of Karnataka, the transport strike was withdrawn and the employees returned to work. However, when workers went to report to duty, they were asked to produce COVID-19 test results and also get their vaccination done, which took two or three days for the workers to comply with. As there was Janata Curfew on April 24 and 25, the workers went to report to duty on April 26, when the officials did not allow them to join duty and sent them back. And, on April 27, the State government announced a State-wide lockdown. Despite all these developments, the central offices of these corporations have issued circulars stating that only 20% to 30% employees were working and the remaining will be treated as absent,” he said. Mr. Neeralakeri said that in the backdrop of the circular, it becomes evident that the remaining workers will be deprived of their salaries. The association has already submitted memorandum to the authorities to treat it as only seven days unauthorised absence and pay salaries for the lockdown period. But the authorities have only paid Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500 as salaries for April. Some of them have received just Rs. 300 to Rs. 400, while salaries of several have been treated as zero, he said. Mr. Neeralakeri said that though the State government has released Rs. 375 crore as grant towards salaries of employees, the officials of the transport corporations are harassing lower level employees by not paying them their salary dues. Association office-bearers Siddanna Kambar, Srishailgouda Kamatar, P.F. Kolkar, H.A.

04 June 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MCC Commissioner resigns alleging harassment by DC||In a sudden turn of events, Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Commissioner Shilpa Nag announced her resignation at a press conference on Thursday, citing “harassment” by Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri. This highlighted the chaos and cracks in the administrative machinery in COVID-19 management. Ms. Nag said she was not quitting as the Commissioner of MCC, but she was resigning from the IAS and would send her resignation letter to the Chief Secretary seeking to be relieved from her duties. Stating that the COVID management situation in Mysuru district was far from ideal, Ms. Nag said, “The DC is pointing fingers at the MCC when a disparity in official death data was pointed out by the media and certain politicians. The official death numbers and death audit happens directly under the supervision of the DC, and she is the one who declares the same on a daily basis,” Ms. Nag said. That there was a lack of coordination on COVID-19 management stems from Ms. Nag’s letter, which stated that the MCC’s efforts to bring Project Step One and Infosys to Mysuru to fill the gaps were quashed by the “inability to receive constructive feedback and the high-handedness of the DC”. Meanwhile, official sources confirmed that Chief Secretary Ravi Kumar was apprised of the developments in the cityand that he would visit Mysuru on Friday to sort out the matter. Ms. Nag accused the Deputy Commissioner of constantly calling the higher-ups and complaining to them that nothing was being done in the MCC. “If she [Ms. Sindhuri] has any personal grudge against me, let her take it out on me. Why target the officials who are all working non-stop to combat the pandemic?” Ms. Nag asked. “Either change your attitude or leave Mysuru, because it is getting a bad name. If she cannot go, I will,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-commissioner-resigns-alleging-harassment-by-dc/article34722482.ece
04 June 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Seeking clarification does not amount to harassment’||Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri has dismissed the allegations of “harassment” and “high-handedness” levelled against her by her colleague from the IAS cadre Shilpa Nag, Commissioner of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC). Ms. Sindhuri countered the allegations by stating that of late, Ms. Nag had stopped attending the COVID-19 reviews conducted by her. She also said the MCC was submitting contradictory ward-wise COVID-19 figures on new cases, deaths, and active cases. “I had ordered that it should be rectified,” said Ms. Sindhuri. “If one cannot work under such circumstances where one only has sought numbers, it is unfortunate.” The Deputy Commissioner said that in addition, she had directed that COVID Care Centres be opened in Mysuru city, which, she emphasised, did not have a single CCC till recently, while the taluks and rural areas had opened 18 CCCs in 20 days. None of this constitutes harassment by any stretch of imagination, she said. Referring to donations and aid coming from CSR funds from private industries for the district, Ms. Sindhuri said it was spent entirely on Mysuru city, and though she had asked for a full account on June 1, no reply had been received by her so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/seeking-clarification-does-not-amount-to-harassment/article34722483.ece

However, 41 patients, who are infected by black fungus, are getting treatment in the district’s government hospital and necessary treatment is being given to them, Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi has said. He was talking to reporters at the Yermarus Inspection Bungalow on the outskirts of Raichur on Thursday. Mr. Savadi said that the initiatives taken by the district administration helped bring down positive cases. Infected people, who were identified during visits to villages, were immediately shifted to COVID Care Centres and provided treatment. This helped reduce the number of cases, he explained. The Deputy Chief Minister said that medical officers have been advised to tackle black fungus cases carefully and provide the necessary treatment to patients. As many as 41 patients have been found in the district with the condition and all are getting treatment, he added.

BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said, “Some centres will continue to operate, albeit with a reduced bed capacity. We will keep a cushion.”.

04 June 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Fewer birds, Olive Ridleys nesting at Thottappally||Environmentalists and birdwatchers were excited to discover a good number of blue-cheeked bee-eaters nesting in a heap of sand close to the Thottappally harbour, probably for the first time in this part of the region, in May-June 2020. They were so thrilled that members of the Green Roots Nature Conservation Forum, a conservation group based at Thottappally, raised a temporary fence around the pile of sand to protect some 35 nests and 70 birds. This year too the migratory birds have come to Thottappally, but are fewer in number with environmentalists raising concerns over the ongoing “indiscriminate” mineral sand-mining at the estuary. “We have so far noticed only three nests and less than 10 birds. A portion of the sand that served as nesting ground for them last year has been removed. Besides, the place is now filled with the noise of excavators engaged in mineral sand-mining. At present, there are hardly any favourable conditions for the birds to nest and breed at Thottappally,” says Saji Jayamohan, secretary of the forum. After a lull, dredging and removal of mineral-rich sand from the estuary was revived recently. According to officials, the sand is being removed to ensure smooth flow of floodwaters from Kuttanad into the sea. Mineral sand-mining The local people, however, say though they are not against dredging of the estuary in a limited way, they are opposed to the transportation of the mineral sand. They allege the government is engaged in large-scale mineral sand-mining in the name of flood mitigation, which, according to them, is creating serious implications to people living along the coast and environmental degradation. The removed sand was being transported to Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited’s unit at Chavara. Apart from being a nesting ground for migratory birds, the Thottappally coast has long been one of the prime locations for egg-laying Olive Ridley turtles, which are legally protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. “Mineral sand-mining was first started at the Thottappally harbour in the last decade in the name of development. Last year, the government extended mining to the nearby estuary. The actions are posing a major threat to the nesting of turtles and spelling doom for the ecology of the area. This time we stumbled upon only five nests of Olive Ridleys during the entire season,” Mr. Jayamohan says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fewer-birds-olive-ridleys-nesting-at-thottappally/article34722985.ece

04 June 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Campaign highlights concerns of Kuttanad||Amidst the spectre of another flood in Kuttanad, people of the region have launched a social media campaign, Save Kuttanad, to bring to the attention of the authorities their woes and worries. The miseries brought by the 2018 deluge are still fresh in the memories of the people and they demand immediate steps to prevent a repeat of the devastation. The sudden panic was caused by the back-to-back flooding in the region last month. Several parts of Kuttanad along with the Alappuzha-Changanassery road were submerged as a result of heavy downpour and an increased flow of floodwaters. Though floodwaters have retreated from most of the places, a number of low-lying areas remain waterlogged. With monsoon expected to bring heavy showers in the coming weeks and months, residents have urged the government to take steps to ensure smooth flow of water. The people are raising concerns as almost three years after the great deluge desiltation of a large number of canals, rivers and Vembanad Lake aimed at increasing their absorption capacity and ensuring free flow of water has reached nowhere. Paddy farmers in Kuttanad have suffered huge losses in recent times following a series of bund breaches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/campaign-highlights-concerns-of-kuttanad/article34722986.ece

The Minister directed speeding up the process of sharing mobile coverage in areas where private service providers lack network access but BSNL has its towers. Reliance Jio has already applied for gaining coverage in 11 places where it currently has no network reach. The chief general manager of BSNL has issued directions to the officer concerned to take immediate decision in this regard. Jio too has submitted an application to the Kanan Devan Hills Plantation Ltd to set up 14 towers in the plantation areas of Munnar. Vaccine registration It was informed in the meeting that following setting up of 3G facilities at Rajamala, network coverage improved. Land owners have evinced interest in providing land for installing mobile towers in Vattavada, Makkuvally, Manayathadam, Kaithapara and Samiyarkudy. The requests will be cleared after verification of land documents. The lack of network coverage not only affected online classes but also registration of COVID-19 vaccination. Dean Kuriakose, MP, who attended the meeting, said that mobile network coverage in Idukki under BSNL was dogged by a number of issues, including shortage of staff, lack of timely upgrade and fund allocation. He said that in Mankulam grama panchayat, 12 out of 13 wards lacked coverage. Land aquisition District Collector H. Dinesan said that the process of clearing land applications could be done after receiving an agreement from the land owners. Representatives of Vodafone-Idea said that they were ready to erect more towers in areas where the coverage was poor.

04 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||No data yet on digital learning in higher education||The gaps in digital infrastructure in higher educational institutions have not yet been ascertained even after one year of the online mode of education as only 10% of the about 1,500 institutions responded to a survey initiated by the Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC). The council had launched the process to assess the IT infrastructure and technology-enabled learning environment in universities and colleges in the State after the COVID-19 outbreak disrupted academic activities in March last. The primary aim of the online questionnaire is to assess the strengths and weaknesses and initiate measures to step up the digital infrastructure on campuses. “The questionnaire was uploaded on the official website of the council. It was rolled out in the first phase of the pandemic,” says Rajan Varughese, Member Secretary of the KSHEC. “A fresh effort will be made by the council to gauge the ground reality in the online mode of education in the higher education sector. The feedback will be useful for policy formulation in the context of the Kerala-Fibre Optic Network project being implemented by the State government. The survey results will also help the council to formulate policies that can benefit all stakeholders in higher education,” he says. As per the council, the online questionnaire has to be filled by a responsible officer in a university/institution to provide relevant data, preferably the nodal officer dealing with the All-Kerala Higher Education Survey initiated by the council. The reluctance shown by the institutions to submit the feedback had prompted the Department of Higher Education to remind the partners that all higher educational institutions have to mandatorily disclose all information pertaining to the institution for the benefit of the stakeholders. The council had reminded the institutions that all government and aided higher educational institutions are covered by the Right to Information Act, 2005 and as per the University Grants Commission/All India Council for Technical Education norms. The executive body of the council had earlier requested the government to issue an order which mandate all higher education institutions to compulsorily participate in the All-Kerala Higher Education Survey, invoking provisions in the Right to Information Act and UGC/ AICTE directives .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-data-yet-on-digital-learning-in-higher-education/article34722599.ece
04 June 2021||Kochi,KERALA||NHAI to issue notification for greenfield alignment of highway||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will issue a notification under Section 3 (A) of the National Highways Act 1956 within a month to acquire land for the greenfield alignment of the 165-km Kochi-Munnar NH 85, which the agency aims to develop as a four-lane stretch to establish port-to-port connectivity between Kochi and Tuticorin. By invoking the provision, the agency will declare its intention to acquire land needed for the project. “An officer was appointed recently to kick-start the process of acquiring land for the project, whose greenfield alignment plan is ready. The entire project will be a greenfield alignment, except approximately 4-km land that the State government had acquired over three decades ago for the Thripunithura bypass (which turned out to be a non-starter). The aim is to ensure that the alignment will be devoid of steep curves,” official sources said. No new plots (from land which were frozen 30 years ago for the Thripunithura bypass) will be acquired afresh for the Kochi-Munnar NH. Only land that was acquired by the PWD and whose compensation was completed will be integrated with the new greenfield alignment of the NH and their possession taken over by the NHAI. “The total project cost of the greenfield highway will be known shortly in the DPR. Every effort will be made to get clearances on the project’s cost, environmental and social impact from different committees, within six months of the DPR being finalised. The existing Kochi-Munnar NH, which is now maintained by the PWD (NH Wing) using funds issued by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), will be handed over to the State government, they added. As per the revised alignment, the proposed 45-m-wide NH will take off a kilometre south of Kundannoor Junction, to prevent congestion at the junction. The PWD (NH Wing), which readied the alignment for the 8.50-km-long Thripunithura bypass, had recently requested the NHAI that it include the entire length of the bypass in the revised alignment of the Kochi-Munnar NH and not just the Mattakuzhy-Thiruvankulam stretch where land acquisition got over. Members of Parliament, NGOs, and residents associations too had made such a demand, especially so since the Thripunithura bypass was included in the Bharatamala Pariyojana project in December 2020. MP’s demand Chalakudy MP Benny Behanan, who was in the forefront of the campaign to realise the Thripunithura bypass, and took up the issue in the Lok Sabha said that he will apprise higher-ups in NHAI and if need be, Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nithin Gadkari of the need to include the entire bypass alignment on the upcoming NH stretch. “Efforts will also be made to prevail on the State government to convene a meeting, so that the possibility of the State pooling in with funds to acquire the pending land can be probed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nhai-to-issue-notification-for-greenfield-alignment-of-highway/article34722929.ece
04 June 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Salt water incursion triggers protest||Saline water incursion has triggered a public protest and war of words in Kumbalam panchayat on the outskirts of Kochi city. While some residents of the panchayat, an island, have complained that the saline incursion into the inland waterbodies and wells had polluted the water and damaged their houses and appliances, the civic authorities maintained that steps for regulating salt water incursion had been initiated. The office-bearers of the Kareethara Pradesham Residents’ Association alleged that the delay in constructing a bund for preventing the incursion of salt water to fish ponds had resulted in the situation. Many houses in the first, 16th and 17th wards of the panchayat, had been affected. The panchayat, which was earning a meagre amount of around Rs. 26,000 annually by auctioning off the fish ponds, was turning a blind eye towards the plight of the residents, said a representation submitted to the District Collector and others. As many as 100 houses, said K. J. Johnson, president of the association, have been affected. “Abandoning their homes, a few residents have moved to rented houses. Lives of most of the residents, who earn their livelihood through petty jobs, have been affected. The civic authorities have failed to respond to their plight,” he complained. Panchayat’s reaction K.S. Radhakrishnan, panchayat president, dismissed the protest as politically motivated. He said instructions had been issued to the contractor who won the bid for fish farming to prevent saline water ingress. While conceding that a few houses were affected, Mr. Radhakrishnan denied the charge that a large number of residents had abandoned their houses and fled the area. Though a bund was constructed last time, the flooding defeated the process. However, the panchayat was taking all possible measures for protecting residents of low-lying areas, he said. “The construction of a retaining wall around the Kumbalam island is the only permanent solution to the perennial issue. Last year, the Irrigation Department had prepared an estimate of Rs. 5 crore at the instance of then legislator M. Swaraj, and budgetary provisions were also made for the project,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/salt-water-incursion-triggers-protest/article34722936.ece
04 June 2021||Kochi,KERALA||ATS interrogating Pujari||A day after he was flown in from Bengaluru on a nine-day custody, the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of the Kerala Police has started grilling gangster Ravi Pujari from Thursday. He is reportedly being interrogated at a Crime Branch facility in Thripunithura. While his custody was in connection with the firing outside the beauty parlour owned by actor Leena Maria Paul in Kochi on December 15, 2018, it is learnt that his alleged links to other cases in Kerala may also come under the scanner. He had in the past rung up politicians and media persons in the State either allegedly for threatening them or to stake claim to the incidents here. He reportedly had threatened a senior Congress leader over phone in 2016 while Kerala Janapaksham (Secular) leader P.C. George had also gone public about receiving alleged threatening calls from the gangster over the feisty politician’s stance in favour of bishop Franco Mulakkal who is an accused in a rape case. In the days leading to the firing incident, the gangster had allegedly rung up Ms. Paul demanding around Rs. 25 lakh about which she had alerted the police then. Shortly after the incident, he had rang up a local news channel claiming responsibility. ATS was handed over the probe after the Crime Branch had arrested two accused, alleged hirelings of the gangster, and recovered the firearms used. Two more accused remain to be nabbed and they are suspected to be abroad. The interrogation of Pujari, the third accused in the case, is expected to help track them. The gangster was arrested in Senagal in 2019 and was handed over to the Bengaluru police. He had been lodged at the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison in Bengaluru since then. His custody period will end on June 8.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ats-starts-grilling-gangster-pujari/article34722942.ece
04 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Coastal Zone Management Plan may take more time||The Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP), which will define the scope and extent of development activities along the coastal belt of 10 districts in Kerala, may take a few more months to get into shape. While the deadline fixed for stakeholder agencies, including the government departments, to comment on the draft plan expired on May 30, enough time will be provided for the interested individuals to suggest amendments to the document, according to Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) sources. The clarification attains significance in the wake of demands by various stakeholders, including fishermen, for more time to submit the comments. Several stakeholders had pointed out that plan documents could not be verified and suggestions submitted on account of the COVID-19 restrictions.  The contours of the high tide line (HTL), the line on the land up to which water reaches during the spring tide, may change in some of the coastal areas of the State in the new CZMP draft plan. The HTL is significant in the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) regime as its from this line to a fixed distance on the land that the CRZ rules would be applicable. The changes in the HTL can lead to changes in the area where the CRZ rules will come into play. While in some cases more area may come under CRZ regime and in other cases, some areas may go out of the regime depending on the HTL, experts pointed out. The Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) had provided the draft recommendations, which were prepared by the National Centre for Earth Science Studies, for the government departments, including Fisheries, Irrigation, Tourism, Revenue and Forest, for consultations during the last week of April. The draft report was prepared for Kasaragod, Kozhikode, Kannur, Malappuram, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Alapuzha, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram. Suggestions It will take a few more months to open the window for individual stakeholders to submit their comments. The suggestions can be submitted directly at the district-level public hearings and also mailed to the authority. The draft plan will be made available at the local bodies concerned and on the website of the authority for verification, sources said. The CZMP of the State needs to be updated according to the recent CRZ rules, which were issued in 2019, for the State to take the benefits of the new legislation.

The Statewide initiative has been undertaken as a COVID Mission project. It will be a continuous programme since the larger objective goes beyond COVID-19 and aims at equipping the community to face future epidemics, disasters, or natural calamities. The five-member KRTs for each NHG are likely to be in place by July-August. They will be tasked with creating awareness based on scientific knowledge and extending assistance to the needy in coordination with various agencies, including local bodies. Awareness campaigns “This is the latest in the series of the pandemic-centric awareness campaigns being carried out by Kudumbashree. This follows 16-odd online sessions held in association with the Indian Medical Association, the Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA), and the Health Department and over 23 lakh calls made by our NHG office-bearers under a chain-call campaign. The latest initiative will be fully community-driven with weekly experience-sharing sessions at the grassroots-level to assess the efficacy,” said Harikishore S., executive director, Kudumbashree. KILA has brought out a handbook as part of the campaign, which will have State, district, and local body-level teams and resource persons to take it to the households in each NHG. “In Ernakulam, we have a district-level core team of 16 resource persons who have been given charge of 14 block panchayats and the Corporation. Two resource persons each will train the 7-member executive committees of the Area Development Societies who in turn will reach out to the response teams at the NHG-level,” said Renjini S., district mission coordinator, Ernakulam. The support groups The community-level support system of Kudumbashree has been activated for the programme by roping in members of Kudumbashree Auditing and Accounting Society members, micro-enterprise consultants, former Kudumbashree office-bearers and even former people’s representatives — the idea being that they will have better grassroots-level connections. A strategy has been devised to assess the efficacy of the programme in an engaging way like holding quizzes. Audio and video clippings over social media and phone calls will be used to further the campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/3-lakh-kudumbashree-teams-to-keep-third-wave-at-bay/article34722939.ece

Preparatory works for acquiring land on the stretch would begin on the basis of the impending notification. The NHAI has envisaged a new 44.70-km greenfield bypass that will begin south of Kundannoor Junction and end at Karayamparambu near Angamaly. It will be executed simultaneously with a project to widen the Karayamparambu-Thrissur NH stretch into a six-lane one. “The new greenfield NH corridor in order to bypass Kochi city was mooted since the largely-four-lane NH Bypass is severely congested and six-laning of the heavily-built up Edappally-Angamaly NH is tough,” said NHAI sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kundannoor-angamaly-nh-bypass-project-gets-impetus/article34722930.ece

In an appeal sent to the Chief Minister, the fishworkers’ forum said that 24 fishers, four from Kerala and the rest from Tamil Nadu, had set out from Iran on a fishing venture in March. However, they were arrested by the authorities in Qatar allegedly for violating the borders. They were jailed after a fine of 50,000 Qatar riyals was imposed on them. They were later released from jail after their sponsor paid the fine. The fishers’ union said the State should step in and involve the Indian Embassy in Qatar to repatriate the fishers. The Keralite fishers in the group were identified as Sebastian, 20, from Poovar; Silva Dasan, 33, from Adimalathura; Stephen, 42, from Pallithottam in Kollam; and Lephus, 42, from Moothakkara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bring-back-24-fishers-from-qatar-forums-urge-cm/article34722931.ece

Further, the pandemic has dwindled the income of 399 families; 279 families are dealing with related stress, and 46 are concerned about children, especially their education. These are some of the findings of the ongoing free psycho-social support being extended to COVID-19 patients by the Kochi Corporation. The service is being provided as tele-counselling by 74 social work students of Rajagiri School of Social Sciences, Kalamassery. A professional counselling agency will provide advance counselling to the needy. “People isolated from society need emotional support beyond their treatment and basic needs. The pandemic has helped our society rediscover its compassion towards our brethren, which used to be our hallmark. We plan to reach out to maximum number of people possible,” said Mayor M. Anilkumar. 595 families So far, the 74 student volunteers split into eight groups have contacted 595 families from the list of patients given by the COVID Cell of the corporation. The calls, which last from 30 to 45 minutes, are made between 10 a.m and 6 p.m. based on the convenience of the families. Each volunteers makes up to four calls a day. “A woman in her 50s said that at one point she even thought of suicide, and talking her out of that mental state is so fulfilling. They shared mostly economic concerns, including loss of livelihood and children’s education,” said Ansia Badar, a final-year MSW student and a team leader. Three parts The tele-counselling session is divided into three parts, eliciting data on immediate concerns, psychological, and impact on income, employment, medical care, inter-personal relations, and access to food. Employment of 324 families has been hit by the pandemic; 191 families are facing a general economic downturn; 163 are having emotional problems, and 129 families are facing problems in inter-personal relationships. “The experience gave me invaluable professional insights and practical application of principles. Most of these people are happy just talking to someone, and that in turn makes us happy,” said Rekha Mariya Biju, another student volunteer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-reaches-out-to-covid-hit-families/article34722934.ece
04 June 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Overnight shifting of patients in Minicoy draws criticism||The islanders of Minicoy in Lakshadweep allege vendetta on the part of the Union Territory administration in hurriedly shifting scores of COVID-19 patients to a first-line treatment centre (FLTC) without prior notice in the dead of the night on Wednesday. “The COVID testing system on the islands is essentially in total disarray as results of RT-PCR take up to a week to arrive. This is because only Kavaratti has a testing facility. When the results of RT-PCR of several people arrive, some who had tested negative in antigen tests also received positive results, leading to a lot of confusion. However, it was decided that since a few days had lapsed after the collection of samples, it was thought best to ask those tested positive to continue to stay at home. But in the night, officials, the Deputy Collector and incident commander specifically, said the District Collector had ordered an immediate shifting of the fresh batch of patients to the treatment facility. This was in bad taste, but the officials were helpless as they had to comply with the order that came late,” Muneer Manikfan, a medical doctor and vice president of the Dweep panchayat at Minicoy, told The Hindu . Islanders angry Several islanders expressed anger at the way the patients were allegedly herded into vehicles and transported. Some said there was not a woman officer present to shift women and children. The COVID-19 situation in Minicoy has gone from bad to worse with decision taken to enforce a total lockdown for seven days from Friday. There were 205 active cases, with over 110 patients admitted to the FLTC as on Thursday. The island has had over 500 cases. Meanwhile, in its maiden meeting in Kochi on Wednesday, the Save Laksahdweep Forum decided to launch units in all islands before June 5 and to observe a 12-hour hunger strike (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) on June 7 to protest the ‘anti-island’ draft legislations being pushed by the adminisitration and seeking the immediate recall of the administrator. Thousands of people barring patients and those under treatment across the islands will take part in the hunger strike.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/overnight-shifting-of-patients-in-minicoy-draws-criticism/article34722946.ece

Neither when her husband walked out on her 20 years ago abandoning their two little daughters, nor when she donned the unconventional role of a crematorium caretaker six years later to feed her young family. Now 57, the frail-looking, but iron-willed Seleena soldiers on as she lights the funeral pyres of COVID-19 victims in Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kit at the crematorium of the Thrikkakara municipality. Immense hardships Seleena has faced immense hardships in life as a single mother to be scared by the prospect of death by a dreaded pandemic. “Fear does not feed empty stomachs or repay mounting debts,” says Seleena nonchalantly. Problem of PPE kits Her house next to the crematorium at Athani Junction, near Kakkanad, was built on a bank loan of Rs. 25 lakh, which got defaulted owing to the pandemic. Life took an even worse turn as both her sons-in-law, drivers by profession, lost their jobs in the pandemic leaving Seleena to provide for her younger daughter and family who stays with her. Amidst it came the added burden of handling the bodies of COVID-19 victims. “There have been days when I had to conduct three or four such funerals. Sometimes the families provide the PPE kit. Otherwise, I have to buy it,” she says. While she usually does not light pyres after 6 p.m. the condition does not apply to COVID victims. She has not yet faced any resentment from her neighbourhood for handling bodies of infected people though she has no guarantee that the attitude will stay unchanged. Livelihood loss But Seleena remains undaunted. She has for long ignored others’ reservations about her job. “I don’t have to convince anyone about my life. People who are so worried about my job should help me take care of my family,” has been her defiant response all along. As the municipality plans to convert the crematorium into a gas-based one, Seleena, who has been running it on an annual tender, stares at a potential loss of livelihood. But as has been her wont, she will cross that bridge on reaching there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/seleena-serves-the-dead-to-make-a-living/article34722597.ece

The petition said that agencies had all of a sudden hiked the price of medical oxygen and started demanding reimbursement under the head of “COVID mitigating expenses” and “additional handling expenses.” The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic had already landed the association members in dire straits. At a time when the private hospitals were struggling to provide affordable quality care to COVID-19 patients, the hike in the price of medical oxygen was unlawful. ‘Black marketeering’ It was nothing but black marketeering and an unethical practice. The hike would hamper the uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen. In fact, the supply of medical oxygen was critical and any unethical practice in this regard would invite punishment under provisions of the Disaster Management Act and the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, 2020. Stringent action should be taken against the suppliers. The petitioner sought a directive to the suppliers not to increase the price without sanction from the authorities under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hospitals-move-court-against-oxygen-price-hike/article34722989.ece

It is based on the finding that online mode of education seems to have widened the social-emotional deficit among students. Many students are yet to get access to digital sessions after education shifted to the online mode last year. Those who had joined class 1 last year are yet to see their teachers or classmates in the physical mode. The situation is similar for students who have joined new schools in classes 5, 8, and 11. “Nearly 33% of students could not watch digital sessions properly in the previous academic year, according to a study report published by the KSSP in October. The situation seems not to have improved and it will exacerbate the digital divide among students. Our assessment had shown lack of confidence among students who did not have access to the Internet, smart phones, and external support,” said Radhan K., general secretary, KSSP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kssp-for-phased-resumption-of-offline-classes/article34722598.ece
04 June 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Many UDF leaders to join KC(M): Mani||The political churning, stirred by the Kerala Congress (M)’s [KC(M)] tumultuous exit from the United Democratic Front (UDF) and a subsequent reconciliation with the rival front late last year, appears to be growing more disruptive in Central Travancore after the elections. Buoyed by its back-to-back successes in the local body and Assembly elections, the outfit led by Jose K. Mani is out to reshape itself as the dominant party in the region. It has launched efforts to woo a handful of leaders from the UDF, especially the Congress, who are disenchanted with the present leadership. The step comes close on the heels of another proposal by the regional party to take a transition from its mass-based structure to a cadre system. Alongside the KC(M), the Nationalist Congress Party under the former Congress leader P.C. Chacko too has begun drawing the Congress workers across Kottayam and Pathanamthitta to its fold. Confirming the move, Mr. Mani, KC(M) chairman, said here on Thursday that a long line of UDF leaders was waiting to join the party and the next meeting of the steering committee on June 14 would initiate important steps towards this direction. Expressions of interest “I have received expressions of interest from an increasing number of leaders, particularly after the Assembly elections. The district presidents have been apprised of these developments for further action,” he said. Sources said the chaos within the UDF after its below par performance in the region in the Assembly elections has provided a golden opportunity to the KC(M), which had put up a better show. The move, according to them, comes as counter to a pre-election move by the UDF to poach members of its estranged constituent. The chaotic exit of the KC(M) from the UDF had prompted a few leaders to switch sides to the rival faction led by P.J. Joseph, predictably with the support of some senior Congress leaders. Despite the early setbacks, the KC(M), by giving priority to statecraft and the pursuit of power, could overcome these challenges in the long run. The rebuttal Meanwhile, both the Congress and the UDF have refuted Mr. Mani’s claims. “By making such statements, his attempt is to mislead the public and cover up the setbacks suffered in Pala and Kaduthuruthy,” said Joshy Philip, District Congress Committee president, Kottayam. Saji Manjakadambil, chairman of the UDF committee in Kottayam, urged Mr. Mani to stop daydreaming and face the realities upfront.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/many-udf-leaders-to-join-kcm-mani/article34722991.ece

Only those having good power backup options and multiple data connections are able to attend sessions without disruptions. Though KSEB officials claimed that there were no pending works disrupting the transmission network in the rural belt, several parents complained that the annoying day-time power blackout was a reality, and that it exposed the faulty transmission system. Since many children are using wired connections with WiFi modem in their homes, power supply disruptions frequently disconnect them from the classroom, they pointed out. Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) representatives from Thamarassery taluk have already taken up the issue with the KSEB and the Education Department. Similar complaints have also come up from villages like Koorachundu, Kuttiyadi, Peruvanamoozhi, and Koodaranhi. The lack of 3G or 4G connections is also a major hurdle for those attending regular online sessions on different video-streaming platforms. For such students, teachers are preparing pre-recorded short video sessions. In some cases, children manage with their parents’ phones which are often incompatible with the high-resolution video-streaming needs. “Even college students who depend on virtual classrooms are struggling to cope with the situation. At least there should be some favourable intervention during this lockdown period,” said G. Arun, a language trainer from Thiruvambady. He pointed out that such disruptions were hardly visible in urban areas. Teachers are also facing issues while preparing daily video lessons. Live interactive sessions reportedly end up midway thanks to unexpected technical problems. Many fear that the situation will be worse during monsoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/power-outage-network-issues-hit-online-classes-in-rural-areas/article34722588.ece

They are demanding a direct financial assistance scheme either in the form of one-time allowance or short-term credit by reworking the existing relief system that focuses only on the distribution of rice. At a recent district-level meeting, they had taken up the demand with the district administration and the Fisheries Department authorities, saying that the supply of rice alone would not help underprivileged families which were struggling to cope after the outbreak of COVID-19. Many were in need of better medical support, they had said. “Only a nominal amount of Rs. 1,500 from the department’s saving-cum-relief scheme reaches the fishermen’s families as aid during the lean period. The sum will not be sufficient to buy even stationery articles for a school-going child,” said Abdul Razak, a member of the Matsya Thozhilali Federation. He added that the package should take into account the challenges of the pandemic and the steep fall in fishermen’s income.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fishers-seek-better-aid-during-trawling-ban/article34722586.ece

Responding to a volley of questions on the issue, he also criticised the police for ‘unnecessarily summoning some BJP leaders for questioning.’ “They had no connection with the case. Still, they had appeared before the investigating officers,” the BJP leader said. He said that the BJP leaders who had received summons had ‘neither approached the court nor complained of chest pain.’ They did not hinder the investigation. “The party had no idea whether the Kodakara heist was black money or white money,” Mr. Surendran said. ‘Baseless allegation’ He denied handing over Rs. 10 lakh to Janathipathya Rashtriya Sabha chief C.K. Janu during the elections.

04 June 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||No decision yet on reopening EICL unit||The resumption of operations at the Kochu Veli unit of English Indian Clays Ltd (EICL) continues to be mired in uncertainty, a full 10 months after the company management suspended operations citing losses. The grim situation, which persists amid the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, has pushed hundreds of EICL employees and their families into dire straits, say EICL employees' unions. While the unions blame the company management of apathy, the latter attributes the delay in restarting operations to the pandemic's second wave and the consequent sluggish market. The EICL employees unions have now sought the urgent intervention of the State government for getting the unit reopened. ‘Resignations sought’ The management is yet to honour the revised service and wage conditions that were agreed upon in the presence of the Labour Commissioner, the joint action council of EICL employees’ unions said in a petition to Labour Minister V. Sivankutty on Wednesday. Company officials are also pressing the employees to put in their resignation, it said. Further, the council has accused the EICL management of attempting to shift the company's operations to Bhuj, Gujarat. “The company is yet to pay the promised interim relief of Rs. 25,000 in full to the employees,” said Anil Kumar, convener of the action council. The CITU has petitioned Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Industries Minister P. Rajeeve and Mr. Sivankutty seeking their intervention to sort out the impasse, said K. Udayakumar, District Clay Workers' Union (CITU). EICL, which is part of the Thapar Group, mines kaolin (China clay) deposits in the district and processes the clay at two facilities — the main plant at Kochu Veli and a second one at Thonnakkal. Blaming mounting losses and shortage of raw material, the EICL management had “temporarily” suspended operations at the Veli and Thonnakkal units on August 10, 2020, a decision that affected the livelihood of 1,500 families. Protests The apparently abrupt decision had triggered a wave of protests, and the unions had launched an indefinite agitation outside the company gates. In October, operations were partially resumed at the Thonnakkal unit after the government issued a permission for mining, but the main unit at Veli remained shut. A senior EICL official involved in the Thiruvananthapuram operations of the company said no decision has been taken to permanently wind up the Kochu Veli unit. “We were expecting to make a comeback by June this year, but the second wave upset all our calculations. It has hit our major clients, which include the paint and paper industries. Even the Thonnakkal unit, where operations were restarted, is running at 60-70% of the capacity at present. But we are hopeful of resuming operations,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-decision-yet-on-reopening-eicl-unit/article34722988.ece
04 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||SSK: 49,000 students lack access to digital classes||There are 49,000 students in the State without digital equipment or access to digital classes, as per the preliminary data collected by Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, (SSK) recently. This comes to nearly 1% of the number of students in the State. A good number belong to Wayanad, Idukki, and Malappuram districts, say Samagra officials. Prior to the start of digital classes last year, a survey by Samagra had found that 2.6 lakh students did not have facilities for online classes. Following government intervention, it came down to around 1.25 lakh by the time the academic year kicked off on June 1. Concerted efforts by the government machinery, people’s representatives, local bodies, voluntary organisations, institutions, and individuals helped cover almost the entire student population, they say. Data collection to ascertain access to digital education this year took into account students who had access to TV, mobile phones, computer, or Net connectivity in their houses; those who attended the classes at Samagra Shiksha’s study centres and received support from education volunteers; and those who did not have digital facilities at their houses and could not access the classes in community centres because there were no centres in their vicinity or they could not reach these. Online classes However, the data collected will require further validation as class 1 admissions are not over yet. Facilities available with the class 1 students and those taking admissions to other grades will have to be looked into, officials told The Hindu . With the General Education Department planning to launch online classes to enable direct student-teacher interactions as early as next month, availability of mobile phones, computer, laptop and Internet connectivity will have to be ensured, instead of mere television. Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, has recommended that once the COVID-19 case numbers dwindle, the number of study centres it can be increased. Opening of ward-level study centres is another option.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ssk-49000-students-lack-access-to-digital-classes/article34722602.ece

Balagopal to be presented in the Assembly on Friday. Breaking the tradition of his predecessor T.M. Thomas Isaac of preparing the Budget at the seaside Inspection Bungalow at Vizhinjam, Mr. Balagopal chose the Government Guest House at Thycaud in the capital to finalise the Budget. Sticking to the core values of the 2021-2022 Budget presented by Dr. Isaac on January 15, Mr. Balagopal is expected to come up with a new COVID package to alleviate the woes of those hit by the pandemic. The Rs. 1,000 crore needed for purchase of vaccines directly from manufacturers will form part of the package. This is also expected to end the Opposition criticism that the government had failed to come up with health and disaster management plans even after two waves of COVID-19 and frequent natural disasters. The packages will be for health, micro enterprises, agriculture, industry, and tourism sectors badly hit by the pandemic. Steps to increase the income of farmers, measures to make the State self-reliant in vegetables and value-added products, houses under LIFE Mission, and rehabilitation measures for Non-Resident Keralites may find place in Budget. Upgrade of health infrastructure will also get prominence as the second wave of COVID-19 has exposed inadequacies. Projects to protect people in coastal areas from sea erosion and upgrade of facilities to digital mode in schools are expected. Although a Rs. 20,000-crore COVID package was announced by Dr. Isaac, it was mainly used to settle pending bills of contractors. Tax measures Measures for additional revenue mobilisation to contain the deficit at 4% will be rolled out without causing much hardships to citizens. A sharp reduction in GST revenue, mounting GST compensation shortfall, and revenue shortfall of Rs. 8,000 crore to Rs. 10,000 crore will force the Minister to hike taxes. Increase in fair value of land by 10%, 5 to 15% hike in fee for various government services, and hike in tax for liquor are likely.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-package-likely-in-budget/article34722948.ece

However, many participants expressed reservations in the UGC draft guidelines that recommended teaching 40% of the syllabus of each course through the online mode. Inaugurating the discussion to evolve the State’s response, Higher Education Minister R. Bindu advocated a gradual process that involved ushering in the reform in a phased manner. Pointing out blended mode of teaching provided immense possibilities, she feared its wide implementation threatened to sideline marginalised sections further. The existing digital divide coupled with the differential access to technology in urban and rural areas could push towards elitism in education, Ms. Bindu said. Stance of VCs While backing the UGC’s push for blended learning, the Vice Chancellors of universities including Kannur, Calicut, Mahatma Gandhi, Kerala Agricultural University (KAU), Cochin University of Science and Technology, and National University of Advanced Legal Studies called for restricting the learning mode to ‘on-site’ teaching. Gopinath Ravindran, Vice Chancellor of Kannur University, said blended learning could enrich the quality of education, provided it was first provided within the campuses of universities and later, colleges. Curriculum overhaul He also stressed on the need for a curriculum overhaul and steps to ensure no teacher would be laid off while ushering in online classes in a major way. M.K. Jayaraj and R. Chandra Babu, Vice Chancellors of Calicut University and KAU respectively, both called for enabling the universities to decide on the proportion of syllabi that had to be taught online. Mahatma Gandhi University Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas emphasised on the need to train teachers in techno-pedagogy before embarking on the blended mode. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University Vice Chancellor Rajasree M.S. said the change would empower and not replace teachers. The mode was a shift towards outcome-based education (OBE), she said.   ReplicateIT@School Kerala State Planning Board member B. Ekbal called for replicating theIT@Schoolproject in the field of higher education. Additional Chief Secretary (Higher Education) V. Venu said the approach could spur transformation in the State which has set its sights on becoming a knowledge economy. Teachers organisations, including AKGCT, AKPCTA and KPCTA, bemoaned the lack of a study into the effectiveness of online classes in the State. KSHEC vice chairman P.M. Rajan Gurukkal and member secretary Rajan Varughese spoke on the occasion.

Dakshina, a class 7 student of Sree Saraswathy Vidyalayam, Ooruttambalam, in Thiruvananthapuram district wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to apprise him of a problem. Dakshina lives at Aaduvally, a remote village in Kattakada taluk. Her village, she informed the Prime Minister, was situated in the midst of three hills. Classes had gone online in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, but for her and other students at Aaduvally, the lack of the Internet facility was posing a huge hurdle. The geography of the area prevented access to Net connections and mobile coverage. A residents’ association that plays an active role in the village had approached Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL) and other private mobile players several times. Finally, a private player had signed a pact with the association for erecting a mobile tower. However, no further steps had been taken by the company in this regard, she said, urging the Prime Minister to issue directions for erecting a mobile tower at Aaduvally. Clearance The regional office of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) informed Dakshina in October that as there was some delay in obtaining clearances from local authorities, the service provider had abandoned the initial site. Efforts were on to get approval for a new site and erect the tower. The authorities had contacted other service providers too. All service providers then visited the village and submitted their reports to the regional DoT office, calling for a mobile tower. Reliance Jio expressed readiness to set up the tower and acquired the site. They provided coverage by April-end. Today, Dakshina and other students are happy, for they do not have to go out to the road, or up on the terrace, or perch atop a rock trying to find a signal. “There is good connectivity in every room of my house,” she says. Earlier, attending live classes used to be difficult owing to the spotty connection. Even for downloads, she would have to climb to the top of some hill. “We used to fan out trying to find some corner where the connection was not patchy. Even then, there would only be a minute or two of good reception, and then we would start looking again,” says a relieved Dakshina.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/girls-letter-to-pm-brings-internet-to-a-kattakada-village/article34722994.ece

The Bill, presented by Health Minister Veena George, was passed without sending it to the subject committee. The Bill empowers the government to take necessary measures as well as impose regulations on public which it thinks may be necessary to stop an epidemic outbreak or even the threat of an outbreak in any part of the State. The government can ask District Collectors to use their powers to prevent the violation of these regulations and take necessary action. Under the provisions of the Bill, the government can ban any get-together, meetings, celebrations or such activities which it thinks might lead to an outbreak or spread of a disease. It empowers the government to quarantine people who may arrive in the State and close State borders ; avoid assembly of persons in public places or religious institutions; control or regulate public transport; rearrange or impose restrictions on the working of schools, offices or commercial establishments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/house-passes-kerala-epidemic-diseases-bill/article34722600.ece

The proposal, submitted by Commissioner for Entrance Examinations (CEE) A. Geetha, comes against the backdrop of education boards in the country opting for varying methods to declare the Class 12 results. Despite several States cancelling their board examinations, Kerala had chosen to go ahead with its Plus Two examinations. The government has also expedited steps to facilitate the evaluation of answer scripts on a priority basis. Both the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) scrapped the Class 12 examinations two days ago. Sources point out that results declared through a process of normalisation of marks or lenient evaluation might not become an accurate indicator of the students’ intellectual capacity. Besides, the chances of delay in declaring the results could stall the entrance examination process. Since 2011, the State has been finalising KEAM ranks on the basis of a 50:50 criterion wherein equal weightage is given to both the score obtained through the entrance and the marks obtained for Maths, Physics and Chemistry in Class 12 examinations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/keam-class-xii-marks-to-be-dropped/article34722604.ece
04 June 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||New guidelines for tackling COVID in kids||The Health Department has framed new guidelines for the management of COVID-19 in children, in anticipation that a third wave of the pandemic could manifest in a surge in paediatric cases. Paediatricians point out that in the first and the second wave, COVID had manifested only as a mild and often asymptomatic disease in children. But among those who got hospitalised, one in three required ICU care. “The absolute number of children getting COVID has gone up in the second wave but as a proportion, less than 12% got affected . Among them, the proportion of those below 10 years was 3-4%. It is rare for children to end up with acute COVID or COVID pneumonia. As for symptoms, children seemed to have diarrhoea and vomiting as main symptoms, unlike adults,” says A. Santhoshkumar, former Superintendent, SAT Hospital. However, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC), which occurs in some children three to four weeks after symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID, is a serious condition with high mortality. Early identification and treatment is critical for an optimal outcome. Most of the children with MISC might have coronary involvement and hence periodic check-ups are a must to watch out for the resolution of myocarditis or the development of any new symptoms, guidelines say. Though SAT Hospital has had some 75 cases of MISC so far, there have been no deaths. The new guidelines are about the treatment and referral protocol for acute COVID and MISC in children, including case triage and management of individual cases inside different settings, including a Paediatric ICU. Children with moderate COVID should be cared for in a taluk hospital or higher institutions. The guidelines also tell primary care physicians how to recognise and treat children with COVID. Fever lasting over five days, fast breathing or in general, if any of the symptoms worsen, children should be referred to a district hospital or above. The State has directed that special newborn care units, newborn ICUs be set up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-guidelines-for-tackling-covid-in-kids/article34722605.ece

We need a bottom-up development approach. It includes creating a people-friendly system with e-office, front office and other basic changes”. The fundamental goal of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government is to ensure land for each and every family in the State. “A time-bound plan will be ready soon to distribute maximum number of title deeds in the coming five years.” Providing documents for land is equally important as distribution of land, Mr. Rajan said. “We started the resurvey process 54 years ago. But we could complete only 54% of the work till now. The process will be speeded up using digital survey methods. The plan is to complete the work in three years.” Declaring a fight against encroachments, the Minister said his department would not give up even an inch of government land. All possible methods would be used to clear encroachments. COVID relief work In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic along with rain-related calamities, the Revenue Department is facing a huge challenge to coordinate relief works. “The department has chalked out a plan on the basis of red zones identified after the 2018 floods. An ABC programme is in place. One is for COVID-19 patients, second for those in quarantine and the third for others.” For caregivers Aswas, a project to construct a resting centre for caregivers of patients in government medical college hospitals, would start soon. The project that was announced in the previous Budget would be implemented in the Thrissur and Alappuzha Government Medical College Hospitals in the first phase. On the work on the NH 544 and Kuthiran twin tunnels, he said the Chief Minister would convene a meeting soon to put pressure on the Union government to speed up the work. “It is for the Centre to take action against the contract company which has violated all norms of the contract and breached the contract period multiple times,” Mr. Rajan said.

04 June 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala beats Karnataka in race for KSRTC||Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation has decided to explore all legal options and challenge the recent order of the Trademarks Registry, India, in favour of Kerala Road Transport Corporation to exclusively use the acronym ‘KSRTC’. Shivayogi C. Kalasad, managing director, Karnataka RTC, said they were yet to receive a copy of the order, following which all legal options would be explored. “We will make all efforts to retain our right to use the acronym,” he said. Kerala Transport Minister Antony Raju issued a statement on Wednesday stating the “KSRTC” acronym and the elephant logo were finally declared to belong to Kerala. Both the Karnataka and Kerala RTCs have been using the acronym ‘KSRTC’ for many decades now. However, Karnataka RTC registered the acronym ‘KSRTC’ and its logo with the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks in 2013. It was spurred by the success of patenting the Airavata Club Class service with the tagline “sleep like a baby”. When some of the private bus operators started using the brand name to lure passengers, the KSRTC decided to register brands such as Airavata Club Class, Rajahamsa, and others with the monogram KSRTC. There were also instances of people misusing the name of KSRTC by creating multiple websites and ticket booking sites. “This led to a lot of confusion among the general public. In 2013, we received the necessary certificates,” said a source. Karnataka RTC issued a notice to Kerala RTC asking them not to use the acronym ‘KSRTC’ as they had patented it in 2014. The Kerala RTC soon approached the Registry and the judgment in the case, favourable to Kerala, was issued recently. Kerala argued that their government has been running their fleet of buses under the acronym since 1965, while Karnataka’s bus services were named so only in 1973. The precursor to Karnataka RTC was called the Mysore Government Road Transport Department (MGRTD), formed in 1948 and renamed as Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation in 1973. Transport Minister Laxman Savadi said that unlike in private firms, the company name and logo do not affect the corporations much as both the Karnataka and Kerala RTCs were “public service enterprises”. “The Karnataka and Kerala RTCs have never competed with each other and even if Karnataka RTC continues to use the acronym KSRTC, there will be no harm done to Kerala RTC. In a federal system, States need to cooperate and resolve our differences,” he said.    ‘Use KnSRTC’   In a letter addressed to the Transport Minister, the KSRTC Staff and Workers’ Federation has suggested the State government to use the abbreviation ‘KnSRTC’. It has also asked the government not to waste money and time over litigation on the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-beats-karnataka-in-race-for-ksrtc/article34722362.ece

04 June 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. rejects charge that patients were given expired Remdesivir shots||The Government of Andhra Pradesh on Thursday rebutted reports in a section of the media that Remdesivir injections that expired in March 2021 had been administered to the patients in the Area Hospital at Narsipatnam in Visakhapatnam district. As the videos purportedly pertaining to the allegation went viral on the social media, the Assistant Director, Drug Control, Visakhapatnam, Rajitha, had clarified that the “Remdesivir injection is a new drug and that the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has initially given instructions to the manufacturer to fix the shelf life and expiry date as six months based on the stability studies submitted by the manufacturer.” “Later, the stability studies continued. And, as per the stability studies data submitted by the manufacturer, the DCGI has given permission to the manufacturer to extend the shelf life and expiry date up to 12 months,” she said. “Hence, the version that expired injections were administered is not true,” Ms. Rajitha added. Earlier, TDP national general secretary N. Lokesh had alleged a massive scam involving the Remdesivir injections. “Remdesivir injections were given to the COVID-19 patients at the government hospital at Narsipatnam in Visakhapatnam district,” he said, and alleged that the labels on these injections had been changed. What the law says As per Section 104 of the Indian Drugs and Cosmetics Act, the containers of any drug should carry labels of the respective manufacturing company only and no other label should appear on them, he said. “At Narsipatnam, the Remdesivir injection bottle carried the label of a different company and not that of Mylan’s, which is the original manufacturer. This reveals how the labels are tampered with in order to change the expiry date on the drug,” Mr. Lokesh alleged. He also demanded an inquiry to know whether the “expired” injections were given to all, or only to a few at the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-govt-rejects-charge-that-patients-were-given-expired-remdesivir-shots/article34722348.ece
04 June 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Newborn with post-COVID intestinal gangrene cured||A newborn baby diagnosed with a rare post COVID-19 complication of an intestinal gangrene due to thrombosis, was given a new lease of life at a private hospital here on Thursday. One of the rarest cases ever to be manifested in newborn babies, the prognosis is very severe and leads to death. Yerra Rajesh, paediatrician at Yerra’s Super Speciality Hospital here, said V. Karuna of Narsaraopet delivered a child on May 30. Ms. Karuna was infected with COVID-19 but a test before her delivery was negative. After birth, the baby developed symptoms like distension of abdomen, vomiting and even didn’t pass stools. The children’s specialist at Narsaraopet referred the baby to Dr. Rajesh. Clinical examination of the newborn revealed severe intestinal infection. During the course of the surgery, it was revealed that the small intestine had developed gangrene to an extent of 25 inches. Blood clots were noticed, and the small bowel was seen to have haemorrhage with a lot of blood. Since, the mother got infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy, its adverse influence had impacted even the foetus in the womb. Even though she was cured of coronavirus through medication, the foetus in the womb was affected. “This case proved that pregnant women should be careful during delivery post COVID-19. Blood clots in the brain, heart, lungs and in other blood vessels are seen in COVID positive cases. The ill-effects of the virus are being witnessed for the first time in a one-day-old baby, after the mother got infected, and even got cured before delivery. Till date, we have observed COVID symptoms in the infant rarely when the pregnant mother tested positive before delivery. After seeing the extensive damage in the infant’s abdomen now, it is certain that there is a lot more about COVID, which we do not know and which we should know,’’ said Dr. Rajesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/newborn-with-post-covid-intestinal-gangrene-cured/article34723027.ece

Citing her own experience on Thursday, the MLA said her relatives were going to Hyderabad to donate blood to her mother, who was in a critical condition in a hospital in Hyderabad. They had obtained the necessary pass from the Mulugu Collectorate and were stopped under Rachakonda police commissionerate limits and despite pleas for emergency health issues, the vehicle was not permitted. The officer had humiliated them and also used the word ‘rubbish’ to their pleas and also levied a fine, the MLA said, adding that she tried to speak to the DCP on a video call to explain the situation but the officer was arrogant and did not budge. “If this is how an MLA is treated by police one can understand how they are terrorising common people,” the MLA said in a video. Ms. Seethakka said such ‘inhuman and arrogant’ behaviour of the police officers would endanger the lives of people in health emergencies. She said only after the DCP left the place did another police officer understand the gravity of the situation watching the video call recording of the MLA’s mother on ventilator and permitted the vehicle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/malkajgiri-dcp-harsh-inhuman-seethakka/article34722918.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has requested all the Chief Ministers in the country to urge the Centre, in one voice, to take charge and responsibility of the vaccination drive. “We had gone for a global tender to procure the vaccines directly to vaccinate everybody free of cost. But to my dismay, no one quoted and the reasons being the situation now being transformed into States Vs Union and also the approving authority being Govt. of India, procurement of vaccines is no longer in our control. Any delay in vaccinating the people would come at a heavy price,” Mr. Jagan wrote, according to the letter released by the Chief Minister's Office. “I request that as Chief Ministers, we speak in a single voice and urge the Govt. of India to take charge and responsibility of the vaccination drive, the way it happened in the early part of the year. The timely vaccination of medical staff yielded great results. The need of the hour is to increase our vaccine availability. A centralised and coordinated vaccination supported by the States would lead to wonderful results for the people of India. I would urge you to lend your support and we as CMs speak in one voice and ensure that India overcomes this pandemic," Mr. Jagan said in the letter. The State government floated a global tender on May 13 and gave four weeks for manufacturers to submit bids. However, there was no response even though three companies took part in the pre-bid meeting held on May 20, said Health, Medical and Family Welfare Principal Secretary Anil Kumar Singhal, at a press conference on Thursday. Bidding date extended The State government, however, would extend the bid submission date by two weeks even though there was little hope for response, he said. Mr. Singhal further said that States such as Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Telangana, Odisha, Kerala and Tamil Nadu floated global tenders, but none of them received a response. Some of the State have extended the last date for bid submission multiple times and some of them cancelled the tender call, while a few were scheduled to close tenders in a day or two, said Mr. Singhal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ask-centre-to-take-responsibility-of-vaccination-jagan-urges-cms/article34723022.ece
04 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||State govt. failed in paddy procurement: Somu Veerraju||BJP State president Somu Veerraju has said the government has failed in eliminating middlemen in the agriculture sector and in procuring paddy in time from farmers at remunerative prices. The YSRCP government could not match its words with deeds when it comes to giving subsidy to farmers under the mechanisation schemes and implementing the micro-irrigation project, he has added. Addressing mediapersons here on Thursday, Mr. Veerraju said the government targeted to purchase 45 lakh tonnes of paddy this year but could procure only 21 lakh costing Rs. 3,990 crore. Even payments for the grains purchased were getting delayed. Farmers were resorting to distress sale for various compelling reasons, he said. The farmers in Rayalaseema who were largely dependent on micro-irrigation were left in the lurch as the government could not supply water to even a single acre in the last two years. Bills raised by companies which supplied the micro-irrigation equipment had been pending for more than two years, Mr. Veerraju pointed out.. ‘Undue credit’ Mr. Veerraju objected to the State government portraying the housing project taken up under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) as its own scheme. He insisted that it was a Central scheme for which the State was taking undue credit. The Central government was giving a subsidy of Rs. 1.80 lakh per unit under PMAY. “Unfortunately, the State government named the project as YSR Jagananna Colonies devoid of the images of the Prime Minister on the publicity material. If the PM’s photos are not displayed, then the BJP will do it,” he warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-govt-failed-in-paddy-procurement-somu-veerraju/article34723024.ece

The government also told the court that a COVID instant order had been issued regarding the protocol for admission and treatment of the black fungus cases, for which 19 hospitals were notified. The number of such hospitals was being increased, depending on the requirement, it said. Besides, in anticipation of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government had constituted a task force committee to look into infrastructure availability, training of nurses and paramedical staff, and paediatric care. Through the instant order, the hospitals had been told to obtain counter signatures of the nodal officers on bills issued to the patients for the sake of verification.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/black-fungus-cases-injections-allocated-by-centre-insufficient/article34723031.ece
04 June 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||UTF against converting primary schools into Foundation Schools||Leaders of the Andhra Pradesh United Teachers' Federation (UTF) on Thursday said they were opposed to the government proposal to convert the 34,000 primary schools in the State into Foundation Schools. In a statement, federation’s State president N. Venkateswarlu and general secretary K.S.S. Prasad said primary schools would cease to exist in the State due to the policies being introduced by the government “in the name of reforms”. They said the plan was to reduce the number of schools under the purview of the Education Department from 45,000 to mere 11,000 and curtail expenditure. They said to impart quality education to students, there was a need to strengthen primary schools, especially in the rural sector. The leaders welcomed the introduction of pre-primary schools in the government sector, but said they were opposed to merger of Classes 3,4 and 5 in the High School. Pointing to the fact that not all regions in the State had Upper Primary and High Schools located at a distance of 3 km, they said in Agency areas, students travelled a distance of more than 5 km to go to school. At such places, parents may not like to send their children to school, which in turn, would contribute to school drop-out rate and there was a likelihood of girls staying away from school. The leaders said the government proposal was not only against the spirit of the Right to Education law but was also not in adherence to the National Education Policy. Stating that such decisions would weaken the primary education system, they said no other State in the country had such policy. They found fault with the government taking such key decision without discussing the issue with intellectuals, teacher MLCs and parents and demanded that a decision be taken only after holding comprehensive discussions on it. Opposing the proposal to bring the Foundation schools under the purview of Societies or Projects, they demanded that all schools be allowed to function under the School Education Department. Their other demands included introduction of pre-primary education in the primary education sector and withdrawal of the plan to divide the primary education into two sections. Immediate measures to strengthen the primary education sector, establishment of a primary school with all facilities in every gram panchayat and steps to fill vacant teacher posts are their other demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/utf-against-converting-primary-schools-into-foundation-schools/article34722403.ece

Chandrababu Naidu has said the State government has become unpopular in the first two years of its rule. Rampant corruption, massive irregularities in all the schemes and programmes have dispelled the notions which the people have. Housing scheme was not beneficial, and thousands of crores were plundered in the Nadu Nedu programme, he said. Addressing a meeting of party parliamentary and Assembly incharges and mandal party presidents on Thursday, Mr. Naidu claimed that there was a rising discontent and disappointment among the people. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had talked about constructing houses for the poor by spending Rs. 50,000 crore. However, just Rs. 5,000 crore was provided for housing in the recent budget. Mr. Jagan promised to build 5 lakh houses each year, but his regime did not build a single house in the last two years, he alleged. The former Chief Minister pointed out that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin ushered in good governance by continuing ‘Amma Canteens’, while Mr. Jagan has closed down Anna Canteens opened by the previous TDP government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/people-unhappy-with-ysrcp-naidu/article34723029.ece

04 June 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rise in black fungus cases sparks worry||A steady increase in cases of mucormycosis (popularly known as Black Fungus) and an alleged shortage of Amphotericin-B and Posaconazole injections is causing anxiety among patients and their relatives. The number of mucormycosis patients, which stood at 35 at King George Hospital (KGH), on May 25, has more than doubled, and the number of total cases (including those at private hospitals) in Visakhapatnam crossed the 100-mark in less than 10 days. District authorities have increased the number of beds to ensure that there is no shortage, even if there is a 10-fold increase in the number of cases. “A total of 1,000 beds have been kept ready at various hospitals in the city to accommodate the growing number of patients being diagnosed with Black Fungus. The Amphotericin-B injections are being supplied to the States by the Centre. We are making all-out efforts to ensure that there is no shortage of injections,” district in-charge Minister Kurasala Kannababu told The Hindu over phone. Collector V. Vinay Chand said that the treatment protocol was worked out for optimum usage of the available drugs. While patients with severe problems would be given intravenous injections, those with mild or moderate symptoms would be treated with tablets. A total of six patients have died and 113 were undergoing treatment for mucormycosis as on June 2 in Visakhapatnam. “Swelling of eyelids (one side), redness, blurring and fall in vision are some of the symptoms. Pain in and around the eye should be taken seriously by patients recovering from COVID,” says Dr. G. Hanumantha Rao, Professor and HOD of Ophthalmology, Maharaja Institute of Medical Sciences (MIMS) at Vizianagaram. “COVID-19 Associated Murcormycosis (CAM) can be treated with Liposomal Amphotericin B or Posaconazole injections. Injections should be used in the first phase, followed by oral formulations,” says Dr. Veluri Gayathri, Professor of Microbiology, NRI Institute of Medical Sciences. “COVID-19 patients with poor blood glucose control, high dose or prolonged usage of steroids and those with high levels of blood ‘ferritin’ are vulnerable to CAM,” she says. “The high prevalence of fungal infection in post-COVID patients is due to indiscriminate use of steroids and antibiotics for COVID treatment, prophylactic use of antifungals and contamination of nasal prongs and pipelines used for oxygen supply,” says Dr. S.K.E. Appa Rao, ENT surgeon and former president of Indian Society of Otology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rise-in-black-fungus-cases-sparks-worry/article34723038.ece

Of the total population of 4.95 crore, almost 1.25 crore people will be having their own house. New villages and towns will be emerging with these layouts. . Unlike in the past, the current government is building each house in a 340 square feet area with a bedroom, hall, kitchen, bathroom and porch. Each house is provided with two fans, two tube lights, four bulbs, and a Sintex tank and the house would later become an asset worth worth Rs. 5-15 lakhs for each beneficiary,’’ said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Stating that the State government had given three options to the beneficiaries, and made it clear that the beneficiary can make his own decision. In the first option, the government would supply the construction materials to build the house and would pay for the labour charges, where the beneficiaries could build the house on their own. In the second option, beneficiaries could bring the construction materials themselves and build a house as per their interests. The government would pay to the beneficiaries in a phased manner . In the third , the government would build the house . He said any left out eligible person could apply and houses would be sanctioned within 90 days after verification. It was unfortunate that 3.74 lakh beneficiaries were being left out from this programme due owing to pending cases in courts, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/work-on-construction-of-156-lakh-houses-begins/article34723019.ece

A few days ago she lost her husband Krishna Yadav, working in electricity department to Coronavirus even after being treated in two hospitals for more than a week and spending about Rs. 6 lakh. She has to look after her two children Mahesh and Tanu Sri aged about 14 and seven respectively. Her mother-in-law has not yet come out of the shock from the loss of her son and she was not even speaking properly with family members. B. Anitha is a resident of Almaipet village in Chotkur mandal. Her husband B. Devaiah, working in a private firm as salesman, died of COVID. She is survived by two children – Ashvitha and Ujawala — aged about 10 years and six months respectively. She does not know how to come out of the crisis being faced by her. On Wednesday, these families had a few guests who came to their rescue. Knowing about the fate of the families, which was reported in media, Komanapally Arpitha, her husband Benjiman, Dr. P. Sudhakar Naik, working as an Income Tax officer, and Dr. Suresh Kumar came all the way from Hyderabad to help these families.

04 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||143 children orphaned by COVID||COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed a large number of people in their productive age, especially during its second wave, has also left many children without parental protection. Several instances have come to light where the virus has claimed both the parents, leaving the children anchor-less. A great number of children have also been left with a single parent. A recent survey conducted by the Women Development and Child Welfare department has identified a total of 143 children who have been orphaned by the COVID-19pandemic. Over 30 children lost both parents to the pandemic, while the remaining lost the single parent they had been left with after death of another. Details about children left with single parent are being collected. The survey, conducted on the directions of the Supreme Court, had gathered information from the ground through Anganwadi teachers in every habitation. Besides, information also came in from District Child Protection Units where the orphan children were brought, and from the help desk set up for the purpose. “Data was also gathered from media reports. Still, we are not sure this is the absolute figure, as children from middle, upper middle classes and the rich may have escaped our survey,” an official informed. The affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court has also delineated all the measures being taken to ensure protection of the children. “Most of the children have been taken in by their close relatives. Institutionalising of the children should be the last measure, hence we are only looking for ways to ensure protection for the children in terms of health, education and general well-being,” the official said. The department is ensuring implementation of an earlier order wherein 3% reservation is provided for orphan children in all elite government residential schools. Efforts are on to secure their enrolment without entrance examination, and a meeting had been conducted in January with all the departments concerned towards this end. A prestigious group of Christian educational institutions has come forward to provide free education to all the children orphaned by COVID-19 within GHMC limits, sources informed. Instructions have been issued to facilitate admission of girl children into Durgabai Deshmmukh Women’s Technical and Training Institute for polytechnic engineering courses. The health insurance coverage already available for orphan children under Aarogyasri will be extended to these children too. A letter has been addressed by the Commissioner, Women Development & Child Welfare to the State Legal Services Authority for providing legal support to the children towards ensuring property rights. As an immediate measure, groceries with nutritious food items are being provided for the children for two months. Besides, a sponsorship of Rs. 2,000 per month is being given for each orphan under guardian care, under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme. All the children above 10 years of age are being given mobile phones with basic features with the contacts of Child Welfare Officers, DCPOs and Dial 100 preloaded, so that they could contact the officials in case of any abuse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/143-children-orphaned-by-covid/article34722908.ece
04 June 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Why will ryots voluntarily give up land?’||Expressing bewilderment over the contentions of the State government that four farmers “voluntarily relinquished rights over their lands” in Siddipet district, Telangana High Court on Thursday sought to know what compensation would be offered to them. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy wondered why would a poor farmer voluntarily forego rights over his land, after Special Government Pleader Harinder Pershad said the farmers came forward to give away the land. The farmers were given assigned pattas over six acres of agriculture land in different survey numbers of Kondapaka mandal in Siddipet district in late 80s. A year ago revenue authorities told the farmers that the land was allotted to others and hence they had to evacuate it. Challenging this, they moved the HC. A single judge passed an order declaring that the farmers had no rights on the said land since they voluntarily gave up their rights over it. Questioning the single judge order, the farmers filed an appeal before the bench led by the CJ. During the arguments, the SGP reiterated that the petitioners on their own relinquished their rights over the land on which government’s double bedroom project was taken up. “Why would anyone voluntarily forego rights over his land? Did it happen in any part of the country? It was unheard of..” observed Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy. The CJ sought to know if the government was ready to offer any compensation to the ryots even if they relinquished rights over the lands voluntarily. The SGP said the government was ready to pay the cost of the land to the farmers. But was the government ready to pay the market rate of the land to the farmers, the bench asked. Taking into consideration the SGP’s contentions, the bench directed the district Collector to hold consultations with the farmers on June 10 over the compensation to be paid. The matter was posted to June 21 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-will-ryots-voluntarily-give-up-land/article34722912.ece
04 June 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Eatala may quit Assembly today||Aggression after resignation is likely to be the strategy of rebel TRS MLA and former Minister Eatala Rajender who is likely to announce his resignation from the Assembly on Friday. Back from New Delhi after meeting senior leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with an assurance that it would back him totally in his fight, Mr. Rajender has called a press conference on Friday morning to spell out his future course of action. Sources said the press conference itself would be a hot affair where he would throw the gauntlet to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to send a strong message that he would not be cowed down by the cases. He would then tour his Huzurabad constituency to meet his followers. Hesitation Mr. Rajender till recently had preferred to let the TRS take action against him rather than his resigning himself. His intentions were to use the anti-defection law and continue as MLA if the TRS party suspended him or dismissed him as MLA citing anti-party activities with the help of the Speaker. Mr. Rajender was hoping that KCR would strip him of the MLA post forcing the Speaker to take action citing anti-party activities. The Speaker would have got sufficient grounds like the MLA confabulating with the BJP leadership in New Delhi and media reporting it extensively. If he was dismissed as MLA for anti-party activities Mr. Rajender wanted to open the legal option getting a stay order for sometime and stall the election in Huzurabad. “He would have an opportunity to stall the election till the court gave its verdict,” one of his followers argued. The TRS, however, preferred to wait and watch the next move of the MLA as it had strong belief that Mr. Rajender was fast losing ground, particularly after he started meeting leaders of various political parties. “Those meetings only reflected his nervousness rather than his defiance and guts to take on our leadership,” a TRS leader wishing anonymity claimed. Emboldened by BJP After considering all the options and the BJP leadership too apparently suggesting that he resign and fight, Mr. Rajender has now decided to cut his connections totally with the party he had sailed with for nearly two decades as MLA and Minister. “His plan for the next few months is to build a BC movement against KCR raking up his ill-treatment.” About who would contest if and when the by-election is forced, his plans are still unclear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/eatala-may-quit-assembly-today/article34722922.ece

This amount was released to him to construct a house. The SGP told a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B.

Paediatricians from government hospitals and specialists from corporate hospitals have stressed that currently, there is no surge in COVID paediatric cases or indications of it, and that children have been relatively less affected. Chief paediatrician and neonatologist at Medicover Woman and Child Hospitals Dr. Ravinder Reddy Parige said that children have been relatively less affected so far due to several factors. “The most important reason is the lesser expression of specific receptors to which this virus binds to enter the host and also their immune system. A very small percentage of infected children may develop moderate-severe disease,” he said. He said that hospitals have to be ready to attend significantly more number of patients seeking consultations, arrange more COVID wards for children with more special units such as high-dependency units (HDU) and ICUs.

Aparna said that arrangements include ICU facilities, more ventilators, and breathing support.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hospitals-gear-up-for-more-covid-paediatric-cases/article34722899.ece

Paddy is getting damaged and it has already started sprouting. We will suffer big loss,” said some farmers of Ramayampet, Nizampet and other mandals of Medak district. Farmers from several mandals of Pullur have made similar allegations. In Khammam district also, rain lashed many parts on Thursday drenching the unsold harvested paddy stored in open fields of farmers in Mudigonda, Chintakani and several other mandals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rain-damages-paddy/article34722924.ece
04 June 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi govt. preparing for 45K daily cases during third wave||The Delhi government is currently considering four scenarios for a possible third wave of COVID-19 in the city. Alarmingly, in one of the scenarios, the daily new cases could be as high as 45,432, as per an official report seen by The Hindu . In the first scenario, the daily new cases could be as high as 28,395, which is the same as the second wave. In the second scenario, it could be 36,914, which is 30% more than the second wave. According to the third estimate, the number shoots to 45,432, which is 60% more. The fourth projection offers a bit of respite, with the case count expected to be around 15,000. The government is also making plans for oxygen arrangements for each of these scenarios. The scenarios are based on a report submitted to the Delhi government by the IIT-Delhi. “These are preliminary estimates. The Delhi government has asked IIT-Kanpur  to form a team, including epidemiologists and other experts, to come up with more accurate predictions of when the third wave could hit the city and how high the cases could be. But it will take more time for them to submit a report,” a Delhi government source said. The Delhi government will be giving the city’s data including, cases and vaccination, to IIT-Kanpur to come up with the prediction, the source said. Only nine of the 58 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants have been made operational in Delhi government hospitals so far, as per the report. This shows the government has missed the previous deadline given by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal that 44 plants should be operationalised before May 31. On April 27, he had said that 44 oxygen plants will be installed in a month at hospitals in the city. “After installing these 44 plants in different hospitals, oxygen supply will improve,” Mr. Kejriwal had said. Work in progress The city had faced a grave oxygen shortage during the second wave, which led to several deaths due to hospitals running out of oxygen. When contacted, a Delhi government spokesperson said: “So far, 20 plants have already been installed in a mission mode within a month and another 10 will be installed next week”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-govt-preparing-for-45k-daily-cases-during-third-wave/article34722885.ece

The test positivity rate (TPR) fell to 0.61%, which means that less than one person out of 100 taking COVID-19 tests is now positive. The TPR was 0.78% on Wednesday and this is the fourth consecutive day that the figures are below 1%. At the same time, 45 deaths were reported and the death toll stood at 24,447.Of the total cases, 13,94,731 people have recovered and there are 8,748 active cases. Vaccines for youngsters Delhi has been facing a shortage of vaccines and free vaccination for the 18-44 age group has not been happening in government schools for over about 11 days now, as per an official bulletin. “The Central government has not been sending vaccines for more than 10 days. If youngsters want to get vaccinated, they have only one option, which is to go to private hospitals. Those vaccines are administered for Rs. 800, Rs. 900, Rs. 1,000, Rs. 1,250 and Rs. 1,400 by private hospitals,” AAP leader Atishi said. She said it is a matter of great concern for Delhi because the last wave had some serious effects on the youngsters. “It is our request to the Central government that instead of sending the vaccines to private hospitals, they make the vaccines available to the Delhi government,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/capital-sees-487-virus-infections-out-of-80046-tests-45-deaths/article34722888.ece
04 June 2021||New Delhi,||Sisodia slams Centre over vaccine shortage||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday hit out at the Central government over the vaccine shortage in the city and alleged that the BJP is giving vaccines to private hospitals instead of government centres. “The BJP is responsible for closures of government vaccination centres, while private hospitals continue to receive vaccines, for which citizens have to pay for. The BJP is using the backdoor to provide vaccines to private hospitals, while government centres with free vaccines face scarcity. Not one State right now has free vaccines to inoculate citizens,” Mr. Sisodia said. Answerable to nation The AAP Minister said that the “nation needs to know” what happened to the Rs. 36,000 crore earmarked for vaccination. He said that it has been eight months since the vaccine was developed in India and the country is still facing a huge shortage. “If BJP spokespersons are calling for press conferences to sling mud on Mr. Kejriwal, it means that the BJP-led Central government has neither a plan or a mission to fight against COVID-19. They don’t have the vision or purpose for better COVID-19 management. The BJP needs to accept that it has grossly mismanaged the vaccine plan in India,” he said. Mr. Sisodia claimed that the BJP still has no plan and they are playing “petty politics”. “At the press conference conducted by Sambit Patra, I noticed that for a good 15-20 minutes, [Sambit] Patra just indulged in continuous mudslinging and attacking CM Arvind Kejriwal ji. What is even more astonishing is that it seems like Mr. Patra had no interest in speaking about vaccination in the nation or COVID-19 management or even preparing for a third wave,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sisodia-slams-centre-over-vaccine-shortage/article34722883.ece

Delhi Mahila Congress chief Amrita Dhawan said instead of focusing its time and effort on ensuring home delivery of ration or oxygen, the government was trying to earn money by allowing home delivery of liquor. She added that families in Delhi had just gone through a tough time due to COVID-19 and were asking about ration, vaccines and medicine while the government was concentrating on liquor. “I believe that alcohol can give a personal pleasure for a minute but it ruins families and has an adverse impact on women and children. The govt. should focus on providing home delivery of life-saving medication and ration instead,” Ms. Dhawan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/campaign-against-home-delivery-of-liquor-begins/article34722880.ece

04 June 2021||GURUGRAM,||Oxygen centre vandalised, alleges NGO running it||An oxygen centre run by Hemkunt Foundation, an NGO, in Sector 61 here was allegedly vandalised on Thursday. The organisation claimed that the men of the tent house owner, who had rented them the place, were behind the incident. SDM (Badshahpur) Satish Yadav said the NGO had entered into a “verbal” agreement with the tent house owner for the place to run the oxygen plant, but the former now demanded that his place be vacated since there were hardly any COVID patients visiting the facility. “The tent house owner had on Wednesday asked the NGO to vacate the place. On Thursday, the men of the tent house owner came and took away their generator sets and curtains. The tent house owner alleged that there were no patients at the facility and the place was being used for storage purposes,” said Mr. Yadav, who visited the place with the local SHO. He said the NGO was allowed 48 hours to vacate the place and the police were told to look into the allegations. Harteerath Singh, Community Development Director, said the NGO had a “verbal” agreement with the “Rama Tent House” to use their place for running an oxygen centre for two months and they had paid Rs. 3.5 lakh for it. “...around two dozen CCTV cameras also went off due to power disconnection. They then vandalised the place. At least one of them was armed,” alleged Mr. Singh. He blamed “political hand” behind the incident. He said a formal complaint would be lodged with the police in this connection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/oxygen-centre-vandalised-alleges-ngo-running-it/article34722561.ece
04 June 2021||Mumbai,||Pankaja continues to give BJP the cold shoulder||On his seventh death anniversary, former Union Minister late Gopinath Munde has become a rallying point for the BJP in Maharashtra to restrategise itself around the sensitive issues of Maratha reservation and political reservation for the OBCs in local civic bodies, which were scrapped by the Supreme Court in its verdicts in two different cases. However, his daughter and former State Women and Child Welfare Minister Pankaja Munde-Palve, in an address to her followers on Thursday in Beed district, chose to give the cold shoulder to the leadership by announcing her decision to reach out to every village to connect with people individually on the two issues and the State government’s mismanagement in handling COVID-19 issues. She even appealed to people to write as many letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office as possible highlighting the reservation issues. “Send so many letters that Prime Minister would mention that in his next Mann ki Baat,” she said. Postal envelope released At the national level, the BJP held a special programme attended by party president J.P. Nadda where he launched a Rs. 5 postal envelope in the memory of one of the tallest OBC leaders in Maharashtra. Munde died in a car accident in Delhi, days after he became Union Minister in 2014. “Gopinath Munde was a mass leader who was rooted to the ground. He was the voice of the poor, Dalits and backward classes at the national level. He was a farmer politician. He was a leader of the bahujan class in true sense,” said Mr. Nadda, recalling how he worked for them resulting in the party’s growth in the State. Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis raised the issue of the Supreme Court scrapping political reservation for the OBCs in local civic bodies saying had Munde been alive, he would not have let such injustice to the OBCs take place. However, the shower of praises on Munde seems to have broken very little ice with Ms. Munde who has been maintaining distance from the State BJP leadership since her defeat in the 2019 Assembly polls at the hands of her estranged cousin and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dhananjay Munde. Though she attacked the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over its failures in handling the pandemic and delivering justice to the Maratha and the OBC communities, she remained conspicuously mute about the State BJP. On the contrary, she presented herself as the one who will be sharpening the Opposition attack. “I am going to go out in every village in Maharashtra to meet people. Let’s fill the Shivaji Park [ground in central Mumbai], but not for political gains but to ensure justice to the community,” she said, reminding all about how her father who fought for the OBCs always stood for reservation to Marathas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pankaja-continues-to-give-bjp-the-cold-shoulder/article34722549.ece

04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Porters burdened by the absence of passengers||On a hot and sunny afternoon in Delhi, when a handful of passengers made their way into the New Delhi railway station, a group of porters thronged them. Near an auto with a passenger with some luggage, were standing several porters in the hope that one of them will get work. “What to do? Nobody comes looking for us anymore. We have to run behind them,” said 43-year-old Mahesh Meena, a porter for 36 years now. Most porters working at the railway station are from Rajasthan and reside in Paharganj — where the rent for accommodation is higher than parts of the city — because it’s closer to their workplace. Most of them have to pay anything between Rs. 4,000-Rs. 5,000, an expense they are barely able to manage for two months now. Living in single room accomodation, their families back in villages waiting for them to send money every two-four week. “Earlier, we were able to save Rs. 500-Rs. 600 but now that amount has come down to Rs. 100-Rs. 150 because there are hardly any passengers due to the pandemic. Also,most passengers don’t prefer hiring us because of the fear of the virus,” Mr. Mahesh said, adding that he has a family of five dependent on him. Sitting idle for the hour and a half, Virender Singh (30) shared that the amount they charge is Rs. 100 for 40 kg but these days, they settle for Rs. 60-Rs. 80 for the same weight. “We ask less as there is no work...we have to accept whatever the passenger wishes to pay because nobody wants to sleep on an empty stomach,” he said. Hari (35), a porter for the last 12 years, said they all arrive at the station at around 3 a.m. and work till 6 p.m. For him, managing the rent has become an issue. Not just rent, there are water and electricity bills as well that need to be managed. Most importantly, we have to send money back home every few days with someone who is going to the village,” he said. Helping others The porters claimed that there are times when they help people, who are in need. Hari recalled helping a girl taking “Gareeb Rath” train home. He said he had packed all her stuff to finally go home as she couldn’t afford to stay in the city anymore. “She had eight pieces of luggage and told us that she had no money. Two of us helped her. We are all in the same boat after all,” he added. They said they are all managing ration on credit from local grocery stores as owners have known them for years. “At least in the last lockdown, food wasn’t much of a concern because it was being provided by the government,” said Om Prakash Meena, a porter for six years. Reminiscing “good old days”, Mr. Mahesh said he never looked to do anything else because he was earning a decent amount at the job. “ Accha khana peena tha, koi tension nai thi. Gareeb they lekin itne nahin p [We were eating and drinking good. We were poor but not so much],” he said. Porters miss Yadav Criticising the Central government, they said they miss RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav — former Railways Minister — who offered jobs to porters as gangmen. “This government has ruined us all. Lalu ji should have been here,” said Basant Lal (54).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/porters-burdened-by-the-absence-of-passengers/article34722558.ece

04 June 2021||Tel Aviv,||Israel coalition reaches deal to form govt.||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opponents pushed on Thursday for a quick Parliament vote to formally end his lengthy rule, hoping to head off any last-minute attempts to derail their newly announced coalition government. The latest political manoeuvring began just hours after opposition leader Yair Lapid and his main coalition partner, Naftali Bennett, declared they had reached a deal to form a new government and muster a majority in the 120-member Knesset, or Parliament. The coalition consists of eight parties from across the political spectrum with little in common except the shared goal of toppling Mr. Netanyahu after a record-setting 12 years in power. The alliance includes hardliners previously allied with Mr. Netanyahu, as well as centre-left parties and even an Arab faction — a first in Israeli politics. Mr. Netanyahu lashed out at his foes on Thursday, signalling that he will continue to exert pressure on former allies who joined the coalition. “All members of Knesset who were elected with right-wing votes need to oppose this dangerous leftist government,” he wrote on Twitter. The drama riveted Israelis at a time when tumult has not been in short supply: four inconclusive elections in two years followed by an 11-day war in the Gaza Strip last month that was accompanied by mob violence between Jews and Arabs in cities across the country. The country also is emerging from the coronavirus crisis that caused deep economic damage and exposed tensions between the secular majority and the ultra-Orthodox minority. Yet the political debate has focused squarely on Mr. Netanyahu, who is facing corruption charges — and whether he should stay or go. The anti-Netanyahu bloc announced the coalition deal just before a deadline at midnight Wednesday. The agreement triggered a complex process that is likely to stretch over the next week. The coalition has a razor-thin majority of 61 votes in Parliament. Now the question is whether the group’s votes will hold together in order to name a new Parliament Speaker, who would then preside over a vote required to confirm the new government. If the group can’t manage that, the current Speaker, who is a Netanyahu ally, could use his position to delay the vote and give Mr. Netanyahu more time to sabotage the coalition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-coalition-reaches-deal-to-form-govt/article34722287.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||What’s next for Benjamin Netanyahu?||Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest serving Prime Minister, may finally be on his way-out. Eight political parties, from the rightwing Yamina to the Arab-majority Ra’am (United Arab List), have come together to form a new coalition, which, if proves majority in the Knesset, could oust Mr. Netanyahu, who has been in power since 2009. Why a new coalition? Israel saw four national elections in the past two years. In all these elections, no party won a majority on its own. After the March 2020 polls, Mr. Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party joined hands with Benny Gantz’s centrist Blue and White to form a unity government. But the coalition did not last long. In December, the government collapsed after the Knesset failed to pass the annual budget. In the March 2021 election, the voters gave another split verdict. Likud emerged as the biggest party with 30 seats out of the 120-member Knesset, but failed to form a coalition with the support of 61 lawmakers — the majority-mark. After Mr. Netanyahu’s failure to form the government, President Reuven Rivlin invited Yair Lapid, leader of Yesh Atid, which is the second largest party in the current Knesset with 17 members, to form the government. It’s Mr. Lapid who put together the ‘change’ coalition. Who are its members? In 2020, Mr. Lapid’s Yesh Atid fought the elections as part of the Blue and White coalition. But when Blue and White leader Mr. Gantz decided to join Mr. Netanyahu’s unity government, Mr. Lapid parted ways. He was the Opposition leader in the previous Knesset. Now, Mr. Lapid and Mr. Gantz have come together again. Their parties together have 25 MKs (Members of Knesset). Six other parties have also joined them — the rightwing Yamina (7 MKs), centre-right New Hope (6 MKs); centre-left Meretz (6MKs) and Labour (7 MKs); secular right Yisrael Beiteinu (7 MKs); and Arab Ra’am (4 MKs). The eight-party coalition has 62 MKs among themselves. But one of Yamina MKs, Amichai Chikli, has already said he would not support the coalition. That has left the coalition with a razor-thin majority of one seat. What happens next? According to the coalition agreement, Yamina leader Naftali Bennet, who was earlier with the far-right-religious Jewish Home party, could be the next Prime Minister. Mr. Bennet, a kippa-wearing politician who is opposed to the creation of an independent Palestinian state, could be the first leader forming a government with support from an Arab party in Israel’s history. Mr. Bennet, according to the coalition pact, could remain the Prime Minister for two years and then Mr. Lapid will get the top job. But the coalition has hardly anything in common but their goal to see Mr. Netanyahu go. So it has to be seen how long the coalition will last. By signing the unity agreements, Mr. Lapid, the architect of the coalition, has passed the first test. But the next is the most important one — to win the confidence of the Knesset. The current Knesset Speaker is Likud’s Yariv Levin. Mr. Lapid has accused him of delaying the vote so that Mr. Netanyahu will have more time to try to persuade rightwing MKs (of Yamina and New Hope) to vote against the Bennet-Lapid government. One Yamina MK has already revolted against Mr. Bennet’s decision. Another one, Nir Orbach, has expressed his doubts about the coalition. If he switches sides, the coalition won’t have a majority. But two members of the Joint List (another Arab platform that has 6 MKs) are undecided how to vote. If they vote for the ‘change’ government, it could sail through despite the rebellion within Yamina. Uncertainty ahead For Mr. Netanyahu, the best outcome would Mr. Bennet failing to prove majority in the Knesset. The country would then move into another round of elections, and he could stay in power until the next government is formed — which could be months away. Being in power would also offer some immunity to Mr. Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption. If ousted, he could remain the Opposition leader. But Mr. Netanyahu’s repeated failures to form a stable government have shaken his hold over Likud. Out of power, he could face leadership challenges within the party. In 2019, Gideon Saar had unsuccessfully challenged him for Likud’s leadership. It may be too early to write Mr. Netanyahu off.

Singapore-registered MV X-Press Pearl , carrying chemicals and plastic, has been in news since a fire incident on May 20 and subsequent explosion aboard, following which tonnes of plastic pellet deposits were found deposited along the country’s beaches. The country’s Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), which termed the incident one of Sri Lanka’s worst ecological disasters in history, has readied oil spill containment booms, to tackle a possible leak from the vessel that officials said carried 350 tonnes of oil in its fuel tanks. “There is no oil leak from the ship yet, but arrangements are in place to deal with a possible spill. That is the worst-case scenario,” Navy spokesperson Indika de Silva said. Meanwhile, several coastal villages reported dead fish and other marine organisms by the shore, images of which went viral on social media. The ship’s crew was evacuated last week, while the fire was fully extinguished on Tuesday, by the Sri Lankan Navy, along with experts from a Dutch salvage company and the Indian Coast Guard, after a 13-day battle with the raging flames. Sri Lanka police are investigating the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-braces-for-oil-spill-from-sinking-cargo-vessel/article34722281.ece
04 June 2021||Washington,||Modi, Harris discuss nitty-gritty of U.S. offer on vaccine doses||Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on the phone with U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris on Wednesday to discuss the U.S. announcement of how it would share the first tranche of 25 million vaccine doses out of the 80 million doses it has committed to sharing by the end of June. It is not yet clear what the specific allocation for India will be. “Spoke to@VPKamala Harris a short while ago. I deeply appreciate the assurance of vaccine supplies to India as part of the US Strategy for Global Vaccine Sharing. I also thanked her for the all the support and solidarity from the U.S. government, businesses and Indian diaspora [sic],” Mr. Modi tweeted. “We also discussed ongoing efforts to further strengthen India-U.S. vaccine cooperation, and the potential of our partnership to contribute to post-COVID global health and economic recovery,” the Prime Minister said. A government readout of the call said Mr. Modi had discussed strengthening the health supply chain, including in vaccine manufacturing. They also discussed the Quad vaccine partnership, which aims to manufacture, in India, at least 1 billion vaccine doses (mostly Johnson and Johnson) by the end of 2022, for supply across Asia. Significantly, Mr. Modi invited Ms. Harris to India, after “the normalisation of the global health situation”. Ms. Harris’s mother’s family is from Tamil Nadu and Ms. Harris has made multiple visits to Chennai in her earlier years. “Vice-President Kamala D. Harris spoke this morning to President Andres Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, President Alejandro Giammattei of Guatemala, PM Narendra Modi of India, and PM Keith Rowley, Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM),” a White House readout of her calls said, adding that there were individual calls to each of the leaders, in which Ms. Harris notified them of the decision to share 25 million vaccine doses. “The Vice-President reiterated that the Administration’s efforts are focused on achieving broad global coverage, responding to surges and other urgent situations and public health needs, and helping as many countries as possible who requested vaccines.” The U.S. has committed to donate 13% of its vaccine supply or 80 million doses by the end of June to other countries. “At least 75% of these doses — nearly 19 million — will be shared through COVAX, including approximately 6 million doses for Latin America and the Caribbean, approximately 7 million for South and Southeast Asia, and approximately 5 million for Africa. The remaining doses, just over 6 million, will be shared directly with countries experiencing surges, those in crisis, and other partners and neighbours, including Canada, Mexico, India and the Republic of Korea,” Mr. Biden said. Based on this, it is not clear how many doses India will receive, and if it will receive a second tranche via the COVAX ( an international effort to equitably distribute vaccines) allotment.

04 June 2021||Washington,||Trump’s Justice Department seized reporters’ phone records||The Trump Justice Department secretly obtained the phone records of four New York Times reporters as part of a leak investigation, the newspaper reported on Wednesday. It is the third instance over the last month in which a news media organisation has disclosed that federal authorities seized the records of its journalists in an effort to identify sources for national security stories published during President Donald Trump's administration. President Joe Biden has said he would not allow the Justice Department to continue the practice of obtaining reporters' records, calling it “simply, simply wrong.” Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley said the department notified the four reporters on Wednesday that it had obtained their phone records last year and that it had sought to obtain non-content email records as part of “a criminal investigation into the unauthorised disclosure of classified information.” The newspaper said the records that were seized covered a nearly four-month period in 2017 and belonged to reporters Matt Apuzzo, Adam Goldman, Eric Lichtblau and Michael S. Schmidt. Mr. Lichtblau has since left the newspaper. The journalists are neither the subjects nor the targets of the investigation, Mr. Coley said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trumps-justice-department-seized-reporters-phone-records/article34722289.ece

The three witnesses include a woman who said she was forced into an abortion at six and a half months pregnant, a former doctor who spoke of draconian birth control policies, and a former detainee who alleged he was “tortured day and night” by Chinese soldiers while he was imprisoned in the remote border region. They spoke to The Associated Press of their experiences before testifying by video link to the independent U.K. tribunal. The tribunal, which does not have U.K. government backing, will be chaired by prominent human rights lawyer Geoffrey Nice, who led the prosecution of ex-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and worked with the International Criminal Court. The tribunal’s judgment is not binding on any government. A third exile, Mahmut Tevekkul, said he was imprisoned and tortured in 2010 by Chinese authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uighur-exiles-describe-torture-in-xinjiang/article34722291.ece
04 June 2021||Washington,||Biden intends to overhaul Trump’s China blacklist||U.S. President Joe Biden intends to this week overhaul a list of Chinese firms that U.S. investors are allowed to own shares in, as the President re-evaluates the world powers’ post-Trump relationship while maintaining pressure on Beijing. Donald Trump prohibited Americans from buying stakes in 31 Chinese companies that were deemed to be supplying or supporting China’s military and security apparatus. The list included major telecoms, construction and technology firms such as China Mobile, China Telecom, video surveillance firm Hikvision, and China Railway Construction Corp. The measures by the White House aimed at quelling the Asian giant’s rise and which has left ties between the two severely strained. Beijing repeated its outrage at the Trump-era blacklist on Thursday and vowed to protect Chinese companies’ rights, claiming the blacklist was “politically-motivated” and “ignores the facts and actual situation” of the firms involved. The ban “severely undermines normal market rules and order” and “damages... the interests of global investors including US investors,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. Mr. Biden’s new order will see the Treasury Department create a list of firms that would be hit with financial penalties for their links with China’s defence and surveillance technology sectors, Bloomberg News reported. He is expected to keep the list largely intact, while the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control will add new firms to the list.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-intends-to-overhaul-trumps-china-blacklist/article34722284.ece

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Information Technology Rules: a case of overreach?||Last week, WhatsApp decided to legally challenge one of India’s new Information Technology rules which requires messaging platforms to help investigative agencies in identifying the originator of problematic messages. WhatsApp reckons this would break end-to-end encryption and undermine people’s right to privacy. The government responded saying it is committed to ensuring the right of privacy for all its citizens, and that it also has to ensure national security. Have these new rules been framed to adequately address the privacy versus security balance, especially in the context of social media intermediaries such as WhatsApp? Rishab Bailey and Parminder Jeet Singh discuss this question in a conversation moderated by Sriram Srinivasan . Edited excerpts: What are your views on how the IT rules relate to the privacy versus security issue? Rishab Bailey:The short answer is that every provision of the new IT rules is ultra vires the Constitution and the parent IT Act of 2000. The rules only make superficial attempts at balancing privacy and security interests. But it’s very clear that security interests are being given primacy over both civil liberty interests as well as economic interests. Keep in mind that the government already has huge powers of surveillance. This was recognised even in the Justice Srikrishna Committee report that accompanied the draft data protection law in 2018. So, rather than seeking to revise these powers, the government is giving itself greater ability to snoop on and interfere with the private lives of citizens. In particular, the traceability obligation in the new rules is problematic because the technical literature on this is nearly universal, in agreeing that this would mean breaking the use of end-to-end encryption for all users on platforms such as WhatsApp. Also, end-to-end encryption is really needed in the digital economy because data theft and hacking are only increasing in India. There’s also an issue of platforms themselves misusing user data. So, ideally, we should be looking to encourage more user-controlled encryption and not limiting this possibility. Parminder Jeet Singh:I’ll start with the points of agreement with Rishab, and that is the context of the way the state has been using its powers in a manner which is becoming very dangerous. Having said that, we also need to see things in the sense of the fact that our societies are changing from pre-digital to digital societies, and many fundamental structural changes have to take place. Among those are also the levers of law enforcement, required in the new context. Second, as Justice Srikrishna said, a new law should be brought out, which discusses the rationale, gives good institutional checks and balances, and then places this significant and new legal possibility for the law enforcement in that context. Third, the biggest problem with WhatsApp is that it is a private communication channel, and after certain virality, becomes public. So, what happens is that with the originator or traceability mandate, anybody who’s writing a personal message to his or her friend is afraid that though they are giving an analysis which, in a private sense, is not criminal, but it could be criminal in a public sense. So, how do you balance the private and the public part of it is a concern. Rishab, do you think that the use of metadata is itself enough to deal with this issue? RB:It’s unclear why you need to have a specific mandate for traceability. Yes, metadata as well as other forms of unencrypted data can be accessed by law enforcement. Keep in mind also that the current law in India also allows the government to request decryption of data where it’s held by an intermediary or where the intermediary holds the private encryption key. Would the decryption rules be relevant in a context where there are no keys for decryption except at the ends of a communication? RB:That is actually the fundamental issue here, which is that the government wants you to move away from encryption controlled by the users to encryption done by the intermediary itself. If the intermediary is controlling the encryption keys, the government can just go to them and ask for this information. PJS:I don’t believe traceability of encrypted messages requires breaking encryption. The metadata, which carries many layers of information already, including a counter that tells you that the message has crossed a certain limit of virality, can be a good enough place to lock the originator of every message when it is created. Now, you can always say it doesn’t go with my method of encryption. But the law does not follow private models of business; private models of business follow the law. I have been a law enforcement officer, and I can see many situations where there is really almost no other way — I mean you can spend decades of investigation and always find the originator. So, there are examples like somebody sending out a message which is derogatory to, say, Dalits and this goes viral. This is illegal under Indian law. So, what should the law do? A second example relates to systematic election-related manipulation, which has happened in the West on Twitter; in India it happens on WhatsApp. Foreign countries can do it, Indian political cells can be doing in a manner which is illegal. And all these can really be traced when you are able to find an originator. Another example is of obscene pictures, non consensual, intimate pictures (that are shared). And finally, a lot of the wrong kind of content is today leaked on WhatsApp by the police itself, who get access to a lot of digital media when they do investigation. All these require the originator to be found out and these cases are going to keep on multiplying. And just to say I think it could be found out otherwise is not sufficient. The government’s response to WhatsApp mentioned the safeguards that come with the rules. Any thoughts on that? RB:The rule as it’s currently drafted is vague, disproportionate, and probably unnecessary. The reasons for which this traceability power can be used are quite broad and therefore capable of misuse. The provision uses the phrase ‘security of the state’, which unfortunately has virtually come to mean criticising the government in any way. Similarly, to say that this power can be used to detect or prevent an offence basically gives executive authorities free rein to identify people even before an offence has been committed. PJS:This should have been a new law with systemic explanation of intent, purpose, and institutional safeguards. Like now, the court has said that sedition has to be redefined. There are two problematic terms here: ‘security of the state’ and ‘public order’. People are shouting in my street; is it a public order issue? And we need our Supreme Court to define these terms and lay out the law on that. I am also strongly of the belief that for these kind of cases, executive authority should not be able to give an order. Only a judicial order, which should insist on the purpose, how you are going to do it, whether the intermediary has been given an opportunity of being able to do it through less intrusive means, which are all the part of the new rules, should allow access to the originator of a message. So, these institutional systems should be in a new law, and the Supreme Court should clarify terms like ‘public order’ and ‘security of the state’. It will always be an ongoing battle. The powers that a police constable was given during the colonial regime... it is the same power the Indian policeman has in New Delhi and the Toronto policemen have: of arresting people, going into people’s houses. It is the institutional safeguard around those which keep their power in check. The same would apply in the digital arena. What do you have to say about the fact that these didn’t come as new laws? PJS:Probably much of it is not of the delegated rule-making level. These kinds of things should go to Parliament and a full-fledged law should be written. RB:What has progressively happened over the last few years is that the Section 79 of the IT Act route, and the fact that you can make rules under this, is being used to introduce progressively more onerous obligations, including on many issues where you might actually need regulation. The argument is that all the rules under Section 79 can do is give effect to the main provision. They can’t introduce new offences, they can’t go beyond what the original provision or, in fact, the parent Act itself contemplates. Coming back to the issue of encryption, the government’s release in response to WhatsApp’s charges made a point about a 2019 communique issued by five countries (the U.K., the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) in which they talk about the problems with encryption. What do you think is going to happen going forward? RB:Actually, every jurisdiction is struggling with the issue of how to deal with the fact that sometimes messages may not be accessible, or data may not be accessible to law enforcement agency. But I don’t think there is a single liberal democracy that actually implements laws mandating traceability in the same way that the new IT rules actually do. This issue of access to encrypted data has come up over the last 25 years in many different countries. Even in the U.S., for instance, it’s been discussed since the mid-1990s. It particularly comes up every five or six years when there’s a terrorist attack or something like that and technology companies say we can’t provide you this data because it’s encrypted. But there have been no laws actually implemented that specifically deal with this issue, largely due to opposition from the technical community as well as civil society and academia. In Australia, fairly wide-ranging powers have been given to the government under a law known as the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Act. This allows law enforcement to request information and assistance from intermediaries. But even here, they can’t mandate the creation of systemic weaknesses or vulnerabilities. It’s also important to keep in mind that often, platforms don’t always want to get on the bad side of governments. This might not necessarily apply in the Indian context, because clearly there’s an adversarial position that’s been adopted here. But platforms can also be arm-twisted into building in what’s called weakness by design into their product. For instance, Apple is said to have dropped plans to encrypt its iCloud data because the FBI pressured it. These are bigger questions that need to be discussed, but I don’t think that you will actually find too many countries which have similar provisions in the law.  Ideally, we should be looking to encourage more user-controlled encryption and not limiting this possibility.

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Rural health care needs fixing, and now||The two consecutive waves of COVID-19 and Mucormycosis have left us shattered. Multiple bruises have been caused to us. But during the second wave of the pandemic, it is our rural people who are struggling the most. They are struggling to get prompt and quality health care. The key role of health-care facilities in the rural areas is to provide regular and comprehensive health-care needs guided by the World Health Organization (WHO)’s principle of Universal Health Coverage, “ensuring that all people have access to needed health services (including prevention, promotion, treatment, rehabilitation and palliation) of sufficient quality to be effective while also ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user the financial hardship”. Data show shortfalls The second wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic has exposed the inadequate and poor health infrastructure in the rural areas. The fact shared by Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey on July 23, 2019 in the Rajya Sabha suggest that 29,337 primary health centres (PHCs) are required in the rural areas of the country; India has 25,743, a shortfall of 3 , 594 units. This means that we have one PHC for 25 villages in India. This needs to be revisited. In the fast-changing health scenario, we should have one expanded PHC for every 10 villages along with the provision of some beds and other minimum necessary facilities. We have 5,624 community health centres (CHCs) against the requirement of 7,322. Data on CHCs, which act as a referral centre covering a population of 80,000 people to 1.20 lakh people, show that, overall, there is a shortfall of 81.8% specialists at CHCs as compared to the requirement for existing CHCs. As in the Human Development Report 2020, India has eight hospital beds for a population of 10,000 people, while in China, it has 40 beds for the same number of people. The picture in Haryana If I may talk about the health infrastructure in Haryana, which remained a backward area of Punjab till 1966, it had only one medical college in the public sector up to 2005 till I became the Chief Minister. During my tenure up to 2014, we laid much emphasis on health services; besides many private sector medical colleges, one State health university, four medical colleges (at Karnal, Faridabad and Nuh in Mewat), and one medical college for women (in the rural area of Sonipat district) were established. Called the Bhagat Phool Singh Government Medical College for Women, this is the second women’s medical college after Lady Hardinge Medical College in Delhi in the northern part of the country. We also established the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-II and a National Cancer Institute at Bhadsa village of Jhajjar district. Yet, Haryana requires 5,070 sub-health centres (SHCs) as against the existing 2,666; 845 PHCs as against 531 at present, and 253 CHCs as against 118 working at present. As per Census 2011, Haryana has a 2.53 crore population. And, as per the norms required after each block of one lakh population, Haryana requires 253 CHCs and 845 PHCs for the whole State. When infrastructure in the health services is so poor in a progressive and prosperous State such as Haryana, one can easily estimate the inadequacy of the physical health-care infrastructure in the rural areas in other States (http://haryanahealth.nic.in/). It is of utmost importance that governments everywhere engage with all kinds of rural community organisations such as panchayats, gram sabha, notified area committees, municipal bodies and non-governmental organisations in minimising the adverse impact of the pandemic on rural life. For that purpose, in Haryana, we constituted Swasthya Kalyan Samitis, or SKSs for all CHCs, PHCs which has proved to be an effective management structure enabling people’s participation in ensuring better functioning of rural health services. According to worldometers.info, out of 139 crore population of India, at least 91 crore people are living in 649,481 villages. There are at least 10% of people in the urban areas who are partly settled in villages as well since they keep moving to their rural habitations quite frequently. Villages need adequate health services. Given the alarming proportion of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in India, we cannot sit idle any longer and need to focus on the existing health infrastructure in the rural areas. This is one of the most important takeaways for us after the two waves of COVID-19 and the spread of Mucormycosis in the country. For want of well-oiled health machinery, most of our people are unaware of being in the grip of NCDs such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases which assume significance in the pandemic. The health network As per an estimate of WHO, NCDs including cases of cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory problems and cancer cause nearly 41 million (71%) of all deaths globally and about 5.87 million (60%) of all deaths in India. It will not be humanly possible to treat them all, thereby causing premature deaths on such a large scale. Persons with such morbidities are the most vulnerable in the case of a pandemic. I agree that the task is easier said than done, but it has to be accomplished. We have no other option but to treat the disease/s at the primary level in its first stage to create a healthy India. It will also help us save a lot of money and the resources being spent at tertiary level health care. If our SHCs work effectively, there will be less pressure on PHCs. If the PHCs function well, then there will be minimal pressure on CHCs and so on. Unfortunately, we have not been able to maintain the vibrancy and vitality of the network of health care. As a result, our vast rural populace remains deprived of critical health interventions. The chain of SHCs, PHCs and CHCs can very well take care of the multiple health needs of our people. They should have the health data of people in their respective areas. It will enable them to identify those likely to slip into the secondary or tertiary care zone. Regular health camps will help us identify those on the verge of developing tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes or any diseases likely to be caused because of their socio and economic conditions. A CHC or referral centre equipped with specialists will do wonders if made to work efficiently. Every CHC is supposed to have ‘at least 30 beds for indoor patients, operation theatre, labour room, X-ray machine, pathological laboratory, standby generator’ and other wherewithal. Just imagine the kind of relief we would have had today in our fight against COVID-19 if our network of SHCs, PHCs and CHCs was working efficiently. Collective responsibility In conclusion, I will only urge all stakeholders to revisit and refurbish our health infrastructure in the rural areas and build them in a better manner. As more than 65% of the population resides in the rural areas, we cannot ignore their health needs. WHO has its norms and yardsticks. We can have our own, perhaps even better than what has been stipulated by WHO. We also know health is a State subject, but all those living in the rural areas are not only the responsibility of the States or the Centre but also a collective responsibility. Just spending money will not take us anywhere. We have to see and ensure that the money being spent improves facilities and contributes to people’s ease of life. It is hugely challenging as a task but we have to firm up our strategies, their execution and by rigorous auditing so that we are ever well prepared not only to meet this pandemic effectively but also to make our rural folk healthier. We must remember that no one will survive unless all of us survive. As Bertrand Russell has put it, “It’s co-existence or no existence.” Bhupinder Singh Hooda is a former Chief Minister of Haryana and Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Legislative Assembly||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/rural-health-care-needs-fixing-and-now/article34722265.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Comments to avoid in long-standing ties||The Chief Minister of Delhi last month warned the Union government about a new strain of the novel coronavirus that has been observed in Singapore that was said to be extremely perilous for children and could visit India as part of a third wave. This triggered a strong denial from the authorities in Singapore that there was any ‘Singapore variant’, and they reserved the right to invoke against the Chief Minister a domestic law, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act, against the online circulation of fake news. During this excessive over-reaction to a comment by the Chief Minister, India’s External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, declared that “irresponsible comments from those who should know better can damage long-standing partnerships” — a wise and pertinent observation. Inappropriate statements It is improbable, however, that Mr. Jaishankar similarly cautioned his Cabinet colleague, the Home Minister, against the latter’s many derogatory statements with reference to Bangladesh prior to and during the Bharatiya Janata Party’s unsuccessful campaign in the election for the West Bengal Legislative Assembly. The Home Minister had described illegal Bangladeshi immigrants as vermin that he would push into the Bay of Bengal, and then implied that poor people in Bangladesh were starving, which drew a stinging public rebuke from the Bangladesh Foreign Minister. In this year, the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh’s liberation and the birth centenary of the father of the nation Sheikh Mubibur Rahman, irresponsible comments from those who should know better are profoundly inappropriate. Diplomacy with Bangladesh India’s relations with Bangladesh, one of the most populous Muslim countries in the world, are acutely sensitive. As a neighbour nearly surrounded on all territorial sides by India, there are the inevitable bilateral problems of long duration, including a perennially favourable balance of trade for India, drought and flood in the 54 transboundary rivers flowing from India to Bangladesh, and the smuggling of goods and vulnerable human beings across the approximately 4,100 kilometre land border. The turbulent history of Partitions; East Bengal that became East Pakistan and then Bangladesh, attended by enormous bloodshed and the abuse of human rights, has left emotional wounds that will take many generations to heal. There are those in Bangladesh who believe that separation from Hindu India in 1947 was more significant than the break with Pakistan in 1971, there remain about three lakh ‘Biharis’ in Bangladesh who have failed thus far to be resettled in Pakistan, and there is the presence of militant Islamist groups such as Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, that have linkages and support from outside Bangladesh. In contrast to these circles, who take confrontation with India as part of their basic credo, are those who regard their Bengali roots and traditions as being of equal validity as their religious affiliation, and treasure the linguistic and cultural ties with adjacent India. It will take time for these inherent fractures in Bangladeshi society to be resolved, and it is for India to show patience and sympathy to this entirely internal process of healing. As quid pro quo for India’s benign attentions and support, New Delhi’s expectations are that a neighbour will keep India’s concerns in mind when devising and pursuing its policies, and this understanding is implemented with severity or laxity depending on the regime in New Delhi. Favourable steps After decades of pro-Pakistani military and civilian governments following 1975, Mujibur Rahman’s daughter Sheikh Hasina, elected for a third consecutive term since 2008, has consolidated her position as unquestioned leader in Bangladesh. She has maintained vigilant supervision over Muslim fundamentalist terrorists as well as on Northeast militant movements sheltering in Bangladesh, with the result that the pacification of India’s Northeast has been greatly facilitated. She has permitted a considerable degree of connectivity between India and its Northeast by land, river and the use of Bangladeshi ports, and Indian investments in Bangladesh have been encouraged. There are at least 100,000 Indian nationals now living and working in that country. To complete the ties of economic integration, the day will come when, along with free movement of commerce and capital, the movement of persons on the lines of Nepal and Bhutan will have to be considered. For India to note As the leading mid-wife of Bangladesh’s liberation struggle and its sole economic supporter in that nation’s early years of independence, New Delhi should view with satisfaction Bangladesh’s coming graduation in 2026 from ‘least developed’ to ‘developing country’ status, and its steady progress as one of South Asia’s leading performers in human development indicators. Its eventual membership of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership cannot be ruled out. To a certain degree, both India and Bangladesh depend on each other for security and stability. Responsible individuals on both sides of the border, whether in government or the Opposition, must be actively discouraged from words and actions detrimental to the consolidation of the existing cordiality.

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A new home for old artefacts||The National Museum in Delhi is a repository of India’s rich history and proud heritage. Over the past few months, many critical pieces have been written about the government’s decision to move the museum to the North and South Blocks. However, examples from other countries show that a planned move can serve the collection, comfort, and audience experience needs of the National Museum better. In addition to Egypt, where the impressive Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza will replace the crowded Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square in Cairo, many national museums have moved to new premises. Limitations The current building, though impressive, has limitations in being a national institution. The new location will provide a space that is over four and half times bigger than the current space. The museum has over 2,00,000 cultural collections and less than 6% of them are in display. The move can provide an opportunity to bring more collections from storage to be displayed through the creation of several more galleries. Additionally, it will also provide much more space for storage, especially with more collections being constantly added from excavations, donations and repatriations. From the time an exhibition of Indian art was organised at the Royal Academy in London, and later in Rashtrapati Bhavan, which led to the creation of the National Museum, the collection numbers have been increasing manifold. They will only increase further in the next few decades. The North and South block buildings are a prominent part of Delhi’s landscape. Once they are retrofitted to provide a fitting external façade (without compromising on heritage), international standard exhibition and collection storage areas, and spaces for education and visitor services, they can become a landmark location. The increase in space would allow for more gallery spaces to include both ancient and contemporary Indian art and culture. The current museum also struggles in terms of finding a space with adequate environmental controls for travelling exhibitions. There will be an opportunity in the new location, with the increased space available, for accommodating both international and national travelling exhibitions. The National Museum as the nodal agency for all outgoing and incoming cultural collections, including repatriated collections, will be able to serve these collection needs better. Key skills for students The National Museum Institute (NMI), whose highly skilled graduates not only serve the needs of the museum but also the broader needs of India’s cultural sector, will benefit much from the move. The students could gain a lot from the collections, their storage, conservation and interpretation. They can greatly benefit with a large increase in laboratory, gallery and teaching facilities. There is also an interest to expand NMI and incorporate its programmes in Museology, Art History and Conservation along with other programmes in Archaeology, Archival Studies and so on, under a new institute. The benefits would only be greater from an expanded operation. The exhibition areas in the current building are still operational. A new Buddhist gallery is being opened at the adjoining Archaeological Survey of India building. In this context, keeping the collections safe in the current building and getting the new location ready before carefully moving the collections with safe packing and transport is important. The risks of damage to collections during transit can be greatly minimised. A better designed and new collection storage area in the new location will minimise risks from the environment, disasters and pests. A revamped National Museum that looks at both people and collection comfort; has galleries that provide excellent audience experience; good education spaces; and uses technology creatively for interpretation, outreach and education could become a ‘must visit’ for every visitor. In fact, it could become the anchor for a vibrant museum movement in India.

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Speed over optics||The Centre’s ‘liberalised’ policy of allowing vaccine companies to strike deals with States and private hospitals has borne limited fruit. While the age group of 18-44 years accounts for the bulk of vaccines being administered, attempts by States to negotiate deals with international vaccine companies have come to naught. In spite of opening vaccination for all adults, there were fewer doses administered in May — around six crore — as opposed to 7.7 crore doses administered in April. The Health Ministry has said that close to 8 crore doses were available in May (counting wastage and stocks with States) and that 12 crore will be available in June for the Centre, States and private hospitals. Over 22 crore doses have been administered so far. There is large variability within and among States regarding vaccination. It is in this context that State Chief Ministers, cutting across party divisions, are now demanding that the Centre be the sole buyer of vaccines. The Supreme Court too has expressed its dissatisfaction over the existing system that puts States in competition with each other and the Centre, almost like another competitor, for vaccine supplies. The Centre has tried to project that it was the clamour from States that forced it to abstain from being the sole purchaser of vaccines, but it was the Centre’s miscalculation that there would not be frantic public demand this calendar year and that the output from the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech would be sufficient for India. International arrangements such as COVAX were premised on India being a large supplier to Africa and several countries around the world with no vaccine development facilities. Now that the Government has prevented the Serum Institute of India from honouring its supply commitments, it is unclear if international suppliers would trust India’s demand for large supply. The unpredictability in policy also weakens India’s ambit of negotiations now that it seems desperate to increase short-term vaccine supply. Moreover, given that vaccines are the most sought-after goods, it is unlikely India would be prioritised so late in the day. There is optimism of increased and significant supply from Bharat Biotech and SII by August. At this stage, it appears that the Centre has few options other than waiting for its domestic suppliers to hike production. Increased supply from abroad is unlikely in the near future, even if resources for procurement are not a constraint. It must however heed the States’ core demand that they be given a greater say in deciding how best to distribute the vaccine. The Centre can be a monitor of and an adviser to the process; and if it becomes the sole buyer, it can spell out a transparent distribution policy. But it ought to prioritise speedy administration over optics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/speed-over-optics/article34722259.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Digital tax tussles||The United States announced and then immediately suspended a whopping 25% tariff rate on over $2 billion of imports from six countries including India, signalling Washington’s intent to act punitively on its long-held grouse with these nations for their digital services taxes primarily impacting Silicon Valley tech giants. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai said that the tariff proposed on goods from Austria, India, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the U.K. was approved following a “Section 301” investigation that found these digital taxes to be discriminatory. With the threat of tariffs hanging over these six economies when most of them are limping through a feeble post-COVID-19 recovery, the USTR appeared to project a softening of the blow by adding that the tariffs would be suspended pending ongoing tax negotiations to “provide time for those negotiations to continue to make progress while maintaining the option of imposing tariffs under Section 301 if warranted in the future”. The backstory is that the investigation was initiated by the Trump administration in June 2020, and the deadline for approving tariff action based on the investigation would have lapsed this week. The latest policy action comes a few months after the Biden administration similarly approved, then suspended, tariffs on France retaliating for its tax impacting firms such as Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. One thing is clear: if the Biden administration did not subscribe to the notion that taxes on digital services by the titans of Silicon Valley, a significant portion of whose revenues are generated on foreign soil, were discriminatory, it could have distanced itself from the Trump-era investigation into this allegation without any serious political fallout. The fact that Mr. Biden has chosen to use the stick of tariffs to force the pace of negotiations on digital services tax with seven nations suggests that the current White House subscribes strongly to the idea of expanding the global playing field for American tech firms to dominate without fear of being slapped with tax liabilities. In the case of India, that was a mere 2% digital service tax on trade and services by non-resident e-commerce operators with a turnover of over Rs. 2 crore. Even more, Washington appears to be unafraid to throw serious political heft behind this venture even to the point of risking another tariff war outbreak, compounding the tensions generated by tax skirmishes between the Trump White House and Beijing on this count. The cost for India could be potentially high, as $118 million worth of its exports will fall under this proposed tariff, and a range of sectors could be impacted. At this point in the fragile, post-COVID-19 recovery, the world can hardly afford another tariff war, and that too one waged to protect a sector that has enjoyed low-tax or tax-free operations across the world for decades.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/digital-tax-tussles/article34722260.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Behind headlines and numbers, stories of invisible lives||When China announced on May 31 that it would for the first time allow couples to have a third child, I thought of Yang Zhizhu. Exactly 10 years ago, I had met Yang in Beijing while researching a story on China’s one-child policy. Back then, most Chinese couples were allowed to have only one child under the family planning policy that came into existence in 1979. The only exceptions were if you were a family living in rural China whose first child was a daughter, or if both parents were only children. The Yangs fit neither description. They lived in Beijing, where Zhizhu was a professor of constitutional law at the China Youth University for Political Sciences. Their lives, like the lives of so many others in China, had been turned upside down when his wife became pregnant for the second time. What should have been a moment of joy became one of a complicated mix of emotions. Having the child, under the policy, would have meant paying extraordinary fines that the family couldn’t afford. “God gave us the child,” was how the Yangs explained their decision to me. Their second daughter was born on December 21, 2009. Zhizhu had to pay a fine of 2,40,000 Yuan (then around $37,000). Without doing so, he would not be able to get his daughter’s household registration certificate, which is needed for everything in China, starting with getting into school. The fee was 10 times the average disposable income in Beijing. He decided not to pay it. That cost him his job. He made a second decision: to take the case to court. In doing so, he triggered a broader debate in China and garnered so much public sympathy that the university reinstated his job subsequently, even if he was not allowed to resume teaching. He ultimately lost the case after a two-year battle and had his bank accounts frozen until he paid the amount. Another conversation came to mind this week, of hearing a friend tell me about her “many brothers and sisters”. Noticing how surprised I was, she explained, “That’s how those of us born in the 1980s refer to our cousins.” It was that rare for many in that generation to have their own sibling. In her case, two years after she was born, her mother was forced to have an abortion to keep her job in the government-run factory where she was working. This was early 1980s China, where you couldn’t simply walk away from your state-given job and your work unit that had such a hold over every aspect of your life. Her father worked in the same factory too, and the only kindergarten she had access to was the one linked to the same work unit. Fighting the policy was not an option. In 2015, China announced a two-child policy. After that failed to boost birth rates, the three-child policy was introduced on May 31. The latest change was explained in news reports with a flood of numbers. Twelve million — the number of babies born last year, according to the May 11 Census, the lowest since 1961 (some experts believe the latest Census prompted the change). Or 264 million — the 60 and above population in China, up 5.44% in the last year. Or 300 million — the number of births, according to the Chinese government which still strongly defends the one-child policy, that family planning had prevented. Statistics are what demographers and governments go by. But we forget that behind each of these numbers lie stories of invisible lives impacted in unimaginable ways.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/behind-headlines-and-numbers-stories-of-invisible-lives/article34722276.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Postmasters-General||Simla, June 3: Revised rates of pay of the Postmasters-General have been published in the “Gazette of India.” It is further notified that the Postmasters-General who are recruited from the ranks of the Indian Civil Service will draw Rs. 250 a month over and above the time-scale pay and the overseas pay which would be admissible to them if they were employed in the regular line and held appointments classed as superior. While under training an officer of the Indian Civil Service will draw his time-scale pay in the ordinary line plus overseas pay and he will not come on the scale set forth above until he is placed in independent charge of a circle. Should an officer be placed in an independent charge of a circle before his 10th year of service his pay will be that which he would draw on the superior Indian Civil Service scale plus Rs. 250 per month. The scale of pay for a non-Civilian Postmaster-General will be Rs. 1750-100-2250, with one selection post on Rs. 1500 a month, subject to the condition that no officer should hold this special appointment unless he has completed three years’ permanent service as Postmaster-General.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/postmasters-general/article34722269.ece

In the initial stages of the struggle, they tried to ride the massive wave of popular support in India and establish some degree of rapport with the activist groups in the Bangla Desh freedom struggle. Both the right and left communists had hoped to dig in their toes firmly in the two Bengals and become the torch-bearers of this new upsurge of Bengali nationalism rising above the rut of Ind-Pak. tensions. But when they failed to make such headway in this ambitious bid to radicalise the Bangla Desh freedom movement, the Indian communists started reassessing their positions to make sure that they did not get too closely identified with the petit bourgeoisie leadership of the Awami League and be engulfed by the nationalist upsurge in the two Bengals which had come closer in the wake of the brutal Pakistani military action. They are now trying to cover up this incapacity to forsee the course of events correctly with a lot of ideological nonsense which is only exposing them to further ridicule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/communists-over-doldrums/article34722270.ece
04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Services exports rose by 6.4% in May||India’s services exports grew by 6.44% in May to $17.85 billion, while services imports grew just 0.3% to $10 billion, as per initial estimates, Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said on Thursday. “There is a comprehensive recovery in India’s exports with May’s numbers building on the performance in April,” Mr. Wadhawan said, citing the 67% rise in merchandise exports in May, which was also 8% higher than the pre-pandemic month of May 2019. Services trade recorded a 15.4% higher surplus year-on-year last month, so the trade surplus from the sector had gone up, the Commerce Secretary said. Preliminary estimates for May’s merchandise trade were released on Wednesday, while the data for services trade is an estimation, which may undergo revision with subsequent data releases from the Reserve Bank of India. While petroleum and gems and jewellery exports had been doing badly earlier, Mr. Wadhawan said that they had contributed significantly to May’s numbers, suggesting that ‘this is a turning point’ for the two. Dismissing suggestions that imports from China were consistently rising despite India’s AtmaNirbhar Bharat programme, Mr. Wadhawan asserted that the view was not an accurate conclusion and that the country’s trade with China was ‘more balanced today’.  ‘Wait for PLI’s effects’ “Many of the measures taken are medium term so their effects will start showing. The production-linked schemes are materialising into investments on the ground in a very expedited framework, and the outcomes will be visible in the medium term to long term, more in the early medium term. In sectors like electronics and mobile phones, this will be visible by next year itself,” the Commerce Secretary added. Mr. Wadhawan asserted that rising commodity prices had not influenced the higher export figures. “We will give you that analysis, but the fact that the world is facing a recession, I don’t think the price aspect would be very dominant. The dominant effect would be from volume growth. The predominant impact is from volume growth, not price growth in today’s recessionary times… in some areas at the margins, the price would have helped,” he contended. The long-awaited notification of the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP) scheme would be done ‘very early’, Mr. Wadhawan reiterated again. “There is no doubt on the fact that the RoDTEP will be introduced from January 1 this year and it’s part of the government’s policy. It’s a new scheme… needless to say, it has some implementation issues. We have been addressing them and very soon, we will be able to (implement it),” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/services-exports-rose-by-64-in-may/article34722251.ece
04 June 2021||CHENNAI,||Chola eyes 3-pronged strategy||Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. Ltd., (Chola) the financial services arm of Murugappa Group, will focus on three broad areas to improve as an organisation, according to Vellayan Subbiah, chairman and non-executive director. Chola would hence first focus on frontline productivity viz. sales and collection teams, followed by talent management and ‘lean’ implementation, he said in a call with analysts. The implementation of the ‘lean’ process, traditionally done in a manufacturing environment — meant to add more customer value with fewer resources — has much applicability for Chola. But, it had been unfortunately delayed following COVID-19, said Mr. Subbiah. “So, those are the three broad areas we are looking at in terms of improvement across the system,” he said. In terms of broader strategy, he hinted Chola was looking at more successful models such as HDFC and Bajaj Finserv. “It requires further broadening of the portfolio in terms of what we offer, and which is what all of the successful guys have done.” On Chola’s participation in Vishwakarma Payments Pvt. Ltd. that has applied for a new umbrella entity (NUE) licence for retail payments with the RBI, he said, “If you look at financial services firms, four of the 10 largest such firms in the world are basically involved in payments in some form or shape. “So we see that as a very core fundamental platform on the top of which other things are built. And therefore, we see it’s important that we at least have the opportunity to participate in that platform.” He added that it was difficult to predict the business trend and prospects for the full year given the uncertainties. “Our thinking is April and May will be bad and then, hopefully, things will turn around in June. And that’s predominantly driven by the lockdowns, affecting both earnings potential and also our collections capability.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/chola-eyes-3-pronged-strategy/article34722241.ece
04 June 2021||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI,||‘Jet’s winning bidder cannot claim airline’s original slots’||In a move that casts doubt on the future of Jet Airways, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has told the Mumbai bench of the NCLT that the airline’s winning bidder does not have a claim over the airport slots distributed among various airlines when Jet ceased operations in 2019. The NCLT is examining the revival plan for the airline submitted by the winning bidder — Murari Lal Jalan and Kalrock Capital Consortium. “The occasion for approval of slots and other bilateral rights will arise after approval of the resolution plan,” the Ministry said in an affidavit submitted to the NCLT. “The RA [resolution applicant] can’t claim these slots as matter of right under the present insolvency proceedings,” it added. A slot is a permission given to an airline to land at or depart from an airport. In March 2019, as Jet wound up operations, the Ministry of Civil Aviation devised a standard operating procedure to redistribute the slots held by it at various airports among different airlines to ensure passengers were not inconvenienced. On Thursday, the Ministry said that during this process, the airlines had made investments in acquiring additional planes to deploy capacity for those slots. Hence, these could not be forfeited and returned to Jet’s new owner, the Ministry said. The Ministry added that as and when Jet applied afresh for slots, allocations would be made among the various airlines without any claim of historicity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/jets-winning-bidder-cannot-claim-airlines-original-slots/article34722246.ece

This sum is similar to the losses for FY21, taking the total losses for the two years since the pandemic began, to $8 billion. Airlines may need almost $5 billion in recapitalisation funds n FY22, of which $1.1 billion is in the pipeline in the form of IPOs and other instruments, said CAPA. After a steep dive in passenger traffic in April and May following a surge in COVID-19 cases, June is likely to see a moderate recovery, followed by acceleration in traffic in the second quarter. Airlines are likely to record domestic traffic of 80-95 million passengers in FY22, lower than the almost 140 million in FY20. CAPA also estimated a rise in liabilities of Air India to $20 billion by 2025, making it unattractive to bidders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/airlines-in-india-may-post-41-bn-loss-in-fy22-capa/article34722244.ece

04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sindhu backs training at the Gachibowli Stadium||World Champion P.V. Sindhu looks to continue training outside the Gopi Chand Academy even after the Tokyo Olympics. In mid-February this year, Sindhu shifted her training base to the Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad to train under Korean coach Park Tae Sang. “When we have facilities of international standard, why not use that? If you want to compete against the top-class players, you have to make sure everything is perfect. Gachibowli is a bigger, international-level stadium. Wherever we go, we will always be playing in a bigger stadium, then why not get used to it?” said Sindhu during a virtual press conference on Thursday. On Wednesday, the doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy along with their Danish coach Mathias Boe also moved to Gachibowli Stadium. B. Sai Praneeth, under Indonesian coach Agus Dwi Santoso, continues to train at the Academy. Talking about her training, Sindhu elaborated, “I do on-court sessions at Gachibowli. My gym and off-court sessions take place at Suchitra Academy, where my trainer gives me training. He is really helping me out. If I need sparring partners, I get them from Suchitra Academy.” Underlining the factors that led to training in the stadium, Sindhu said, “When you play in a big stadium, you make sure you control the shuttle, which is very, very important. Sometimes, when you play abroad, there is drift, there is AC or the shuttle might be just fast. Also, I am learning new skills and techniques.” Praise for Park About training with Park Tae Sang, Sindhu said, “When I started training under Park (one and half years ago), it was not easy to grasp what he was teaching. We practised each day and the communication got better. He is always supporting and motivating me. He is doing a great job.” Can’t take it easy Looking at the likely field in the absence of defending champion Carolina Marin in Tokyo, Sindhu said, “You can’t take it easy. There are a lot of good players like Tai Tzu-Ying, Ratchanok, Okuhara, Yamaguchi and others. Those ranked from 1 and 10, have the same standard. I have to be prepared. “When I started off this year, it wasn’t too great for me because of the big gap due to lockdown. But I came back and rectified my mistakes. I played the All-England and improved on my game. Attack is my strong point but I’m also focusing a lot on defence.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-backs-training-at-gachibowli/article34722423.ece

Top seed Barty, already suffering from a left hip injury, retired injured midway through the second set of her second-round match against Poland's 45th-ranked Magda Linette. The Australian, who won the title on her last visit to Roland Garros in 2019, left the court for medical treatment after losing the first set 6-1. She then called it quits at 2-2 in the second set on Court Philippe Chatrier. Djokovic continued his bid for a 19th Grand Slam title with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 win over Uruguay's Pablo Cuevas. Roger Federer became entangled in a rare running dispute with a chair umpire before safely securing his place in the last 32. Federer saw off Marin Cilic for the 10th time in 11 meetings, winning 6-2, 2-6, 7-6(4), 6-2 but only after a second set bust-up with umpire Emmanuel Joseph. The 20-time Grand Sam title winner was handed a time violation at 1-3 down in the for taking too long between points. "I don't even dare to go my towel anymore," he said to Joseph. Federer, the oldest man in the draw at 39, lost his cool and the set before recovering to defeat former world number three Cilic. Former US Open winner Cilic was also handed a time warning late in the third set. Rohan Bopanna and Croatian Franko Skugor advanced to the third round with a 6-4 7-5 win over Americans Frances Tiafoe and Nicholas Monroe. Earlier on Wednesday, Serena Williams survived a scare to extend her latest bid for an elusive 24th Grand Slam singles title with a three-set victory over Mihaela Buzarnescu, while men's fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas and world number two Daniil Medvedev also reached the third round. Medvedev bounced back from losing the first set to American Tommy Paul in style by romping to a 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-3 victory.

Dinesh Karthik will be seen in the role of a television commentator in the World Test Championship final between India and New Zealand. Karthik told The Hindu on Thursday, “I was a bit fortunate the way it came to me. I think I can bring to the table things like technique and strategy.” Knowing the players And, he can provide insight into players’ minds. “I have played with the cricketers in both teams, know the way they think and will try to get into their heads.” New Zealand was a very good side but India had the firepower, Karthik said. “We have a potent pace attack. And if we can build partnerships, I see no reason why we cannot win.” Karthik may be in the commentary box for the big game, but he hasn’t given up on his India dreams.  The thought of playing for India again fires him up. “The passion is still there. The prospect of playing for the country again in white-ball cricket is what keeps me going.” Karthik revealed he had made peace with the fact that he might not play Test cricket again. “But I am gung-ho about my chances of figuring in the World Twenty20 championship. If I have a good IPL in September-October, I could get picked.” The street-smart Karthik averages 33.25 for India in Twenty20 Internationals at a worthy strike rate of 143.52. These are very good numbers. And he has conjured up nuggets such as his stunning eight-ball unbeaten 29 in the Nidahas tri-series final in Colombo, 2018. His innings included a sensational last ball six — a whip-drive over extra cover off Bangladesh seamer Soumya Sarkar — when India needed five. “That was a life-changing innings,” Karthik remembered with a smile. He had donned the role of a finisher to perfection. Karthik is suited for that role with his composure under pressure and rapier-like blows that can scuttle bowling plans and scatter field settings. Fitting the bill He is 36, but talk about age and he shows his displeasure. “We live in an era where fitness parameters are set for a cricketer. You have to clear those fitness tests to be picked in the Indian team. So, if you are fit, where is the question of age.” Whether leading Tamil Nadu to title triumph in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 championship or knocking up quick runs for Kolkata Knight Riders, or plucking a gravity-defying catch with the big gloves, Karthik is a man of action. And he still has gas left in the tank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dinesh-karthik-to-get-behind-the-mike-at-wtc-final/article34722375.ece
04 June 2021||Tokyo,||‘Olympics certain to go ahead’||The Tokyo Olympics are “100%” certain to go ahead, the chief organiser said on Thursday, but warned that a major coronavirus outbreak mid-Games could slam the door shut on fans. Tokyo 2020 president Seiko Hashimoto made the comments exactly 50 days before the pandemic-postponed Olympics, which remain plagued by public opposition. “I believe that the possibility of these Games going on is 100% that we will do this,” Hashimoto told BBC Sport , adding that fans could be locked out during the Games. “The biggest challenge for us will be how we can control and manage the flow of people who flock to the venues,” said Hashimoto.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/olympics-certain-to-go-ahead/article34722377.ece
04 June 2021||Kochi,||Slipping into the danger zone||Two months ago, M.P. Jabir was sitting on the 21st rung in the World Athletics’ Road to Olympics rankings. The 24-year-old has not made the entry standard, just 19 have made the cut so far, but there are 40 berths available for Tokyo in the 400m hurdles and he hopes to get in through the rankings route. But the two-time Asian bronze medallist has now fallen to 25 and is worried. “The fear is there that my Tokyo rankings could fall further.  “We can’t say how much it will go down at the last moment since there are a lot of competitions all over the world,” said Jabir, from the Patiala national camp. Dropping few rungs Like Jabir, javelin thrower Annu Rani has dropped a few rungs to 19, while Asian Games champion shot-putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor is on a very worrying 29 since the field events in Tokyo have just 32 slots. Asian Games silver medallist and 400m national record holder Muhammed Anas has suddenly slipped from 40 to 45 in the quartermile, but his main focus is the mile relays and India has already made the cut in one of them, the mixed event. Dutee’s ranking World University Games champion Dutee Chand is 40 and 41 in the women’s 100 and 200m. Both these sprints have 56 berths. And in the 4x400m relays, which is a 16-team field, the Indian men are 14th while the women are 15th. The qualification doors close on June 29 and as athletes try to focus on their Olympic preparations even while worrying over whether they would drop out of the Tokyo rankings, there will be distractions aplenty. For this is also a look-around time to see what other countries and relay teams are doing to grab the last few slots. Nigeria’s plans For instance Nigeria, which is behind India at No. 17 in the women’s mile relay rankings, has now decided to host the African Championships in Lagos from June 23, after original host Algeria asked for a postponement, with an eye on some of these berths. Nigeria, like India, had missed the recent World Relays in Poland. The AFI is working on sending almost all the Olympic probables to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan for competitions next week. “They are looking but we don’t know what will happen. What we need now are competitions,” said Anas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/slipping-into-the-danger-zone/article34722580.ece
04 June 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Humpy qualifies for Candidates||In her long career Koneru Humpy has notched up several remarkable achievements. But, what she did on Wednesday night merits special attention. Or, rather, what she achieved without doing anything, to be precise. She qualified for the Candidates tournament — the winner of which will earn the right to challenge the World chess champion — after she finished second in the FIDE Women’s Grand Prix overall standings. Special What makes the feat special is that she did it without playing one of the three legs she had chosen from the series of four. Humpy chose to skip the Gibraltar leg, which concluded on Wednesday, because of travel concerns in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. When she played in the first two legs — at Skolkovo (Russia) and Monaco — the coronavirus hadn’t yet raised its ugly head. She won the first leg and was runner-up in the second. She had 293 points from those two legs. A top-three finish in the third could have fetched her the Grand Prix title, but she had, of course, chosen not to play. She, however, finished runner-up in the GP series to Russia’s Alexandra Goryachkina (398 points); she had chosen Lausanne as the third leg, which was played in March last year, shortly before the world went into lockdown. Humpy has no regrets at having missed Gibraltar. She is, actually, relieved that she has qualified for next year’s Candidates. “I was closely following the Gibraltar tournament and am relieved and happy that the results went my way,” the World No. 3 told The Hindu over phone. “It feels great that I have qualified for the Candidates on my Grand Prix performance alone.” Calculated risk Even if she hadn’t, there would have been chances at the World Cup or Grand Swiss or by virtue of her Elo rating. “But I could not have taken anything for granted and I could have missed out, too,” she said. “Yes, I was taking a risk by not going to Gibraltar. But I had to take that decision. Life is not just about playing chess, you know!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/humpy-qualifies-for-candidates/article34722411.ece
04 June 2021||New Delhi,||Harikrishna and Vidit confirmed for World Cup||Grandmasters P. Harikrishna and Vidit Gujrathi have received confirmation from the International Chess Federation (FIDE) to be part of the World Cup beginning in Sochi from July 10. Harikrishna and Vidit, ranked 20 and 22, gained the berths that fell vacant owing to the withdrawal of the seeded players. The confirmation from FIDE also helped All India Chess Federation nominate B. Adhiban — the highest ranked Indian after Viswanathan Anand, Harikrishna and Vidit — for the World Cup. In all, FIDE allows 91 countries to nominate a player each apart from those already qualified. Anand gives it a miss Anand, a two-time champion who enjoyed a direct seeding, will not participate. As a result, in the 206-player men’s field, India will be represented by P. Harikrishna, Vidit, Adhiban, Aravindh Chithambaram and P. Iniyan. An additional ‘wild card’ entry cannot be ruled out. In the 103-player women’s section, as reported earlier, it will be K. Humpy, D. Harika, Padmini Rout, Bhakti Kulkarni and P. Vaishali. The squad will be accompanied by two trainers, GMs Abhijit Kunte and N. Srinath. Players like Harikrishna, Vidit, Humpy and Harika are likely to get a first-round bye. The on-board action commences on July 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/harikrishna-and-vidit-confirmed-for-world-cup/article34722412.ece
04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indian official kits for Tokyo Games unveiled||Indian officials expect at least 25 more athletes to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics by the end of June and the contingent to return with at least 10 medals from the Games. So far 100 athletes have qualified, including the two hockey teams. “We are estimating to touch 125 to 135 by the time the qualification process is over. This means the Indian contingent, including officials and support staff, is likely to be around 190,” IOA president Narinder Batra said during a virtual unveiling of the Indian sports and ceremonial uniforms for the event. It also marked the 50-day countdown to the Games, scheduled to open on July 23. Only a handful of qualified athletes were present physically on the occasion — including Neeraj Chopra, Bajrang Punia, Ravi Dahiya, Sumit Malik and Seema Bisla. The sports kits are sponsored by Li Ning while the ceremonial kits are by Raymonds.  Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju assured of full support from the ministry and SAI in accelerating the vaccination programme for the qualified/ probable athletes in time for their departure to Tokyo. “'The IOC will issue an updated Playbook later (but) we have to follow all the health and safety protocols in view of the pandemic,” Rijiju said. PM reviews preparations Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting to review India’s Olympics preparations and was apprised with various steps taken for athletes’ training. While most of the athletes and officials have managed one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Prime Minister has directed complete vaccination for all athletes, staff and officials travelling to Tokyo. He would also be connecting with the Olympic contingent through video-conference in July. Regular video interactions with their families are planned for all athletes during the Olympics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-official-kits-for-tokyo-games-unveiled/article34722416.ece

Rupa, daughter of former BCCI chief N. Srinivasan, became the first woman to head a State association when she took over as the TNCA chief in September 2019. Her position was challenged by Sanjeev Gupta, a former life member of the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association. Justice (retd.) D.K. Jain, in his verdict issued on Thursday, has stated that Rupa “has at least indirect (if not direct) interest in CSKCL, which has entered into an agreement/contract with the BCCI, thus, attracting one of the forms of conflict of interest”. Rupa is a whole-time director of India Cements Ltd. (ICL), while Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited (CSKCL) owns the IPL franchise. As per the verdict, Rupa “… in her capacity as the whole time director and promoter of ICL, has close association with the Trustees of IC Shareholders Trust and the Directors of CSKCL.” The ethics officer has directed the BCCI to follow its rulebook. If it is adhered to, the TNCA president will have to step down from her post.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/coi-complaint-against-rupa-upheld/article34722368.ece

04 June 2021||Bengaluru,||Turf clubs liable to pay GST only on commission received for service of totalisator: HC||In a judgement that gives a major tax relief to turf clubs, the High Court of Karnataka has declared that the clubs are liable for payment of GST only on the commission that they receive for the service that they render through the totalisator. The court said that the clubs are not liable to pay GST on the entire 100% of the face value of the bet or amount paid into the totalisator while striking down the Rule 31A(3) of the Central GST Rules, 2017 and the corresponding Rule 31A of the Karnataka GST Rules, 2017. Justice M. Nagaprasanna delivered the verdict on June 2 while allowing the petitions filed in 2018 by the Bangalore Turf Club Ltd and the Mysore Race Club Ltd questioning the legality of these rules, which came into effect from January 23, 2018. The court said the rules are contrary to the provisions of the GST Act as “the totalisator is brought under a taxable event without it being so defined under the act nor power being conferred in terms of the charging section, which renders the rule being made beyond the provisions of the act.” The court also said that the two petitioner clubs are entitled for all consequential benefits that flow from this verdict. The act, the court said, which deals with supply of goods, consideration, business “would not apply to the function of the totalisator.” “Making the entire bet amount that is received by the totalisator liable for payment of GST would take away the principle that a tax can be only on the basis of consideration even under the CGST,” the court said. “The consideration that the petitioners (turf clubs) receive is by way of commission for planting a totalisator. This can be nothing different from that of a stock broker or a travel agent - both of whom are liable to pay GST only on the income - commission that they earn and not on all the monies that pass through them,” said the court. Stating that betting is neither in the course of business nor in furtherance of business of a race club for the purposes of the GST Act, the court said that clubs hold the amount received in the totalisator for a brief period in its fiduciary capacity, for which the consideration the clubs receive is the commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/turf-clubs-liable-to-pay-gst-only-on-commission-received-for-service-of-totalisator-hc/article34722427.ece

As I plunge my spoon into a gooey chocolate cake, my palate is surprised by what lies beneath: shreds of coconut, coated in luscious Belgian chocolate. Keeping me company is a soulful Nepali track — a recommendation by the Sweet Spot team. It came written on a neon sticky note, attached to the neat box laden with brownies, tarts and cookies. Sweet Spot, started in April by Zeeshan Anees, Ahad Anaikar, Mohamed Faraaz, Pooja Reddy and Mohamed Samee aims to give home bakers a platform to promote their products. The desserts are sold under the label of the person who created them, explains Samee. The idea is not to monopolise the dessert market, but to even out the playing field. And along with the goodies come song recommendations from the team. These include: ‘Hataarindai, Bataasindai’, ‘Parchaiyon Main’, ‘Heat Waves’, ‘100 words’... “The idea came to us during the last lockdown, when we noticed an increase in home bakers. We were ordering a lot of desserts from them,” says Samee. Soon, they transformed a small space, in the same compound as the old Nolita, into a dessert parlour. The team put all interested home bakers through a series of quality checks, filtering out what did not work for them. On an average, the boutique features items by 15 home bakers, the number goes up to 20 during the weekends. Each bakers typically stocks two to three of her creations. “Sixty to 70% are products by our anchor brands such as Meltz by Aishwarya, Whisk by Safra, Serendipia, Chef Srishti, Coucou, Baked by Faz, Zoya’s bakes, and the rest are from upcoming bakers,” says Samee. The bestsellers list includes milk chocolate salted caramel cake, baklava tart and dark chocolate cheesecake. The latest entrant on the menu is sheer shahi kurma. They are trying to bring in variety with Indian desserts as well as savoury snacks like quiches and cream cheese-filled Korean buns.

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Sly sighting||When Chennai wildlife photographer Karthik Ramamurthy realised he would be spending this lockdown at his home in Kanchipuram, he anticipated the rural joys of birdwatching and clear, starry skies. What he did not expect, however, was to chance upon a creature he had not seen since 2011. “It wasn’t just one of them; it was a whole family. Two adult Bengal foxes, and two puppies, playing in a trench,” says Karthik about his recent late evening tryst. Out on a walk with an eye out for birds, he could not believe his luck when he spotted them. He only had binoculars with him then, but could not give up on the thought of a picture. “These foxes are notoriously difficult to catch sight of, because they are nocturnal, and even harder to photograph because they are quick,” he explains. Sure enough, when he came back next morning, the spot was empty. In the evening, he saw them, but they saw him too, and the puppies scurried away immediately. “It was only by the third day that they got used to my presence. I took care not to scare them; I stayed inside my car, by a bush, a good few metres away,” says Karthik. So it was on day three and four that the family was carefree in its movements again, allowing him to take some treasured shots from afar with his trusty 600 mm lens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/sly-sighting/article34722513.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Meet the||In 2018, Phalgun Polepalli and Shwetha Badarinath could not find a single person to make dice, much to their dismay. “Dice were practically invented in India; but all major boardgame manufacturing these days is in China. It took us a long time to find a woodworker who could make what we needed,” recalls Phalgun over a phone call from Bengaluru. In May that year, the duo formally launched Dice Toy Labs, to publish games by Indians, set in an Indian context. Today, Dice boasts over 10 boardgames dreamt up by various creative minds for different age groups, with two more in the pipeline. It is one of many brands that have cropped up across India, reclaiming the country’s boardgaming traditions with a little help from families resigned to staying at home during lockdown. Brands like Dice Toy Labs and Go India Games are creating fresh games set in familiar contexts, thus filling a gaping hole in the market. As Phalgun points out, “Wherever Shwetha and I travelled, any toy store we would visit for our son would have Monopoly or other old games, nothing an Indian could relate to.” The duo also realised that though game ideas were many, often they would not reach the retail stage, or stay long in the market. For, it is not enough to have a brilliant idea. A good board game today needs a designer to come up with the core concept and gameplay, an artist to give a definite visual style, a graphic designer for typography, manufacturers and artisans to give shape to boards and pieces, and a publisher to bring all this together with a focus on investment and sales. In India currently, game designers have a couple of choices — to pitch their games to a brand like Funskool, or work with independent publishers like Dice, often run by passionate boardgamers. Chennai-based designer Santhosh Kumar does both. Santhosh, who runs Bambaram Toys and Games with a focus on creating fun, educational tools for children, recently had one of his boardgames released by Funskool. Called Big Bull Junior, the game teaches children above the age of eight, the intricacies of the stock market without any jargon. Ask him to explain the game, and he gushes: “Players try to build a high value set of companies (portfolio). But unlike the real stock market, here players themselves can manipulate the price. The catch: one’s portfolio is not known to others. So when you are changing the price of a company, you may end up helping other players!” The brass tacks So, just how does one go about constructing a game? How do they decide if it should have four players or more; last for two hours or six; stick to a linear flow based on a single objective or pack in multiple layers and side-quests; involve dice or cards or tokens, or all three, or none? Some of these decisions are based on the creators’ basic objective: the story they are trying to tell, the adventure they want to create. Other decisions, are less organic. Take, for instance, Cristina Maiorescu, the creator of popular boardgame Bharata 600 and the woman behind publishing company GoIndia Games. Cristina sees herself as both publisher and designer. She states over a phone call from Bengaluru: “From the ideation stage, I do thorough consumer research with different research and database companies. For Bharata 600 BC, we had to find out what consumers were looking for in terms of game mechanics, duration and complexity. India is still a very nascent market; it’s quite young compared to the market in Western countries, where players have a more advanced appetite. Only after players get over simple gateway games, do they look for complex ones.” Larger appeal A complex boardgame in India would invariably become a niche one, but Cristina wanted her game to appeal to a larger market. She surveyed more than 10,000 potential consumers before locking in on an algorithm — what makes Bharata 600 BC stand out, is its inclusion of multiple play styles in a single game, like exploration, combat, collaboration. It lets players choose a complexity level. It is set in the post-Vedic period, described by the brand as “ the era of the 16 Mahajanapadas (Great Kingdoms)”, it lets players build armies, wage wars, rule civilisations. What sets indie games apart, is the art. Each game takes pride in its aesthetic, like Dice’s wargame Yudhbhoomi that features stark white Harappa-esque warrior figurines, 64 in total, comprising various armies set to face each other off on the board. In contrast, Bharata 600 BC’s coloured wooden counters are made by the famed Channapatna artists of Karnataka, who for decades have been crafting traditional toys. According to B. Venkatesh, one of the Channapatna artists creating Cristina’s pieces, orders from “modern” boardgame makers have increased in the past few years. Over a phone call from Channapatna, he says, “It is not like we work on only boardgame parts throughout the month, but we fulfill orders as and when they come. These days, a lot of companies have come up, selling traditional-based games on the Internet; old games like chauka bara are also getting popular, as are games based on The Ramayana and The Mahabharata . Most of the brands we get our orders from, are based in Hyderabad and Bengaluru.” Small blessings The machine that the craftsmen use is small enough to be kept in their homes or courtyards; which means that these are among the few artisan communities that have managed to persist with their livelihoods despite COVID-19 lockdowns since last March. As their client, Cristina testifies to this: “Our production was sometimes held up because of the printing units being closed, but never because of the Channapatna artists.” Despite lockdown hiccups, the market for locally made board games has remained steady through the past couple of years. A part of this popularity can be chalked down to the continuous efforts of publishers to keep players engaged. Phalgun and Shwetha have kept game-lovers involved on their website, where they test out new game ideas for feedback, besides holding challenges and game design contests. “As long as you have access to the printer, you can print out a game, play it with friends or family, and give us feedback,” says Phalgun. Cristina has produced 500 units of Bharata 600 BC every month since November 2020, and even had to scale up in January and February. “Now, we have the good kind of problem — we can only make 500 but the demand is higher. In fact, the demand rises every time there is a lockdown announcement,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/meet-the/article34722512.ece

In this World Heritage Site, the Royal Bengal tigers swim in the creeks, the Gangetic dolphins play in the rivulets, while the estuarine crocodiles bask on the river-banks. In addition, it harbours innumerable species of birds, mammals and fish. The rising sea, owing to global warming, poses a grave danger of drowning these bountiful islands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/sunderbans/article34722641.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The mango tree||Once upon a summer, not too long ago, Miyan Mittho was having the worst day of his life. He had an upset stomach, thanks to gorging on the mangoes from that season. Though he believed his life to be a wide open book, he was not particularly keen on sharing this story on Instagram. What’s more, a group of students and teachers had gathered under his tree during the recess. So much for letting a sick bird take an afternoon nap. His mango tree was right at the end of the school grounds with a small marsh at the back. No one disturbed his peace except Noya, the girl who loved the colour green — that included plants, Olive Ridley turtles and parakeets. “Even in Hogwarts, the forest was off limit for kids. But here!” “They are having a ‘meeting’, Miyan. Noya and her two cronies are making a presentation to the Principal about this bog,” said CEO, his mortal enemy, the resident cat. She had long given up trying to catch the parakeet on the high branches and both had settled into a convenient routine of having long chats, like old couples. “They are planning to make a badminton court here.” “What? How do you know?” Mittho shifted from one foot to the other, his stomach growling. “I keep my claws sharp. You see that hulk? She is the PT Madam. And those four girls behind her are the best players of the school.” “Which animal are you?” came Noya’s sonorous voice from below, asking the gathering at large. The air was heady with the fragrance of ripe mangoes. “I can’t read a book,” Mittho chirped, “Can’t hold keys to mysterious treasures. Can’t slurp an ice cream. Can’t…can’t…can’t… And humans talk about which animal they are? I mean, seriously?” “You can fly, Miyan.” “Yeah, as if that’s a big deal. Even a fly can fly.” “Not humans, mind you.” Web of life “We can’t fill the bog with cement,” Noya beseeched the Principal, who wore a crisp khadi suit and a kind expression. “This year, the UN’s theme for celebrating the World Environment Day is ‘ecosystem restoration’. And here we are trying to destroy one!” “Principal Sir, would you rather see a trophy on the school wall or mosquito bite on your arms?” asked the PT teacher, wiping her sweaty forehead. A few girls sniggered. “Did I hear ‘FILL the bog’?” Mittho was aghast. “What about our old Hakim, the turtle? The mafia of fireflies that lives on the other shore… I can’t ever remember all their names. The water snake Shashikant who goes to the gym to keep himself lean? The beetles and crickets who have that rock band they play every night? What’s it called… The Beatles!” The PT teacher below the tree put her legs wide apart. “We are living in the Western Ghats. There are just too many higgity-piggity swamps around for my liking.” “We can never have too much of the wild!” said Noya. “And this is the only swamp WE have. Ecosystems are the web of life. The healthier our ecosystems are, the healthier we are. There are polar caps, rainforests, oceans, desserts, mountains, grasslands, mangroves, rivers, coral reefs, marshes, lakes…and so so many ecosystems and habitats. How boring the world would be with more and more cities!” The PT teacher yawned. “Pakistan is hosting the UN World Environment Day this year,” Noya added. “Pakistan…” a few kids guffawed. A solution “Laugh as you like, but it is us who are destroying our swamp. Not the Pakistani army.” Noya looked coolly at her schoolmates. “What is that one thing we all have in common? It is the planet. Or would you rather go to Uranus? It is just -216°C there and will take you only nine years to reach.” “She has a point, Imalka Madam,” the Principal cleared his throat, addressing the PT teacher. “We can perhaps think of making the court on the side of the parade ground.” “We are talking of cutting just this one tree, Sir. That’s not like clearing a forest for mining,” the PT Madam growled. “CUT THIS TREE?” Mittho whistled, losing control of his bowels in the heat of the moment. His poop landed fair and square on Noya. “Yikes!” cried Noya’s friend and stepped away. This time, the kids laughed aloud. “I rest my case,” the PT teacher didn’t even bother to smile. “See, I told you! I am having the worst day of my life.” Mittho thumped his talons, inching closer to the cat. “You are a hype-beast, Miyan.” CEO began to clean herself. Suddenly, she glanced up, moved her whiskers and jumped on Mittho, scratching his wing with her paw. Mittho shrieked and landed from the branch onto the PT teacher’s shoulder. CEO meowed, as Mittho buried his head, beak and all in the teacher’s collar. “Awww…” went the kids. The PT teacher’s expression, as severe as her tight ponytail, softened. She reached out and patted the parakeet. Someone clicked a photo and uploaded it instantly before a teacher could cry, ‘No phones!’ “That parakeet lives in the tree you want to cut,” Noya said. *** Three days later, the picture was still trending. It had gone viral. “You are a star, Miyan. You saved the swamp,” CEO purred from a low branch. “And you’re a thug, CEO,” Miyan Mittho half-scowled, half-beamed. “A cat’s a cat…” She stretched herself and posed for kids clicking selfies with the tree. “…and that’s that.”  “We can never have too much of the wild!” said Noya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/the-mango-tree/article34722668.ece

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Is your area healthy?||The very basic needs of all humans are clean air, water and food. Often, in our pursuit of material comforts, we forget what these are. Crucial to meeting them is a healthy ecosystem, as all of nature is linked. Do you live in an area that has a healthy ecosystem? What can you do to support it?   Birds play important roles innatureas seed dispersers, pollinators, scavengers and in controlling insect populations, to name a few. Do you hear many bird calls in your area? Document the bird diversity near your home, and make an attempt to provide as much natural food as you can for them.   Insects are nature’s most important pollinators. Bees, butterflies, moths, beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, ants, dragonflies…do you see any of these in your area? Make a list of what you see and when.   The presence of amphibians is an indicator of non-polluted water. Can you hear frogs and toads calling when it rains at night? If not, try and create a small pond with water in your area.   Every ecosystem has certain species of wild animals, even in urban areas. Have you noticed the disappearance of creatures like sparrows or butterflies? Think about what you can do to see that they continue to live around you.   Does your area look like a nicely manicured garden? If so, perhaps you can make an attempt to re-wild it. Allowing native plants, trees, shrubs, herbs to grow will bring back biodiversity.   Wild creatures live and depend on different levels in nature: under the soil, on the ground, on grass, shrubs, bushes and trees. Try to create a multi-layered habitat consisting of native plants in your area.   Soil is home to tiny organisms like different kinds of bacteria, worms, and insects that help keep it healthy. We lay roads and underground pipes and construct our buildings on soil. Let’s keep more of our city spaces free of construction. And use environment-friendly ways when we build our houses.     Pesticides and fertilisers, paints and cleaning products contain toxic chemicals that, along with non-biodegradable garbage, pollute land, air and water. Replace all chemical-based products with ones made with natural substances. And reduce garbage!   Keep rocks, boulders, hills, ponds, streams, marshes, rivers, etc intact. Don’t blast or build on them or drain them! They support wild plants and animals. Leave sufficient natural spaces around your homes.   Is the flora in your area native? Or have they come there from some distant place? Beware! Some travellers who come in and spread so rapidly that they disturb the natural balance. Like Lantana, Cosmos and Parthenium. Remove these in favour of native flowering plants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/is-your-area-healthy/article34722632.ece

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Thodi in all its hues||Who could resist that melody-tinged pallavi, the ebullient sancharas and sharp swaraprastara that marked the culmination of the RTP in Hamsanadham, the piece de resistance of Hamsa Geetham, the online concert supported by Purdue University featuring Ranjani and Gayatri. The pallavi, ‘Va vennilave mannil va theynthidaamal deepamaaga olira,’ was set to an intricate Chatusrajathi Triputa talam — the Poorvaanga in chatusra nadai and Uttaranga in tisra nadai. All these, not at the cost of its musical brilliance. The duo vied with each other in presenting an expansive swaraprastara, with a closing touch of ragamalika. Rajiv Mukundan’s violin accompaniment was splendid. His aesthetic sense makes him a desirable accompanist on any day. Similarly, the percussion section led by Sai Giridhar was an asset to the vocalists in its subdued richness. S. Krishna (ghatam) matched well with him. Their thani in the intricate tala was well executed and deserves special mention. Impressive raga essay Earlier, Ranjani gave a fitting lead to the raga alapana and Gayatri took it forward and it seamlessly glided into a fabulous tanam. Rajiv Mukundan rose to the occasion and offered an equally impressive Hamsanadham. Thodi stood out in all its magnificence in the two-hour concert. Ranjani initiated the raga elucidation with deft touches and Gayatri, who took it forward, did not forget to perform her favourite, a grahabhedam, by culling out a lovely sketch of Mohana Kalyani from Thodi. The kriti was Tyagaraja’s ‘Enduku dayaradura’ (Misra Chapu). The swaras were at ‘Jaagela idhi samayamu’. Rajiv Mukundan’s response both in the alapana and the swaras was again superb. The sisters commenced their recital with the Pantuvarali varnam, ‘Sami ninne’ by Shatkala Narasayya, which they embellished with their nuanced aesthetic. This was followed by a Purandaradasa Devaranama, ‘Saranu benakane’ on Lord Vinayaka in Bilahari. Their swaraprastara at the pallavi rendered at a captivating tempo enhanced the concert.  Muthuswami Dikshitar’s ‘Sri Varalakshmi’ (Sri raga, Rupakam) was rendered in an unhurried pace, which brought out the duo’s creativity, craftsmanship, and imaginative rendering. GNB’s Bahudari piece on Parvathi, ‘Unnadiye gathiyenru’, had emotive appeal. The composer says, “O, Mother, in your feet is my only refuge.” After a virutham, ‘Kadhalagi kasindhu kanneer malgi’ from Namasivaya Pathigam by Thirugnana Sambandhar in ragas Karaharapriya, Mohanam and Jonpuri, the duo rendered ‘Andavan darisaname’ by Muthiah Bhagavatar. Their concert is never complete without an abhang and the sisters concluded with one by Janabai in Desh raag. The Chennai-based author writes on music and culture.   Ranjani and Gayatri succeeded in weaving a web of charm with their aesthetic nuances||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/thodi-in-all-its-hues/article34722225.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||How a Tamil opera was adapted to Kathakali||In the four century-old history of Kathakali, October 28, 1995 is momentous. A play was presented in an Indian language other than Malayalam for the first time. Arunachala Kavi’s magnum opus Rama Natakam , choreographed by the maestro Kalamandalam M.P.S. Namboodiri, was staged in Tamil that day. MPS, as he is fondly referred to, is a former principal of Kerala Kalamandalam and a well-known performer and choreographer. He recalled that memorable day during a recent conversation. “True, I choreographed the play, but the credit for embarking on such an extraordinary project goes to the late scholar L.S. Rajagopal,” said MPS. An authority on the traditional theatre and music of Kerala, Rajagopal was a prolific writer whose books — Women’s Role in Koodiyattam , Koodiyattam: Preliminaries and Performance , Temple Musical Instruments of Kerala – to mention a few – have won rave reviews. The renowned Tamil poet Arunachala Kavi, whose compositions are popular in Kerala, lived during the incipient stages of the evolution of Kathakali. Surprisingly, the structure of Rama Natakam suggested that it was composed to be enacted as a Sangeetha Natakam . “The opening slokas and padams for different characters made it easily adaptable to Kathakali,” recalled MPS. Moreover, the poet had prescribed the ragas and talas for the padams. Futile attempts Rajagopal was convinced of the possibility of adapting the Tamil play for Kathakali performance as early as the 1970s. But since the Kathakali actors could not read Tamil, he had transliterated the entire play into Malayalam, with meanings. He approached several cultural institutions like Kerala Kalamandalam, but to no avail. Finally, the Thrissur Kathakali Club agreed to stage the play, realising its historic importance. Fortunately for Rajagopal, a few senior artistes volunteered to collaborate with him. Naturally, MPS was entrusted with the responsibility of choreographing the play. “As for choreography, I only needed to prescribe the mudras and movements including kalasams, as all the other details were given by the poet himself,” said MPS. Further, only a few rehearsals were needed, since the preliminary work done by Rajagopal was useful for the actors to comprehend their roles well. Presented in five scenes that lasted for an hour and a half, the major events included Vasishta’s advice to Dasaratha to perform the Puthrakameshti yagam; the king’s mental agony in sending away Rama and Lakshmana with sage Viswamitra and finally, the killing of the demoness Thadaka. The scene of the king’s anguish, enacted by Kalamandalam Vasu Pisharody, was well choreographed and won laurels for MPS. MPS himself donned the role of Viswamitra while Kalamandalam Narayanankutty that of Thadaka. No strangeness in the libretto was felt when Madambi Subramanian Namboodiri began the vandana sloka in Tamil with ‘Anai mukhane, haranar thirumakane’ in raga Kedaragowla, supported by Kalamandalam Subramanian. A long wait Rajagopal had anticipated that the play in Tamil would enhance Kathakali’s popularity in Tamil Nadu. But nothing happened until 2010, when abhinaya exponent Kalanidhi Narayanan invited MPS to stage the play at Sri Krishna Gana Sabha in Chennai. Unfortunately, Rajagopal did not live to see it, as he passed away in 2008. But MPS and the Kalamandalam team presented the play to a packed house and a standing ovation on January 5. But for MPS and Kalamandalam Krishnakumar, who portrayed Dasaratha, the rest of the actors were post-graduate students of the institution. Also, the play was extended to seven scenes and ended in Sita Swayamvaram . Kalamandalam Babu Namboodiri handled the music. “The entire script is with me and it is not difficult to stage it again with new actors. But unfortunately, no organisation is coming forward to stage it,” said MPS. The writer and culture critic is a trained musician.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/how-a-tamil-opera-was-adapted-to-kathakali/article34722239.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Multiple notes||Amrit Ramnath clearly doesn’t think much of the canons of the music world: in his realm, music is many, and to conform to one means losing out on several others. Son and disciple of the illustrious musician Bombay Jayashri, Amrit is unmistakably influenced by his mother-guru, even as he bears a striking resemblance to her and her singing. Soft-spoken, sincere and passionate, Amrit has a multi-pronged interest in music. Carnatic music surely forms his core, but he doesn’t carry it everywhere — neither in terms of his personal aesthetics nor with respect to music. He recasts himself as the context demands, but what remains a constant in each of his ventures is his desire to give the best.  Sumiran , his latest musical video, is a shabad by Guru Nanak, set to a charming tune in raag Yaman, and shot at an equally charming locale. Both music and video have garnered attention online. “I’m so excited that you’re interviewing me,” he admits, without trying to behave like a ‘musician’. Amrit will soon complete his Honours in Philosophy from Birbeck, University of London, but in parallel, he is pursuing his music intensely — as singer, instrumentalist, composer, arranger and producer of music videos. How has the response been to his latest video, I ask. “Nothing much, a few responses here and there...,” comes Amrit’s modest reply. “I love to work, so I will keep at it.” Was music a genetic inevitability? He thinks so. There was an inescapable musical environment at home, with both maternal and paternal families steeped in it. “My father, who grew up in Kolkata, was exposed to a lot of Hindustani music. He sings and is also a violinist. He writes poetry as well. My mother needs no introduction. Both my maternal uncles are accomplished musicians as well.” But the intensity with which he currently pursues his music, Amrit says, is a conscious process. “I realised a few years ago that nothing keeps me going like music does. I decided to make this my journey,” says the young man who schooled at Krishnamurthi Foundation in Chennai. Exposure to music genres As a little boy, he was a student of the legendary Lalgudi Jayaraman, on whose suggestion he studied Western classical music. He learnt Carnatic singing from his mother, but became exposed to many genres of music in exactly the same way as his mother. “I can resonate to film music from the 40s to 90s more than I do to the current period. I listen to ghazals and Hindustani music, mostly of maestros like Ustad Salamat and Nazakat Ali Khan, Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and others. I also love listening to Sirkazhi Govindarajan. Though I respond to other forms, Carnatic music is my core.” For Amrit, switching between forms has never been an issue. “Suppose I am singing a ghazal, I need to get into the shoes of a ghazal singer,” he explains. In Sumiran , the spiritual song turns into a piece of real-world memories. Serene and reflective, with lovely sitar moments from the well-known Purbayan Chatterjee, the song is beautifully arranged and shot. “It is a song we sang in school. I have been trying to figure this out for a while now — my school days, my interaction with people there, the landscape — how all this came back to me in my moments of solitude, shaped Sumiran . I have been working on this since 2017.” Amrit seems clearly at ease performing music. “I am very comfortable before a camera. The initial 20-30 minutes is difficult. I enjoy the whole process. Having an aesthetic background, looking good, everything is important for me. Each project has a different aesthetic demand, and I do it meticulously. After all, an artiste has to entertain.” Amrit has packed days: music classes, practice sessions, his work as a commercial music arranger and composer, making sketches, and a host of other things. Given the range of things he is doing, it is evident that the young and talented man is trying to find his musical route.  The Bengaluru-based journalist writes on   art and culture.   I am very comfortable before a camera. The initial 20-30 minutes is difficult.

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A head for art||A photograph of her mask covered with flowers was 23-year-old Meera Chandran’s first reaction to the lockdown that began in March 2020. ‘Spread love, not germs’ was the caption that accompanied the picture posted on July 11 last year. The next picture exhorted people to ‘break the chain’ of infections. There was a bunch of unlit matchsticks plastered on her left cheek while the matchsticks on her right cheek were shown burning. The third had a stark warning: ‘Six feet away or six feet under,’ with one side of the photo featuring her face devoid of paint while the other side was painted black. Over the past year, the Kollam-based architect has won a following on Instagram for her face art, which she uses to highlight current issues, sexism, racism, the farmers’ protest, and so on. Her face is her canvas, where a wide range of art is executed. She then clicks selfies that are shared on her Instagram account. Although she’s no expert when it comes to make-up, she seems to know intuitively how best to capture an idea with the help of collages, paints, Photoshop and installations, all on her face, which has been covered in flowers, newspapers, clay, and a whitening mask among other things. “Words do not come easily to me. Lines, colours, shapes and textures speak to me, helping me express my thoughts, concerns and opinions,” says Meera. The changing attitude When the lockdown began, she felt overwhelmed by the sudden changes in lifestyle that isolated people and began to change their behaviour. “I saw how neighbours and friends were ostracising people with COVID-19 instead of helping them. That is why I posted a photograph of my face wearing a mask covered with flowers. I found that people react to images more quickly and strongly,” she says. The self-taught artist has been an entrepreneur from the age of 19 with her own line of clay jewellery (@mannu_by_meera), as well as a line of clothing (@_studiounicorn). Although she had already been dabbling in face art on her Instagram account (@meerachandran), it was during the lockdown that she came into her own. There’s one photograph that is bound to strike a chord with every woman in India — a multitude of eyes are painted on her face, and it is captioned ‘All eyes on me, but I chose to be free.’ “There is the most dangerous life of all, living a life that is scripted and judged by others. Try to unclip your own wings, maybe help yourself to fly, and rise up from the fall for the hundredth time, and then you taste freedom and that is absolute joy,” she says, adding, “This is a feeling that must be common to all females. It is self-explanatory.” On October 1, Meera was enraged by the news of the rape and murder of a Dalit woman in Hathras, whose corpse was then burnt by the police. As a reaction, she painted her face black and worked on the photograph to show flames enveloping it, with the caption ‘Stood and let her burn’. To support the farmers’ protest in Delhi, she covered her face in mud and let it dry in furrows and lines that resembled the parched fields and weather-beaten faces and feet of the farmers. Another shows her face covered with the word ‘Imperfect’. “I was reacting to a personal issue,” she says with a laugh. “Most teenagers have issues with their face and figure. I had acne, which filled me with angst during my schooldays. It was to remind all of us that we are all imperfect in some way or the other, and to embrace our imperfections.” On one occasion, tired of the negative news that was flooding the media, she covered her face with a collage of newspapers enclosed by a ring of fire. “I felt that the media was completely engulfing our lives... it was taking over my senses,” she says. Meera believes her art is inherited from her mother, a trained artist who could not take it up professionally. “I have picked up some tips from her. But the facial art is my idea and my family supports me,” she says. Although she has no plans for an exhibition in the near future, her works on Instagram have won her recognition. With evocative captions and pithy explanations, her photographs caught the eye of dancer-actor Rima Kallingal, who invited Meera to collaborate on her new production, ‘Rise’. Her work won her another assignment, this time with a band. She will be designing futuristic costumes and facial art for their music video. Meera refuses to let her art be confined to blueprints and buildings. “I continue to work as an architect and also indulge my creativity as an artist,” she says.  I saw how neighbours and friends were ostracising people with COVID-19 instead of helping them.

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A stage set 500 years ago||“Go to Guwahati for the Ankia Bhaona Samaroh. You will have a rare experience and a new vision of Assamese culture,” Raju Das, an officer of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, New Delhi, who hails from Assam, had told me. I arrived in Guwahati as an “outsider-observer” of Assam’s 500-year-old unique Ankia Bhaona theatre tradition, my knowledge limited to a few articles I had read about it. ‘Rukmini Nagar Bihu Field, Rangamancha Path, Guwahati’ — the address of the festival venue aroused instant excitement — Rukmini is a popular character in this art form and the road leading to the venue was named rangamancha or stage! The spiritual and artistic ambience of a Namghar (prayer hall of a sattra or monastery where the ritualistic performances happen), constructed under an oval-shaped roof, was recreated at the Bihu Field in the heart of the city. A large number of spectators — men, women and children — had occupied the seats around the stage even before the play had begun. And before taking their seats, they offered prayers to the Manikut (the sanctum of the Sattra ) put up at the upper end of the stage. The surging crowd proved the incredible popularity of this ritualistic theatre tradition. Ankia Bhaona, thriving in Assam for five centuries, is known as the precursor to Sattriya, Assam’s classical dance tradition, and was created by Srimanta Sankaradeva, the renaissance man of Assam. Born in 1449, he was a saint, social reformer, scholar, poet and playwright. Sankaradeva created three unique arts traditions of Assam – Borgeet (music), Ankia Bhaona (theatre), and Sattriya (dance) — besides the Brajavali literary language that was a confluence of Hindi, Maithili, Bhojpuri, Assamese and Sanskrit. While Sattriya is known across the globe, Ankia Bhaona is hardly staged or known outside Assam. However, its mass appeal is apparent during festivals, with top political leaders from around the country and the State, including the Chief Minister, attending the performances. Six scripts Sankaradeva scripted six plays — Ram Vijaya , Patni Prashada , Parijaat Haran , Rukmini Haran , Keli Gopala and Kaliya Daman — all revolving round the stories of Krishna or Rama from Bhagavata Purana , The Mahabharat and The Ramayana . These six plays have been staged repeatedly over the past 500 years and continue to captivate audiences despite the change in time, taste and trends, such is the impact of the theatrical spectacle that Sankaradeva devised. Ankia Bhaona’s uniqueness lies in its inherent synthesis of the classical and the folk theatre traditions. Composite in character, it has been a beautiful confluence of dance, drama, music, literature, religion and even the art of mask-making. A versatile Sanskrit scholar, who was well-versed in Natyashastra, Sankaradeva undertook a 12-year pilgrimage across the country to familiarise himself with the rich folk traditions of different regions. With this understanding, he conceived Ankia Bhaona, which later played a pivotal role in the development of the theatre traditions of the Northeast. Following the format of Indian classical theatre, Ankia Bhaona starts with a Purvaranga (prelude) and has a Sutradhar (narrator-anchor) as well. Unlike other theatre forms, where the Sutradhar appears intermittently to anchor proceedings, here he is anchor, director, narrator, singer, dancer and actor and remains on stage throughout. Wearing a white long-sleeved coat, white turban and elaborate ornaments, he enters the stage with a pure dance sequence known as Sutradhari Nach, recites the introductory verses (Bhatima), explains the plot of the play, and announces the entry and exit of the characters. He even narrates situations in the plot that can’t be staged. All his interpretations are replete with elaborate hand gestures and body movements. It is he who constantly reminds the audience about the relevance of total surrender to the divine, Hari, even as he anchors the play that is meticulously crafted to entertain and educate the masses about Vaishnavite philosophy. Filled with song Though drama in form, Ankia Bhaona is a treasure trove of dance and music. The Purvaranga establishes the mood followed by a rhythmic group performance by dancing musicians called Gayan-Bayan (singers with large cymbals and percussionists with the khol). As with Sattriya dance, Gayan-Bayan has emerged as a popular independent performance style in recent times. “Since it includes music and dance, Ankia Bhaona uses a variety of raags and taals that none of the other folk theatre traditions explore,” says Ratan Hazarika, director, Sattriya Kendra, Guwahati. It is mandatory for each character to enter and exit the stage with a definite dancing pattern. According to Sattriya dancer Anita Sarma, who is a Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee, “Ankia Bhaona has contributed immensely to Sattriya dance in terms of abhinaya, footwork and hand gestures.” Learned or the uninitiated, adults or children, urbanites or rural folk, Ankia Bhaona has something to offer for every spectator. While Sanskrit is meant for the scholarly, Brajavali is used to reach out to the common man. Along with acts of devotion and sermons on spiritualism, humour and erotic expressions also get due representation in the plays. Besides, ordinary mortals get to interact with the gods in the plots. Children get excited with the appearance of the masked characters of animals, deities and demons. “Sankaradeva broke away to a considerable extent from the confines of classical Sanskrit drama and based the theatre form more on folk dance and drama to make it accessible to all,” says Pona Mahanta, former professor, Dibrugarh University, who was invited to the festival as an observer. With nearly 900 Sattras spread across Assam that follow the philosophy of Sankaradeva and his principal disciple Madhavadeva, the land of the Brahmaputra hosts innumerable performances of Ankia Bhaona, which seem to define the culture of the region. The sattras apart, modern theatre groups also take great pride in performing the Bhaonas independently. An increasing number of Bhaona festivals and competitions are being held with the support of the State government and cultural institutions. Assam’s cultural canvas is clearly not limited to only Bihu and Sattryia, but extends far beyond.  The Bhubaneshwar-based journalist   attended Sattriya Kendra’s annual Ankia Bhaona Samaroh at the invitation of Sangeet Natak Akademi, New Delhi.

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A series of young singers||U.S.-based Cadence Entertainment has been hosting online classical music concerts for a year to a select audience, mainly in the U.S. and India. They are broadcast either live or pre-recorded in studios before broadcast, and are also made available later on demand, for a nominal fee, on their website. What is noteworthy is that the concerts feature a wide cross-section of artistes, many of them young. The series has so far had Nayan Ghosh, Kala Ramnath, Shakir Khan, Satyendra Solanki, Sweekar Katti, Dr. Alka Deo Marulkar, Manjiri Asnare Kelkar, Sanjeev Chimmalgi, Gauri Pathare and Sanika Kulkarni. A recent concert was that of the 29-year-old Mumbai-based vocalist Bhagyesh Marathe. Grandson of Pt. Ram Marathe, he is currently under the tutelage of Hubli-based Pt. Kedar Bodas at the Gangubai Hangal Gurukul, where 36 young learners are selected for training by six established gurus. Bhava-rich rendition Bhagyesh sang raag Bageshwari, and it was a pleasure to see this youngster follow the old-world courtesy of taking permission from his co-artistes on stage to start the concert. He impressed with his bhava, unusual note patterns and his creative approach. Particularly pleasing were the intricate taans, which had wazan (weight)  despite the speed. Mere copying, however well practised, inevitably sounds stale. The vilambit composition he sang was his own. His next raag was Kedara, in which he rendered two traditional compositions. Perhaps his internalisation of this raag has not yet given him any esoteric insights, but he still was able to impress with his superb handling and skill. Sadly, the concert ended without a third piece due to paucity of time. On the tabla was Tejovrush Joshi and on the harmonium, Siddhesh Bicholkar. U.S.-based Samarth Nagarkar, who trained under Aditi Upadhyay in Bengaluru, has also learnt from guru Aditi’s father, Pt. Dinkar Kaikini, and from Pt. Ulhas Kashalkar at Kolkata’s ITC SRA. Talking about how Hindustani music has been thriving in the U.S., Samarth credited the cultural organisations that have been promoting Indian classical music there for several decades, thus making it financially viable for artistes. “We not only get a good audience, we get an well-informed one, and their number is growing. I was once asked by an American in the audience if I had any connection with the late Pt. Nivruttibua Sarnaik (rarely heard outside India) as he felt my taan patterns were similar to his!” Samarth started his concert with raag Bihag. The vilambit Tilwada taal bandish, ‘Ai ma dhan dhan re’, was a traditional Gwalior gharana piece. Interestingly, starting his presentation on the gandhar, Samarth displayed his inherent musical instinct. He was in no hurry to unfold every aspect of this romantic evening raag; choosing to slowly weave magic with his voice. Admirably, the taans were presented in judicious proportion. The concluding Tarana was in Teen taal; again Samarth handled the drut laya with ease. His second raag was the Jaipur gharana favourite Basanti Kedar, combination of Basant and Kedar, which like all ‘jod raags’ is difficult to handle. The Teen taal composition was the traditional ‘Attar sugandh gulab’. Sensibly singing this briefly (under 30 minutes), Samarth moved on to present a hori, for which he displayed an admirable affinity. Indeed, his hori was noteworthy for its authenticity and he sang it beautifully. He later explained that his guru, Pt. Dinkar Kaikini, enjoyed thumris and horis, and had learnt this piece from the great Siddheshwari Devi herself. He was accompanied on the tabla by teenager Vivek Pandya, and on the harmonium by Rohan Prabhudesai. Both concerts are available on TeamCadenceEntertainment.com; the next online concert will be by Aditya Modak, now famous with his success in the film, The Disciple .

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The play must go on||The word is as important as the face for a Koodiyattam artiste. As the vidooshaka in a Koodiyattam play or as the narrator of Prabandhakoothu, a sub-genre of Koodiyattam, the artiste has to be a master of narrative skills. The vidooshaka in Prabandhakoothu once even enjoyed the privilege to mock and criticise the king. Is that mighty word losing its edge? Prabandhakoothu is the solo male-only art form that chronicles epic stories, while interspersing them with modern situations and spicing them up with wit and humour. Sanskrit slokas are parsed and their logical meaning explained in Malayalam in great detail, references are made to similar stories or even modern literary texts. For instance, the famous sloka in Ramayana, ‘ Raman dasaratham vidhi…’, where Sumitra advices Lakshmana just as he sets out for the forest. Though the sloka has only 12 words, the Prabandhakoothu artiste may take over two hours to explain it, unfurling the different shades of meanings in each word. Plays with a purpose The introduction around 900 CE of the character of vidooshaka, who spoke the common man’s language, drew new audiences to the Sanskrit theatre form of Koodiyattam. From this evolved, over a couple of centuries, Prabandhakoothu, also known as Chakyarkoothu, since this was performed only by members of the Chakyar community till a few decades ago. And texts known as prabandhas came to be written exclusively for Prabandhakoothu. Its function was to entertain, instruct, criticise, provoke to think, and thereby help cleanse society of its ills. Prabandhakoothu is still very popular and much more in demand than Koodiyattam, with many temples hosting it during annual festivals and on auspicious days. But some serious practitioners and connoisseurs are not too happy. They fear Prabandhakoothu is losing its gravitas and is increasingly being seen by many as a local version of the stand-up comic. They also feel it has been reduced to two-hour storytelling sessions, devoid of the scholarship that the past masters lent it. A.V. Narayanan, a Prabandhakoothu artiste, says most of the performances seen today feature the same few stories. He laments that training and performance of serious works are not getting the attention they deserve. There is a risk that important aspects of the storytelling craft will be lost forever due to a lack of performers and audiences. This prompted Narayanan, who is also a film editor, to use his videographing skills to archive authentic Prabandhakoothu performances by veteran exponents. The release of the video recording of Dootavakyam last year performed by 72-year-old Ammannur Kuttan Chakyar, a senior artiste, guru, scholar and performer known for his serious approach to the art, is the culmination of such efforts.  Dootavakyam , written by Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri, more popular for his devotional text, Narayaneeyam , covers the story of Krishna’s peace mission to the Kauravas. It starts with the Pandavas looking for peace and ends with Krishna displaying his cosmic form or Viswaroopa. The text has more than 45 slokas and several lengthy passages in prose. The 37-hour long high-definition video of the performance was recorded over 21 days and released late last year after several delays. “There are several other prabandhas that need to be preserved,” says Narayanan. But it is impossible for one individual to undertake this task. Narayanan finds that there are not been many takers for his video recording, and hopes some organisation will take up the challenge. Kuttan Chakyar says such recordings are valuable not merely from the entertainment point of view, but as a guide for future students. He fears many other Melpathur works, which are landmark dramatic monologues in Kerala’s literary history, may have already become inaccessible. For example, he says, he has seen his guru Ammannur Madhava Chakyar perform Rajasooyam, but is sceptical if anyone today can do justice to that work. According to Kuttan Chakyar, “Learning long prabandhas is a tedious affair. Apart from memorising the text, one has to think about it, practise hard, and perform it over and over again. “Prabandhakoothu is not merely the narration of a story. It is playacting, where the artiste has to create the dialogues of the various characters on the spot. That is why familiarity with the text is extremely important. And more meanings emerge the more one reflects on the poet’s words.” He is doubtful if the new generation of artistes will have the time, patience or motivation for that. But there is hope yet. Dr. T. K. Narayanan, vice-chancellor, Kerala Kalamandalam, said at the launch of the Dootavakyam video that such projects certainly fall in the domain of the arts university. He wanted the Koodiyattam department at Kalamandalam to undertake projects to digitise works by masters. There is no other way to preserve such traditions, he said.  The retired journalist writes on Kerala’s performing arts.

04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Highs and lows||Kala Prashala, a division of SciArt Services, recently hosted an online concert of the Rangan brothers — Raghuveer and Narayan — students of veteran musician O.S. Thiagarajan. The one-hour thematic concert titled ‘Sri Padmanabham,’ included six kritis of Maharaja Swati Tirunal. And the brothers judiciously provided time for the songs, based on their complexity, content and merit. Well-defined Ritigowla Raghuveer and Narayan have similar vocal prowess and their duet, therefore, sounds perfect in unison. The duo began the recital with the Asaveri kriti ‘Palaya madhavamam anisham’. The extended swara exchange in keezh and mel kalams added value to the slow, soft and steady presentation. The brothers next took up Ritigowla, a raga of supreme melodic charm. Though brief, the contours were well defined and the choice of the kriti was the popular ‘Paripalayamam’. Quick came ‘Bogindra sayeenam’ in the lilting Kuntalavarali, followed by the main raga Saveri. All raga essays were shared by the brothers like swara exchanges — one took it to a particular point and allowed the other to extend it further and reach the upper register sancharas and bring it to the finale. Their comprehension of the depth and range of a raga was evident and both diligently spread it out to present a comprehensive portrait of Saveri. ‘Devi pravane,’ one of the nine popular Navaratri krits of Swati Tirunal, was their choice here. No doubt the kriti demanded a lot of concentration both in terms of rendition and perfect enunciation. The charanam line ‘Soma bimba madahara sumukhi bakta jana kile’ was taken up for niraval and swaraprastara. It was an engaging exercise with brisk swara sallies and the duo rounded it off with the popular landing on ‘ srgsr pdnpd ’. The closing pieces were ‘Taruni gnan yendu’ in Dwijavanti and ‘Baja baja manasa’ in Sindhubhairavi. Nevertheless, a few words of concern to the aspiring vocalists. While their voices blend well, the integration falters in some places. Better practice and effective planning as to where one should stop and the other proceed will help them present a wholesome concert. Also, in raga treatises, developing a raga may be a methodical exercise, nevertheless a grip over adding karvais and delivering brigas at appropriate places will not only highlight the beauty of the raga but bring the expertise of the musicians to the fore. The siblings should work more on this aspect too.  The Chennai-based author writes on music and culture.    The brothers judiciously provided time for the songs, based on their complexity, content and merit||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/highs-and-lows/article34722230.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Warm and fuzzy notes of home||Currently screening at the New York Indian Film Festival, Freddie’s Piano is a simple-sweet film about two stepbrothers and their deep concern for each other after their parents die in an accident. Set in the charming by-lanes of Puducherry, the story of Aden and Freddie is written and directed by debutant filmmaker Aakash Prabhakar, a Mumbai-based stage and film actor. Suddenly unmoored from their parental anchor, life is difficult, but with touching stoicism the two continue the daily business of living. Twelve-year-old Freddie is a budding pianist, named after Frédéric Chopin. His mother was a skilled pianist, and the film opens with the lilting notes of the instrument being played expertly by the gnarled fingers of a woman, seen only partially. Hers is a presence that will be felt through the film, though she is no more. From that dreamlike scene, the camera moves to a delightful one of Freddie, playing an imaginary piano and listening to the notes of a real one on his Walkman, while waiting for his schoolbus. His older brother Aden is hurriedly rustling up a bowl of milk and cornflakes for him. Playing both mother and father to Freddie, Aden doesn’t just make breakfast for his kid brother, he also has to find money to run the house. Blend of emotions The film is not a bleak one, however. Suffused with humour and a cast of warm characters, it revives your faith in human kindness. Aden’s friend, Roshan, fixes up a job for him at his father’s camera-repairing shop. Aden knows nothing about cameras, but is very good at repairing household gadgets as his father had introduced him to his toolbox when he was all of six. In no time, he wins over his friend’s sceptical father and the business expands into a general repair shop that brings in a bit of money, which the old man generously shares with Aden. Then, there’s Mrs. Koshy, who pampers Freddie with dinner and encourages him to play on her keyboard, and Lisa, Freddie’s school teacher with a tendre for Aden. Though these friends bring in sunshine, Freddie is unable to dispel the dark clouds of missing his mother and the music they made together. Alone, he visits her grave on her birthday and places an origami figure of mother and child over it. Then, he visits the church and plays the piano, lost in an aching yearning. When he realises that Aden has entered and has been listening to his music, he has an angry outburst. That Aden should have forgotten Ma’s birthday opens up the floodgates of an emotion he has suppressed all this while. “I will go to Chennai and live with paati ,” he declares. Now, Aden is shattered. Ridden with guilt that he has not nurtured his parents’ dream of making Freddie a pianist, he determines to gift his brother a grand piano for Christmas. Easier thought than done! For someone unable to pay Freddie’s bus fees, Rs. 5 lakh for a piano seems a ridiculous pipedream. Like an O. Henry short story, Prabhakar’s two-hour English-Indian film leaves you with a warm, fuzzy feeling. The writer-director, who plays the 22-year-old Aden, says he took a leaf from his own life to write the story. “The story is very close to my heart. I started learning to play the keyboard when I was 12. It meant the world to me! When I asked my mother for a larger keyboard, I didn’t know then to what lengths she went to buy me one. It was only recently that I discovered how my mother had put together the money to fulfil my dream.” Growing up, Prabhakar watched films avidly. And they clearly left their mark. You can see the influence of Life Is Beautiful and Children of Heaven in Aden and Freddie’s brotherly bonding that makes you smile and weep at the same time. Pranav Mylarassu, who plays the introvert Freddie with amazing restraint, is a student of A.R. Rahman’s Music Conservatory in Chennai. This is his first foray into acting, but the young boy plays the perfect foil to the experienced Prabhakar’s Aden. All the supporting actors, including Leela Samson in a charming cameo as paati , make the film credible and engrossing. Especially charming is the Tamil accent pervading the English spoken by the actors — natural and authentic. Puducherry, beautifully captured by cinematographer Sandeep K. Vijay, plays an organic role in contributing to the overall charm. The villas and cafés of this erstwhile French town provide the perfect backdrop to a small, domestic story that tugs at your heartstrings, gently. The independent journalist is the author of two books on Madhubala and Dev Anand.  The film is not a bleak one, however. Suffused with humour and a cast of warm characters, it revives your faith in human kindness||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/warm-and-fuzzy-notes-of-home/article34722194.ece
04 June 2021||June 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Delving deeper into Kathak||In an effort to beat the pandemic blues, SPIC MACAY launched the ‘Sarva Mangal Yoga Series’ online with a versatile mix of dance, music, art and craft workshops alongside a yoga camp. The workshops stretch across five days offering an ambit of activities for young learners to explore aspects of arts, cultural heritage and history. Kathak exponent Rani Khanam is one of the gurus in the programme, training a batch of students including learners with formal dance training as well as those who are being initiated into classical dance for the first time. Stressing the importance of the lineage, style and the uniqueness of each school of Kathak, she introduces learners to different gharanas. An artiste from the Lucknow gharana of Kathak, Rani Khanam combines the reflective mysticism of Sufi poets with the lyrical grace of the Lucknow technique to interpret the gharana in imaginative ways. “It’s very important to first understand the history of Kathak and trace the stories of different artistic lineages of the form to find your connection with it,” she says. “The term Kathak itself came into prominence after the 1960s, earlier it was known by different names. The storytelling tradition of the dance form is its most significant aspect.” She also dwelt on the expansive nature of the form and its prominence across North India. “The use of multiple languages and dialects in the compositions is proof of the fact that the form was adopted in, and adapted to several different regions, amalgamating many cultural traditions into its fold.” Exploring rhythm Gently introducing learners to the taal system, she says, “Rhythm anchors any form of music and dance as well as everyday life, in Kathak the importance of rhythm and footwork is unique and foremost.” Ektaal, Dhamaar taal, Jhumra and Deepachandi, Pancham Sawari and Gajajhampa, Teentaal, Punjabi taal were some of the commonly used taals she explains. Leading the students through basic footwork and stances she introduces them to the concepts of tihai, gat and various parts of a composition. While focusing on the precision of the postures and rhythmic movements, she also demonstrates the softness of the hand gestures. According to Rani Khanam, flow and fluidity are cornerstones of the Kathak movement repertoire. She discusses different characters from mythology that are commonly portrayed in dance recitals and initiates the participants into the nuances of attempting abhinaya. As the workshop proceeds, each student appears on camera, presenting the basic footwork and taal recitation. “Sharpness and precision are key in imbibing the taal,” observes the guru, correcting the learners patiently. For several youngsters, this is their first brush with the world of Kathak and they have several questions to ask. Sharing the importance of repetition, practice andriyaaz, the guru encourages the students to integrate the dance form into their daily life to truly be immersed in it and extend their dance journeys.

04 June 2021||LUCKNOW,||Mayawati sacks two party MLAs, including legislature party leader||Already a depleted force in Uttar Pradesh, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Thursday expelled two of her most senior MLAs in the State on charges of indulging in “anti-party activities” during the recently concluded panchayat polls. Both the MLAs belong to OBC communities and hail from Purvanchal. Ms. Mayawati expelled her legislative party leader in the State Assembly Lalji Verma and former U.P. BSP president Ram Achal Rajbhar. She, however, did not specify the “anti-party activities” they allegedly engaged in. Shah Alam alias Guddu Jamali, BSP MLA from Mubarakpur in Azamgarh, replaces Mr. Verma in the Assembly. Mr. Verma, a five-time MLA, is a Kurmi, while Mr. Rajbhar, also an MLA five times, hails from the Rajbhar caste. The expulsions could indicate a fresh churn in the BSP ahead of the 2022 Assembly poll. Despite being expelled, Mr. Verma hoped that he will be given an audience with the BSP president and an opportunity to explain his viewpoint. “I was in the hospital during the panchayat elections and could not actively take part. Behenji inquired about my health thrice. There was nothing wrong,” he told PTI. “I came to know of this action only now. I was not allowed to explain my viewpoint. It appears that since I was out of action because of my health, some people got a chance to give wrong inputs to the party president leading to this action,” he said. Mr. Verma, however, asserted that has no plans to join any other party.  Future plans Asked about his future plans he said, “I want to remain in the BSP. The party has performed well in the panchayat elections in my district. I had never imagined that such a thing can happen to me. I will try to meet the party president through the mediation of party leaders.” Mr. Rajbhar said that he does not know the reason that led to the BSP expelling him.

04 June 2021||Patna,||Bihar BJP leader served notice for comments on Nitish Kumar||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has served a show-cause notice to Tunnaji Pandey, party MLC in Bihar, for taking on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Leaders of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) slammed the MLC for attacking Mr. Kumar. “The party’s disciplinary committee has served a show-cause notice to Tunnaji Pandey and asked him to reply to the notice in 10 days. After that, the party will also take action against him,” said senior State BJP leader and Health Minister, Mangal Pandey. Party sources, however, told The Hindu that Tunnaji Pandey “may be expelled from the party after the notice period expires”. Of late, Mr. Pandey is said to have come closer to the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). “Mr. Pandey these days is not even being invited to party meetings,” said a senior State BJP leader. Mr. Pandey has been attacking Mr. Kumar on several issues. On June 2, he triggered a controversy with one of his social media posts that said, “Whatever I had said was right that in this election, people had given their mandate to elect Tejashwi Yadav but Nitish Kumar ji came to power by misusing official machinery.” His term in the State Legislative Council will expire on July 16. Earlier, Mr. Pandey had taken on Mr. Kumar through a social media post saying that “he [Mr. Kumar] has been a Chief Minister of circumstances”. “Nitish Kumar is a Chief Minister of circumstances. Former RJD MP Mohd. Shahabuddin was right by saying this but he got punishment. He [Mr. Kumar] is not my leader. I’m just a BJP leader and I’ve no connection with the mahagathbandhan, ” said Mr. Pandey on Twitter. Accused of corruption His comments had apparently incensed the Janata Dal (United) and other alliance partners. However, even before NDA leaders could react, the BJP MLC, in another post, accused the Chief Minister of being involved in corruption. “Chief Minister has been hand in glove with liquor smugglers since 2009. I’ll expose him and ensure that he lands in jail,” said Mr. Pandey, while adding that he was not afraid of speaking the truth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bihar-bjp-leader-served-notice-for-comments-on-nitish-kumar/article34722531.ece
04 June 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assam to take up flash floods issue with Bhutan, sister States||The Assam government has decided to take up the issue of flash floods caused by the release of water from dams in Bhutan and neighbouring States in the Northeast. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting attended by Water Resources Minister Pijush Hazarika, Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya and Agriculture Minister Atul Bora on Wednesday. The meeting was held to discuss various flood and erosion-related issues, including the impact on the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, with Assam already experiencing pre-monsoon showers. On Thursday, Mr. Bora said, “Release of water from Doyang [Nagaland], Ranganadi [Arunachal Pradesh] and dams in Bhutan causes large-scale inundation in Assam, and the authorities concerned need to be told not to release water simultaneously”.

04 June 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Himachal High Court protects journalist against coercive action||The Himachal Pradesh High Court on Thursday directed the State police to not take any coercive action against a journalist, who had approached the court seeking quashing of criminal charges against him, till the next hearing. Aman Bharadwaj, the petitioner, who works with the Zee Media group, had sought quashing and setting aside of the FIR under Sections 419 (Punishment for cheating by personation), 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (Using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) of the Indian Penal Code, besides Section 66(d) of the Information Technology Act and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act registered against him in Shimla. Justice Ajay Mohan Goel ordered that till the next date of hearing no coercive shall be taken against the petitioner. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the State government had on April 25 issued certain directions on monitoring the inter-State movement into Himachal Pradesh through the process of registration on the e-pass portal. Later, on May 5, the government issued a notification to impose “corona curfew” in the State from May 7. The petitioner submitted that to investigate the e-pass registration process on the portal, he conducted a “reality check” and broadcast the news on May 7. Mr. Bharadwaj filled the registration forms in the name of Amitabh Bachchan and Donald Trump for issuance of two e-passes without assigning any valid reason.  E-pass for Trump “The petitioner deliberately uploaded his own verification details i.e. Aadhaar card number and telephone number. Also, he mentioned two random vehicle numbers along with other details. To the surprise of the petitioner the passes so applied in the name of Amitabh Bachchan and Donald Trump were generated. This substantiated the fact that the passes being issued were being done in a mechanical manner,” said the petition. The same day the news was broadcast, an FIR was registered against the journalist at Shimla (east) police station on a complaint filed by Director, Information Technology (Himachal Pradesh).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/himachal-high-court-protects-journalist-against-coercive-action/article34722528.ece
04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||NGT dismisses petition to revive Yamuna monitoring committee||Stating that there was no ground to recall an earlier order, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has dismissed a plea seeking to revive the Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) which was formed in 2018 to monitor rejuvenation of the river. The green panel had dissolved the committee in January while directing chief secretaries of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to monitor progress. A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “The news item published subsequent to the disposal of the case cannot be made a ground to recall of review the order. The interim order is merged with the final order passed in the original application. No justifiable ground has been made out for the maintainability of the review application. The review application is devoid of any merit and deserves to be dismissed.” The green panel in January had dissolved the committee which was constituted by former NGT expert member B.S. Sajwan and former Delhi Chief Secretary Shailaja Chandra. “We place on record our appreciation for the contribution of YMC in the last two years. With the taking over of the further monitoring by the Chief Secretaries of Delhi, Haryana and U.P., proceedings of the committee constituted by this Tribunal on the subject will stand concluded,” the Bench had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ngt-dismisses-petition-to-revive-yamuna-monitoring-committee/article34722536.ece
04 June 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Group to perform rituals of abandoned COVID-19 victims||After six months, Siddhant Panda, a resident of Odisha’s Sundargarh district, plans to pay a visit to Prayagraj for performing ‘asthi visarjan’, a Hindu ritual of immersing and scattering the ashes and leftover bones of the departed. Mr. Panda has not lost anyone in his family or any relative in his extended family but he said he was morally-bound to bid a final adieu to some whose bodies have been abandoned. Since last year, Mr. Panda and his five friends have been helping cremate COVID-19 victims after their relatives abandoned the bodies at Sundargarh. A fortnight ago, Sundargarh was one of the worst-hit districts in the second wave of the pandemic. “After cremation, while some relatives turned up to collect ashes and leftover bones from cremation ground, the unknown fear of catching the virus from ashes kept many people at bay. They did not even show up to collect ashes and bones,” rued Mr. Panda, 48, who runs a drug store for living. These people, popularly known as ‘mashani bandhi’ (friends in crematorium), diligently collected leftover bones and ashes of the victims in an earthen pot which was wrapped up in a piece of cloth. Every pot has the name of the victim and phone number of relatives written on it. “As of now, people have not collected ashes and bones of 56 victims,” said Mr. Panda. For past two decades, he and his friends — Kamlesh Nathani, Sisir Behera, Manoj Tripathy, Bijay Hota and Deben Sahu, all Sundargarh-based established businessmen – have been volunteering in the disposal of unidentified bodies by taking time out of their busy schedule. Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic struck, their gesture of helping cremate bodies appeared to have become full-time job. “We have helped cremate 310 COVID-19 victims since last year. While 78 bodies were disposed of in the first wave, the second wave saw a dramatic rise in deaths. As many as 232 bodies have been cremated at Sundargarh alone,” said Mr. Nathani. Relatives often request these volunteers to immerse the ashes and bones in the river water.  ‘Taking nothing’ “We cannot do that since there is standing government instruction that these earthen pots cannot be disturbed for 90 days. We have decided to do en masse ‘asthi visarjan’ at Prayagraj after six months when the COVID-19 situation improves. We are not taking a pie from government for cremating the bodies. If we abandon these pots, we would be disrespecting departed souls,” said Mr. Panda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/group-to-perform-rituals-of-abandoned-covid-19-victims/article34722539.ece
04 June 2021||Bhubaneswar,||Crowdfunding helps airlifting of Odisha youth to Chennai||Amrit Pradhan, a 24-year-old youth, is neither a celebrity nor does he belong to an affluent family in Odisha. But, a special team of doctors from the Apollo Hospital, Chennai, came here to shift him in an air-ambulance possibly for a lung transplant. Amidst the all-pervasive gloom and pessimism during the pandemic, the airlifting of the unemployed youth has thrown up an example of community bonding and camaraderie. Following an emotional appeal from the family members, people from across the country have raised close to Rs. 60 lakh helping the youth continue his battle against COVID-19. After passing out from the premier government College of Engineering & Technology, Amrit had taken up a corporate job. During the pandemic, he left the job and started preparing for the civil services. Everything was going smoothly for the Berhampur-based family until his mother, a primary school teacher, contracted the virus around last week of April and subsequently, his father, a retired bank employee, too tested positive. While Amrit was taking care of his parents, he started showing COVID-19 symptoms. He was initially admitted to a private hospital here and later shifted to AIIMS-Bhubaneswar on May 2 when his condition deteriorated. He has been on ventilator support for the last 20 days. According to family members, severe COVID-19-related infection has aggravated pneumonia, septicemia and a major fungal infection in addition to many other complications. “Around May 24, doctors at AIIMS advised us that my brother would need to be admitted in a hospital having facility for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support and lung transplantation which is not available in Odisha,” said Manisha Pradhan, elder sister of the youth. “Though doctors’ advice created fresh hope, it also pushed the family into a state of hopeless situation. The treatment would require a minimum Rs. 1.2 crore to begin with and no one knows where it would end up,” said Chidananda Tarai, brother in-law of Amrit. Members of the family with limited resources said the fast-evolving situation had forced them to opt for the fund-raising route. “Even as we posted an appeal providing the details of Amrit’s health condition and treatment, the search for the hospital facility had begun. The appeal immediately connected people across the country. Within a week, Rs. 57,24,750 was mobilised through Milaap, a free crowdfunding online platform, for medical emergencies,” said Mr. Tarai.  “My brother is very strong and has been battling for life for about 20 days on ventilator support. The way people have showered their love and affection through contributions, it generated a fresh hope. I am sure my brother will walk away from hospital with the blessings of the well-wishers, who we don’t know about and where they are based,” said Ms. Pradhan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/crowdfunding-helps-airlifting-of-odisha-youth-to-chennai/article34722542.ece
04 June 2021||NEW DELHI,||DU may start registration process for UG admissions on July 15, say officials||The Delhi University is likely to begin the registration process for undergraduate admissions on July 15, said officials. They said the timeline for the admission process will be fixed once the Boards announce their decision on holding exams and declaration of results. Waiting for clarity Rajeev Gupta of DU’s admissions committee, said: “We are proposing to start registrations for the undergraduate admissions from July 15. It all depends on when the different boards take a decision on the board exams and declare the results. We are anticipating that within a week there should be clarity from all the boards, and everyone will announce what their process will be. We have to wait for a decision from all boards as we cannot exclude anyone.” “While there is no clarity as of now, we are tentatively going to begin registrations from mid-July,” said Mr. Gupta. Apart from CBSE, several State boards have also announced the cancellation of the Class 12 board examinations this year due to the pandemic. The officials said as of now, a merit system will be followed based on which admissions will be conducted. Stating that approval for the common entrance test was pending at the Education Ministry, Mr. Gupta said: “Delhi University will follow whatever directions we get from the Ministry. If conducting an exam is not possible at all under the present circumstances, then we will continue with the old system only.” As a result of the ongoing pandemic, this will be the second year that admissions to DU will be delayed. Last year, the varsity released its first cut-off list in October while classes for the new batch commenced in November.  DU will follow whatever directions we get from the Ministry. If conducting an exam is not possible at all under the present circumstances then we will continue with the old system only Rajeev Gupta Member of DU admission panel||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/du-may-start-registration-process-for-ug-admissions-on-july-15-say-officials/article34722527.ece
